other related presentation materials supplementing today's call for additional factors that impacted year-over-year
performance.
As announced on January 18th, we reached an agreement to sell our Pacific Scientific Aerospace businesses. For the
current quarter, the results of this business are reflected as discontinued operations in our statement of earnings as
required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In addition, our historical audited financial statements for the
three years ended December 31, 2010 we revised to reflect this business as discontinued operations. We'll be filing
these financial statements with the SEC later today under a Form 8-K. All references in these remarks and
accompanying presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate only to the
continuing operation of Danaher's businesses unless otherwise noted.
I'd also like to note that we'll be making some statements during the call that may be forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the federal securities law, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or
anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results may differ materially from any
forward-looking statements we might make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they
are made; we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new
information, future events and developments or otherwise.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Larry.
H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer
Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We've gotten off to a great start in 2011 and I'm pleased to report an
outstanding first quarter for Danaher. We grew 10% organically in the first quarter with all of our segments reporting
mid-single-digit growth or better. We feel very good about where the portfolio is today in terms of how our businesses
are performing, how they're positioned in our served markets and the macro drivers in these markets.
Over the last several years, we've aimed many of our investments at the emerging markets, which positions us well in
the fastest-growing parts of the world. Those investments are paying off as we grew nearly 20% in the emerging
markets this quarter, with China and Brazil leading the way. We were also encouraged by the continued strength in the
developed economies, which grew to high single-digit rate in the quarter. Want to provide a special word of thanks to
our associates in Japan, who, in the face of great tragedy, have shown tremendous spirit and resilience.
In addition to our go-to-market initiatives, we've also been making significant investments in innovation and new
product development. In the quarter, R&D as a percentage of sales was up 50 basis points year-over-year to 6.5%. This
level of investment is much higher than where we were just a few years ago and is indicative of our long-term
trajectory. Our R&D efforts have led to a number of exciting new products throughout the portfolio, which in turn we
believe are helping drive market share gains in many of our businesses, including Leica, Videojet, Fluke, Radiometer,
Hach Lange and Kollmorgen, with other important product launches scheduled for later this year.
During the quarter, we delivered strong operational performance as evidenced by the outstanding margin performance
with our core operating margin improvement up 245 basis points year-over-year. Each of our segments delivered at
least 200 basis points of core margin improvement.
So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported first quarter diluted net
earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.61, representing a record first quarter for Danaher and a 33%
increase as compared to our adjusted EPS last year. Revenues for the quarter increased 11% to a record $3.3 billion,
with core revenues up 10%. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by 1.5%, while the impact of
deconsolidating the Apex revenues more than offset sales growth attributed to acquisitions, resulting in a net decrease
of revenues of 0.5%.
Our year-over-year gross margin for the first quarter increased 390 basis points to 52.7%, largely due to leverage from
greater sales volumes, productivity improvements and the higher gross margins of our newer businesses. This is the

third consecutive quarter that our gross margin has exceeded 50%.
Overall, our operating margin in the first quarter increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%, with our
core-operating margin up 245 basis points. Included in the operating results was a $14.5 million in equity earnings
contributed by Apex. Absent the Apex contribution, our operating margin was 17.2%.
First quarter operating cash flow was $434 million, a 10% increase, not withstanding a $100 million increase
year-on-year in income tax payments made during the quarter. We expect the timing of our tax payments to normalize
during the balance of the year. Free cash flow was $385 million.
During the quarter we completed two acquisitions with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $250 million, to
strengthen our product ID and water quality platforms. We also announced the pending acquisition of Beckman
Coulter. Based in Brea, California, Beckman is a leading supplier of in vitro diagnostic systems, including instruments,
consumables and software for the biomedical laboratory market. Its clinical diagnostic systems are found in hospitals
and other clinical settings around the world and deliver critical information to physicians to diagnosis disease, make
treatment decisions and monitor patient care. To date, we have received U.S. antitrust approval and expect to close the
transaction late in the second quarter. We are looking forward to sharing with you more details after the closing.
Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 27.5% for the quarter with core
revenues up 14%. Our core operating margin for the first quarter increased 270 basis points. Overall, our operating
margin increased 170 basis points to 20.7%.
Fluke core revenues grew at a mid teens rate in the quarter with solid demand in all major geographies and product
categories. Emerging market revenues were up more than 20%, led by Brazil, where we are expanding our market
presence with investments and feet on the street and a series of mid-priced core service and installation test tools.
At Tektronix, core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter, led by sales of oscilloscopes and logic analyzers, which
were both up over 30%, partially offset by continued softness in the video end markets. The strength was broad-based
geographically, led again by the emerging markets. We've been particularly pleased with the sales of our new
mid-range line of oscilloscopes, the DPO/MSO 4000 and 5000 series, which we launched last quarter.
Core revenues from our communications businesses also grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter with healthy demand
for our – for both our core enterprise tools and our network management solutions. During the quarter, Verizon
Wireless selected Tektronix Communications to provide monitoring solutions for their next generation LTE platform.
This was an important and exciting win for the team who were chosen in part due to the versatility and scalability of
their products to provide deep, end-to-end visibility into LTE networking and service performance for Verizon.
Environmental segment revenues increased 9% in the quarter, with core revenues up 7%. Our core operating margin
was up 240 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin increased 230 basis points to 19.3%.
Water Quality core revenues increased at a high single-digit rate. At Hach Lange, the demand was solid for our core lab
and process instrumentation in all major geographies. Industrial and food and beverage verticals in the U.S., Latin
America and China were particularly robust during the quarter. Hach continues to focus on expanding its service
capabilities, which have more than doubled in the past two years and currently account for about 10% of total revenues.
Trojan core revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in the quarter, driven by robust growth in its industrial
applications. ChemTreat's core revenues also grew low double digits in the quarter. ChemTreat continues to expand
outside the U.S. and their Canadian revenues have more than doubled in the last two years. They've invested in feet on
the street initiatives to expand our penetration there.
During the quarter, Hach expanded its direct sales and service team in Australia and New Zealand with the acquisition
of Accurate Group, enhancing our ability to provide local training and personalized application support in that region.
This acquisition represents another example of Hach Lange expanding its direct go-to-market capabilities.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's first quarter core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate, with robust shipments of
dispensers and automatic tank gauges in North America and Europe, partially offset by slower global sales of payment

and point of sale systems. During the quarter, Gilbarco launched two new dispenser platforms specifically designed for
Eastern Europe and India. We expect these platforms to help capture additional market share in these fast-growing
economies.
Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues for the quarter increased 21.5% compared to the prior year, with core
revenues up 9%. Our core operating margin was up 220 basis points in the first quarter. Overall our operating margin
was up 730 basis points from the prior year to 14.4%, primarily due to the first quarter 2010 acquisition-related charges
that did not repeat in the first quarter of 2011.
Radiometer's core revenues grew at a high single digit rate for the quarter. This performance has been driven by healthy
demand in Europe, China and Japan for both the ABL90 and ABL80 blood gas analyzers, which bodes well for future
consumable sales. We also continue to build A2T's install-base outside of North America, with placements up more
than 30% in the quarter.
Leica Biosystems core revenues increased in excess of 10% in the quarter, with strong demand in North America and
Europe for our advanced staining systems, which grew more than 20%. We believe that we continue to take share in
this market.
During the quarter, we launched our HER2 fully automated breast cancer diagnostic test for the BOND system in
Europe. This is a critically important addition to our companion diagnostics reagent offering, as we are now able to aid
in the selection and identification of specific targeted therapies for breast cancer patients.
Leica Microsystems core revenues grew at a mid-single-digit rate during the quarter, which we were particularly
pleased with given the difficult year-over-year comparison as a result of Japanese stimulus activity in 2010. Sales of
compound and confocal microscopes into the Life Science research and industrial markets were particularly strong.
During the quarter, we launched several new research products, including the SD AF inverted microscope with
integrated spinning disk technology for high speed confocal sectioning and 3D reconstruction, addressing the high
growth live cell imaging market. We look forward to hosting investors at our Leica facility in Wetzlar, Germany in a
couple of weeks to share with them more Leica success stories.
And core revenues at AB SCIEX grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter with robust demand from the academic,
proteomic and applied markets. Our new TripleTOF 5600 led the way. Proteomics researchers are selecting the 5600
because it is able to deliver both qualitative and quantitative analysis effectively on a single platform. Customer
acceptance and feedback on the new product continues to be outstanding. Now a full year into the acquisition, AB
SCIEX is clearly seeing the benefits of new products, a much more focused go-to-market effort and the implementation
of DBS.
Turning to Dental, segment revenues increased 7.5% in the first quarter, with core revenues up 5.5%. Our core
operating margin was up 275 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin was up 220 basis points
from the prior year to 10.7%.
KaVo revenues increased at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter with solid demand in all major geographies for our
instruments and imaging products. KaVo launched a record number of new products in the quarter at two of the largest
dental industry trade shows, the Chicago Midwinter show, and the International Dental Show, or IDS, held in Germany.
Doctors are particularly excited about the new OP300, a hybrid digital imaging system, which integrates three imaging
modalities, cephalometric using orthodontics, along with 2D panoramic and 3D cone beam on a single unit, giving
dentists a truly adaptable, flexible imaging platform. As the digitization of the dental practice continues, the OP300
provides general practitioners for the first time with a range of technologies to perform more complex procedures, such
as implants, in their own operatories, instead of referring patients to specialists.
Sybron core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter with good growth in general dentistry consumables,
infection prevention and orthodontic solutions. Sales in the emerging markets were again strong, as we continue to
invest together with KaVo and go-to-market initiatives in those high growth areas.

During the quarter, we launched SonicFill, a new composite filling system that combines Kerr's composite technology
with KaVo's handpiece technology. Customer feedback on this new product launch has been very positive.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment, revenues increased 16% for the quarter, with core revenues up 14.5%.
Our core operating margin increased 200 basis points in the first quarter. Overall, our operating margin was 21.3%, a
210 basis point increase compared to the same period last year.
Product Identification core revenues were up mid-teens in the quarter with broad-based global growth across all major
product categories, including Videojet's full suite of CIJ printers, where we believe we continue to capture share.
Demand from electronics customers for our parts marking instruments was again strong this quarter. During the
quarter, we launched a new suite of large character marking, or LCM, systems for bar code graphics and alphanumeric
printing and packaging applications. While still early, we've been pleased with customer feedback thus far.
And in March we closed on the previously announced acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions
provider for the digital packaging, design and production market, based in Belgium. With revenues of about $250
million, Esko is an attractive adjacency to Videojet and our Product Identification platform.
Our Motion businesses core revenues grew in excess of 20% in the quarter. The momentum we saw build last year
continued as we experienced significant growth in all major geographies and end markets. The investments we've made
during the last few years in our new AKM and AKD motors and drive product lines continue to pay off with robust
demand in the quarter, particularly among industrial automation customers. We believe we continue to capture market
share with AKM and AKD, with volumes there up over 100% year-over-year.
So to wrap up, the first quarter 2011 was an excellent start for Danaher. Our portfolio of businesses is well positioned.
The investments we've made in innovation and emerging markets continue to drive growth and share gains. We're
pleased with our team's performance, which led to outstanding core revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. We
expect the global economy to continue to improve in 2011, led by the emerging markets, with the developed markets
also growing, albeit at a lower rate. We believe we are well positioned with DBS driving our focus on outperformance.
We are initiating second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of $0.62 to
$0.67. Due to the broad strength we are seeing in our businesses, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per
share from continuing operations guidance from the prior range of $2.55 to $2.70 to a new range of $2.65 to $2.75 for
the full year 2011. This includes $0.04 of anticipated net dilution resulting from the impact of the Pacific Scientific
divestiture and the EskoArtwork acquisition. This updated guidance excludes the impact of the pending acquisition of
Beckman Coulter.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hi, good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr.>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: The gain on the sale of the Aerospace business, did you guys disclose the size of that before? That
was $0.30 in the 10-Q?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It hasn't closed, it's imminent, and it'll be about $0.30 after tax.

<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. So you're going to restructure that away, obviously?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We'll call that out separately.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. Will there be restructuring – will there be incremental – or will you use that for incremental
restructuring or no?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think there'll be restructuring through the year, but we're not going to use that gain to offset
it.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. So the numbers will be clean there?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yes.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. And then the core growth, moving throughout the year, sorry, I got a lot going on this
morning, core growth for the second quarter, what do you think there? And have you updated the core growth number
for the year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Steve, we do not envy your challenge today
with everybody reporting. On the core growth side, I think with what we saw in the first quarter, we come into the
second quarter here working against our toughest comps. But I think we're looking at 6% to 8% core in the quarter, and
frankly, I think probably looking at that rate for the year. But feeling very good as we get going here in April for sure.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. So you'll be exiting the year at more of kind of a 4% to 5% rate then?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I think if you look at where we would
expect to be in the second quarter, I think we'll be in that 6% to 8% range, I suspect we'll be at the higher end of that
range, given what we see right now. I think for the remaining three quarters of the year, I think we'll be in that 6% to
8% range and even with the 10% first quarter, we probably could be in that range for the year. I don't think we'll be that
muted come year-end, but we've got a long way to travel. It's still early in the year between now and December.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Sure. And then order is just the book-to-bill – one last question – for the quarter?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We were a little bit north of 1 and it trended nicely during the quarter.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay. Thanks a lot, appreciate it.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott Davis>: Good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott Davis>: Everybody handles earnings releases differently; I choose to eat donuts and drink lots of coffee and
generally abuse myself, so. On another note, your gross margin was just fantastic and beat on kind of probably the most
bullish of models. Talk about what drove that. I mean obviously you must be getting price out there, because clearly
you couldn't have had any headwind on price cost with that kind of gross margin. I mean how much of it is mix, how
much of it is price? Can you just give us a little granularity on that?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. Well, I think, while we do see some of
those inflationary pressures and price was a positive, we nearly had a point of price, I think that price cost balance is in
a good place, Scott, because it's a 50% gross margin business. We don't have a lot of those core commodity exposures
that some other folks obviously will. I think that with the core growth being better, particularly with some of our newer

and/or our higher gross margin businesses, that certainly helped. And I think we've just had very good execution from a
COGS and from the other variables in the gross margin calculation. I was very pleased with the execution across the
board in that regard. I think you saw that, really, in all five segments.
<Q - Scott Davis>: Okay, fair enough. As a follow-up, you've got a big one to bite off with Beckman, but are you still
out there looking at deals? Is there capacity to look at deals? I mean, just talk to us about how you think about forward
M&A and forward cash reinvestment?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Scott, I think we're very much in the position
that we said we would be when we announced Beckman. Obviously that transaction is still pending, but we're very
much in the deal game, not as much as we typically would be. But you saw us announce another small acquisition here
for Water. We're looking at a number of things. We probably are talking about a deal envelope, barring other sources of
capital, in the $300 million range for the rest of this year. But I think, by and large, we get back into the probably $2
billion range in 2012, which, at this point, is only nine months out. So I don't think at this juncture we're feeling unduly
pinched by obviously the implications from the Beckman deal.
<Q - Scott Davis>: Okay. That's helpful. Good luck, guys. Thanks.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Robert Cornell>: Yeah, I'm surprised nobody asked about Beckman Coulter yet. So there's a press release talking
about delays in the FDA address of the high-throughput machine, maybe you could give us some color on that and
what it means?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Bob.
<Q - Robert Cornell>: Hi.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, what Beckman put out earlier this week
was an update, I think really for investors, given the delay in their submission to the FDA for the approval or the
re-approval of the troponin test on their two major testing platforms. I think we want to respect the company's primacy
on commenting on those sorts of matters in great detail, but I think given the work required, they basically wanted to
make sure investors and their customers understood that they were going to be submitting to the FDA later than they
had initially flagged. I don't think we were wildly surprised by that. There's a lot of work to do in preparing for those
submissions and it's work obviously that the company is very focused on. But in terms of the big picture relative to
Beckman, I don't think the delay that they've announced is material.
<Q - Robert Cornell>: Given your comment that it's a second – a late second quarter close, could you update us on the
accretion dilution comments for '11 and '12?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Bob, it does appear that as opposed to closing, that we may be having the business for two
months in this quarter. It's more likely going to – it could well be towards the end of June and we won't have much of
an impact here in the quarter. We'll come back and update as we get to closing or if we close the end of June, maybe
we'll do it in the third week of July with earnings. But it could have some modest impact here in 2011. But given the
things that we're working on and we have planned, I don't see that impacting our sort of 2012 outlook here.
<Q - Robert Cornell>: Well, I mean did you guys say at one point that this could be $0.05 to $0.10 accretive this year
and $0.25 to $0.30 accretive next year? Just – my memory may be failing me.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That's correct, Bob. And given the delay here that obviously could have some impact on this
year, but we don't see that impacting next year at this point.

<Q - Robert Cornell>: Not next year? A final point and a bigger picture point, you guys mentioned a couple of times
the lower priced point products in a variety of the end markets. I mean could you just address the broad opportunity for
Danaher to get into the local products at lower price points and make good margins? I mean you mentioned that at a
couple of points, and I'm sure that's a part of the R&D boost and so forth and so on. Is that strategy going to impact
gross profit margins? I mean how is that all low price point emerging market development going to reflect itself in the
results?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Bob, I think that when we talk about
our emerging market product strategy, we really want to play up and down the price point continuum for two reasons.
The first being, of course, the deeper we penetrate those markets, the faster we plug into the underlying growth in those
markets. And secondly, the further we go down that price point continuum, because by and large, we really have started
at the high price point segment with our western brands, the tougher we make it for local competitors to come up the
experience curve and take that volume into the developed markets.
I think when you look at what we've done in building China businesses and are now really trying to drive in earnest in
India and Brazil, we really start, not with the high price point products and taking their prices down, but really putting
together the product specifications, build material cost targets and the like, so that we're geared towards meeting that
differentiated customer need at a cost position that allows us to drive margin maintenance and hopefully, we often aim
for this, margin expansion. So I don't believe there's an inherent trade-off in coming down that price point continuum
and your gross margins, if the product spec and the cost targets are designed up front with that market reality in mind.
<Q - Robert Cornell>: Yeah, thanks. That's all for me. Very interesting. Thanks, Larry. Thanks, Dan.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Bob.

We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: So just first question on maybe at this point working capital and your cash conversion, which
looks like still healthy, 90% plus, 92%, but down, and as you built for all this growth, what was your experience?
Looks like the receivable days up, inventory days up a bit. I mean how did that go, or any [indiscernible] (30:26)?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, it's Dan. The build we had in working capital was very consistent with what we've had
in sort of prior years in the first quarter. The biggest driver of the year-on-year, on the sub-100%, still 90%, sub-100%
conversion, was we had a $100 million increase in tax payments year-on-year in the first quarter. Probably have pretty
heavy tax payments here in Q2, but then that'll flip in the second half. So I think from the broader issue on cash flow
conversion, I think we're going to have a very strong year, particularly as we get into second half with likely lower tax
payments as compared to the second half a year ago. On the working capital side, as we did last year, with double-digit
core growth, we had a very modest increase in working capital and I think if we're in that 6% to 8% range, though that
could suggest a multi-hundred million dollar increase in working capital, we don't expect that at all. We think working
capital, by the end of year, will be flat to slightly up.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay. All right. Great. And maybe on Dental margin increase, which has been a long road,
can you comment about what was – what the dynamics were in that business? And how much was sort of the result of
initiatives versus maybe just sort of tailwinds?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think with KaVo being up nearly 400
basis points, they'd argue they earned most of that. Obviously the growth helps, both at KaVo and at Sybron, but I
really think, Steve, it's fundamentally the story that you're well aware of and we've told many times in terms of the
efforts just to get that cost structure right and to make sure that we're driving growth that's accretive, both in terms of

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jon Wood with Jefferies and Company.
<Q - Jon Wood>: Hey, good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon Wood>: Hey. So, Larry, could you talk about test and measurements on the book-to-bill in the first quarter
and just talk about the year? Is it reasonable to assume that franchise can do double-digit in 2011 at this point or is it
too early to go there?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that if we look at just
book-to-bill for T&M, where that matters most, I think, is at Tech and they had north of 1-0 on a book-to-bill basis.
And we were very pleased with that. I think if we look at Tech we see a very good stream of new products
forthcoming, which we're excited about. I think given our sense of the market, we probably have maybe a little more
market risk in the wake of the Japan tragedy in T&M than we do some other businesses. But by and large, I suspect
even with the tough comps, T&M will be one of the lead businesses for us this year relative to our core growth. I'd
certainly expect them to be in the double-digit range here in the second quarter and certainly would not rule it out for
the full year. They're very well positioned, not only at Tech, but frankly across that segment.
<Q - Jon Wood>: Okay. Great. Thanks. One last one on SCIEX. And this is another big year for product introductions,
feasibly. Do you need another major product line turn this year to maintain kind of that high single-digit trajectory in
your view, or is the TripleTOF really in the early innings of penetration?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I would say that, first of all, we are very
pleased with the performance at SCIEX, really the first full quarter outside of the transition arrangement because we
obviously anniversaried that deal. So to see the top line performance and the bottom line performance at SCIEX was
reassuring. And frankly, they did better than we would have anticipated in part because there's been so much work
done, but also they probably had one of the tougher comps given the Japan stimulus of any of our businesses. Clearly
the 56 has been impactful. I think we are in the early innings. But that said, there are other things forthcoming and
we're looking forward to being at ASMS in Denver come June and talking about the next wave of innovation at AB
SCIEX.

else would be down about 20%. What did you actually see and what are you seeing there? And maybe you could
comment on, if you've seen any sort of supply chain issues and how you're dealing with that.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that, first of all, John, what we
saw since the earthquake is just an incredible level of strength, of character, of leadership on the part of our team. I
don't think I've ever been more proud of our people, particularly given the circumstances, than I have been with our
Japan team. What we were flagging, obviously, immediately following the quake was some concern that we could have
some immediate revenue impact. We did not see that; that really didn't materialize in any meaningful way in the
quarter.
Now as you know, Japan's year-end is March, so it was an important time and there was real revenue at risk; thrilled
that it didn't materialize. I think what we, like most companies at this point, are trying to sort through is just what
happens as the ramifications for everything that has transpired here, work their way into the Japanese economy. It's less
than 5% of sales, it's obviously important, but it's not like it's going to have, I think, significant impact for us going
through the rest of the year, as best we see it in terms of our sales in Japan. But I would characterize the situation as
being a bit fluid at this point.
I think our greater concern, again, like most companies, is how supply chains come back online during the course of the
year. We haven't really baked in anything here relative to the negative effects, but it's probably one of the variables in
our outlook and certainly getting a lot of management attention. Because it only takes one specialty material, it only
takes one IC that may come from a northern Japanese facility, obviously, to ricochet through a particular product line
on a global basis.
But at this point, I think as each day passes, the news in that regard becomes more encouraging. But again, I think it's a
dynamic that's getting a tremendous amount of work on this end and we'll be smarter about things as we go through the
course of the year. I don't think we can wholly, categorically rule out some risk in that regard as we look out to the last
nine months of the year.
<Q - John Inch>: Yeah, well, Larry, I'm understanding the broader risk. I'm just wondering, I mean a lot of your
products have some kind of electronic content in them, right?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: We do.
<Q - John Inch>: So have you identified, yeah, have you identified the one area that may be an issue? I'm just trying
to think, you wouldn't want to kind of hit a quarter and one of your segments sort of skips, typically because you
couldn't have supply chain issues. So I'm just wondering if you've thought about, well, if there's anything, it's probably
this area, and it's pertaining to this, and right now we're trying to dual source or do something like that. I mean, just,
have you identified anything in that regard yet or not really?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, John, I think we're well aware that we
can't ship product if we're missing a particular component.
<Q - John Inch>: Right.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think given the nature of our products and
the diversity of our portfolio, the risk that we're talking about here could crop up anywhere. I think what you really
have to do, and what we're doing, and I get an update on this every 48 hours, is you literally have to go to the
component level, right?
<Q - John Inch>: Right.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: This isn't about northern Japan; it's not about
a particular company or a commodity category. You've got to go to that SKU and understand the current inventory
position, where that supplier is relative to their own production capability and verify that.

So we are at that point where we think we have risk, even a potential risk, we are working through sourcing inventory
in other locations, looking at resourcing options, availing ourselves of all those array of options. I think if you look at
what we've been able to do over time, in terms of holding on-time delivery in the face of growth, driving margin
expansion in good times and in bad, you know we've got an outstanding procurement materials management team
standing up to that test right now. But again, I think that there's still a lot of work to do to work through our supply base
to make sure that we have no disruptions to our customers, let alone our investors, as we look through the rest of 2011.
<Q - John Inch>: Yeah, no, that's fair. Can I ask about China? You called China out as a continued source of strength,
along with Brazil. China's obviously been trying to reign in growth to a degree, and obviously Japan is a big, big trader
with China. What are your folks on the ground saying, Larry, with respect to kind of the runway or trajectory for the
rest of the year? Do you think kind of macro tightening is going to have much of an impact on your businesses? And
clearly, Beckman's got a pretty good position in China as well. I'm just wondering if there are implications for
Beckman as it pertains to China?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: John, while we don't have a macroeconomist
on staff in China, Dan and I did have the opportunity just two nights ago to do an in depth review with the China team.
On the back of an outstanding first quarter, despite the very real policy direction that you referenced, our teams see
nothing but very robust demand across the portfolio. It was striking, their level of conviction and confidence, given the
start to the year and what they're hearing from customers. Again, I think we need to be very mindful of the issues that
the Chinese government are trying to bring to the floor, but right now, we're very excited about the year we could have
in China.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: For a number of those, our companies over there, we've had a very significant year-on-year
increase in feet on the street in salespeople over there.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: So in some cases where they're seeing some modest slowing, we've got much better coverage
and we think we can kind of grow through that at these sort of rates.
<Q - John Inch>: Just lastly, Larry, the big picture delay with respect to Beckman and the FDA that you called out,
you said it was not material. Can you just help us understand, with respect to you guys, why is it not material?
Meaning, just again from sort of very high level, isn't there a risk that this kind of gets further delayed? Like at what
point does it really become material? Or is this simply because the deal is based purely on cost synergy and you're not
really that concerned about sort of this testing stuff getting into market on a timely basis?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: John, just to be clear, what I intended to
convey is that the delay here is not something that, in our view, is unanticipated. I think we didn't assume, as I think we
referenced back in January, that we were planning for perfection here relative to the resubmission. So the slippage a bit
here, as long as they get that application in and it's approved, and again go back to their 8-K, there are caveats there.
But given the planning assumptions that are in place on this end, I think we're still going to be in a very good place.
<Q - John Inch>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Deane Dray>: I wasn't planning on asking a question about Motion, but when you go across the businesses and
Motion stands out as really upside performance, you said 20% plus growth, all geographies, all end-markets. So if you
just take us through some additional color here on was it retrofits or new capacity being added with the customers,
share gains, any further color would be helpful.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Deane, thanks for asking, because they really
had a terrific performance on the back of, I think, an excellent 2010. I think that there really is no one silver bullet here.
In essence, what we referenced in the prepared remarks is very important. These new product introductions have really
helped us with design wins. I think that we are doing a much better job, not only investing, but executing on the ground
in the emerging markets, particularly in China. But that said, overall, the commercial execution on the part of the
Kollmorgen and Thompson teams, Dan and I were just with them as well the other day, I think has dramatically
improved vis-à-vis where it was just a few years ago. So you've got technology, you've got better commercial
capability, you've got more emerging market exposure, and obviously you've got a market dynamic where the tailwinds
are strong. Put all that together, they're leading the way right now for us on the core growth side.
<Q - Deane Dray>: And no, Motion does not have much in the way of backlog, but in terms of visibility, quote
activity, how sustainable does this look over the next couple quarters?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, obviously the comps get tougher for
them, and I think we'll see their core growth taper a bit as we go through the year, but I would still expect them to be a
growth leader for us this year. While they don't have maybe booked backlog per se, Deane, I think as you look at their
design wins and their likely shipments, assuming certain build rates on the part of their OEM customers, they're
looking at a good 2011.
<Q - Deane Dray>: Great. And then just last one for me, regarding the 2011 guidance increase, if my – looking at the
incremental margins, based upon what we talked about in December, 35%, 40%, looks like you could be tracking
towards the upper end of that range. Is that still your outlook for the year on incrementals?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment, Deane.
Obviously with a range of $2.65 to $2.75, if you dialed in the high end of that core growth range for the year of 6% to
8% with a mid to high 30 BCM, you get into that zone.
I think, again, I think one of the things we want to make sure we share with folks is that we had an outstanding first
quarter, great start to the year. We are mindful of the Japanese risks that are out there, maybe more so on the global
supply chain than local sales, but they're both real, still fluid. Clearly some inflationary pressures out there.
And I think with all that said, we certainly want to make sure that, in a year like this, we are investing ahead, both with
respect to growth and margin expansion. So we've already begun some of the dialogue here about what are some of the
things we might have thought were really 2012 initiatives that we might be able to action this year. And that's part of
what we want to do here, is make sure we've got the latitude, not only to deliver a good 2011, but also continue to build
for '12 and '13.

<Q - Mark Douglass>: Just if we can talk through margins a little bit, very strong move in Industrial Tech margins. Do
we see these fairly sustainable given the continued strength that's going to be likely in Product ID and Motion, or is

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah, Mark, operationally we expect to see these sort of margins for the balance of the year.
We will have about $25 million of non-cash expenses related to the Esko acquisition that will bleed out, primarily in
Q2, but some in the second half as well. So the margins we're seeing in Motion, Product ID, the other businesses,
Industrial, remain quite strong. We're seeing a little bit of inflation, but we're also getting pretty good price, particularly
at Motion, and we think absent some of these non-cash charges, which will bring the reported margin down, the true
operating margins we think we can sustain at these levels.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Oh, great. Thanks. Yeah, I was going to ask about the – with steel prices going up with
Motion, would these be safe as well. So thanks for that. And then just kind of the thing about margins on Test &
Measurement. As you continue to integrate Keithley, do you see a pretty good trajectory there, assuming T&M stays
pretty healthy, which it seems that it will, at least through '11?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure, I mean, we clearly – we had almost 21% in the first quarter. And I think you'll see some
modest sequential improvement, maybe to 50 basis points, 100 basis points over the next couple quarters in T&M
margins as well in part – as partially as we get the benefit of integrating Keithley.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: And thanks for bringing Keithley up, Mark,
because that is an acquisition, obviously rather recent, perhaps over-shadowed by Beckman. That integration, that
activity has gone exceptionally well. We're very pleased with the team, their embrace of Tektronix, the opportunities
really to partner both from a new product development and technology view, but also in terms of leveraging the
Tektronix and Fluke global channels to help accelerate Keithley sales. Very pleased to have that one on board.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Right. Was there kind of core sales for Keithley kind of similar to the segment average, or
were they closer to what Tek put up, like [indiscernible]%(49:54)?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: They were very much in line with the rest of
the team.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Nigel.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Good morning. So obviously the delay in the closure of Beckman, does this change in any way the
size of the equity issue? The reason I ask is that you guys are earning roughly $4 million of free cash flow a quarter. So
in theory it might reduce the need to raise cash. So I mean just any comment on that would be helpful.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, I think that our previous disclosure of around $1 billion of equity, I think that still
stands. We're pleased with the cash flow, very strong with our cash position, which will hopefully in the coming days
as we close Pacific Scientific will be north of $2 billion. And that obviously will go towards the Beckman acquisition. I
think we're still comfortable with equity in that sort of range. In part, we want to give ourselves some latitude here on
the M&A side.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then GVR [Gilbarco Veeder-Root] doesn't get a lot of air time, but high oil prices, retail

spend more CapEx, and could that benefit GVR? Anything you've seen in the past that might suggest that?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that there have been some rules
of thumb in the past that would suggest, at least in developed markets, that retail spend tracks pretty well with retail
margins. But the market has really undergone, I think, a good deal of change over time. Obviously the emerging
markets are far more important, they're a bit less sensitive to that regard. The offering that we have, given the
automation around the payment, [ph] fuel assent (51:56) and card list has also been a driver that has defied some of the
underlying economics. I think we worry about that dynamic less, but clearly what we've seen is a real uptick in
investment broadly that we think will continue over the next several years.
In the short-term though, Nigel, as you know, we had an exceptional year last year in payment, particularly given some
of the compliance deadlines, and that's where we're probably facing some of our stiffest headwind here in the second
quarter and through the rest of this year. And GVR, looking at the second quarter just here in the short term, likely is
going to be down low double-digits in part because of these tougher comps that will bring the core in Environmental
down to probably a flattish figure, offsetting some good performance in Water Quality. But long term, I think we see
good investment levels around the world, and that, combined with these automation requirements, positions GVR very
well. Let alone, of course, the uptick in environmental concerns at retail.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Sure. And just finally, just to clarify your comments on Japan, I mean it's encouraging that you don't
see a major impact on the financials for the balance of the year. But just to kind of clarify, in late March and through
April, you haven't seen a significant deterioration in your Japanese business?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's right. When we were together in New
York, what we were watching twice daily was just what the implications would be from the disruptions to the
infrastructure, let alone customer operations and the like. That news got better virtually every day as we went through
March, and they finished pretty much in line with the original expectation, which I thought was simply remarkable. I
think at this point, as things evolve, we don't see today tremendous negative headwind there, but I think that probably
next to some of the specific issues at GVR, we are expressing some caution around the situation on the ground in
Japan. But thus far, I think we feel like that's manageable.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Rick.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Larry and Dan, could you address the Life Sciences, LSD segment, the operating margin
there just on an absolute basis, I think I understand the basis point improvement year-over-year with the restructuring
cost and things at AB SCIEX, but at this 14.4% level, again, is that sustainable? Was that helped by mix? It sounds like
the TSA is out. That probably helps and should be sustainable. So do we build off of that margin level for the balance
of the year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Rick, I think at this point we think we'll be in that range. It was a quarter that everything went
right for LSD, both the top line, I think the mix is very favorable. As you know, a year ago the segment margins were
7%, so we doubled it year-on-year. Also, in part because some of the strength we're seeing there, we've ramped up
some investments both on the growth side. We've got some clinical studies at both Radiometer and Leica Bio that will
cost some money here in the next couple quarters. There's also some restructuring. So I think we're very pleased where
we are. I'm not sure you'll see movement here. In fact, I think sequentially in Q2, because some of this growth
investments and restructuring, sequentially margins will come down a little bit. So I think we'll be in sort of the

mid-teens range for the full year, but we'll be doing things this year that will hopefully get us another leg up in 2012.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Okay. And then, Larry, is there any movement that you can kind of mention on the AKT
product in the US, in terms of approval?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: There is movement.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Okay.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: And that's probably all I should say. I think
what you've seen us try to do is avoid being specific, given the process that we're going through right now with the
authorities that we continue to make progress, but in terms of when we'll be able to launch, I think I'm going to defer
that to a -
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Okay.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I'm going to defer that to the day we
launch.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Okay. So – okay.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: But we're thrilled. But I think it's important to
recognize that that product outside of the U.S. continues to be well accepted. We saw another good quarter of
placements. Globally we're up to nearly 500 instruments installed. That obviously really begins to build, I think, an
exceptional foundation for the consumable stream as utilization picks up. So we're very encouraged that we've got the
right product. We want to make sure we address the questions and the needs of the U.S. regulators. And once we do,
we'll be ready to go.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Is it likely this year, I mean we hope this year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: I stand by my prior comment.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Okay, there's positive movement. Got it.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Rick.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: One other thing, it felt like we maybe took a little extra time to highlight some of the new
products in some of the segments, and we've got some key major price point products like the 5600 that have come to
market now. Would you look at your growth rate this year, thinking 6% to 8% core for the full year? Would you feel
like there's maybe a point, probably not two, but a point or two of incremental growth that is more than end-market
recovery and it's a fairly aggressive new product intro this year relative to past?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think we're getting better at execution,
in terms of conception, development and launch. We're obviously spending more money, you see that in the uptick in
R&D. I think it's really, in many respects, table stakes in some of these industries and markets that we've entered.
What's really hard to segment, Rick, is when we drive growth, even with tailwind, how much of that, basically, where
we've got this increased vitality, would we attribute to the new products vis-à-vis the improved commercial and go-to
market execution. It's just very hard. I don't think we want to try to internally get into that game. If we're winning, we're
winning, we're doing everything we can to do so. Trying to parse that for ourselves, let alone for you is – I'm not going
to. It's high value add.
<Q - Richard C. Eastman>: Yeah. No, that's fine. Okay. Thank you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Thank you, Rick.

Thank you. And due to time constraints, our last question will come from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Thanks. Just a couple quick ones. On second quarter core, you guys had talked about a number
of different segments. Just wondering if you could follow up on Industrial and Dental.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure, Terry. I think Dental we continue to see in sort of that mid-single-digit rate. Industrial,
probably double-digit, 10%, 10% plus.
<Q - Terry Darling>: And where is Apex in full year guidance at this point?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: They contributed about $15 million in the quarter. We expect that to be about $60 million for
the full year. Good ramp-up over last year, but they're also doing a fair amount of restructuring, which again, I think
we'll get another step-up in 2012.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Okay. And then just lastly, kind of a follow-up on the last question, Larry, a lot of benefits from
new products, growth, better margins. And I guess the question is, as we move into 2012, does the curve or the impact
of all that sort of start to flatten, or do you see the flattening further out beyond 2012? I know it's tough because you get
a lot of different segments and products, but I think maybe just touch on that.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Terry, I think we feel very good about those
things that we can control, both from an innovation and a go-to market perspective. I think with all the history that's
been made in the macro scene the last three months, we're not going to get too far out ahead of ourselves on those calls,
but I think we like the positions that we have and we like the markets that we're in. If the global recovery continues the
pace, we're going to be very well placed, well-positioned going into '12 and '13.
<Q - Terry Darling>: So does R&D stay at 6.5% through the year or should we expect that to come back down?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: It should be in that zone. I mean part of the
latitude that we want to make sure we retain through the year is to take that up above plan, above budget, where those
opportunities present themselves. We had a couple discussions just this week in that direction.
<Q - Terry Darling>: And just to squeeze one last one in. Did you call out Videojet core in the quarter?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We did. It was in mid-teens.
<Q - Terry Darling>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Terry.
