Now I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with highlights
of our performance in the first quarter. Next, I'll update our strategic progress in light of the continued soft economy.
And finally, I'll look ahead into the fiscal year. Then I'll turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed financial review
of the quarter and the coming year.
Before we get into the highlights, I want to start by saying we are generally satisfied with our top line results, our cost
management, and our synergy performance this quarter. Our margins, however, were most significantly affected by the
year-over-year negative impact related to generics. This quarter saw a significant shift in the generic wave from a peak
in introductions in the first quarter of last year to a trough this year. We also saw an impact from our strategic decision
to make meaningful promotional investments in our Daily Living business. Wade will walk you through the gross
margin story in more detail later.
Regarding sales for the quarter, we generated a record $18.3 billion. GAAP and adjusted first quarter earnings per
diluted share were $0.72, which includes a positive impact of $0.07 per diluted share attributable to a deferred tax
adjustment from a reduction to the UK corporate tax rate for Alliance Boots.
We filled a record 213 million prescriptions in the quarter and increased our pharmacy market share 50 basis points to
19.4% year over year. We opened an innovative new store with Johns Hopkins Medicine, which will allow us to
co-develop clinical initiatives designed to improve community health care that we intend to pull throughout the chain.
Walgreens and Theranos also took the next step in our planned national rollout of groundbreaking new lab services
with the opening of Theranos Wellness Centers in two stores in Phoenix.
We continue to participate in industry consolidation, as we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Kerr Drug's
retail drugstores and specialty pharmacy business. And, finally, we opened our net-zero energy store in Evanston,
Illinois. We're investing in this store to bring what we learn to our other locations and help us reduce our chain-wide
energy consumption 20% by 2020.
As I mentioned, we reported first quarter sales of $18.3 billion, up 5.9% from $17.3 billion a year ago. GAAP operating
income for the quarter was $924 million, up 31.1% from $705 million last year. Adjusted operating income for the
quarter was $1.1 billion, up 19.4% from $924 million in first quarter 2013.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.72 in the first quarter compared to $0.43 last year, up 66.1%. And first
quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.72, up 24.1% from $0.58 in the same quarter last year.
Finally, we generated operating cash flow of $133 million in the first quarter compared with $601 million in the
year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily the result of the timing of working capital changes associated with our
transition to AmerisourceBergen.
Looking at our gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth on a GAAP basis, this quarter the spread was $72
million. On an adjusted basis, the spread was $44 million. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased by $61 million
or 1.2% compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted SG&A dollar growth increased $17 million or 0.4%
compared to the same quarter last year, as we continued our strong focus on cost management. In fact, our SG&A
dollar growth performance this quarter was among the best we've had in the past several years.
As we made progress on our top line results, we also advanced our three strategic growth drivers: creating the Well
Experience; transforming the role of community pharmacy; and establishing an efficient global platform. Today, I'll
provide an update on that progress.

Beginning with Well Experience, we are continuing to see a value conscious consumer and the impact of a soft
economy. We responded with meaningful promotional investments in the quarter, resulting in an increase in traffic of
210 basis points compared to fourth quarter fiscal 2013. In addition, basket size grew 2.2% and Daily Living sales in
comparable stores increased 2.4%, all compared to the same quarter last year.
We also saw aggregate gains in market share in the quarter across Nielsen tracked categories in our Daily Living
business, which improved as the quarter progressed. While these numbers represent solid gains in our Daily Living
business, as we go forward into fiscal 2014, we will leverage our data and insights from Balance Rewards to improve
the effectiveness of our promotional investments.
We're elevating our focus on meeting customers' expectations in all channels and are driving alignment across our
organization with the appointment of Sona Chawla as President of Digital and Chief Marketing Officer. Through her
new role, we bring together the power of e-commerce, marketing and insights, and analytics teams to help deliver our
Well Experience.
A key part of that strategy is the continuing rollout of our Well Experience store format. We're pleased with our
progress to date on Well Experience, with 87 new and converted stores this quarter, totaling 600 across the country. As
we continue to refine our strategy, we will bring our innovative format with its updated assortments and integrated
healthcare offering into new markets.
We're also enhancing our beauty offering, which we rolled out in nearly 200 of our Phoenix and Arizona stores this
quarter, and where we launched Boots No7 products in partnership with Alliance Boots along with a broader
assortment of beauty brands. We also created a more engaging interactive experience for our customers with
specialized training for our beauty advisors. And most importantly, performance is exceeding our expectations.
And, finally, turning to Balance Rewards, 70% of front-end sales in November were processed through our loyalty
program, with 74 million active members and 92 million members enrolled. Also, with more than 12 months of data,
we are gaining valuable insights into our customers' shopping and purchasing habits, giving us excellent information to
work with as we sharpen our category plans for the year ahead.
In our Pharmacy, Health & Wellness business, demand for flu shots remained high despite the slow start to the cough,
cold and flu season. In a quarter, we administered 1.1 million more flu shots than we did last year, bringing our total for
the season to date to 6.4 million.
In addition, our script comp was up 5.5% in the quarter and our retail pharmacy market share increased 50 basis points
to 19.4% year over year. We also exceeded the industry prescription growth rate in the quarter by 2.9 percentage points
and filled a record 213 million prescriptions.
However, as I described earlier, our margin was impacted by a negative effect related to generics, including a
slowdown in generic introductions as well as an impact to controlled pain medications. The past year we led the
industry to ensure the safe dispensing of controlled medications, working to ensure our patients receive the medications
they need and to help control abuse through new processes, procedures and training as part of our Good Faith
Dispensing Policies.
As result of our enhanced procedures, we saw some drop-off in volume of these higher margin medications and a 50
basis point impact to gross profit dollar growth.
As we begin to look beyond the flu season, we will leverage our success with flu shots to drive our non-flu vaccine
program. We've seen year-over-year growth in vaccines of 34% and we continue to see tremendous potential to grow
our share of the $7.4 billion market.
We also will continue to grow our share of Medicare Part B patients as we take advantage of the consolidation of
mail-order diabetes testing supply companies. As a result, we have seen significant growth in our testing supply
prescriptions and are looking to continue to increase that business.

Last year, our share in Med D outpaced the industry and we are focused on improving our performance this year. Once
again, we are a preferred provider for four of the top national plans offering our customers lower co-pays for the
medications. We have experience with these programs, know the customers and believe we are well-positioned to
improve our Med D script volume.
Through our Well Network, we have brought over 400 healthcare clinics, specialty and infusion assets, hospital
on-sites, centers of excellence and other resources together with our 8,200 retail pharmacies and connected them with
partners across the industry, including physicians, health plans, payers and plans. Together, we are pioneering new
kinds of partnerships and models of care that will create better experiences for patients, improve health outcomes and
lower the overall healthcare costs.
Next, our partnership with Alliance Boots also continue to add to our results contributing $0.14 per diluted share to
Walgreens first quarter 2014 adjusted results, which included $0.07 per diluted share attributable to the deferred tax
adjustment I referenced earlier. As you recall, that compares favorably to our previous estimate of $0.05 for the quarter.
In addition to the company's contribution, we're making solid progress through our joint venture in Bern, Switzerland,
building productive relationships with generic manufacturers and integrating AmerisourceBergen into our global
procurement process.
In addition, with our scale and expertise, we can add value beyond procurement working with manufacturers on a full
range of programs that bring together our healthcare assets, improved service delivery and health outcomes. Sixteen
months into our work, I'm more confident than ever in our game-changing strategic partnership with Alliance Boots,
and our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen. We're bringing together two iconic retail brands, the leading
European integrated wholesale retailer and a leading U.S. wholesaler to create a truly unique collaborative global retail
wholesale model.
This combination is powerful in itself, three of the world's leaders in our respective industry sectors, building a global
platform that is unmatched in the retail or wholesale pharmacy industry that will allow to not only better serve the U.S.
and European healthcare systems and patients, but allows to serve the growing markets around the world. Wade will
give you more details on this as well as our progress toward our 2016 goals shortly.
Overall, we believe we are well positioned for future growth. As we noted in our press release, we anticipate the effect
of the generic trough will moderate in the back half of the year. And with our joint venture in Bern, we are best
positioned to manage the changes taking place across the industry. We are focused on determined execution in our core
business, the fundamentals that have always defined this company, disciplined cost management, driving top line
results and meeting the needs of customers every day in our stores.
Finally, with Christmas just a few days away, we are in amidst of our business season. I want to thank our employees
who have done a great job providing extraordinary customer care and ensuring that we execute with excellence during
a very critical time for our business. We wish everyone on our team a happy and healthy holiday season.
And with that, thank you, Happy Holidays, and I'll turn the call over to Wade.
Wade D. Miquelon
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, I will take you
through our quarterly results as well as update you on our Alliance Boots partnership and our AmerisourceBergen
relationship.
As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.72 per diluted share based on 960 million shares.
GAAP EPS walks to an adjusted EPS of $0.72 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. A LIFO provision of $0.04;
acquisition-related items were $0.11 per share consisting of $0.05 of acquisition-related amortization costs; $0.02 of
acquisition-related costs; $0.03 from Alliance Boots related tax and $0.01 of Alliance Boots related amortization.
Finally, special items were a net reduction of $0.15 per share.

As noted, there was $0.02 per share in costs associated primarily with the closing of the Lehigh Valley distribution
center, as the company positions itself to operate on a global platform which was more than offset by the positive EPS
impact of $0.17 per share related to the warrant issued by AmerisourceBergen.
GAAP and adjusted net earnings in this year's quarter include the positive impact of $0.07 per diluted share attributable
to a deferred tax adjustment resulting from a reduction to the UK corporate tax rate applicable to Alliance Boots, which
was enacted in July of 2013.
Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 7.2%.
Comp front-end sales increased 2.4% and total comp store sales increased 5.4%. Comp prescriptions filled increased
5.5% versus the script comp of negative 4.8% in the year-ago period. Now, please recall the year-ago quarter was
negatively impacted by our exit from the Express Scripts network.
In the first quarter, the front-end comp increased 2.4%, traffic increased by 0.2% and the basket size increased by 2.2%.
As Greg touched on earlier, our front-end has now turned positive on both a one-year and two-year stack basis,
primarily due to the momentum of our new promotional decisions designed to balance traffic and basket with
profitability.
Looking at comparable store script numbers, our retail scripts were up 5.5%. And this continues to reflect the
fundamentals of our underlying business, return of Express Scripts customers, and our continued progress in winning
new Medicare Part D customers. It is also worth noting that the two-year stack on script comps has turned positive for
the first time in eight quarters.
With respect to margin, our adjusted FIFO gross margin was 28.5% in the current quarter compared to 29.8% last year,
a 130 basis point decline. While we always experience some reimbursement pressure, by far the most significant factor
affecting the pharmacy margin was dramatically slower rate of new generic introductions this quarter versus the quarter
a year ago.
The front-end margin was negatively impacted by increased promotional investment designed to drive traffic as well.
As Greg mentioned, the loss of some controlled substances in the business impacted the margin negatively.
Taking a look at our longer term adjusted FIFO gross margin trends, this quarter's 130 basis point decline was up
against 140 basis point increase a year ago. In essence, the benefit of the generic wave last year reversed itself this year,
and we expect an impact of similar magnitude in the second quarter. As stated earlier, both the Pharmacy and front-end
margins decreased in the quarter, which impacted our overall results. Moving forward, front-end margin will continue
to be impacted by our new promotional adjustments until we cycle these changes.
This next chart, which we demonstrated and discussed last quarter, illustrates the impact the new generic drug
introductions have on our monthly prescription sales comps. You can see that the generic impact on comp prescription
sales was greatest in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, reaching a negative 8.8% versus the generic impact in the most
recent quarter of a negative 0.9%.
The highlighted quarters illustrate that the number of new generic drug introductions have slowed dramatically versus a
year ago. In our experience, the margin change resulted from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lagged to the
impact of generic changes. That is the strongest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after generic impact
on prescription sales and is the most deflationary. And, conversely, the weakest positive effect on margin typically
occurs shortly after the generic impact on prescription sales is the least deflationary.
Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollars growth trends for the past nine
quarters on a GAAP basis. And next slide shows these trends on an adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth
slowed slightly from 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 1.2% in the first quarter of 2014 commensurate with the
generic wave shift and the front-end investment.
To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our GAAP SG&A dollar growth was a negative 0.4%, to
which we add back 0.3 percentage points for Walgreen acquisition-related amortization and 0.9 percentage points for
the Hurricane Sandy offset, sum up by a 0.4 percentage point related to organizational efficiency costs. Many of these

items resulted in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of positive 0.4% in the quarter.
Shown here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past nine quarters on a GAAP basis, and the follow-on slide
shows a similar trend on adjusted basis. The adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was a 0.4% year-over-year
increase versus the 2.5% increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. This next chart illustrates that our two-year stack
for the SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.
Now, let's review the two-year stack trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a
year ago by 450 basis points, with a two-year stack of 2.9% growth in the first quarter of 2014 down from 7.4% last
year. During the quarter, the rate of growth and adjusted FIFO gross profit dollars exceeded adjusted SG&A dollar
growth by 80 basis points. Given the very powerful margin headwinds we faced, we are pleased with the SG&A effort
needed to yield this positive spread. And as you can see, this is the third consecutive quarter with a positive spread.
Turning to a few other components of our income statement, this quarter included LIFO provision of $58 million
versus the provision or charge of $55 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the quarter was 2.8%, up slightly
from 2.5% a year ago.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $41 million versus $37 million from a year ago. Average diluted shares
outstanding were 962 million shares versus 951 million shares last year. The change is primarily due to the impact of a
higher stock price on the number of in-the-money options which are accounted into diluted shares. In Q2, you can
expect diluted share count of approximately 960 million shares, subject to changes in the current share price. You can
also expect interest expense of approximately $40 million in Q2.
Our blended effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% versus 38.2% last year. On a go-forward basis, Walgreens tax
rate is expected to be about 37.5% excluding the various impacts associated with the Alliance Boots partnership.
Cash and cash equivalents were $969 million in the first quarter versus $1.8 billion a year ago. Accounts receivable
increased by 20.5%, primarily due to increased business, including the return of Express Scripts network prescriptions,
while accounts payable decreased by 1.2%. LIFO inventories were down 1.2% and FIFO inventories were up 1.5%
year over year versus sales growth of 5.9%. Overall, net working capital decreased by 5.7% versus a year ago.
During the first quarter, we generated $132 million in cash from operations versus $601 million a year ago. The
decrease was primarily the result of timing of working capital changes associated with our transition to
AmerisourceBergen, which we expect will work itself out over time. Free cash flow in the quarter was a negative $231
million versus a positive $265 million a year ago.
Shifting to our quarterly Alliance Boots accretion walk, as shown, the walk yields an accretion of $0.14 in the quarter,
including a $0.07 one-time tax benefit due to the lowering of corporate taxes in the UK. A detailed description of this
walk is included in the appendix.
Looking forward, we estimate the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the second quarter of fiscal year
2014 to be $0.07 to $0.08 per share based on our current estimates of IFRS to GAAP conversion and foreign exchange
rates. And moving forward, we will continue to provide our accretion estimates on the call each quarter, in advance.
We're also confirming the combined synergies for fiscal year 2014 and expect them to be in the $350 million to $400
million range.
A key consideration for the second quarter each year is the relative population affected by the flu, as illustrated in this
chart. As noted, the red line is the incidence of flu last year, with the peak in January, and the purple line is the average
incidence of flu for the last three years. And the black line is the actual flu incidence season to date this year. As you
can see, the flu incidence this year is less pervasive than last year and is running 5% to 10% below last year. We will
keep you posted on how this relative flu incidence plays out throughout the season with our monthly sales releases.
I'd like to close today with a brief update on progress towards our fiscal year 2016 goals, which we provided to you
after we announced our 45% investment in Alliance Boots in June of 2012. While it's still relatively early in our
journey, performance to date with respect to four of our goals is on track with or slightly ahead of our expectations.
And these four goals are: sales of $130 billion including Alliance Boots share of associates and joint ventures sales;

synergies of $1 billion; operating cash flow of $8 billion; and net debt of $11 billion.
Performance to date with respect to our adjusted operating income goal of $99.5 billion is currently tracking a bit below
the CAGR required to meet this goal, largely because of gross profit dollar growth pressure domestically, as I discussed
today, and a challenging environment in some international markets.
While we recognize there are risks to achieving this goal, we remain focused on delivering it and have identified a
range of further opportunities, including benefits of our AmerisourceBergen relationship, incremental Alliance Boots
synergies, business expansion and new initiatives, and accelerated cost savings, all which can help mitigate these risks.
We intend to continue to update you on our progress against these goals in future calls.
In summary, we continue to be very optimistic and excited about our future. We've made tremendous progress in our
Well Experience journey to become the most relevant retailer in our space. But still we believe we are just scratching
the surface of ways we can continue to leverage our best-in-class footprint with differentiated products and services to
please and reward our most valuable customers and gain new customers just like them. We believe we have the
strategies, tools, and talent to do exactly that.
We're gaining share in retail pharmacy as we are finding new ways to please and attract pharmacy patients. But what
gets us even more excited is the tremendous opportunity we have before us to move from a traditional pharmacy
historically participating in about 12% of the healthcare market to a company that is increasingly participating much
more broadly, in areas like specialty, home infusion, workplace health, vaccinations, diagnostics lab, hospital
partnerships, and primary care.
Because of our unmatched infrastructure, over 70,000 healthcare service providers and new emerging technologies, we
are extraordinarily well positioned to capture value while helping deliver better outcomes on healthcare spend across
the board, thereby benefiting patients, payers, suppliers, and in many cases, even other providers.
Lastly, our partnership with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen gives us a unique opportunity to leverage our
combined assets and capabilities to be more efficient and effective in our core business and to continue our journey to
influence health, beauty, and well-being on a global stage. We believe that this unique combination will continue to
lead to other value-creating partnerships.
We've always said there will be some ups and downs in this journey, but if we stay relentlessly focused we can achieve
our purpose to help people get, stay, and live well, and continue to reward our stakeholders.
Thank you for all your combined and continued support and I hope the holiday season blesses you and all of yours.
And now, I'll turn it back to Rick.

<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: I guess with some other large scale generic deals being announced in the pharma supply
channel recently, I was just curious if you guys think you have a first-mover advantage with manufacturers just given
the earlier timing of your JV. And also just overall, do you think these other deals help your cause? Do they hurt a

little? Are they neutral? I'm just curious for more color given some of these other deals.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, Steve, good question. Certainly, I think we do realize we have first-mover advantage.
We've been at this for a period of time now. And I think Jeff and the team in Bern, John Donovan are doing a great job
as we've talked about. Certainly, we're focused on maintaining that first-mover advantage and not giving it up. I think,
as I somewhat said in my remarks, we do feel like we've got a truly differentiated model, which is not only an
integrated retail wholesale model but certainly two great partners with AmerisourceBergen here in the U.S., Alliance
Boots in Europe.
So, I think, we've put together an opportunity to serve both the U.S. and the European market with an integrated
wholesale retail market with three iconic brands, which gives us the opportunity to even go beyond. So we think our
model, frankly, is a superior model. We do not want to lose our first-mover advantage. As far as what it may do to the
market, we'll see. I think, certainly, with three big buying groups out there, the industry's going to continue to change
and we'll have to stay ahead of that to make sure we react. But we think we're advantaged.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay, that's great. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Miller of William Blair. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Yes, can you expand on the business expansion and new initiatives, Wade, that you called out
to be able to offset for the operating profit tracking thus far a little bit below the long-term plan? And then also the
efficiencies and cost savings you alluded to, is that something we're going to see those expenses come through on a
quarter-by-quarter basis? Or might we see a larger restructuring for the company?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, I'll speak a little bit to the business initiatives and expansion. Obviously, some of
these things are public and known and some of these things are still things that are not, but they're the kinds of things
we've talked about, work we're doing with. For example, Big Pharma to help reinvent their model to help save costs in
clinical trials, which we're doing some work with right now. Also, things like Theranos, which we believe has very
meaningful potential. We're very excited about. In various geographies, we've got a strong footprint, but we've got
opportunities to do even more breadth of services in those markets and get deeper and broader and working with our
partners; Alliance Boots, we're doing exactly that.
On the costs side, I think you saw we had very good cost progress. We think we're – we do a lot of things efficiently,
but there are always opportunities to do a lot more. And under Tim Theriault's leadership, we're bringing good news,
improvement to a whole another level in the company, really looking at every process end-to-end and how we can be
much more efficient, much more enabling to our employees. So we have continued opportunities and we're
aggressively going after it. But it's going to make us, I think, a much better company and allow us to serve our
customers even better to boot.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. And my second question is there are a lot of adjustments here to get to the underlying
performance. But, one, I need help with this, the $0.07 positive impact on Alliance Boots. Is that being added back to
the $151 million that's flowing through the equity earnings line such that if we took that out, it'd be around $80 million
underlying?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now
open.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Hey, guys. So a couple of things. In your release, you have a statement in here about
assessing various steps to optimize assets and cost structure alongside AB and ABC. What are you thinking about there,
either generally or specifically?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, John, Greg. I think we did mention and, I think, as Wade said in his remarks, the first
couple things we looked at for this quarter were some distribution centers. But as we – what we want to do is make sure
that we're looking to the future with our new partners, AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Boots and if that obviously
come together like we think it will, there's opportunities for us to position ourselves going forward. And whether it's
looking at distribution centers, making sure we've got the right footprint, we're looking at all types of cost within
corporate to make sure that we've got the right initiatives, the right people devoted to those. Certainly, we're looking at
all of our assets across the enterprise to make sure that we're set up for the future.
So nothing truly defined, but just an effort to make sure that we are indeed positioned ourselves for the future. As Wade
said, I've designated Tim Theriault, who is our CIO and Head of Innovation, and continuous improvement as our – it's
Lean into Lean Six Sigma and drive that throughout the organization. I think the one thing that we have seen from our
Alliance Boots partnership with the wholesale expertise and cost focus that a wholesaler has bringing to Boots over the
years, there are opportunities to bring costs now to the system. So it's really all that in a nutshell that make sure that we
are positioned for the future.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And do you think alongside that – historically, I think you've looked at an SG&A run rate
maybe in the 3% to 4% range, obviously you're well below that here. Is there a new long-term run rate well below that
prior one?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: We get 3.5% to 4.5%, is kind of what we have historically said on organic basis. I don't
think we're prepared to give a new number today. I would just say that – we think there are opportunities to be
increasingly efficient. It's not just SG&A, it's – by the way, it's across the board of – and it's really end-to-end
processes. But, again, I think, the big idea here is who we're becoming in partnership with. Both Alliance Boots and
AmerisourceBergen is enhanced and different company than who we've been and we're really readying ourselves to
make sure that we can capitalize on that to the maximum extent possible.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And then one last thing, when you look about the $1 billion of synergy, do you
think some of that will end up getting reinvested back in the business? Maybe not so much at the front-end, but your
pharmacy labor, things inside the store to deal with higher volumes or no – very little of that will get reinvested?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Certainly as we go forward, some of it could, John. But I think, right now, we're focused
on a lot of the initiatives we have over and above that to drive the business. So we think most – the majority of that will
indeed come to the bottom line. At the same time, we haven't really given out what we think we can accomplish with
AmerisourceBergen. AmerisourceBergen is indeed in those fiscal 2016 goals, but we're just beginning to get started on
that. So we think there's opportunity over and above that.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: In fact, on the $1 billion, John, to the extent that some of it was reinvested, then we'll
deliver more. That's really a net that we're targeting.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, John.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yes, good morning. Can you help us think a little bit more details on the margin trajectory
for fiscal year 2014? So giving all the moving parts, when I think about the promotional activity in generics, for second
half of the year, should we model gross margin up year-over-year or only sequentially?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Ricky, maybe I'll start and turn it over to Wade. I would say based on what we're seeing,
certainly, that I wouldn't think Q2 directionally will be much different than what we're seeing in Q1. And I think we're
already through the first – nearly through the first month and then the biggest month of the second quarter. We're
continuing to see a cautious consumer, and therefore our promotional activity will probably directionally remain the
same.
I think, obviously, as you've seen in the one chart that we put up was as far as the sales impact of the generic wave.
Certainly, Q2 has got a significant peak from last year that we're going against another trough. So, directionally, for
Q2, I don't see – I wouldn't think much of a change. Certainly, we've got some help in the back half with generics.
And as we get more and more Balance Rewards data and insights, we want to continue to make our promotional a little
more effective. But, I would say – as I said, I think, Q2, not much directionally and we'll try to do what we can in the
back half of the year. Wade?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No, I agree. I think certainly you – we often joke about Rick's theory of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle of the generics, the more that you kind of study and analyze the timing of these, the more they
seem to change a bit, but you have similar information that we do. Certainly, the back half looks to be stronger. And,
again, I think, under Alex's leadership, I think, we're doing a lot of things to get the smart balance between both growth
and profitability. And as we sweeten the mix around Health & Beauty down the road as well, it's an opportunity for us.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: And just to confirm because I think you've mentioned it, the promotional activity had a
negligible impact on the front-end margin? So should we just assume the promotional activity spend is going to stay at
constant levels throughout the year?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No, the largest impact was, as we said, was the waiver, the trough rather, of new generics,
significantly. But then the next largest would have been the front-end promotion with, as we said, to a lesser degree, 50
bps from controlled substances in gross profit dollar growth. But it was meaningful, but the largest was the trough in
generics by far.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And, Ricky, with that promotional investment, as we said, we grew our traffic a couple
100 basis points in the quarter before we increased basket size and increased the comp, which is good. We just had to
throw a lot more at it and – than we anticipated. And that's what we meant by meaningful investment and that's what I
meant directionally, I don't see the competitive promotional environment changing much.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then, I know that you've talked very positively about Theranos. Can you share
with us kind of like your experience, I think, the technology has been in your pharmacies for a couple of months now.
What are you seeing in the marketplace?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, we're very, very positive on Theranos. I mean, it's really a – one of the disruptive
plays, it's a better patient experience with a prick of blood. It's the highest standard of quality in lab with costs, half of
the cost of Medicare. And the patient feedback we're getting is very good, but it's really a better, faster, cheaper, more
conveniently play. And we're going to – as we expand here, we'll keep learning and perfecting the patient experience
which is really the case – the key thing. But we're very, very positive.
I think it's just one more example of how community pharmacy can play a role in broader health care. And that's the
direction we're going, we've got the assets, we have the health care professionals, we have the convenience and we
have the right to win in these spaces and we're very excited about it.

doing that.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Wade, first, as we look at
the synergies you guys have reported today and the buckets that you guys laid out at the analyst presentation in Europe,
can you bucket for us where they're coming from and give us a sense for where you're seeing the most traction early?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, sure. The biggest – or the biggest benefit we've been getting is generics, as we've said,
that hasn't changed. The other areas where we're getting meaningful early synergies are things like own brand
procurement, for us our indirect spend, our relationship with some of the CPG players, so all of those are providing
opportunities.
The one that will ramp up over time, but becomes really a point of differentiation in an ongoing giving is what we're
doing to drive the own brand in the Boots portfolio. And, again, it's just, today, a few select stores, but the broad
Phoenix area. But the results are very, very good and we're very optimistic that as we expand this, this will become
something that becomes a very strong part of our value creating portfolio for many years.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. And then maybe on the inventory, I guess, maybe just as an update, as you guys ramp the
ABC agreement, how should we think about inventory levels going forward either measured as a – I don't know, if you
want to talk about in an absolute dollar sense or inventory days on hand or change in mix. I guess, kind of ability to
extract cash from that line going forward, I guess, could you give us an update on how to think about that?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, there are a lot of moving parts as you can see in our cash numbers and working capital
numbers associated with this transition. And this is a non-normal quarter, if you will, because even while we're
transitioning inventory, for example, on brands to ABC, that reduces inventory for us, but our payables go up
commensurately. But in the very short-term on the cutover rate, we also get fair large level as inventory at store, for
example, so that we can make sure that we had a flawless transition, now that will work its way out.
So, I guess, what I'd say is two things is, one, is this kind of pig in the python will work its way out from the transition
over time from a cash flow basis. But then beyond that, because we have daily deliveries, because of their expertise, we
should be able to over time take out additional days of inventory although we put no specific goal there.
Also, keep in mind that starting next month we'll begin the generic transition, which will go several months, nine
months, region by region, store by store. And that will also create a little bit of a timing flex up and down with our cash
flow and working capital. But again, over time, these things will work themselves out and lend themselves to a net-net
inventory opportunity in the future.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay, and then maybe just one last one quickly. As we think about the income statement
moving through this year, you've got the margin erosion that's a component of a tough generic comp. Probably until we
get to fiscal 2015, you're going to see faster specialty growth and brand drug growth from a dollar basis driving the
pharmacy top line. How much of the margin erosion should we think of as the tough comp on generics? And how much
of the erosion is the mix impact of accelerating brand and specialty drug growth versus growth in generics?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That's a good question. There is, from a margin percentage, you are right, specialty are the
lowest and brand will be higher than that and generics the best. But from a gross profit dollar growth, it's a little bit
different. Obviously, we have, for example, when there's branded inflation, we get some benefit on that. So I guess
what I would say is, our model, really think of it in terms of gross profit dollar growth versus the margin percent per se.

And this was certainly probably as dry as any quarter gets in generics, next quarter is about the same as that. But again,
that's what will really swing the gross profit dollar growth once we get into the back half and beyond.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay, thanks. I appreciate the color.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael R. Minchak>: Thanks, good morning. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa. Just with respect to the
combined Alliance Boots synergy number in the first quarter, the $107 million you reported appears to be tracking a
little bit ahead of expectations based on the $350 million to $400 million forecast for 2014. Can you talk about what's
driving the upside there and the cadence of those synergies going forward in 2014?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, it is tracking ahead, good observation. It does give us confidence, actually even more
so leading up to those fiscal 2016 goals that Wade talked about. I think the team in Bern is doing a tremendous job
working with our pharmaceutical suppliers in new and creative ways. And now that we're bringing in
AmerisourceBergen volume, as I said, that's positive as well. It could be a little less in 2Q because there's some
bumpiness. But we feel for the fiscal year that we're ahead of that target that we've given and we feel confident in the
$1 billion, and we believe there's upside.
<Q - Michael R. Minchak>: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, with respect to the pharmacy reimbursement
environment, can you talk about how things are trending there and whether you anticipate things getting any materially
better or worse in here?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: As we say and as I say all the time, anybody in healthcare, we always face ongoing
reimbursement pressure, and certainly that hasn't changed and frankly won't change. We have to deal with that. I think
that we'll probably see similar to what we've seen, but there's certainly more and more focus on it. I think what we're
working to do is to work with people in preferred ways to create more value and be able to bring more and more
services in addition to just the pharmacy provision that we bring. But I think we have to accept ongoing reimbursement
pressures due to our focus on our cost to fill. Also, we think we're positioned better than anyone as far as procurement
and to make sure that we're working all three of those metrics in unison.
<Q - Michael R. Minchak>: Great, thanks for the comment.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for the questions. Just to follow up on the cadence of the Alliance Boots contribution,
it looks like you're calling for about $0.07 next quarter, $0.07 to $0.08 next quarter, about the same as what we saw
organically this quarter. I was just wondering if you could maybe shed a little light on why that contribution would be
flat sequentially. And then anything you can give us around the balance of the year would be helpful.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: There are a couple things going on here. One is just – it's a bit iterative. You never know
exactly what the accretion or dilution is until our numbers are done. So as they grow their earnings and we grow
synergies, it also is relative to whatever our base is. And again, there's also flexibility of what will synergies be, which
some of those are known and normal and some are known completely. But I think that we have it close enough at this
point because of three-month lag to know the general range. But again, there are a couple of moving parts that in the
end can move around. So for example, this quarter we were thinking it would be – $0.05 I think was our guidance,
$0.04 to $0.05. We ended up at $0.07. Again, because of these moving parts for some of the final synergies and how
they come in as well as our relative performance and then how you calculate that.

<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Okay, got it. And then just on generic price inflation, this obviously has been a big topic. One
of your competitors called this out as a headwind to them in the quarter. I guess specifically, anything worth calling out
in the quarter as far as generic price inflation goes? And then more broadly, how should we think about an environment
where it does appear that generic price inflation will continue? As you guys look at that over the balance of the year, is
that a headwind, tailwind, neutral? Any thought there'd be helpful.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, there's always some inflation in the industry. In the past, we did see some unusual
inflation on select molecules in this past quarter, which did give us a little bit of an impact. It's hard to say whether that
will be ongoing or not. Certainly, we think we are very well positioned with Jeff and John Donovan and the team in
Switzerland to make sure that we're working with both, generic and branded pharmaceutical companies to provide
value and offset anything that may occur. But we saw a little bit of unusual activity. But again, our folks in Bern are on
top of it and we want to work with these folks in a way that helps them create value as well as the synergies
opportunities we see.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great. And then I guess just the last one if you guys wouldn't mind. Any update around
changing view around ACA contribution as we've seen a little bit more progress, I guess, on uptake of enrollment and
also around Medicaid expansion, and any thoughts you guys have there, relative to the rest of the year would be great.
Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I would just say that it's probably too early for us to know all the implications and timing as
we go forward here. I think there are lots of opinions out there, and one is probably as good as the next. But right now
we're not modeling in a lot from the early days, but over time obviously it's going to change the structure of the
industry and how we participate with players. Maybe, Kermit, do you want to...
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Yes, Robert, I'd add – certainly we've seen the enrollment has been slow, but we continue
to work with our healthcare partners and go help to educate these patients. We've always said that we expect the
Affordable Care Act to bring more people into the healthcare system as a result of coverage, which we certainly would
think will benefit from this increase in enrollment. We have built our strategy around an access to quality care over the
past decade. And we think we're well positioned to serve these patients not only from a prescription perspective, but for
additional healthcare services like vaccines and immunizations and also some of the preventative services you now see
in our healthcare clinics.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Edward Kelly of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Good morning, guys. A few questions for you. Wade, I guess, first of all, related to the 2016
commentary. When do you expect to give us some update as to how these numbers are playing out? When you talk
about adjusted operating income tracking a little bit lighter, does that also include now the benefit of ABC?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, I think we obviously did these goals before ABC and then when we announced ABC,
we said that there is additional opportunity, but we wouldn't be changing our goals. That's in part because $9 billion we
already believe is a very meaningful, large goal to hit and an appropriate goal, but the other thing is we also had other
projects built in. If we had not gone with ABC, like project GAAP and others where we were going to change our
distribution supply system internally and had meaningful benefits built in for that.
So this is really swapping out this for that and albeit a little bit better. But I think the key thing is, is we really start to
reap the benefits of ABC in a meaningful way in 2015, both on the generic distribution side as well on the procurement
side and even other opportunities that we're now starting to work among the two and the three parties. So there's a bit of
a hockey stick here versus a CAGR. But that was always, to some extent, the case, and I think that this is really now
just part of our base operating model.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Any sense just on timing of when we should – when we'll be getting an update you think?

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Quarter to quarter, we look at it and say are these realistic based upon all the risks and
opportunities we have internally, if we ever feel that's not the case, we'll certainly tell you. You can put together a glide
path like we can and take our numbers and put it along that path. But we continue to do assessment and say do we think
it's still possible to hit these and do we have the right bullets in the chamber, if you will, and at this point we do.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Ed, this is Greg. I would say that we're doing this quarter-by-quarter. Obviously, we're
kicking the tires as we go to make sure that we feel that we can achieve those goals and we do. So I would somewhat
consider this as an update, but at the same time, you can rest assured that we'll continue to look at those numbers and
make sure that we're confident. And I think to Wade's point, we think that we've got ways to achieve those goals. And
the CAGR on the operating adjusted income is a little bit soft, but we think the change in the mix of the business will
allow us to get it.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: I think when you talked about that, Wade, I thought I heard you say something about
international as well as the U.S. business. Is that right? And could you give us a little bit more color on that front?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: What I said is business initiatives as well as, I think, global growth opportunities or
whatever. But these are the series of initiatives that we're working with our partners, Alliance Boots, to strengthen
various markets, introduce new services in some case, work with new partners like Global Pharma and create value in
unique ways.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: I actually meant the CAGR, when you were talking about the CAGR being a little softer, I
thought you had mentioned international too.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I guess putting it simplistically, there are some markets that had been a bit challenging for
AB on an EBIT basis. But on the other hand, because of their accelerated cash flow, their accelerated de-levering,
excellent work on refinancing on an after tax and also some tax benefits on after tax basis, they're generating great
value creation. So it's a little bit of that EBIT pressure, but actually from a bottom line impact, we're getting it back.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: All right, just one other question for you on the front end. Can we just dig in a little bit more
into the promotional strategy here because you are successfully driving better comp growth, better traffic growth. It's
not up a ton, right? The traffic year-over-year and, on a two-year basis, it's better but not a huge improvement, right?
And the gross margin seems to be taking a little bit of a beating. So I'm not so sure that your comparable gross profit
dollar growth is up. Could you comment on that?
And then just generally, if that's all the case, is it working, right? Or do you need to make further adjustments? And is
that what you're talking about, about when you talk about balancing front-end sales and margins?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, Ed, Greg. I agree with you. I think that – the good news is, we've made investment,
we've got the top line moving. When I said I'm generally satisfied with that, that's what I mean. I'm never truly fully
satisfied. With that, we did have to make more meaningful investment than we anticipated. We want to make sure that
we're getting a bang for a buck for that investment. We probably had to overinvest based on what we anticipated.
I think the opportunity we have, now that we have 12 months of data coming from our Balance Rewards program,
there's tremendous insights to help us get much more effective input with that investment that we're having to make.
But we obviously want to make sure that the investment we're making gives us a much greater of the return than what it
did this quarter.
Now, that you can't change that overnight, so a lot of the plans and activity, as I said, are in place for the next quarter.
So that's the reason I say, I don't think directionally we're going to see much of a difference. But I do think as Alex and
team get more and more insights, we are absolutely going to be using that to get a better return for the investment in the
promotional activity we're making.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes.

Thank you. And I'm showing we have two more questions in the queue. Our next question comes from the line of
Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Hey, Greg, I think you – and Wade, you made a comment
about impact from controlled substances, reduction in the volumes there. I'm not sure if I might have missed it earlier.
But, Greg, did you say the impact to gross margin in the quarter was 50 basis points? And is that something that will –
is sort of like a – just a step down overall because the dispensing of those drugs will just be reduced overall? Or how
should we think about that? Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, I did mention that. And, I think, we obviously as a leader in industry believe it is
frankly up to us now. This is on us to make sure that we are indeed leading with best practices. We have Kermit and
team, I'll let him talk about in a little bit as he has implemented Good Faith Dispensing efforts. I think, as a result, we
are indeed seeing a reduction in some of those higher margin pain control substances. We want to make sure that we're
getting them to patients appropriately and the patients that frankly need those medications are able to receive them and
frankly those that don't, don't. And now – and it will be ongoing as far as that hit that we've talked about, that's an
ongoing hit.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: So, Charles, just to clarify, it was actually a reduction of 50 basis points in gross profit
dollar growth, not in margin.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: I see, okay. That's helpful.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: And, Charles, I would just add that, we implemented our Good Faith Dispensing Policy
back in late April of last year. And this policy is really designed to ensure that the patients get the right medication that
they need, but while at the same time helping us to control abuse of these controlled substances.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked. I would like to go back
and talk a little bit about expense control. You did a great job this quarter. There was some press rumors about actually
shrinking the number of people in your corporate office. I know it's an awkward topic because people listen to your
calls, however, it was in the press. And I was just wondering whether some of the improvement you're seeing is
because you've become more efficient in reduced head count, and are there more plans to reduce head count in
corporate?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, Meredith, thanks. Yes, I think I remember the article you're talking about. And, I
think, obviously this got overstated and sensationalized maybe a little bit, but – so as we go forward, part of our Lean
Six Sigma is just to make sure we've got the right projects, processes in place, we've got the appropriate people signed
to those and frankly continue to look at optimizing not only our head count but our assets along the way. But the article
you're talking about was extremely over-sensationalized.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And does Boots have – or Alliance Boots have any impact on the way you look at becoming
more efficient and productive in corporate?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, I think, there are some best practices, not only in corporate, but even out in the field.
And Alex Gourlay is not on the call and, maybe the next one, I'll have him on. But one of the things I think we're doing
with Mark Wagner and team is focusing on trying to get more and more work out of these stores, the

AmerisourceBergen distribution agreement with daily deliveries and so forth, will help us not have to carry as much
inventory and be able to diminish the workload in our stores. But we have a real focus on moving from more and more
tasks to more focus on the customer. And, I think, that in itself we're able to bring some of the best practices that Alex's
bringing from Boots and what they have done over the years as well.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And then I do actually have a question about something that Wade was saying about
synergies, and I think there was a mention that you were working on making your distribution network and structure,
processes, more efficient, even if you hadn't done the ABC deal. And that was included in the synergies. And that just
kind of surprised me because I guess I thought synergies would be related strictly to whatever happens with Alliance
Boots. Are you saying that you're learning – is it part of the best practices you learned from them? Or was that kind of a
separate initiative that you were working on anyway?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No, actually I apologize if I confused you. What I had said was, is that, the benefit that we
anticipate we'll get from ABC in distribution and in buying is part of our plan to get to our $9 billion goal. This is not
included in the $1 billion AB synergies. That's just with AB. This is separate from that, but, I guess, prior to ABC, we
were looking at a variety of different models that would have made us more efficient which had some savings built into
our plans. These are certainly bigger, but to the extent that this is our partner and our chosen way to go to market with
both generics and with our supply chain, those basically built into our base model and into our goals.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thank you. That clarification is very helpful. I just – my final thing is a plea. We would love it
if you would give us more data about the healthcare side of the business. It may not be material, but the forecasting that
we do now is kind of weird to come up with what incremental revenues you're getting that are outside of the stores. I
would love it if you give revenues and profits. Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Point taken, Meredith. We'll study it and consider it.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Meredith.
