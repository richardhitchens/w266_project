uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the
comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other
reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any
forward-looking statement.
Before I hand the call over to Amy, I'd like to remind you that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will
relate to the corresponding period of last year. Also, unless specified otherwise, all impacted numbers for the current
quarter have been adjusted for the cumulative effect of the revenue deferrals and recognitions related to the Office and
Windows upgrade offers, the $900 million charge for inventory adjustments primarily related to the new Surface RT
pricing we announced earlier this week, and the goodwill impairment charge from last year. You can find the details of
the adjustments and reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in our financial
summary slide deck. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Amy.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
In many ways, our fourth quarter results reflect the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. The consumer
x86 PC market declined as users continued to prioritize devices with touch and mobility. At the same time, we saw
continued strength in our enterprise products and cloud solutions, and increased adoption of our consumer services.
This quarter, our Windows business declined as the device market continued to evolve beyond the traditional PC. We
are working to transition the business into this modern era of computing, taking advantage of the new scenarios enabled
by Windows 8. As we've said before, given the complexity of the ecosystem, this journey will take time, but we
continue to make incremental progress.
In June, we released the public preview of Windows 8.1. It blends the desktop and modern experience. It has new
features and improvements in areas such as personalization, search, built-in apps, and cloud connectivity. Windows 8.1
will be a free update to existing Windows 8 users and will be made available to OEMs in August, less than one year
since launch.
To increase and improve retail distribution, we entered into a strategic partnership with Best Buy to create a Windows
store in over 600 Best Buy locations. These store-within-a-store locations provide a large scale, hands-on consumer
experience that showcases Microsoft devices and services.
The percentage and breadth of touch devices available at retail continues to improve. The first 8-inch Windows tablet
became available at retail a few weeks ago. It has legacy application compatibility, includes Microsoft Office, and
retails for less than $400. We expect additional compelling small screen devices to be available in the coming months.
Less than a year ago, we launched Surface RT and Surface Pro, each with a unique value proposition. Surface is one
part of our journey to bring innovative, compelling Windows devices to market in the modern era of computing. With
each step, we analyze our progress and fine-tune our action plan as needed.
Here's what we did this quarter. We reduced the price of Surface RT by $150, to $349 per device. As a result of this
price change as well as inventory adjustments for related parts and accessories, we recorded a $900 million charge to
our income statement. While this resulted in a negative $0.07 impact on earnings, we believe this pricing adjustment
will accelerate Surface RT adoption and position us better for long-term success.
We also increased retail distribution this quarter. Surface is now available in 29 markets and 10,000 retail locations. We
expanded the availability of Surface to our Business and Institutional customers. Through our new channel expansion
program, commercial customers are able to purchase Surface devices from authorized resellers in the U.S. Over the
next few months, we will authorize commercial distributors and resellers in more countries.
So in summary on Windows, we are working hard with our partners to gain share in the evolving and growing device
market. I want to be very clear. We know we have to do better, and that's one reason we made the strategic and

organizational changes we made last week. With over 1.5 billion Windows users around the world, a transition of this
magnitude takes time. We are confident we are moving in the right direction.
Now on to our enterprise business which continues to be strong. We closed out the year with record unearned revenue
of $22.4 billion as businesses continue to make long-term commitments to the Microsoft platform.
Within our Server & Tools business, we continued to make significant improvements in performance, reliability and
scalability with SQL Server. As a result, customers are increasingly moving mission-critical and BI workloads to the
platform. While SQL Server has been the unit share leader in the market for some time, it has consistently outgrown the
market over the past 12 months and is now the second-largest database in revenue share.
We recently announced the next versions of Windows Server and System Center, which will continue to deliver on our
Cloud OS vision. With new features and enhancements in virtualization, storage and networking, we are empowering
our customers to more efficiently manage their application services and their private, hosted and public cloud
infrastructures.
In Windows Azure, we continue to innovate and broaden our cloud platform offerings. We recently announced an
important Enterprise partnership with Oracle that will enable customers to run Oracle software on Hyper-V and in
Windows Azure. In June, we announced the public preview of Windows Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet,
making Microsoft the first multinational organization to offer public cloud services in China. As a result of the greater
choice and flexibility, we are seeing increased customer traction, both in terms of an increase in enterprise customers
but also the average deal size.
Our productivity solutions continue to be a top priority for CIOs. As enterprise customers look to modernize their
productivity infrastructures, they are increasingly turning to Office 365. We recently announced the expansion of
commercial availability into several new markets, making Office 365 available in over 125 markets worldwide. I'm
pleased to share that momentum is accelerating, and Office 365 is now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate.
During the quarter we saw ongoing momentum for our consumer services such as Office 365 Home Premium,
SkyDrive, Xbox Live, Skype, and Outlook.com.
By giving consumers rich, high value experiences across productivity, communications and entertainment, these
services can help give our products and our overall ecosystem a strategic advantage in today's marketplace, where the
line between home and work is blurring for many customers. Our unified communication offering of Skype and Lync
are a great example of where Customer and Enterprise products can be mutually reinforcing and create more
opportunity for Microsoft.
In summary, the fourth quarter continued many of the trends we saw developing throughout the fiscal year. We
continued to make important strides toward our strategy to create a family of devices and services for individuals and
businesses, to empower them for the activities they value the most. Some of our investments are already paying off
while others reinforce the foundation that positions us for future growth and profitability.
With that, I'll hand it over to Chris to give more details about this quarter before I come back to share thoughts on the
first quarter of fiscal 2014.
Chris Suh
Thanks, Amy. First I'm going to review our overall results, and then I'll move on to the details by business segment.
Revenue was up 3% to $19.2 billion and operating income declined 11% to $6.2 billion. Earnings per share declined
19% to $0.59. Foreign exchange had a $257 million or 1% negative impact to revenue this quarter, and a $177 million
or 3% negative impact to net income. From a geographic perspective, revenue in the U.S. was strong relative to other
regions. Annuity revenue continued to be strong, growing 13%. We had record unearned revenue of $22.4 billion, and
our contracted, not billed balance was approximately $21 billion.

Now, to the results for the Windows Division where revenue declined 5% this quarter. The x86 PC market continued to
decline. While business PCs showed modest growth, we estimate consumer PCs declined more than 20%. As a result,
OEM revenue declined 15%. OEM revenue lagged the PC market primarily due to market dynamics in China and
lower ASPs reflecting the introduction of our small-screen touch offerings and current period incentive program.
Non-OEM revenue grew 22% driven by sales of Surface, and continued double-digit growth in volume licensing as
businesses across all areas and segments continue to value the Windows platform.
This quarter we saw continued progress in the transition from Windows XP, and today almost three quarters of
enterprise desktops are running Windows 7. Volume licensing of Windows delivered more than $4 billion in revenue
this year.
Next, I'll walk through our Server & Tools business which posted another solid quarter with 9% revenue growth and
double-digit bookings growth. Product revenue grew 9%, driven primarily by growth in premium versions of Windows
Server and SQL Server. Our cloud momentum continues with strong customer adoption, upsell to higher-level services,
and increased innovation. We released a number of Azure services, including mobility, media, and website services,
and a growing number of customers are already using multiple services for their cloud platform needs. We added 25%
more enterprise customers this quarter, and now over 50% of the Fortune 500 are using Windows Azure.
In the data center, Systems Center revenue grew 14% and the premium version of Windows Server continued to see
significant revenue growth. Hyper-V, our virtualization product, continued to gain market share over the past year.
Companies such as Aston Martin and Grant Thornton continue to look to Hyper-V and Systems Center to deliver their
critical business applications.
In the data platform business, SQL Server revenue grew 16% and again outpaced the broader market. Last month we
announced SQL Server 2014, the next version of our data platform, which has in-memory capabilities built right into
the core database. We also announced Power BI for Office 365, a cloud-based BI solution that combines the power of
SQL Server with the familiarity of Office.
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division, where revenue grew 2%. Within that, business revenue grew 7%,
driven by 10% growth in annuity revenue. Consumer revenue declined 27%. Results in our consumer business were
driven by declines in the consumer x86 PC market and the shift to subscription, offset in part by attach gains.
As our customers transition to the new subscription model, there is a short-term impact to revenue due to the changes in
the timing of revenue recognition, but over time we expect our revenue to grow and become more recurring and
predictable. With the subscription model, we are providing greater value to our customers through frequent product
updates, new cloud services and attractive pricing.
We saw strong early adoption of the subscription offering and now have more than 1 million Office 365 Home
Premium subscribers. It's been a big year for Office 365 and as Amy said, it's now on a $1.5 billion annual revenue run
rate. This was our strongest quarter ever, with more net seat adds in the quarter than all of fiscal 2012. We're seeing
strong upsell with one in three Office 365 seats now running premium workloads.
In terms of our Productivity offerings, we continue to see strength with Exchange, SharePoint and Lync, each growing
double digits. Lync revenue grew over 30%, driving our enterprise communication business to deliver more than $1
billion revenue in this fiscal year.
Additionally, we met a key milestone in the Lync and Skype integration and users can now seamlessly communicate in
voice and IM across the two services.
Next, I'll move on to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 9% and operating performance improved by
$107 million or 22%. Online advertising revenue was up 11%, driven by both rate and volume improvements in our
search business.
In the Entertainment & Devices Division, revenue grew 8%. Xbox Live transaction revenue grew nearly 20% and is
providing economic opportunities for publishers in the soft console market. This quarter we announced our
next-generation gaming and entertainment console, Xbox One, and at E3 we showcased an impressive line of games

that will be coming to the new platform.
Progress with Windows Phone continues as our partners, including Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and HTC are delivering
new phones at a broader range of price points. Telefonica also recently announced an enhanced marketing effort to
promote Windows Phone 8 devices. And with the recent Sprint announcement, Windows Phone 8 devices will now be
available on all major U.S. operators.
Now I'll cover the remainder of the income statement. Costs of goods sold increased 14%, principally driven by
Surface and growth in cloud infrastructure. Operating expenses grew 9%, primarily related to sales and marketing for
Surface and Windows 8. This quarter, our CapEx increased as we continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure and
expand our geographic footprint to support the growth in our online businesses. And finally, we returned $2.9 billion to
shareholders in buybacks and dividends.
Now I'll turn the call back to Amy for our outlook.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Chris. Before I discuss our expectations for the first quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing last
week's announcement on One Microsoft.
If you haven't already done so, I encourage you to read our strategy memo and Steve Ballmer's e-mail to employees.
Microsoft is rallying behind a single strategy. As a part of this, we implemented a new organizational structure that will
allow us to advance our strategy more quickly and more efficiently. We are currently in the process of determining
what changes, if any, will be made to our reporting segments.
In late September we will host an analyst event here in Redmond, at which point we will discuss our strategy, our new
organizational structure, and any changes to our reporting segments. We will also give more thoughts on our full year
outlook at that time. Please look for additional details from Chris over the coming weeks.
Now, moving on to our expectations for the first quarter. In Windows, we expect revenue to continue to be negatively
impacted by the decline in the consumer x86 PC market. Excluding the impact of the Windows upgrade offer in the
prior year, OEM revenue should account for approximately 65% of the division's revenue and should decline
mid-teens. Non-OEM revenue should account for approximately 35% of the division's revenue, primarily reflecting
revenue from volume licensing and Surface, including Surface RT at its new price point.
When updating your models, please keep in mind that in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, prior to the launch of Surface,
OEM accounted for 75% of the division's total revenue.
Within Server & Tools, product revenue including transactional and multi-year licensing is about 80% of the division's
total, while enterprise services is the remaining 20%. We expect both product and enterprise services revenue to grow
high-single digits.
In the Microsoft Business Division, we expect business revenue to account for approximately 85% of the division's
total while consumer revenue should account for the remaining 15%. Business revenue should grow mid-single digits,
reflecting low double-digit growth in annuity and the shift from transaction licensing to cloud services.
With the ongoing shift to subscriptions, consumer revenue will lag the x86 consumer PC market by approximately 5%
even as attach continues to grow. This excludes the impact of the Office upgrade offer in the prior year. As a reminder,
business revenue accounted for 80% of total revenue in the prior year.
In the Online Services Division we expect revenue to grow low double digits, reflecting growth of search revenue,
partially offset by lower display revenue.
With the Entertainment & Devices division, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as the industry awaits the
next generation consoles.

For the first quarter, cost of goods sold will reflect Surface as well as the impact of the capital expenditures we made in
fiscal 2013. As a result, COGS should grow over 20%.
Other income and expense includes dividend and interest income, offset by interest expense and the net cost of
hedging. In the current low interest rate environment we expect these items to generally offset.
For the first quarter, regarding CapEx, we expect continued growth in our investments in our global data centers.
Excluding the impact of the Windows and Office upgrade offers, unearned revenue should roughly follow historical
seasonal patterns.
Now, turning briefly to the full fiscal year, we are reducing our operating expense guidance. We now expect fiscal year
2014 operating expenses to be $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion with growth in the low teens for the first quarter. We
expect our tax rate to be between 18% and 21% for the full fiscal year.
In summary, as we look back on the year, fiscal 2013 was a pivotal time for Microsoft. With Windows 8 we increased
our addressable market. Our OEM partners have started capitalizing on the new opportunities, delivering a wide range
of new Windows hardware from phones to tablets to new PCs. We extended our first party devices through Surface and
the announcement of Xbox One. We modernized productivity with Office 365, changing our business model. For the
first time, both businesses and consumers can now access Office through subscription. We took share from key
competitors in key enterprise markets.
We added several new features, including infrastructure as a service capabilities for Windows Azure. With Azure, we
are fundamentally changing the way businesses manage their IT infrastructure, and we continued the expansion of our
datacenter footprint, which enables us to deliver high value services and experiences globally.
As we look to fiscal 2014, we're focused on a single strategy. With our new organizational structure, we believe we'll
be able to execute more quickly and more efficiently, driving long-term growth, profitability and shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it back to Chris, and we'll take some questions.
Chris Suh
Thanks Amy. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible, so please just stick to one question.
Operator, please go ahead and repeat your instructions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We do have a first question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Thanks, Amy. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about – you talked about COGS in
Q1 and you don't mention COGS for the rest of the year. Obviously you have Xbox One launching in the second
quarter. Could you give us some guidance about how we should think about that product having an impact on margins,
maybe comparing it to the 360? Or anything else you could do to help us directionally with the COGS impact beyond
Q1?
<A - Amy Hood>: Yeah. As we transition to a device and services company, I think you should keep in mind that we
expect CapEx to continue to grow as we ramp our business. Specifically, to Xbox One and the new generation of
consoles and launches, I think you should think about that as you think about all console lifecycles. And so keep that in
mind as you model COGS and seasonality throughout the year.
<A - Chris Suh>: Okay. Thanks, Walter. Next question please.

Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. Can you give us some color on the short term revenue impact of the move to
the cloud? Is it just MBD? Is it also in Server & Tools? How does the license revenue convert to cloud revenue?
<A - Amy Hood>: Mark, thanks for that question. It is primarily in MBD where we had a higher percentage of our
revenue but that was accounted for transactionally both on the business side and in the consumer side. So I think that's
why you've seen us in our outlook for Q1 try to start to explain that transition to consumer by saying that we expect it
to lag the PC market by approximately 5 percentage points while attach increases.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Is there a similar lag on the transactional side on the enterprise?
<A - Amy Hood>: Yes. You can see it when we gave the guidance for the business segment. We said 10% growth in
the annuity and so that would clearly say that part of that is a transactional move from recognized up-front revenue to
multi-year licensing agreements.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Mark. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi, yes. Just a follow-up on actually both of those two. First Amy, obviously when you go
to a subscription model, you have less up-front, kind of lower billings that first year versus license. I wonder if you can
give us sort of a back-fill where $1 of cloud or Office 365 revenue would have been, in that first year would have been
$3, relative to license just so we can try to back-fill and help with that transition.
And also actually to Walter's question about Xbox COGS, maybe give us a sense for if this cycle really should be any
different than previous cycles when you thought about pricing relative to the cost of the console itself. Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Yes. I'll try to remember both those questions. Let me take the second one, because it's the most
recent in my mind. I would not think about this console cycle as being any different from prior cycles.
So let me go back to the first question, which is, can I give an example, I believe, of how to think about the transition
from how we used to recognize revenue when we bought something up-front transactionally versus buying a
subscription from us. I'll give an example.
If you used to buy a license from us as a consumer and paid us, for example, $100 for (25:54) ease of mass [ph], we
recognized $100 in the period in which it was purchased. Now, if that same person went and bought Office 365 Home
Premium, and once it was activated, we would recognize the revenue over the period of the purchase, which is 12
months, and recognize it ratably.
<A - Chris Suh>: Yes. Thanks. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. I was wondering focusing on the Server &
Tools Division, you guys came in with high single-digit growth versus the guidance of low double-digit growth. I was
hoping you could walk us through some of the elements that perhaps transpired during the quarter that caused that gap,
why you came in slightly below expectations there, and to what extent was the shift toward subscriptions a part of that?

<A - Amy Hood>: Let me start by saying, Server & Tools had a very good quarter. We continue to win share in
virtualization with SQL Server and continue to grow faster than both Oracle and IBM. Revenue did grow 9%, but
importantly, far outpaced the underlying hardware market. And over the period of the quarter we did see the hardware
market fundamentally come in a bit lower than we had expected.
<Q - Keith Weiss>: Okay.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great. Thanks, Keith. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much. Amy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the
incentive pricing you've been doing. Not just on your own devices, like Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, but
also in the OEM market. And if you haven't done incentive pricing at the OEM level, is there a chance we could see
this strategy going forward as a way to help lower the price points of consumer PCs and then hence trying to spur
demand? Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Heather. I think it's a great question. I do think that we should think about incentives and
all of our programs including a small screen touch SKU that we've launched as a way to increase the breadth of our
Windows devices available across all price points.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, Heather. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Your line is now open.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thanks. I wonder if you have any perspective for us on – you've got Intel's Haswell chip
shipping now, 8.1 coming in probably October. Are you sensing that OEMs are trying to manage inventories down for
the time being and waiting cautiously? Intel suggested that maybe you're seeing some inventory liquidation, so I
wonder if you could just give us a sense for what you're hearing from the OEMs?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Rick. I think, like the rest of the ecosystem, we are excited by the advances Intel's made
with the fourth generation core processor, and we're also looking forward the next Atom chip. But with launch a little
less than a month ago, I think it's a little bit too early for me to say. We'll have to wait and see how the quarter plays
out.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, Rick. Next question please.
Operator
Our next question comes to us from Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Amy, on the expenses you're revising next year down and it looks like your expense growth will
materially slow from what it was this year. I'm just curious if you could just help us understand where that's coming
from and how you're thinking about that for next year.
<A - Amy Hood>: Well, actually, I think this is – I feel good because I think in some ways, the reorg we announced
last week, along with our increased focus on our new single strategy, has allowed us to really look and say, what are the
things we're going to put behind and focus on to improve our execution. And so I feel quite good about our ability to do
that. And you've heard us say before, many of the reasons we did this reorg are about doing things better and more

Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA. Your line is now open.
<Q - Edward E. Maguire>: Hi. Good afternoon. Amy, you had discussed your increased CapEx this quarter, and I
was wondering if you could address the margin profile of your cloud services. In the comments you discussed how you
have higher data center costs, and what I'd like to understand is whether this is temporary as you're ramping up this
transition towards subscription business, or whether this actually changes the gross margin profile of these revenues?
Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Ed. That's good question. As we transition to a device and services company, that is a
multi-year commitment to evolve our business and you should expect that CapEx will continue to grow as we ramp that
business. With the expansion of Azure service offerings and the continued momentum in Office 365 as well as our
consumer services, investing in this global footprint to meet customer demand is incredibly important and quite
strategic. And really the question is, our ability to scale smartly, and that will create an advantage for us that we can
pass along to our customers. And so I look forward to being able to move these data centers globally to reach more
people with more services.
<A - Chris Suh>: Okay. Thanks, Ed. Operator, next question, please.

Our next question comes to us from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. Amy, your CapEx this quarter was about $700 million or greater than $700
million, greater than you guided just 90 days ago. Why was there such a sudden change? I know Chris, I think,
explained why it was high – higher, and why it's going to be higher going forward. But why was it such a sudden
change so dramatically just in this quarter? And will this planned increase going forward affect your ability to do things
like buy back shares?
<A - Amy Hood>: Our – in Q4, really as we continued to add Azure services – in fact we added over 80 this quarter,
and with the increased demand of Office 365 and the $1.5 billion annual run rate, up from just $1 billion in Q3, I would
think about that as our ability to increase demand and meet demand globally with our services and so, doing that in Q4
was important because you want to be ahead of demand there.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: So was that something that was unexpected? You just had higher demand in Q4?
<A - Amy Hood>: We're accelerating.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Okay, okay. Will this affect your ability to buy back shares going forward, this increase in
CapEx?
<A - Amy Hood>: No. I mean, our cash – we returned $2.9 billion this quarter and over $12 billion for the year, and
we'll continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation with those investment acquisitions where they make
sense and return of capital to shareholders.
<A - Chris Suh>: Okay. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much, Amy. Congrats on your first conference call as CFO. My
question had to do with the Windows side of the business. I know that you had a impairment charge for the inventory
clearance, but even if I add that back in, it looks like the operating margins in the Windows business were sequentially
lower quite materially. I just wanted to get some insights into what drove that from the March quarter into the June
quarter. And as you look further out into the operating margins of the Windows business, given that you're going to be
focusing on Surface, how should we think about the margin structure? I guess you have a volume threshold to clear
before you can start to make a margin, given that it's more of a product. But, really two parts to that question. Would
love to get your insights. Thank you so much.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Kash. Let me address what I think were the two components. The first component felt like
a general question about margins this quarter for Windows. As you said, they were impacted by Surface. And the
second one is by the marketing investment we continue to make in the ecosystem to move it forward. Overall, I think as
you think about the Windows Division as we report it, obviously since there is a mix between hardware and software,
you should continue to expect margins to reflect that mix.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, Kash. Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Thanks a lot. Amy, I just wanted to drill into the billings growth, where we adjust for the
unearned. And it's a lot higher for the Server & Tools business, which is obviously going through a transition towards
more subscription arrangements. A lot higher there than in the MBD segment. I'm just wondering if you can compare
and contrast why that might be? I understand the consumer piece in MBD, but is the other piece of this just that there
are more traditional licensing arrangements in MBD with enterprise customers and so the impact from the transition is
all the greater, and that's why you see that more subdued billings growth rate in MBD? Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Ross, thank you. It's always terrific when someone answers their own question. You actually have it
exactly correct.
<Q - Ross MacMillan>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks. Thanks, Ross. Next question please.

The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.
<Q - Gregg S. Moskowitz>: Thank you very much and good afternoon. Just a follow-on a bit on Kash's question. With
Windows revenue coming in where it did, we're getting a few questions from investors about how Windows fared this
quarter relative to PC units. If we were to exclude tablet revenues, both Surface and otherwise, just wondering, Amy, if
you might be able to say roughly on a year-over-year basis how Windows PC revenue compared to the low
double-digit PC unit decline cited by the IDCs and Gartners?
<A - Amy Hood>: Chris actually covered that a bit in his comments, but let me reiterate, because I do understand the
question, I think, which is related to our OEM revenue of 15%, down 15%. It was related, I believe to China, lower
ASPs on the small screen SKU that we mentioned as well as some of the incentive programs that we had in place
during the quarter.
<Q - Gregg S. Moskowitz>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thank you, and Amy, welcome on the first earnings call. I had a question on the business PC
side. That sort of was an area of strength for the business division, and you saw some growth there. Can you talk a little
bit about if you see that as a sustainable number or is that still driven by the end of life for Windows XP? Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Yeah, as we mentioned our Windows business did make incremental progress in the business side.
We expect that to continue in Q1. And with the end of life of Windows XP next year, we expect continued migrations.
And today in the enterprise about three quarters of desktops are already running Windows 7.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Good. Thank you. Next question please, operator.

All right. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brendan J. Barnicle>: Thanks so much. Amy, contracted but unbilled was down sequentially from Q3, the first
time we'd seen that in the last two years. What's attributing to that shift?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thank you. Actually, I think our strong annuity growth as well as our record unearned balance I do
believe supports our belief it's a strong performance of our multiyear license agreements is in place.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, operator. I think we have time for one more.

Okay. The next question's going to come from Karl Keirstead with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a question about the mix shift to multiyear licensing across
Microsoft that's been a big part of the story. It's been up about 5% points year-over-year each quarter in fiscal 2013.
Amy, I'm just wondering as we look forward to fiscal 2014, can we expect it to increase at that clip? Or is the software
assurance attach rate now getting high enough that that mix shift should start to moderate?
<A - Amy Hood>: We've – I continue to believe we'll have double-digit annuity growth next year. So I think that shift
you've seen, especially as we continue to move people to our Cloud Services, will continue.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Okay. Thanks.
Chris Suh
Thank you, Karl. Okay. So that will wrap up our Q&A portion of today's earnings call. We look forward to seeing
many of you in the coming months at various investor conferences and at our Financial Analyst Meeting to be held in
late September, where we'll share more details about our long-term strategies, new organizational structure and outlook
for the rest of the fiscal year. Thank you again for joining us today.
