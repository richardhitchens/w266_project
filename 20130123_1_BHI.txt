MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello. My name is Dawn, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to
Baker Hughes' Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Trey Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Dawn. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Baker Hughes' fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference
call. Here with me today is our President and CEO, Martin Craighead and Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation and the news release that was issued earlier today can be found on our
website at bakerhughes.com. Additional reconciliation of operating profit and non-GAAP measures to GAAP results
for historic periods can also be found in our website in the Investor Relations section under Supplemental Financial
Information.
During today's presentation, I must caution you that any company outlooks discussed this morning are subject to
various risk factors. We'll try to highlight these risk factors as we make these forward-looking statements. However, the
format of the call prevents a more thorough discussion of these risk factors. For a full review of these risk factors,
please refer to the Baker Hughes' SEC filings, and in particular, the forward-looking disclosure in this morning's news
release.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Martin Craighead. Martin?

Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Trey and good morning. This morning, Baker Hughes reported record annual revenue of $20.9 billion,
including an 11% increase in our international segments, and a 5% increase in our North America segment. Much of
this growth can be attributed to the new products and services we brought to the market, especially in the deepwater
and unconventional plays, as well as solid operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and our international
businesses in Europe, Africa, Russia, and the Middle East.
In North America, we experienced challenging market conditions for most of the year, including the oversupply of
pressure pumping capacity and activity levels in Canada that were below expectations. Later in the call, I'll provide
more detail on these markets.
In the near term, we're focused on improving the quality of earnings by positioning Baker Hughes as the partner of
choice in a business environment where customers are pressured to reduce their finding and development costs, but also
improve their ultimate recoveries, even as they expand into harsher and more challenging frontiers. In these market
conditions, customers turn to those companies that can deliver differentiating products and technology.
Products like our FracPoint sliding sleeve system and our Steerable Drilling Liner technology, and of course, our
AutoTrak Curve Rotary Steerable System which just hit another impressive milestone by passing 3 million feet drilled
in the U.S. alone since being launched less than two years ago. These products differentiate and they're becoming
increasingly important to our customer and our own income statement. That's why we continue to increase our
investment in technology and new product development and accelerate the commercialization of new products.
I'll speak to these items more in a few minutes. But first, I'll turn the call over to Peter to give more detail on the quarter
and full year's results. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thank you, Martin, and good morning. Before I start the review of our financial results, I'd first like to remind
everyone of last quarter's announcement pertaining to our process in pipeline services business. This business was
reclassified to discontinued operations in our financial statements in our prior periods were restated. For purposes of
today's call, I'll only be discussing financial results from continuing operations.
This morning, we reported income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of $211 million or $0.48 per share.
This includes a $63 million or $0.14 per share reserve for bad debt in Latin America. Excluding this reserve, income
from continuing operations would have been $274 million or $0.62 per share.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $5.2 billion, which is flat compared to the previous quarter, as deteriorating market
conditions in North America were offset by record revenues in all of our international segments.
EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $841 million, down 2% sequentially including the additional bad debt reserve in
Latin America.
As Martin highlighted we posted record revenue of $20.9 billion for the year, which is up approximately 8% or $1.5
billion from the prior year. This was a result of strong growth in every region of the world, with the exception of
Canada which experienced a 13% reduction in market activity.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $3.7 billion and adjusted income from continuing operations was $1.32 billion, or
$3 per share. On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the year was $1.28 billion or $2.90 per share.
To help in your understanding of the quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
third quarter, we posted earnings from continuing operations of $0.60 per share. First add back $0.10 from previously
identified items in the third quarter. That brings us to a third quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $0.70.

Next, add back $0.06 for bad debt reserves recognized in Latin America and Europe in the third quarter. Subtract $0.14
for North America operations due to a sharp decline in activity towards the end of the fourth quarter, and further
erosion of pressured pumping pricing. Add $0.08 for international operations primarily due to share gains, increased
activity and year-end product sales in our international regions. Subtract $0.02 for higher corporate costs and interest
expense. And subtract $0.06 for higher effective tax rate, primarily due to a change in our geographical mix of
earnings. At this point, our operational earnings per share would have been $0.62. However, due to additional reserves
in Latin America, we subtract another $0.14. That brings us to $0.48 per share.
In table five of our earnings release, we've provided adjusted financial information, including the impact of identified
adjusting items on each region's results in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the third quarter of 2012. At this point on in
the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit, and operating profit margin refer explicitly to table
five, unless otherwise stated.
Revenue in North America was $2.6 billion, down $183 million or 7% sequentially. North America operating profit
was $222 million, down $99 million sequentially. As a result, North America operating profit margin was 8.7%, in line
with recent guidance.
Our North America operational performance can be summarized into four main points. First, in the U.S. and Canada,
the pressure pumping product line continue to face margin pressure with further pricing degradation. These unfavorable
price conditions were partially offset by sequential reduction in our core costs and continued improvements in our
efficiency.
Second, some of our other U.S. product lines experienced a reduction in activity as rig counts declined sharply towards
the end of the quarter, due to customers shutting down early for the holiday period. However, activity levels for our
production product lines remained strong with Upstream Chemicals and Artificial Lift posting near-record revenues
and profits during the quarter.
Third, in Canada, our operations were also significantly impacted by one major customer who shut down all of their
Canadian drilling and completion operations during the quarter. And fourth, the Gulf of Mexico continued to perform
well as deepwater activity levels continued to increase.
Moving to international results, each of our international segments experienced increased activity and posted record
revenue in the fourth quarter. In aggregate, revenue was $2.5 billion, up $178 million or 8% versus the prior quarter,
and up $195 million or 9% compared to a year ago. International operating profit was $261 million, up $13 million
sequentially, including the reserve in Latin America of $63 million, previously highlighted.
Excluding these reserves in the third and fourth quarters, international operating profit was up $47 million sequentially.
Reported international operating profit margin was 10.6%, down 20 basis points sequentially. Excluding the impact of
bad debt in Latin America, international operating profit margins would have been 13.1%. This is an increase of 110
basis points sequentially and modestly higher than recent guidance.
Focusing on each of our international segments, our Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian segment delivered the highest
revenue, operating profit, and operating profit margin in the last three years. Sequentially, revenue increased $84
million or 10%, with operating profits improving $52 million, excluding the $6 million reserve for bad debt in Europe
in Q3. Operating profit margins were 18.2% in the fourth quarter.
Revenue and profit increase is primarily associated with strong activity in year-end product sales in Africa and Russia.
Activity gains in Continental Europe were partially offset by rig delays in Norway early in the quarter.
Turning to the Middle East/Asia Pacific segment, we also saw sequential revenue growth, increasing $38 million,
primarily due to increased activity in Iraq, the Arabian Gulf, and Australia. Operating profit, however, was flat
sequentially as a result of continued start-up and logistics cost in Iraq, along with frac fleet mobilization cost in Saudi
Arabia to support upcoming unconventional work.
And in our Latin America segment, we achieved sequential revenue improvement of $56 million or 10%. This increase
is primarily due to the year-end product sales and activity improvements in the Andean region and Mexico, offset by

reductions in Brazil as the active rig count there declined 10%. Excluding the impact of bad debt in Q3 and Q4,
operating profits decreased $3 million to an overall operating profit margin of 11.1%.
For our Industrial Services segment, which now exclude their Process and Pipeline Services business, revenue was
$191 million, down $2 million sequentially, and the operating profit was $21 million, up $6 million sequentially.
Operating profit margins were 11% in the fourth quarter, increased profits were primarily due to a mix of sales with
good performance from our Downstream Chemicals Group.
Turning to the balance sheet. For the quarter, we were free cash flow positive. During the quarter, we reduced
receivables in each of our oilfield operating segments, resulting in a net accounts receivable decrease of $283 million.
This translates into a five-day reduction in our days sales outstanding. At the same time, we also reduced our
inventories by $108 million from the prior quarter.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $714 million, resulting in a total of $2.9 billion for 2012. A positive cash flow
was used to pay down short-term debt. Total debt was $4.9 billion, down $229 million from the prior quarter. As a
result, our total debt-to-capital ratio declined 1 percentage point to 22%. We ended the quarter with a balance of $1
billion in cash.
Now, let me provide you with our guidance for 2013 starting with rig counts. For North America, we project the
average annual rig count will decline by 5% or 125 rigs compared to 2012. In the U.S., relative to the fourth quarter
2012 exit rate, 1,763 rigs, we anticipate that the rig count will be flat during the first quarter of 2013 and then modestly
rebound throughout the remainder of the year to a final 2013 exit rate of 1,880 rigs, comprised of approximately 1,420
oil rigs and 460 gas rigs. On average, compared to 2012, we expect the annual U.S. rig count to decline by 5% this
year.
U.S. rig count includes offshore rigs which are expected to increase 8% to 52 rigs in 2013. This includes an increase of
four deepwater rigs compared to 2012.
In Canada, the first quarter rig count is projected to sequentially improve 38% to 511 average rigs. This would be 13%
below the average from the first quarter of 2012. Canadian rig counts in the second half of the year currently forecast to
be similar to the second half of 2012, resulting in an average annual rig count decline of 8% in 2013.
Looking internationally, the average rig count is anticipated to grow to 1,383 rigs in 2013 led by Latin America, the
Middle East and Asia Pacific. Excluding Iraq, this would represent a 7% increase in the international rig count.
Our international revenue and margins are expected to improve in 2013; however, these typically drop in the first
quarter due to seasonally lower product sales and weather disruptions.
For the year, solid revenue and margin growth is anticipated in our Eastern Hemisphere operations.
The Middle East/Asia Pacific segment should see the most significant growth as we continue to build our integrated
operations in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. And recent share gains in the North Sea and the East Coast of Africa will drive
growth in our Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian segment.
In Latin America, our activity is expected to increase in Mexico, Argentina, and the Andean region, partially offsetting
reductions in Brazil, which are expected to occur in the middle of the year.
For the year, Industrial Services activity should remain stable with margins ranging between 10% and 12%. Since
Industrial Services no longer includes the Process and Pipeline Services Group, we expect much less seasonality.
Looking at interest expense, we expect it to be between $210 million and $220 million for the full year. Corporate costs
are expected to be between $280 million and $290 million, which is a reduction of $10 million to $20 million compared
to last year. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be about $2 billion, which is a reduction of approximately 30%
year-over-year or $900 million. We are reducing our spend in pressure pumping horsepower and infrastructure
significantly. Our rental tool spend is expected to be flat year-on-year. Total CapEx will be allocated approximately

35% to North America operations and 45% to international operations. The balance will support our Global Products
and Services Group, IT and other corporate functions. And finally, our annual tax rate is expected to be between 32%
and 33%.
At this point, I'll now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter. I'd like to provide an overall update and outlook on the business starting with North America. At current
commodity prices, we expect activity to remain stable this year as our customers keep a cautious outlook. We predicted
the average North American rig count will be down compared to last year. However, this decline will be partially offset
by continued gains in rig efficiencies that can be attributed to increased pad drilling, a more modernized rig fleet, and a
continued absorption of new drilling completions and production technologies that we are bringing to the market.
On the last earnings call, we reported that rig efficiencies in the U.S. have improved about 15% during 2012. This year
we project roughly another 10% increase in wells per rig compared to 2012. In addition to rig efficiencies, our
customers will focus increasingly on production enhancement. For example, in the past, the drilling and completion
design of a well was defined by the reservoir, while artificial lift consideration was usually dealt with years later.
Today, Baker Hughes is working with U.S. customers to engineer artificial lift solutions during the well planning
stages. By planning for production enhancement techniques upfront, we're helping our customers improve ultimate
recovery.
Now I'd like to comment on some of the various operations in North America. First to Canada, which is a meaningful
part of our North American business. Many of our customers continue to deal with constrained cash flows from low
natural gas prices and an abundance of projects that are marginally profitable. Higher U.S. shale oil production coupled
with decreasing consumption and limited refining and pipeline capacity is increasing differentials for heavy oil close to
$40 a barrel.
Considering that break-even prices for new heavy oil projects can be as high as $65 a barrel, we believe that some of
these projects in Canada are at near-term risk. Given this, Canadian customers are focused squarely on conserving cash
and increasing returns on capital. And until industry fundamentals change and the biggest driver to that is improvement
in takeaway capacity, Canadian activity will remain challenged.
As you would expect, we're adjusting our 2013 plans to mirror the projected activity levels. Now, these cycles are
nothing new in Canada and once again, value-adding technologies which can lower an AFE or increase production
rates are critical to our customers. Some of our technologies that are instrumental to this include the Talon and Kymera
drill bits, rotary steerable systems, resistivity imaging services, steam additives for SAGD applications and next
generation OptiPort and FracPoint completion tools.
As for the pressure pumping market, based on our estimates, the U.S. market has about 20% to 25% too much
horsepower which translates into at least 125 fleets across the sector that are currently idle or underutilized in some
capacity.
All else being equal, the U.S. would need at least 300 additional drilling rigs to come back online in order to get those
idle fleets fully up and utilized. Of course, any increase in drilling activity will improve fleet utilization.
As we've discussed in previous calls, Baker Hughes began overhauling this very important product line a year ago. At
the beginning of 2012, about 20% of our fleets were working 24-hour shifts. Today I'm pleased to say that we've nearly
doubled that.
We've lowered cost by improving our supply chain and moving our infrastructure closer to the centers of activity. In
fact, we opened six new facilities last year. We invented and then rapidly commercialized alternatives to guar in order
to offset the cost and volatility of that particular commodity.

Our newest products MaxPerm and CLEARSTAR are replacing as much as 20% of our total guar consumption today.
And we've introduced new biofuel engines that leverage technology to drive efficiency and bring environmental gains.
Most importantly, we're winning the right kind of work with the right customers and I expect further improvements in
all these areas through 2013.
In addition to these important actions, technology and product integration are key value enhancers for our customers
and for Baker Hughes. As an example, our Reservoir Solutions team in the U.S. are working directly with customers to
optimize frac designs. Using advanced formation evaluation from Baker Hughes' wireline services, these teams are able
to identify the most productive zones in the well. In one particular case, we proposed a non-geometric completion
design resulting in fewer stages than the geometric design deployed on several other wells. This particular result was
outstanding and the customer realized increased production and a significant cost reduction. This is a great example of
how we are winning work by providing more than just stages through integrated solutions to our customers.
Another example of our initiative to improve the economies of shale is our recently-announced collaboration with
CGGVeritas. We are working together to integrate their geophysical capabilities with our petrophysical and
geomechanical expertise to significantly improve operator economics in shale and tight plays. And we're confident this
collaboration has the potential to expand our capabilities around full-field development.
Our Gulf of Mexico operations continue to perform exceptionally well. Activity is increasing, our share is improving,
and we are being rewarded for game-changing technologies such as advanced wireline formation sampling, Kymera
drill bits, and next-generation completion systems. The growing mix of development work will continue to benefit
Baker Hughes' sizeable completions business.
Let me share a recent example of this. After two years of research, an integrated engineering team from our pressure
pumping and completion systems product lines successfully designed and deployed a next-generation multi-zone single
trip frac system for a customer operating in the Lower Tertiary. This new system allows for multiple fracs during a
single trip in these HPHT environments and was installed 50% faster when compared to traditional techniques.
In addition to the engineering achievement, the operational execution was flawless and we set an industry record for
installation depth for this type of a system. And as a result, this customer has ordered additional systems for the Gulf of
Mexico and the system is also on order for West Africa and Asia Pacific.
Now, turning to our international business. In Norway, we rapidly mobilized resources during the quarter to begin
executing on our new contract. Clearly, this is a huge market and we're pleased to enter the new year as the leading
provider of drilling services in this technically-challenging offshore environment.
Also last quarter, we successfully deployed a steerable drilling liner system in the North Sea that integrates our rotary
steerables technology with our proven liner hanger systems by pulling the liner behind the bottom hole assembly while
drilling. This saves our customer a couple of days of completions' time, but it also enables them to tap reserves and
under-pressured mature fields without the risk of lost circulation. This product will differentiate in environments where
wellbore stability issues previously impeded our customers' ability to reach deeper reservoirs.
In addition, we began work on a new development project in the Barents Sea. A delineation well was drilled in the
fourth quarter and we are now embarking on drilling the second well of a 22-well program providing drilling services
and completion systems. Logistics, maintenance, and basic support for our growing business in the Norwegian Arctic
will be provided out of our new facility in Hammerfest.
In Africa, we've opened a new facility in Mozambique in order to support recent contract awards there, and these share
gains in East Africa will position Baker Hughes as the leading supplier of drilling services for this growing region.
In Latin America, we were awarded a major contract in Brazil to provide integrated services for a deepwater
exploration campaign in the Santos Basin. Baker Hughes will provide drilling, evaluation, completion, pressure
pumping, and artificial lift technologies and services.
In Asia Pacific, we were awarded a series of well construction contracts during the quarter, including awards for
drilling services in Indonesia, and the Cooper Basin of Australia. We also secured a direct award for multiple

deepwater exploration wells in the South China Sea, and this represents a major expansion of our position in the
Chinese offshore market. We're also continuing to grow and refine our integrated operations business in the Middle
East.
During the fourth quarter, we mobilized multiple rigs in Saudi Arabia to support our new operations in Shaybah. We
also added rigs in Iraq and exited the year with seven operational rigs and intend to mobilize two additional rigs this
quarter. We expect to see profitability improve in Iraq as we progress in 2013. This will be the result of reduced
logistics costs and improved operating efficiency. We do not expect Iraq to be accretive to our Middle East margins this
year, due to the higher percentage of past due revenue associated with this type of work, but we do expect Iraq to
contribute to earnings in the second half of this year.
As we've said before, our establishment of our strong foothold in one of the world's key hydrocarbon-producing regions
is of strategic importance, and I remain confident in our ability to execute and improve our financial performance there.
Now, let me provide some final thoughts on the year ahead. While we see a reduction in North America on-shore spend
led by continued weakness and pressure pumping pricing, it would be more than offset by growth in the Gulf of
Mexico and international markets. And what I like about that is that half of that increased spend will be in drilling and
completions product lines.
The task of finding an efficiently-producing oil and gas is not getting any easier for our customers. We all know that –
about the challenges of maximizing recovery from deepwater reservoirs and while much has been said and written on
the abundance and real potential of unconventional reservoirs, the fact remains that these reservoirs present their own
unique set of challenges for our customers, ranging from environmental to economic to operational.
Harvesting both unconventional and deepwater opportunities in the future will require customers to leverage a portfolio
of leading-edge products and services and basin-specific expertise from their service providers. And given Baker
Hughes' reputation for innovation, product design, service excellence, and service integration, we are very well
positioned to help customers most effectively monetize their reservoir assets.
And to that end, first, we remain committed to leading in technology and innovation, which is why we will increase our
investment in R&D in 2013. Second, we will grow our expertise in reservoir development and integrated operations
around the world. And third, we will expand our core service offering to include critical capabilities and emerging
technologies. And finally, we continue to remain firmly committed to improving both our return on capital and the
quality of earnings.
Before we open it up for questions, on behalf of Baker Hughes, let me offer my condolences to the families around the
world who have lost loved ones in the tragedy in Algeria. Many of these individuals were customers and colleagues.
Baker Hughes do not have any employees at that facility, and our thoughts are with those who have been impacted by
this tragic event.
And with that, Trey, let's go ahead and open up for some questions.
Trey Clark

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James C. West>: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning to you, James.
<Q - James C. West>: Martin, in your comments – your prepared comments, a lot of commentary around North
America, also in Peter's comments as well. Some of it, I guess, negative; some of it, Baker Hughes-specific positive. As
we think about an environment where you are introducing new technologies, you are getting an improving customer
mix, you do see the Gulf of Mexico being a good driver of growth, yet U.S. land rig count down, maybe completions
are up in that scenario; still pricing challenges and pricing weakness spreading out. How should we think about margin
progression, kind of off of this fourth quarter level? Is that below? Are we stuck in this kind of single-digit range or
simply going to bounce back off? This is because of the year and some of the positives in your mix and your business
come through.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Well, this is Peter. I'll answer first, maybe Martin can supplement that. But we think the
GOM is going to progress nicely. We've got good share positions there. We've had the 30% increase in revenues last
year and that – and revenue should continue to move forward in the GOM.
Canada of course bounces around with seasonality, should be up in Q1, should be down sharply in Q2, and second half
looks like second half of last year. So, that leaves you with two other variables which are the pressure pumping
business in U.S. land and our other product lines in U.S. land, and our other product lines seem to be holding up in the
U.S. land; haven't had much pricing pressure there yet, so that's been pretty good. And we expect the rig count to
continue to improve throughout the year. So, those product lines right now look like they're pretty stable and pretty
good.
And I think the big variable is what happened in pressure pumping, whether or not pricing continues to decline and
outpaces our cost savings. We are expecting guar cost to improve further into Q1 and they did improve in Q4, so that's
good. But pricing has been pretty much eating up those savings in recent quarters. So, that's the big volatility and we're
not going to try to make a call on that right now.
<Q - James C. West>: Okay. So Peter, do you think that given that the rig count – you do expect the rig count to
improve that you're greater than, I guess, your peers' exposure to the spot market for pressure pumping. Is that would be
a net positive or is that a net negative for you?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, James, this is Martin.
<Q - James C. West>: I know it's a tough question.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, we do expect the – as Peter said, the rig count to improve from here on out slightly,
more towards the back half of the year than the early part. And – but on a year-on-year average, it's down. And in terms
of the pricing, we have been and continue to be probably still a little bit more exposed to the spot market. And that
price environment is continuing to weaken, it's not – I don't think it's found bottom yet. I think it's a tough thing to call.
The flip side of that is we're – I don't think we have as much price decline opportunity versus, let's say, an operator or a
service company that's got still a more of a contract mix. So, with the year-on-year decline in the rigs, a little bit more
pricing, softness in that particular product line, it's – as Peter said, it's a little difficult to say exactly where it's going to
end up.

<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you, good morning. Martin, with regards to your international commentary here, it
sounds like EAC and MEAP up or expected to be up reasonably nicely in 2013 and Latin America, probably down
year-over-year. If I heard you correctly, you said, Andean Mexico, everything but Brazil only partially offsets the
declines in Brazil. So when you – how does that distill into an overall international top line growth rate for 2013? Is it
high single-digits with kind of EAC and the Middle East/Asia Pacific, up maybe high single, low double and Latin
America down low single? Is that about right?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. I'd say that's pretty reasonable, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And then we didn't talk much about margins. You were flat year-over-year in 2012.
Historically, we've talked about kind of the current environment, which is mostly sort of volume metric-driven, very
selective pricing and hopefully some mixed opportunities as well distilling into, call it, 20% to 25% incremental margin
environment internationally. Is that what we should assume for 2013?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. It might be a bit better than that, but I think that's a reasonable number from here
on now.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And last one from me, Peter, year-end product sales, I think Q4 2011 we witnessed
kind of a $15 million contribution quarter-on-quarter, was that roughly in the ballpark for this fourth quarter or was it a
bit better than that?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: In terms of contribution margin?
<Q - William A. Herbert>: No, no, no, in terms of top line fourth quarter versus third quarter?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: No, it was...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Better than that.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It was better than. I would say, much of the sequential improvement in revenues
internationally was year-end product sales and it's pretty much spread across the three regions. Pretty strong, I think
we've said in our remarks in Africa and Russia, strong in Asia Pacific, and strong in Latin America. So therefore, we
would expect that to reverse out into Q1.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Sure. So are the $178 million revenue improvement quarter-on-quarter, call it, at least
50% of that was year-end product sales on pretty high incrementals?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, more than 50%.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: That's a great summary, thanks. I wanted to – I want to focus my question on the international
front and just get a little color for first, what kind of drag on margins has Iraq been? If you could put that in the context
in terms of basis points, that'd be great, and then give us some indication – and that will give us some indication on
what we can expect for a tailwind as we go into the second half of the year, specifically in the Middle East – as it

relates to Middle East, Asia margin?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Kurt, this is Martin. I'm not going to get into specific on the basis point impact. I can tell
you that, obviously, it's still a drag on the margin as we said it's going to continue to be. We're still experiencing some
issues with regards to the mobilization and the start-up there. A lot of those issues, frankly, are just on the learning
curve, but a lot them continue to be associated with the difficulty in the lack of transparency with regards to
institutional responsibilities and bureaucracy and so forth.
Now, I'll tell you this that a lot of the issues that we have control over are improving pretty rapidly, and that's being
driven by, again, moving up the learning curve. And on the other hand, some of the issues, I think, you're not just
hearing it from us with regards to operating there, it's still challenged.
But I'll tell you that, as I said, we finished with seven rigs there. We should probably be mobilizing two to three more
rigs in this quarter. And we expect it will be providing additional EPS for the Middle East region. So, that's the outlook
right now.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And Kurt, let me add, we expect our Middle East/Asia Pacific region to sort of grow the most
in terms of revenues and grow the most in terms of margin. And much of that is driven by Iraq for the revenue
improvement and very high incrementals from here. And so and that plays in. And of course, Saudi also plays into that
Middle East equation too. So, let's not forget about Saudi, but Iraq and Saudi, we expect to drive very handsome returns
by the end of the year.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. I appreciate that additional color, Peter. Maybe as a follow-up question, similar process,
kind of different product line, you mentioned that you had some benefit of the guar rolling off the high cost situation
through your P&L. And then, you had pricing kind of eat away at that. Can we just kind of focus on the guar – can you
remind us what you expected to recapture in a gross number from the guar inventory roll off?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I can't because we never specified the number. But it's a couple of hundred basis points
certainly of margin.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So, that'd be from your high point to – once all the inventory rolls off? Is that the way to look?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, that's probably quarter-to-quarter, so that's – it's even greater than that, if you think
about high point to low point.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And Peter, just would that be like 400 basis points, 500 basis points in aggregate?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I'm talking about that particular product line. I'm not talking about North America margins
generally.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Yeah, yeah, I'm focusing on guar too. So, would that kind of be the order of magnitude?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: That's a little high. But, yeah, it would be that order of magnitude from high to low.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. All right. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.

<Q - Michael Urban>: I wanted to stick with pressure pumping for a second. Given some of the things that you've
done over the course of the last year specific to the Baker Hughes improving supply chain logistics 24-hour operations,
you've given us a pretty good path or outlook here for North America and the U.S. But on an apples-to-apples basis, as

that market progresses and hopefully improves at any given level of market demand and pricing, would you expect
Baker Hughes margin to be higher?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Urban>: And, I mean, have you talked about – you talked about kind of how much it was hurting you at
one point, at various points, over the last year. I mean, do you have an estimate of roughly what that difference would
be whether that's in basis points of margin or absolute cost or whatever the case may be?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, Mike, I can't – I don't want to quantify by product line in a specific region. I can
tell you, as Peter said in his remarks, the non-pressure pumping businesses for Baker Hughes are – some of them
setting records and just excelling. They're doing fantastic. And this particular product line in the pressure pumping has
made tremendous headway, but these headwinds on pricing, it's not over yet. And I just – it's going to be a drag on the
overall North America margins for all of 2013 easily.
But I think as you asked in your first part of your question there, at any given point wherever it may be, in terms of
market pricing, we will be better than we were before, just given on the way we're running the business today around
the supply chain, as well as around the efficiency and the type of customers we have where we can have the number of
24-hour fleets that we have now.
So, walking forward, that particular business, I believe, will perform differentially favorably for us than it will for the
market.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Right. Makes sense. And then sticking with North America more broadly, you talked about the
cooperation with CGV, how important is seismic becoming in North America in terms of just getting better about
wellbore placement, reservoir optimization. You talked about better integration across the lifecycles of a well?
And then, more broadly how – are you able to get access to their best technology and fully integrate that with what
you're doing based on the structure of that venture?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Structure of the agreement. And the answer to your last part is, yes. It's a fully – no
barriers between the two organizations in terms of cooperating on behalf of the customer.
I'd say that it depends on the customer, which one is more evolved in understanding the reservoir, where they're at in it,
and how sophisticated they are. But as we said on previous calls, Mike, there is a re-injection of technology into the
North American operator culture. There's – it's – I think that one of our guys termed it the stage wars are ending.
It's now about efficiency and being smart. And, I think you're going to see a separation in the customer community as
well to the ones that are able to capitalize on embracing technology and applying it. And, you can't be smart about the
reservoir if you don't have a seismic component. There is no reservoir understanding without a seismic understanding.
And, we like what we have with CGG and their recent alignment with Fugro and their own Hampson-Russell
capabilities matched up with our geomechanical and petrophysical capabilities is really helping. I can tell you that we
have a waterfall of opportunities since this has been announced. And frankly, we're just trying to sort out the best
opportunities and digest them. But the market is ready for this type of hookup.
<Q - Michael Urban>: So that collaboration is sufficient, you don't feel like you need to own it right now?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We don't like big heavy boats. And so, I think we like what we have right now.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Martin, your comment about moving frac equipment in Saudi to pursue unconventional, can
you tell me about that?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's the south part of the Kingdom, it's called the [ph] Jaffora Basin (42:34). It's
primarily – as you know, Jim, they call it unconventional there but it's really, really tight. There is some shale
reservoirs. This isn't particularly that. But it will have a lot of the same characteristics of the unconventional.
You remember back in February we had opening of the unconventional research center in the Kingdom. We have now
dozens of people working there as well as embedded in Saudi Aramco, both reservoir people as well as engineers and
so forth. And, that frac fleet will go to work hopefully by the end of the quarter. It's kind of being commissioned right
now. And the projects – the relationship with Aramco is very good in terms of defining where the wells should be, what
kind of wells they should be. We're starting off with just some stratigraphic and delineation wells, but I think you've
heard about the rig count expansion that's going to occur in Saudi. And, with lot of exploration, a lot of just to keep
their oil production up or get it up to that 12 million barrels a day and large part of it is going to be in this gas area.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: We are all very helpful. There had been talk about how one of the smaller pressure pumping
companies had been invited over to the Kingdom to look at that possibly moving frac equipment to do unconvetionals
at the northern part of the Kingdom. Is that – do I have that right? Has Aramco been looking for frac capacity in other
parts of the country to pursue unconventionals?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would assume that they probably are, but I'm not aware of any particular company
moving in there, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Got it. Okay, as my follow-up, it's interesting to me, the technology discussion that you're
starting to have now, which is kind of a shift from where you guys have been for the last while. Is this – Gaffney,
Cline's 50th anniversary and all this, and your mention of the CGV collaboration, is Baker finally moving into the
reservoir digital age after all these years?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I hope we're not in the analog age, let's put it that way.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: No, no. But, you guys have lagged. You haven't had a landmark or a WesternGeco and what
you did have in seismic you got rid of. And, all of the sudden, I'm now hearing you guys talk about reservoir more than
ever before?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I think it's a continuation of – if you remember, when Chad got here, we
recognized the gap we had in understanding the reservoir. And yes, whether it was GeoMechanics International,
whether it was RDS, whether it was Gaffney and Cline, we've consolidated a pretty strong organization. We're not
done. We're going to muscle up that organization more.
But also as I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to increase our spending on R&D because the global customer
community, in light of what you're saying, Jim, is as ever – their appetite's even more ferocious than it's ever been
about having the right products to get the job done. And that's because their job is getting a lot tougher to get those
reserves. So, it plays right into our wheelhouse. And we're going to keep – we're going to stay the course.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Well, it just sounds like you're accelerating the effort, it sounds great. Okay, gentlemen,
thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

of continuing decline in pricing, do you keep signing up rigs? Excuse me, do you keep signing up contracts on the fleet
or do you start to furlough some more here?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No. We don't furlough anymore. As we said, we have a certain percentage of our fleet
that's cold-stacked. We've actually seen our utilization improve from Q4 into these first few weeks of Q1. We're
winning a lot of good work. It's the type of work with the right customers. And what I mean by that is they're near our
centers of our new R&M centers and they have a portfolio of rigs that they're able to keep our fleets going 24 hours.
So, no, I expect – in fact, our forecast shows more and more stages going throughout 2013 and those are share gains.
And we're happy with the work we're winning, I can tell you.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah. And then let me just add, we've talked about rig efficiency. Even though the rig counts
go down year-over-year, it's going up from here and we expect rig efficiency to improve. We still see some
improvement in well count. And so yes, we are predicting the number of stages going up this year. So, that's probably
good for everybody and good for us differentially.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And David, I think you guys kind of struggle with the whole pricing thing, but we
estimate probably 25% of the work that's being done out there is still under some kind of price agreement or
take-or-pay that we never had the luxury of having. As those peel off, then that – then you're put into the spot market,
and the customer is going to try to take it out of your hide. So – but we didn't enjoy that in the back 12 months. So, is
our pricing going down? Well, not really, but we're talking to the market pricing going down. Does that make sense?
<Q - David Anderson>: Yes, it does. Well, that's kind of what I'm trying to understand and trying to isolate your U.S.
land business in terms of margins. If your utilization is going up, and I recognize you were on spot market a year ago,
at these level of pricing, can you expect the overall U.S. land margins themselves to pick up throughout the year based
upon just increased utilization?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yes.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Absolutely.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And the continuing improvements in some of the other cost categories.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yes, they certainly can. Utilization plays a big role outside of pricing. Utilization can affect
your margins just as powerfully as pricing can.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. I'm sorry, I'm going to break the rules, a totally unrelated follow-up. On your CapEx,
you talked about 30% lower. Can you A – can you first – can you break where the CapEx was spent in 2012? And
secondarily, you guys have spent – done a pretty good expansion job over the last four or five years internationally. Are
you stepping back now and kind of looking to kind of reassessing where you are? And are you thinking about where
you're good and where you're not and are you sort of retrenching in certain areas? Can you just explain to us your kind
of – as you look out internationally in terms of the expansion of kind of where you are now?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Let me give that a try. Almost half of our CapEx in 2012 was North America. We since
dropped that to about a third. Our infrastructure spend's gone down a bit, but our rental tool CapEx, as we said, is about
flat. We're operating at record levels internationally. We're operating at very high levels on U.S. land still for the – our
traditional product lines, which is in rental tools. And so we've got to keep that rental tool spend up, and so that rental
tool spend hasn't shifted much really between North America and International. It's just the – a lot of the pressure
pumping investment has declined and a lot of infrastructure spend is behind us now.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes. And let me just add that it doesn't mean that our pressure pumping business is being
starved dramatically. There's still a great cementing business there and the market's expanding for that, and the coil
market. And there is still frankly some stimulation equipment going in to improve our efficiencies in terms of sand
kings and some new blender designs and so forth. But, in terms of raw horsepower, that's the most dramatic drop as

you would expect in the CapEx data.
<Q - David Anderson>: And what about your international footprint? Where do you stand on that? Are you kind of
reassessing that now? When you institute a geomarket approach, obviously, you expand that to fill out that, but are you
now kind of looking in certain areas where maybe you're not as strong as you should be, but be pulling back there and
kind of reallocating different areas. How are you thinking about that right now?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, we are. We're taking a pretty tough line on certain businesses, either they got to be
improved or they got to be exited. And we started that in 2012 and we're going to continue on that. And that's just
prudent capital discipline and margin discipline. And I just think that's just a way to operate a business relative to – I
think once we did the whole geomarket thing, it was about growth. And we're not giving up on growth, but we're going
to take a harder line on returns.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey from ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Judson Bailey>: Thanks, good morning. A follow-up question on Latin America. I believe you indicated earlier,
we're probably looking at revenues probably down year-over-year in 2013. Can you help us think about, maybe, I don't
know, magnitude given some of the losses in Brazil? And also, how we think about your margins in that environment?
If revenue is sequentially down, have you been cutting cost there to kind of maintain margins at current level or are we
going to see those drop a bit to start the year?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We intend to maintain pretty decent margins there. The rig count, actually, in Latin America
is going up everywhere just about – but just we're talking about specifically a difference in share in Brazil, that will be
going down we think for us. And so we think we can make it up elsewhere. So, we're not talking about drastic declines
in revenue certainly because we can make it up elsewhere. And we think we can keep margins sort of flattish from here
by offsetting some of that Brazil share loss with gains elsewhere, so.
<Q - Judson Bailey>: Okay. And my follow-up is on another region for Europe, Africa, sounds like that's probably
where you're going to see the most growth behind Middle East. Can you help us think about the moving parts there?
Obviously, the North Sea is going to be very strong, but you talked about some of your gains in East Africa. Can you
help us think about within that geomarket, your best revenue growth and maybe margins there, as well?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, Jud. This is Martin. Let me – as Peter, I think, highlighted in his prepared
comments, we had some record performance across the world and I can tell you that particularly, that was led by, while
smaller, Russia Caspian, did exceptionally well in the fourth quarter, and I think some nice contract awards are going to
be on their way there.
And Africa, on all corners, putting North Africa aside right now with the chaos that's unfolding there. But East Africa
and our position in Mozambique, our new facilities in Pemba and customers moving in there and some contract awards
and, of course, our strength in Nigeria, in Angola and the Ivory Coast. So, I think Africa will lead and compete with
Russia Caspian in terms of the specific regional growth there.
And then Europe is a massive business for us and just the law of numbers, it's going to be hard to move the needle, but
we're in the process of mobilizing on those additional rigs in Norway. And it's such a technology-driven basin. And
with some of the products, the steerable drilling liner that I mentioned and some other things, I wouldn't count out the
ability of Norway, in particular, to add some real numbers in 2013, but it's already so big. So, in terms of differential,
it's not going to be like Africa or Russia Caspian.

you're talking about, I think the number was mentioned in terms of incrementals, maybe 20%, 25% incremental

<Q - Bradley Handler>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Brad.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Good morning, guys. Let me – I'll stick with the – some of the non-North America stuff as
well, I guess just seeking whatever additional clarity. Coming back to this notion of kind of high-grading in the quality
of earnings and, Martin, you obviously had a number of references in your comments to that. I guess, I'm curious, have
you already made decisions about exiting certain countries or certain product lines? Have you already effected those
changes?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes and no. It's a process. It's – I wouldn't want to make – I wouldn't want you to think
that this is some kind of new or – it's just the way we're going to run the business. You have to make money or it has to
be very clear when you're going to make money or there's no reason to be doing it. So, we have that same outlook on
places as high profile as Iraq. We have a line of sight into where it's going to contribute. And if we can't, it doesn't
make the cut and we have to take some – we have to make some decisions.
And I think in response to the earlier question, the way that we emerged out of our reorganization, it just takes time to
sort out to see where – which ones aren't going to make the cut and we're only a few years into it. So – but I'm not
going to be any more specific on that for obvious competitive reasons, but it's part of our mission to get our quality of
earnings up and remain disciplined. So, I don't want you to make it sound like it's a whole new way of operating or a
wave here. It's just – we're just going to continue to bring discipline to the numbers.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Sure. No, I understand that. I mean, it's helpful. I appreciate you qualifying that for me. Does
it – so should – as we've talked a little bit about your 2013 growth outlook internationally...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Did – would you say it had an impact? I think you identified high single-digit – all-in, sort of
a high single-digit revenue target or growth rate target for the year. Do you think it had some impact already in terms of
that? Could it have been higher, but it's – but sacrificing some margin opportunity? I mean would – decisions have
already been made, I guess, is what I'm asking you to get at for us.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yes. This is Peter. It's a continuous process. It didn't contribute much, I think, in 2012. I
think there's a little bit more emphasis on it in 2013. And we're counting on some of that to happen perhaps more in
2013 than what occurred in 2012.
<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay. Okay. Maybe very unrelated follow-up, but appreciate some more color on it. Your
read on what's happening in Colombia right now? So you know that's been a problem area for a few quarters already.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We like our position there. And the permit situation that challenged the service sector
over the last couple of quarters seems to be abating. There's been some nice geological success on part of – a couple of
the customers, got a real professional state oil company there. And so, I think 2013 will be much better than it was in
2012 given some of those bureaucratic things behind us.

<Q - Bradley Handler>: Okay, very helpful. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our last question comes from Doug Becker from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Hey, thanks. Martin, just hoping you could take a step back and talk about just some of the
self-help initiatives. And maybe you've addressed some of these already, but I'm thinking along the lines of supply
chain, reliability of tools, just an update on some of these self-help initiatives, major self help initiatives Baker Hughes
has ongoing?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes. Well, Doug look, it's – I'd say that we're probably at second base with regards to the
opportunity around running that business more effectively and efficiently in light of how the markets evolve, these
unconventionals, because as we've learned and as you guys know, logistics is a big driver and the efficiency behind
that. So, we've made great progress in freight, supply chain in general which drives the utilization, the staffing
numbers. We expect a lot more in terms of stages. But yet, we don't see the head count going up anywhere near what it
would have been under the way the business used to be run frankly. The leadership team that's been injected into that
product line is first-class. They know the customers. They know how to make money in the business. They're making
the right decisions.
So – but the biggest impact and the one that takes the longest because you don't have complete control over it is the
customer mix. You got to wait for the contracts to come up. You got to wait for them to roll. You got to have a facility
nearby. And I really like our win rate. I'm not going to comment on it explicitly and give you any kind of numbers, but
I am really happy with the type of work, who the customers are, where it's at, what the pricing is.
And like I say, we're probably on second base. We got a lot more opportunity through 2013 and 2014. And then any
favorability in terms of pricing, should that occur, will be more impactful I think versus the less efficient way we were
running the business before.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: And this is something you do expect that we'll be able to see. I know there's a lot of moving
parts in North America, but we're talking meaningful improvements here in terms of several hundred basis points,
clearly?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We made meaningful improvement in 2012. It's just got tidal-waved out because of the
pricing situation. And I think we can make meaningful improvement in 2013 and 2014. Now, we don't have as many
low-hanging fruits as we had in the early stages of, if you remember, Q2 and Q3 of last year, but the numbers –
potentials are still there. It just may take a little bit longer to roll out from 2013 and into 2014.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay. And then, Peter, just a quick one. You highlighted that international margins
particularly declined in the first quarter. You talked about some of the product sales and the impact there, talking about
a flat U.S. rig count. Is it reasonable to say that first quarter EPS should be below the fourth quarter?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Certainly, Canada, we would expect to improve. You see the rig count week by week getting
much stronger, so Canada should get a traditional increase. Gulf of Mexico, not much help necessarily into Q1 for us.
International, certainly down, and I think the big question mark is pressure pumping and whether or not we're going to
get our utilization up in Q1 and I'm not going to call that for you.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: So I guess – I mean, so if I paraphrase, you think there's at least a chance that first quarter
could be higher than the fourth quarter EPS?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Sure.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Always a chance.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: But there's a lot of volatility there, you know, high beta there.

<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Yes, but chance is probably the wrong term, a reasonable, realistic chance.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Then let you be the judge of that.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome, Doug.
