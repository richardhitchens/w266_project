MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter 2013 conference call. At this time all participants are in a
listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] .
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Jack Koraleski, CEO for Union Pacific. Thank you. Mr. Koraleski,
you may begin.
John J. Koraleski
Thanks, Rob. And good morning, everybody. Welcome to Union Pacific's second quarter earnings conference call.
With me today in Omaha are Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer, Eric Butler our Executive Vice President of
Marketing and Sales, and Lance Fritz our Executive Vice President of Operations.
This morning we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved an all-time record quarter generating an earnings
milestone of $2.37 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the second quarter of 2012. We managed our network
efficiently and continued to show the agility of our strong and diverse franchise. When combined with solid core
pricing gains, we more than offset the slight shortfall in volumes to generate a new best-ever quarterly operating ratio

of 65.7%. Translates into value that we're creating for our customers and increased financial returns for our
shareholders. So with that let's get started. I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks Jack and good morning. Let's start with how we're creating value for our customers, the cornerstone of our
strategy.
It all starts with the industry's best franchise which provides customers access to diverse and growing markets through
the targeted investments we continue to enhance this franchise so that we can deliver the best service and support future
growth.
A passion for providing excellent service has allowed us to introduce innovative products that not only win business
but also secure reinvestable returns. And the capstone of our value proposition is our relationship with our customers, a
key component that we work hard to develop and maintain.
Today our value proposition is stronger than ever as reflected by our customer satisfaction scores which came in at 93
for the second quarter. We appreciate this recognition from our customers, and continue to focus on providing excellent
service and strengthening our value offering.
In the second quarter volume was down about one percent compared to last year as strong growth in chemicals and
solid gains in automotive were offset by declines in intermodal and ag. The drought related decline in ag continues to
have a significant impact on overall volume. Setting ag aside, the other five groups were up about 1% in total.
Core pricing grew 4% with all six businesses posting gains. Those pricing gains along with some positive mix were the
main drivers in the 5% improvement in average revenue per car. The price driven average per car gains outpacing the
volume decline freight revenue grew 5% to more than $5.1 billion.
Let's take a close look at each of the six groups starting with the two that saw declines.
Ag products' revenue declined 8%, with second quarter volume down 10%, and a 2% improvement in average revenue
per car. Last summer's drought continued to impact grain car loadings, with second quarter volumes down 22% from
last year. Domestic feed grain shipments declined as tight corn supply, especially in UP served territories, led to
reductions in livestock feedings and increased sourcing from local crops that are less likely to move by rail. Export feed
grain shipments also declined with limited U.S. supply and improved production.
Grain product shipments were down 1% as more DDGs were fed locally driving the 17% decline in DDG volume.
Ethanol shipments provided some good news, growing 3% as production picked up to replenish low ethanol
inventories. Food and refrigerated shipments also declined 3% as lower U.S. sugar prices driven by surplus conditions
reduced sugar imports from Mexico and restrictions in Russia and China limited U.S. beef and pork exports.
Intermodal revenue was down 1%, with a price-driven 2% improvement in average revenue per unit partially offset a
3% decline in volume. Lower volume was due to declines in international intermodal, where soft West Coast imports
reduced shipments by 8% following strong first quarter gains. With modest retail sales growth, retailers remain
cautious about overstocking inventory levels. Volume fared better for domestic intermodal, where continued success
converting highway business to rail in both dry and refrigerated containers drove volume up 3%.
Automotive volume grew 4%, which combined with an 8% increase in average revenue per car to drive revenue up
12%. Driven by replacement demand, favorable financing, and an improving overall economy, vehicle sales continued
to gain momentum with the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate reaching 15.9 million in June, the highest level since
late 2007. New models offering more futures and improved fuel efficiency are compelling consumers to replace aging
vehicles.
In addition, upticks in housing and construction activity have increased demand for light trucks. While overall auto
sales continue to reflect strong growth, our finished vehicle shipments saw more modest increase reflecting a 2% gain

as select OEMs faced downtown to deal with model changes and new product launches. Parts volume increased 5%,
while pricing gains in the previously mentioned Pacer network logistics management arrangement increased average
revenue per car.
Chemicals volume increased 10%, which combined with [audio gap] (5:48 – 5:58) a 2% improvement in average
revenue per car to produce a 12% increase in revenue. Crude oil volume was up 3% from the previous quarter, and
increased nearly 40% when compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven primarily by increased
shipments from Bakken, Western Oklahoma and West Texas shale plays in UP-served terminals in Saint James,
Louisiana and the Texas Gulf Coast and Arkansas.
Our petroleum products in LPG gas business was up 10% driven by growth in residual fuel oil and asphalt shipments.
Strong international demand for potash led to a 7% increase in fertilizer shipments, while most other segments also
posted gains reflecting the continued strength of our chemical business.
Turning now to coal, you can see from the chart of weekly car loadings that the second quarter volumes began to
stabilize, and finished the quarter a little bit better than flat compared to last year. Coal pricing gains led to a 12%
improvement in average revenue per car and produced a 12% increase in revenue. Tonnage from the Southern Powder
River Basin increased 1% as declining utility stockpiles and higher natural gas prices improved the demand for coal.
Powder River Basin stockpiles are estimated to have declined 21% from their peak in April 2012, swinging from 24
days above normal at that time to about one day below normal this May. New business also provided a boost, but these
gains were offset by utility outages and the previously mentioned loss of legacy customer contract at the beginning of
the year. Soft domestic demand, a weak international market for Western U.S., coal and mine production issues led to
limited shipments of Colorado Utah coal with tonnage down 11%.
Industrial products revenue increased 7%, even as volume remained flat, driven by a 6% improvement in average
revenue per car. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 18% as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased frac
sand shipment by 24%. Growth in housing starts and residential improvements increased the demand for lumber with
shipments up 11%. Although the housing market continued to strengthen, lumber's pace of growth eased slightly in the
second quarter, as falling lumber prices, excess inventory, and wet weather slowed lumber shipments.
On the downside, lower steel production and soft global demand impacted scrap steel with volume down 17%. Rock
shipments declined 5% as local sourcing impacted some of our short haul business into the Eagle Ford shale play. We
also see a steep decline in military shipments, with reduced deployments and training rotations to facilities on our
network.
That wraps up the second quarter. So let's take a look ahead at what we see for the second half of 2013. Our current
outlook is for the economy to show some improvement from the sluggishness we've seen in the second quarter.
Although we'll continue to face challenges in some markets, our diverse franchise still provides opportunities to grow
in others. The diminished 2012 corn crop will continue to impact ag products in the third quarter. But an improving
export wheat market should offers some relief. The pace of decline for ag products should ease with third quarter
volumes expected to be down in the lower single digit range. We hope to see a return to trend line yields when the new
crop – corn crop, comes in later in the year which should provide some opportunities.
Global Insight has raised their full year light vehicle sales estimates to 15.4 million vehicles from 15.0 million vehicles
at the beginning of the year, which should be good news for our automotive business. Crude oil should continue to
drive chemical's growth, but the growth rate will continue to ease against 2012's larger base. Most other chemical
markets are expected to remain solid.
Moving to coal, the loss of a customer contract at the beginning of the year will continue to impact volumes. While we
expect coal volumes to increase sequentially into third quarter, year over year volume growth for the quarter will
depend upon weather conditions. Industrial products should also continue to benefit from shale-related growth, with
increased drilling activity and a ramp up in pipeline projects, after a slow start to the year. The housing market
continues to recover, which is expected to drive demand for lumber. We expect continued success in converting
highway business toward domestic intermodal, and international intermodal should pick up as a slowly growing

economy is expected to produce a positive, but somewhat muted, peak season.
For the remainder of the year our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will continue to support business
development opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. Assuming an improving economy and a normal
summer weather pattern, we expect to finish the full year with a slight volume increase, which combined with pricing
gains will generate profitable revenue growth.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with our safety performance for the first half of the year. Our year-to-date
reportable personal injury rate increased 5% from 2012. However, the number of severe injuries declined to a record
low, which reflects our work to reduce risk and the team's deep personal commitment to safety, something we call The
Courage to Care.
Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved 1% versus 2012. Our continued investments to harden our
infrastructure as well as leverage advanced defect detection technology have driven a reduction in track and
equipment-induced derailments.
Moving to public safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved 3% versus 2012, reflecting our focus on improving
or closing high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness. Our second quarter rate of 1.85 was a second quarter
best and represented a significant improvement over the first quarter performance. Incident rates improved in each
region of our network, including the South, where there is a higher grade crossing density than our overall network.
Moving on to network performance, in the second quarter the network remained fluid, but it does have room for
improvement. Overall velocity was down 3% and terminal dwell was up 4% in the quarter, both adversely impacted by
weather interruptions and heat-induced slow orders in the southwestern portion of the network. Increased track renewal
programs in high volume corridors also played a role.
Weather challenges included flooding that impacted major gateways in Chicago, St. Louis and Eagle Pass, Texas. As a
result, we saw a 25% increase in the number of days with major service interruption versus the second quarter of last
year. Infrastructure investments that enhanced our agility and resiliency enabled us to rapidly recover after each
incident, reducing the impact from these events. Overall, our network remains solid and well positioned to handle
volume growth. We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers, with a best-ever 96% industry
spot and pull, which measures the delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer.
Our service delivery index, a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, declined modestly
compared to the second quarter of 2012. Half of the decline can be attributed to tighter service commitments to our
customers and the effects of traffic mix changes. Despite these challenges, we achieved sequential improvement in both
service delivery and terminal dwell compared to the first quarter. Solid network fundamentals position us to operate at
improved service levels going forward. We are continuing to increase capacity across our network, most notably in the
South where volumes have rebounded to pre-recession levels.
Moving on to network productivity, slow order miles declined almost 30% to a best-ever second quarter level. We've
made substantial advancements in the South with process improvements that allow us to maintain the railroad while
providing value-added service levels. As a result, our network is in excellent shape, reflecting the investment in
replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced service failures.
We continue to leverage existing resources in growth markets as well as realize efficiencies in more challenging
segments. During the second quarter, we turned a 4% growth in automotive volumes into an average train size increase
of 2%, running an all-time quarterly record of 65 cars per train during the quarter. And despite the 22% decline in grain
volumes, we were able to run near-record second quarter grain train lengths, with manifest and coal train lengths falling
just short of quarterly records. Intermodal train sizes reflect the challenge of an 8% dip in international volume.

We continue to find ways to utilize assets more effectively through process improvement and targeted capital
investment. A good example of this is the Fort Worth terminal, which is a major network yard that supports Texas oil
and gas fields, Mexico, the automotive network and construction markets. The UP Way uses process improvement
tools like value stream mapping and the A3 problem solving process to find and apply countermeasures for process
bottlenecks and service failures. More importantly, it engages those doing the work in generating these
countermeasures, collecting and focusing the power of the team. Through our UP Way initiatives we are handling
substantially more cars through our key networked yard in Fort Worth at better service levels.
Our capital investment strategy also plays a vital role. Our targeted 2013 capital spend is still around the $3.6 billion
mark. About $2 billion of that is replacement capital, with most of that to renew our track infrastructure. We're on
target for the year as more than half of that program work is now complete. Spending for service growth and
productivity will total around $1 billion. Capacity, commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers.
Spending on positive train control will total $450 million for the year.
Major projects include work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico rail facility, which is slated to open in early 2014. This
year's progress on the Sunset Corridor includes about 30 miles of double track. Additionally our capacity expansion
plans in the South are increasing more than threefold from spending levels in 2011, helping support the efficient
movement of growing volumes in that region. We're adding sidings, expanding terminals, double tracking some routes
and upgrading signals. We're also purchasing 100 locomotives, 900 freight cars, as well as some domestic containers to
replace units currently on lease or being retired.
It's important to note that all of these projects have a positive safety impact, whether it's replacement or service and
growth capital. And the growth capital must meet aggressive return thresholds or we just will just not pursue the
project.
So to wrap it up, we remain optimistic on our operating outlook for the second half of the year and our ability to realize
network improvements on various fronts. We remain steadfast in our commitment to operate a safer and more efficient
railroad for the benefit of our employees, customers, the public and shareholders. We'll remain agile, managing
network resources in response to dynamic market shifts and unexpected events.
The network is strong and fluid, capable of handling volume growth at safe, efficient and reliable service levels. Our
continuous improvement efforts, and particularly the UP Way, will continue to generate process improvements that add
value for all of our stakeholders. To support our growth initiatives we will continue to make smart capital investments
that generate attractive returns, all of which will continue to enhance our overall value proposition.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight, Jr.
Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Let's start with a quick recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew
5% to an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.5 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense
totaled $3.6 billion, increasing 3%. Operating income grew 9% to $1.9 billion, also hitting a best-ever quarterly mark.
Below the line, other income totaled $23 million, up $2 million compared to 2012. For the full year, we're still
projecting other income to be in the $100 million to $120 million range barring any unusual adjustments. Interest
expense of $133 million was $2 million lower than last year, while income tax expense increased to $662 million,
driven by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 10% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2%
as a result of our continued share repurchase activity. These results combined to produce a best-ever quarterly earnings
record of $2.37 per share, up 13% versus 2012.
Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 5% to more than $5.1 billion. Solid core pricing gains of 4% and positive
mix of about two points, driven by a decline in lower average revenue per car intermodal shipments, more than offset
the slight decline in volume levels. In addition, fuel surcharge revenue was down from last year due to a lower average
diesel fuel price and lower volumes.

Moving on to the expense side. Slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was up
3% compared to 2012. Inflationary pressures of about 2.5% combined with shifts in traffic mix to more manifest
business, which requires additional employees, drove the quarterly increase. Lower volume costs and productivity
gains partially offset these increases.
Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter, about half of the increase was driven by capital projects, including
positive train control activity. The other half was driven by a shift in traffic mix, that I just discussed.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $863 million, decreasing $19 million versus 2012. A 3% decline in the
average diesel fuel price drove the reduction in the costs. Gross ton miles were essentially flat compared to last year.
Conversely, our consumption rate increased 2% compared to 2012.
Moving on to other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 8% to $585 million, due to
higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses and joint facility maintenance expenses. As we discussed in
April, we continue to incur logistic management fees associated with the new Pacer agreement which are recouped in
our automotive freight revenue line.
Depreciation expense increased 1% to $438 million. The impact of increased capital spending in recent years was
partially offset by a new equipment rate study that we discussed with you earlier this year. Looking at the full year
2013, we now expect depreciation expense to be up in the 1% to 2% range versus 2012, due to the timing of asset
purchases and project work completion.
Slide 25 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $302 million,
up 1% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses associated with the new Pacer contract and growth in
automotive shipments drove higher freight car rental expense. Lower freight car and locomotive leased expense
partially offset these increases. Other expenses came in at $219 million, up $29 million versus last year. Despite the
long-term improvement trend in our safety performance, personal injury expense increased compared to a tough comp
last year. Our recent actuarial study resulted in a smaller reduction to our estimate for prior year activity compared with
the second quarter of last year. In addition, higher operating taxes and freight and property damage costs also drove
expenses up compared to 2012. For the second half of this year, we still expect the other expense line to average around
$225 million a quarter, barring any unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance, we achieved an all-time best operating ratio of 65.7% this quarter,
improving 1.3 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact of solid core pricing gains
and network efficiencies, despite the slight shortfall in volumes. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving a
full-year sub 65% operating ratio by 2017.
Union Pacific's record first half earnings drove strong cash from operations of more than $3.2 billion, up 16%
compared to 2012. Free cash flow of $833 million reflects the growing profitability of the franchise, more than
offsetting the 12% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012.
Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At quarter end, our adjusted debt to
cap ratio was roughly 40%. Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced
approach to cash allocation. In the second quarter, we bought back nearly 3.1 million shares, totaling $463 million.
Since 2007 we've repurchased over 97 million shares, at an average price of around $82 per share. Looking ahead, we
have about 9 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.
That's a recap of our second quarter results. Looking at the remainder of the year, the economy will be a key driving
factor. Assuming an improving economy and summer weather conditions that will drive coal demand and fall crop
harvest yields, we're projecting positive volume growth for the second half of the year, which should bring full year
volumes to the positive side of the ledger.
In the third quarter, we'll continue to see a year-over-year decline in our ag volumes, however not at the magnitude that
we saw in the second quarter. As for our coal shipments, summer weather will be the determining factor. In addition,
we'll have to see how consumer sentiment and the economy impact the intermodal peak season this year. However, we

do think there are continued growth opportunities in other market sectors that have the potential to offset these
uncertainties.
Combined with continued real core pricing gains and our ability to leverage our diverse franchise, we expect to achieve
yet another record financial year with best-ever marks in earnings and operating ratio. We're well positioned through
the first half of this year. Regardless of the hand that the economy deals us, we'll remain focused on our ability to
generate improving returns required to strengthen and enhance our network, create value for our customers, and drive
increased returns for our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Thanks, Rob. As we move into the second half of the year, the economic outlook remains uncertain. But from our
perspective, the underlying economy in the second quarter seemed somewhat weaker than it did in the first quarter.
We're hopeful that we'll see some economic improvement in the months ahead. We are well positioned with our diverse
franchise, our strong value proposition and our excellent service offerings, while remaining agile in today's changing
environment. We'll continue focusing on reinvestable pricing, attracting new profitable growth opportunities, and
running a safe, efficient and reliable network that generates greater value for both our customers and our shareholders
going forward.
With that, we'll open up the phones for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Maybe first a question on the coal business. You saw nice sequential step-up in the coal
yields there. I guess I'm just kind of trying to think about how we should be thinking about the mix of what was
previously price legacy business, and maybe what is kind of current run rate base as we think out into the back half of
the year. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense what maybe the mix factors could be when we look at the coal business in
the second half of 2013?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Chris, if you look at it I think we had $350 million of legacy up for renewal this year. And
we retained about 80% of that. The majority of that was coal business. There's really nothing significantly changing as
we go forward for the balance of the year. And the mix impact that you're going to see is really going to be dependent
on the coal burn in the various customer regions and zones. So there's really not much more clarification.
Eric, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. I guess I'm just trying to maybe get a sense. You lost a contract earlier in the year
which I think you had mentioned was about 5% of the business. So it would seem that the underlying business is
obviously doing better than kind of the flattish volumes you're seeing there. But that's helpful.
Maybe switching gears with a follow-up. Just on the back of crude by rail, when you think about the tightening
differentials on WTI versus Brent. Have you seen a deceleration in the pace of activity at Saint James, for instance?

Just trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about sequential pace of crude by rail in the back half.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We really haven't seen any impact at Saint James. We have – had seen some minor impact in
our Texas business where there's a lot of pipelines.
Eric, you want to...
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. The intrastate Texas short haul business we always take opportunistic opportunities to
move some of that, which is pretty directly competitive to pipeline given the fact it's pretty short haul stuff, and so
we've seen some decline in that; but that's really nominal. For our base book of long haul Bakken, the Saint James
business, we feel pretty good about the continued opportunities with that.

<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys.
<A>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Wanted to first just follow up on coal. So, if I remember, earlier in the year you guys were
guiding to slight declines in coal volumes for the full year, and I guess the implication was positive volumes in the back
half of the year. It seems like you've got maybe less visibility to coal now. I just want to understand that. Are you no
longer confident that you're going to have positive coal in the full second half of the year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Go ahead, Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yes, Scott, we haven't changed our guidance. Where we said that for the full year that
we still think coal's going to be slightly down, given all the factors and given the fact that it was down 19% in the first
quarter. So that does imply with a flat performance in the second quarter, that does imply strengthening in the back
half. Where we're saying there's lack of clarity, if you will, is as always, weather will be a huge factor in how the
summer burn plays out in our coal business. And as Eric pointed out, at this point in time, inventories are about two
days lower than normal. So we're well positioned, if the weather itself cooperates.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: We're getting killed in New York with heat. How is the weather cooperating in your territories
right now?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It's going to be 97 degrees in Omaha today, so we're doing high fives. But so far at least for
the summer it's been okay. It was actually a cooler spring than what we had hoped for, but the summer has heated up
nicely, and we're hoping that that's going to stay through the balance of the season.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I would add is that the Energy Department has put out estimates that suggest that electrical
generation demand will be down 4% in the second half of the year. They probably don't have any better crystal ball
than we do in terms of weather impacts. But that is a data point that's out there.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. Just second question. Why is international intermodal so weak? Is there share losses to
BM, and do you think it's just the West Coast ports losing any share? They just seem surprisingly weak, and want to get
an explanation for it, and how you think that plays out in terms of peak season?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Part of it may be they were surprisingly strong in the first quarter. But Eric you can clarify
that.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. So our first quarter was strong, as you recall. There's always significant competition
between all of the ports up and down the West Coast, and between ourselves and our competitors, but there's no
significant share swing that has occurred.

The real fundamental issue is retail indicators in this country, retail sales have really been mixed. And you could argue
even in the second quarter they look like they have softened a bit. Supply chain manufacturers and retailers are
continuing to thin out the supply chain and trying to squeeze out inventory. So you have actually seen lower volumes
coming in to all of the West Coast ports from Asia. Certainly what's going on in China might also have an impact to
that. Certainly near sourcing to Mexico might have an impact to that. But you have seen lower volumes into all of the
West Coast ports in the second quarter.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: And why do you have the improved international peak as a positive in the second half?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Well, if you look again at what we've said is the economy is what our outlook is dependent
upon. If you look at inventory, if you look at some of the sentiment, it does suggest that later in the third quarter, the
fourth quarter, there should be decent consumer sentiment for a strong retail season. If that happens, you will need to
move the business because there are not a lot of inventories out there. So that would suggest a pickup from where we
are today.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you about the kind of look on coal beyond second
half of this year and the weather comments. But if you look in to 2014 and 2015, have you seen any kind of new
indication from utilities that there are more coal plants being scheduled for shutdown, or is that pretty much status quo?
And when you look at that, would you say there might be some impact in 2014 to demand from coal plant shutdowns,
or you think that's not going to be much of an effect?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So as we discussed previously, coal shutdown plants and any announcements you might see
really is not the factor because there's more capacity than demand. And you might hear about shutdowns that just kind
of match capacity and demand. The key issue is what market share coal has. Coal is hanging in there pretty solidly at a
38%, 39% market share of total electrical generation. We see nothing on the horizon that's going to substantially
change that. Certainly there could be some environmental regulatory thing that could change it. But right now from a
business economic standpoint, we see nothing on the horizon that's going to change that.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. And then one on crude by rail. You commented on I guess the near term
trend. It sounds like there's some negative impact on the short haul business, but really not in Saint James. What about
customer investment activity and the discussions that you're having that would kind of indicate how new terminals will
be opened up looking out the next year or two? Is there a change in discussions? Are customers kind of slowing things
down at all? Or is it pretty much the same as what you saw before when crude spreads were wider?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So actually customer investment in destination terminals is expanding, both in Saint James,
there's a project well underway to expand that capacity, but more importantly we've talked about this in the past, if you
look at what has gone on in California, there's significant activity in terms of expansion of destination terminals in
California. We've mentioned before California is going to have a significant shortfall. Their local crude production is
declining. Alaska's slope is declining, so they're looking to source from Canada, from the Bakken and also from the
Niobrara and also Permian, and so they need destination terminals in California. And there's significant activity,
significant investment going on. Some has been public, some has not.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We have seen no diminishing in the enthusiasm for customer investment in the oil business.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thank you for the time.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah, hi there. Good morning.
<A>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: You know, in spite of a relatively modest revenue growth rate, the OR this quarter was very
impressive, I think, by any measure. And if we look at kind of how things changed sequentially, typically your third
quarter is the best. Now, I know you don't give guidance, so we're not sort of looking for that. But if you think about
kind of anything in the third quarter or on a sequential basis that means that we need to keep in mind something that's
going to cause seasonality to be off, is there anything that you look at in this upcoming third quarter or even relative to
last year that's important for us to bear in mind? Because this was pretty impressive, and suggests that the long-term
guidance will be achieved early.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Bill, we don't see anything in the third quarter that we would consider to be
unusual. There's always in the rail business unforeseens that could happen. But at this point in time we really don't have
anything substantive. Rob or Lance?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Bill, I would say just one thing to keep in mind that's always a factor in our business is
mix, obviously can have a factor, and so can fuel prices. I mean, if fuel price is up or down that can obviously have an
impact. But, no, there's nothing that directionally that's going to change our commitment to continue to make progress
on our operating ratio commitments.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay, great. Now, if you think about these long-term OR goals that you have, the ROIC has
gotten to pretty good levels, certainly relative to history. How do you think about the implications over time of being
above the cost of capital? Is that – do we have to start thinking about regulatory risks yet, or is this – are we not really
there?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Well, Bill, as you've heard us say all along, we're proud of the fact that we've improved
our returns. We're going to continue to reinvest in the business, which is how we're able to reinvest as much capital as
we do. And as you've heard me say many times, if you look at our calculation of our returns on a replacement basis, our
returns are around, call it 7%ish. So, clearly, room for us to continue to improve that on an actual replacement cost
calculation. So we're going to – we're not going to change our behavior. We'll continue to run a safe, efficient network
and price to value where we add value to our customers and continue to move forward in our returns so that we can
continue to make these capital investments that we'd like to make.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, Bill, every chance I get in Washington D.C., my message is very, very clear, that
while we are earning good financial returns, we are investing record amounts of capital. We're providing great value
and service for our customers. And on a replacement cost basis, we're still not in the ballpark of where we need to be.
And I think that message has been well received, particularly given that customers are relatively satisfied with our
service offerings.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good morning. So, was curious on coal yields here when I look at things on an RPU
basis. I mean, we saw volumes up nicely this quarter versus what we've seen at least for the past few quarters and RPU
declined sequentially. And I'm just trying to get an idea as we look out to the back half and expect improvement from a
volume standpoint year over year how much of the prior legacy flow through should influence RPU? And would I be
smart to expect stable, flat or down? And obviously I'm assuming that we get a decent burn going on this summer and

that volumes do increase on a year-over-year basis.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Rob, want to take a shot at that?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Justin, the simple answer to your question is it's difficult to give guidance on what
you're asking in terms of the average revenue per car because mix plays such a key factor in that. But you're right,
sequentially the average revenue per car did come down and is driven primarily by the mix effect that Eric talked about
where volumes, as an example, were off 11% in our Colorado Utah business, for example, while PRP was up in the
quarter. So that's an example of the mix effect.
In terms of the pricing underlying what's happening in the coal business, there's no directional change. We've renewed
those legacy contracts that Jack talked about, and that should flow through, through the balance of the year, so there's
no change in that element of the average revenue per car, but the mix effect and the volume associated with those
repriced contracts will clearly play a role as we move forward.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe a little bit on the longer term view as we look out to the
petrochemical projects that are coming on line in your southern corridor. You know, curious how we should be
thinking about the timing. I know there's at least one cracker in 2014, and most of the rest of the stuff is beyond 2014.
But what's the timing of that project, and how meaningful would you expect loads to start coming on in 2014 from
that?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As you're talking about the expansion of the chemicals production capacity due to low natural
gas prices, I think they're roughly eight announced plant expansions. Most of those have turnover to operation dates, I
think, in 2016 or beyond. And so we are working with them now in terms of developing transportation alternatives,
working with many of those customers in helping them ship their inbound construction materials to build the facilities.
But I think most of those will be late 2015, early 2016, or later.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Yes, I think there was one the Gruppo Mossi project that was – had an estimated
completion in 2014. So I was curious as to what kind of production you would expect that to see? I know it's one that
you guys have called out before in your presentations.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We don't – as you know we don't list production from individual plants and individual
customers. We do have a very strong chemicals franchise with a lot of great value and we believe that there's upside. I
think what we might have called out in the past about the Gruppo Mossi facility was a 2016 start, I think that's what we
called out, but we don't list individual opportunities and individual plants. But we are excited about all of the upside.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Great. Well, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great, good morning. You talked earlier about international intermodal, if I could switch to
domestic intermodal. You're look at a – I guess volumes were up about 3%. Would you anticipate that to grow faster on
that? You've talked about I think it was what, about 10 million addressable loads, plus I think another 2 million
addressable loads or 3 million addressable loads from Mexico. Do you expect the conversion rate to pick up, or is the
3% kind of your targeted run rate.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So, as we look at domestic intermodal, it's a rich target area. I mean, we have said publicly that
there's probably 9 million loads, 10 million loads that can be converted from truck to rail. We have, we believe, the
strongest North-South Mexico franchise. We have six border points. Truck business to and from U.S. and Mexico is

growing rapidly this year. So we think there's a rich target area. We have a number of strategies and initiatives that we
have underway with our partners in the intermodal industry to convert more truck to rail. And so we think there's lots of
upside.
Converting is – there are a lot of issues, and a lot of things that need to be done to do that. Effective conversion. So I'm
not sure I will give a roadmap in terms of what the number will be at what period of time, but we continue to believe
there's significant upside in the domestic intermodal market.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: We're pretty excited, Ken, about the opportunity that we'll have in 2014 with the opening of
our new facility in Santa Teresa to take in addition to that 10 million truckload, there's another 3 million truckloads
between the U.S. and Mexico. And that facility is going to really – we're going to really focus on that and target that.
So we're looking forward to having that facility up and running here in 2014.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: And I'd like to make one other data point. The new trucking CSA rules that went into effect July
1, we're not really seeing any impact from that right now. But we do expect over time that there will be an impact from
that which will make rail more competitive. Intermodal more competitive.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: You're talking about hours of service, right?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yes.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Okay. Thanks for the input there, I'm sorry. I guess my other question is, I think Rob
mentioned during his speech that more manifests will drive a need for more employees. Should we see that pace
accelerate given some of the comments on the areas you're targeting, whether it's group by rail or some of the other
areas that might be more manifest. Should we see that pace of employees pick up now?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Ken, it depends on the volumes and the mix is a part of it. I go back to our original
guidance on head count. We sort of put capital aside because as I commented some of our head count was earmarked
on the capital, and specifically positive train fill. But if you look at our – our net head count flow should flow with
volume.
So if volume is slightly up I would expect head count net to be slightly up, if volumes end up being slightly down, for
example, which I don't hope – won't have to happen, but if that were to happen, we'd expect head count to be down.
But all of which not one for one, because there is productivity in there. So I think while manifest itself carries with it a
little bit more labor intensity, when you step back and look at it enterprise wide that doesn't change our view on our
head count guidance.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Appreciate the insight. Thanks, guys.

were associated with the utility outages, and the new business that you mentioned for the coal business? And
specifically, did the new business that you were talking about include any legacy coal business that was repriced for
2012 but did not move?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric, Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Allison, if I understand your question, you're asking in the second quarter what was the
impact of some of the legacy repricing of businesses that did not move. Let me attempt to answer, and if I don't answer
it correctly what you're asking, come back.

<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: We have previously said that as we repriced contracts, if the volume doesn't move, and
we called this out in the sec -, excuse me, in the first quarter, that we didn't get, call it half a point of price, because the
repriced business, the volume was down. We're still experiencing that. While we had sequential improvement in our
volumes in our coal business, it's still not at the rate that the full load rate, if you will, back to historical levels.
So I would summarize by saying that if coal volumes were to pick back up to historical levels there's still some upside
opportunity there. And depending on when it actually happens, it may or may not show up in how we report our
pricing, but rest assured it would show up in our margins.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay, that's fair. And is there any volume number that you could give us for the utility outage
that you mentioned?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: No, I mean, it's in our numbers. It's in the mix of our numbers. But we don't call it out
specifically.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Okay. And then on my follow-up question on crude by rail. You've talked a lot about the
destination side of the equation. But I was wondering if you could speak to production ramping up in the Niobrara, and
how many rail facilities that you might serve there on the origination side?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So as you know, production in Niobrara is ramping up but it still is at much lower levels than
what you see out of Bakken or out of some of the Canadian areas. There are in terms of new or – our customers and
destination origin, terminal owners, there are a number of large projects underway, I'm not going to call out the
specifics, but a number of large projects, both on ourselves and our competitors that are underway in terms of origin
facilities out of the Niobrara. Those are really targeted to move Niobrara products into California.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up from the question that Ken was
asking on intermodal. You guys mentioned your new Santa Teresa facility that's ramping up. Does that mean that
Ferromex is going to jump a little bit more aggressively in the cross-border intermodal business with partnership with
UP?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, so our Santa Teresa facility, that Jack was talking about, is targeted to open in the first
quarter of next year. That facility is on UP, and it'll do a number of things for us, but one of the things it will do it will
help us really penetrate in that maquiladoras market that is just south of the border, and moving their products to
destination in the U.S. by long haul truck. We'll be able to convert that to intermodal and move to intermodal. And so
that's not really an FXE play. It would not surprise me if the FXE is interested in growing their intermodal business.
They have a great franchise, as does the KCSM. And as I said before, there's a rich target opportunity there in terms of
intermodal, particularly to and from Mexico. So it would not surprise me if that were the case.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. And maybe Eric or Jack, if you guys want to respond to this one as well. But
I think the risk that could develop here is if the slow economy continues, do you think that Union Pacific can continue
driving core pricing well within the 4% range? I know there was some legacy contracts last year, you're getting a little
bit more benefit this year, but it's our understanding that you don't have a significant book of business to re-price early
in 2014. So do you envision that if things kind of continue at the 2Q pace you could maintain that level of pricing
growth, or is there a little bit of risk in the economy there as well?

<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Rob. Go ahead.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yes. Brandon, let me just remind everyone what we've said. Again, we haven't given
guidance on specific pricing number other than to say that we're confident we can still get real pricing, which some,
and many, define that as sort of inflation-plus kind of pricing. But as we've talked before we're focused on making sure
that every piece of business is reinvestable. But to your point of legacy, I have called out that in 2014 it's quote: "a
legacy-light year". But that doesn't change our overall focus on pricing and our commitment to get that real core pricing
gain.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Thanks. Given the market's evident enthusiasm with the Mexican business, as evidenced by
Kansas City Southern's multiple, it's always worth noting you guys have on absolute basis an equally sized – a
somewhat equally sized Mexican business. Perhaps if you could just talk about, I know we've touched on intermodal
but some of the growth that you saw in second quarter, how that business is trending? And in terms of near shoring and
biz development, what does the pipeline look like in terms of what might be coming on line in Mexico to drive further
and future growth.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So we are very excited about the Mexico market. And as you may, or may not, know, we are
still the Kansas City Southern, the Mexico KCSM largest interline partner to and from Mexico. So we're excited about
the franchise. We are excited about all of the opportunities. There's immense growth on the auto side of the business.
There's a number of different automotive facilities that are being built and expanded in Mexico and between the KCFM
and the FXE joining with the UP franchise, that's a sweet spot for us.
The Mexican grain business is always very strong for us. With the drought last year we have seen some weakness, but
as you have normal crop yields that is always a target area for us. And then intermodal is really kind of the untapped
area. There's a significant amount of intermodal today in terms of for the auto manufacturers, but if you take the auto
manufacturers out of the mix, there's significant North/South truck moves, and we believe that that's an untapped area
for us to penetrate and grow our Mexico business. So we're very excited about Mexico.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Excellent. I guess my follow-up question would be a longer term. We're starting to hear and see
conceptual schematics and models of natural gas-powered locomotives. Certainly the manufacturers are starting to talk
about it more, and potential for savings operationally of 20%, 30% in terms of running cost. Again, this is all kind of
theoretical at this point. But to what extent are you examining natural gas locomotives, beta testing, where are you in
that, and realistically what might be a timeframe to see something deployed in a commercial basis?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure, Lance.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. Yes, so there is a lot of work both at Union Pacific and in the industry on natural gas
powered locomotives. We are positioning ourselves right now to start running some beta testing. We have been
partnered up with the CN, they used some of our equipment when they were beta testing and have seen their results. It
is not a layup from the standpoint of earning a reasonable return out of the investment necessary to convert to natural
gas. There's a significant capital footprint on the network. And there's also a significant capital put into the rolling stock
so that you can have tenders behind the locomotives. However, it looks promising, so we're investigating and pursuing.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Got it. Thank you.

<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. My question is on the agriculture business.
2Q 2013 volumes I think were the second lowest going back to 2007. And so two questions, really. Has there been any
change other than, say, the droughts on your network with other customers coming on or off the network?
And then secondly, what have been the implications for you from an expense standpoint and how does that resolve
itself as volumes eventually come back? Thank you.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So let me talk about the network. We actually have been expanding our ag network footprint as
we've gone through the drought period. We have invested and have created with our customers more originations and
we have expanded our capability in terms of running larger more efficient trains in our network. So while the drought
has been underway, we've actually positioned ourselves for the future to grow the business.
If you look at the ag business, yes, it was near record lows, but there are a couple of factors. You had the drought. You
also had during this time, don't forget, you had the Russian and Chinese governments putting bans on some of our
exports. You had our sugar exports being impacted also in terms of from Mexico. So all of those factors have impacted
the volumes while we've had this drought in terms of our corn crop that everyone is focused on. So it was almost like a
perfect storm. But we feel pretty good about the future. Assuming normal trend line yields, our network is probably in
better shape now than we were going into it in terms of being able to handle the upside.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Quick question on the core pricing gains of 4%. As we look into the back half of the year sort of
all things being equal, if you do get that lift from domestic coal, if weather does cooperate, would we see the core
pricing numbers go up because of the previous legacy renewals?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, Jason, you could. I mean, the math of it is as some of those legacy contracts that
we repriced if the volume increases, that's a benefit for us this year. So we'll have to see how it plays out.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: And sticking with the coal theme for my follow-up. How's the PRB looking in terms of sort of
going to get some Eastern burn going forward? I know we've seen a little bit of a switch out from some of the eastern
plants, Illinois Basin. Is there any room for PRB to pick up some steam?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Eastern utilities, they have a choice between PRB, they have the choice between Illinois coal,
they have a choice between Central Appalachian coal. And the decision tree is different for different utilities based on
where they are in terms of scrubbers and other environmental investments that they've made, the materials that they
would need to cleanse the coal, like lime. So I mean it's a different equation for every utility and I think every utility is
looking at that equation and the mix of what they want to do. And in that context we are continuing to have discussions
with eastern utilities.

<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: But you think there's a good chance that that could pick up in the future?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Eastern utilities, they're making these decisions. They're investigating Southern Powder River
Basin coal as one of numerous options. We are excited about that. We want to facilitate that, but there's a lot of factors
that go into their decision.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, fair enough. Guys, thanks for the time as always.

Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Rob, would you care to talk about
the magnitude of the fuel surcharge lag impact in the quarter? Could you kindly hang a number on that for us?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, John, I'd say it was a tailwind that when you consider the recovery, the lag, the
price of fuel, et cetera, it was a tailwind of $0.01 or so.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: So, not a major factor in the quarter.
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Right.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: And then also on the expense side, in a world where volumes were down 0.5% to 1%,
expenses were up 3%, which seems to run in the face a little bit of the company's long-running objective to try and
offset cost inflation with productivity. Was the mix in traffic to more manifest the main driver of that, or was there
something else going on?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Yeah, John, as I commented earlier, manifest was a part of it. I talked about the personal
injury item. While improved safety performance year-over-year it wasn't as good as last year's prior period adjustment.
So that's a factor. Headcount, our hiring as we talked about, our hiring partly manifest, partly just getting ahead of the
curve on some other replacement activities was a part of the activity as well.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Mine are just two kind of follow-up questions.
First on intermodal, can you tell us on the domestic side whether all of your growth right now is coming from
conversions or is there any, in other words, is the economy playing at all a negative, flat, or a positive factor on your
domestic side? Or is your entire growth coming from truck to rail conversion?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I would use actually two-thirds, one-third. Two thirds conversion, one-third economy. So the
majority of our growth is coming from conversion.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. And in terms of your employee count, just to follow up on that. You had mentioned
that you wanted to grow your employee count somewhere less than volume. It seems that it's growing at least more
than volume in the first half. So is that to indicate that we should see a reduction in your employee count in the back
half of the year? Am I reading that right?

<A - Lance M. Fritz>: You know, that would be pretty hard to say. So if you look at it Walter, right now about half of
that employee count was driven by capital spending, PTC investment and those kinds of things. One of the phenomena
that we're seeing right at the moment is hiring for the replacement of people who will be retiring and leaving the
workforce. We have probably a few extra people at this point in time because they're in training for the second half of
the year and those kinds of things. But I don't think it's going to change.
I don't know, Rob, do you see it differently?
<A - Robert M. Knight, Jr.>: Well, mix will play a factor. But, again, our overall guidance is the net effective head
count when you set capital aside will be up or down with volumes with the assumption that we'll continue to get
productivity behind that.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So roughly how much of you guys here are capital people that are compared to last year?
How many have you added for capital purposes versus last year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob had said it was about half of our growth in head count was capital and about half was
driven by other.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Follow up on PRB. I think at the Investor meeting in October you mentioned
export coal might be 7 million tons or 8 million tons this year. Does that seem reasonable, and could you add color to
that smaller part of the franchise?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Last year we had about 7.6 million tons of export , which I think was a record year. We might
have a couple of points higher than that. We might end up at 7.8 tons this year.
Frankly, the export market was somewhat disappointing this year given some of the economic difficulties, particularly
in Europe, less so in Asia. We do expect that as the world economy grows that the export market should strengthen and
there will be upside to that. But this year will be a little higher, call it around 8 million tons, averaging up.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And Eric, is that exporting through Houston to Europe; is that right?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: You have exports from our network going through the Gulf, and we also have exports going off
the West Coast to Asia.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: And switching subjects to PTC, I guess. As PTC spend is becoming more fully more
implemented and larger, do you at this point, as you're getting close to this large spend this year foresee any economic
benefit from this?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. The short answer is no. So just a level set for everybody. PTC is an overlay system that
sits on top of what we already have. It only is designed to do four things, all of essentially stopping trains prior to an
incident. There is no productivity benefit to that. As a matter of fact, we're managing the project very aggressively so
we don't get hit by a productivity hit. Because the only thing that could happen is if the system isn't working well, it
could reduce our effective capacity. So we're working very hard not to let that happen.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our final question this morning is coming from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Good morning guys, and thanks for fitting me in. I think you mentioned that the third
quarter guidance for ag volume would be down slightly. And I guess what I was trying to get some help figuring out
how if we get the crop that we planted for that volume could recover, kind of as we moved into 2014.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Crops really impact the fourth quarter. The harvest really doesn't start until late in the third
quarter, late September. So it's really, crops coming in is a fourth quarter impact.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay, so the majority of the recovery there should sort of end sort of mid fourth
quarter?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yes, that would be our expectation, David.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Great. And then one last quick one. With the mix of export moves that you have
relative to utility, do you have a sense for the average length of haul between those two chunks? I know the total coal
business is in the 960 mile, 970 mile range. I was just trying to figure out if exports is longer haul or shorter haul than
your average utility was.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: The stuff down to Houston would be about the same, and it'd be a little longer to California,
but I don't think it's going to be a big issue. It's kind of just so small – it's such a small tonnage I don't think it's going to
move any of our numbers.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Just the curiosity factor. Thank you very much guys.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You bet.
