MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the United Technologies First Quarter Conference Call. On the call today are Greg
Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jay Malave, Director of Investor Relations.
This call is being carried live on the Internet and there is a presentation available for download from the UTC's website
at www.utc.com. Please note the company will speak to results from continuing operations except where otherwise
noted. They will also speak to segment results adjusted for restructuring and one-time items as they usually do.
The company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking
statements provided in this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. UTC's SEC filings, including its 10-Q and 10-K
reports, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in
the forward-looking statements. Once the call becomes open for questions, we ask that you limit your first round to two
questions for a caller to give everyone the opportunity to participate. You may also ask further questions by reinserting
yourself in the queue and we will answer as time permits.
Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thank you, Samya, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on the press release this morning, UTC reported
first quarter earnings per share of $1.39, that's up 6% versus 2012 and a little higher than we expected due to a little
better than expected execution at Aerospace Systems and our Climate, Controls and Security business, as well as the
timing of some one-time gains.

Recall back in March we were talking about a $1.30 number that we were comfortable with. In fact in that $1.30, we
had about $0.05 of gains in excess of restructuring. We had enough with 2011, so about $0.06 of the $1.39 was a little
bit more than we expected on the timing of some gains out of the portfolio – the portfolio at CCS.
As far as the rest of the business, our integration remains on track and we continue to see strong performance in our
two major acquisitions, with Goodrich and IAE providing $0.21 of earnings in the quarter. Organic sales declined 2%,
partially due to tough compares in commercial aerospace aftermarket in the Transicold business. But we continue to see
signs of economic recovery, especially in North America and emerging markets.
Europe, however, continues to be a headwind and the legacy PW4000 commercial spares at Pratt & Whitney have yet
to recover. So the path could be a bit even but we are confident in our full year outlook.
On slide 2, on a positive note, order trends that you see on slide 2 indicate that the majority of our portfolio is
well-positioned for a resumption of top-line growth as we progress through the remainder of the year. Just a reminder,
we'll talk to orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do.
In our commercial businesses, we see good traction in North America. The housing and commercial construction
markets are improving. Americans are investing in their homes again, and our North American residential HVAC
orders are up 11% versus last year.
The ABI, or the Architectural Billings Indices, has now trended above 50 for the past seven months and we see that
coming through in our orders, with Otis new equipment orders up 21% in North America. We did see a decline – a 12%
decline in our North American commercial HVAC orders. This is on a tough compare and we continue to expect that
business to grow 2% to 4% for the year.
As I mentioned, Europe remains a challenge, although we do see some bright spots. CCS's commercial refrigeration
business, their orders grew 11% in Europe and Otis new equipment orders grew 21% with Russia, France, and the U.K.
more than offsetting weakness in southern Europe. However, CCS's commercial HVAC and fire and security product
orders were down 14% and 5% respectively. So we're not quite out of the woods in Europe yet.
Otis continues to gain momentum in China. Building on the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, orders were up 27%
in Q1. CCS commercial HVAC orders were down slightly while the fire and security product orders grew 8% in China.
Our position in emerging markets continues to pay off with combined BRIC orders for the commercial businesses up
22% in the quarter.
Turning to Aerospace, we saw modest improvement in our commercial aftermarket business at Aerospace Systems.
Spares orders were up 2% on a pro forma basis with strength primarily from the legacy Goodrich business. However,
we have yet to see a recovery of Pratt Whitney, where legacy commercial spare orders were down 28%. Continued
declines in wide-body PW4000 orders were partially offset by strong growth in the V2500.
The rate of decline also reflects a tough compare to last year and a strong book-to-bill in the fourth quarter. With
increasing airline traffic, record load factors, declining oil prices, and airlines projected to earn more than $10 billion
this year, we still expect an increase in order rates as we move through the year.
On the military side, although we didn't see a significant impact from sequestration, we do see the impact of DoD
budget cuts and a reduction in flying hours with aggregate pro forma aftermarket sales down 10% in the quarter across
the aero businesses. So we'll keep a close eye on the aerospace aftermarket and look for signs of more stabilization in
Europe, but order rates and macroeconomic trends broadly support our assumption for growth as we move through the
year. We remain confident in our full year guidance of earnings per share of $5.85 to $6.15 and sales of $64 billion to
$65 billion, that's up 3% to 5% organically.
Okay. Now, on to slide 3. Taking a closer look at first quarter results, total sales and segment operating profit increased
16% and 15% respectively, driven by the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions. Climate, Control and Securities continues to
realize savings from integration as they increase profits 8% on a 3% decline in organic sales. And Otis continues to
gain momentum with organic sales growth for the second consecutive quarter.

EPS of $1.39, as I said before, included $0.11 of gains in excess of restructuring. About $0.15 of combined gains came
from the tax adjustments related to the 2012 tax extenders, which were passed by Congress in January of 2013 and the
ongoing portfolio transformation at CCS. These gains were partially offset by $0.04 of restructuring. Excluding these
items as well as $0.21 of net gains from last year's first quarter, and earnings per share increased 16%, again driven by
the IAE and Goodrich acquisitions.
Free cash flow in the quarter was 88% of net income. CapEx was $295 million, that's up nearly 60% versus last year as
we prepare for the ramp in commercial aerospace. We also restarted our share repurchase program in January,
acquiring $335 million of our stock, and we expect to buy back a similar amount here in the second quarter.
Let me stop there for now and I'll talk more about the full year in just a second, but first let me turn it over to Jay to
take you through the segment results.
Jay Malave
Thanks, Greg. Turning to page 4. Otis sales improved 2% in the quarter, led by solid mid single-digit growth in new
equipment and continued growth in service sales. Excluding the impact of currency, new equipment sales were up in
the Americas, Europe and Asia, with North America, Russia and China leading the way. Operating profit was
essentially flat at constant currency. Continued weakness in southern Europe offset the benefits of volume growth and
continued cost reduction in the rest of the world.
New equipment order growth was strong, up 24% in the quarter with double-digit growth in the Americas, Europe and
Asia, led by 27% improvement in China. Order strength in Russia more than offset weakness in southern Europe.
Thanks to a growing order book and near-term completion of factory transformations around the world, Otis expects to
see improving performance as the year progresses. Guidance for the full year remains unchanged, with profit expected
to be up $100 million to $150 million on mid single-digit sales growth.
On slide 5, Climate, Controls and Security increased profits 8% in the quarter on 7% lower sales, resulting in another
sharp increase in margins, up 170 basis points from prior year to 13.1%. Organic sales were down 3%, driven by a
steep decline in container shipments on a difficult prior-year compare combined with weak European markets, partially
offset by high single-digit growth in the Americas residential HVAC business. China was up low single digits while
Asia overall was flattish.
CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth despite a decline in order – organic sales. Profit growth was driven
by restructuring of productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security,
lower commodity cost and the absence of ongoing losses from a business we divested in the first quarter last year.
Global commercial HVAC orders were down 8%, following 9% growth last year, with double-digit declines in North
America and Europe, partially offset by low single-digit growth in Asia. Orders for global Fire & Security products
were down low single digit, and the field businesses were down about 10%. Transicold orders were up 30% and
commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were up 11%.
With solid results in the first quarter and anticipated organic improvement, we continue to expect our profit growth of
$150 million to $200 million on mid single-digit organic growth – sales growth at CCS.
Turning to Aerospace on slide 6. At Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by the
consolidation of IAE and the transfer of the AeroPower business. Organic sales were down 2% year-over-year as
declines in commercial aftermarket and military businesses were partially offset by higher commercial engine OEM
and power system sales.
Large commercial spare sales were down 19% organically over last year's first quarter, which was the strongest of
2012. On a reported basis, large commercial spares were up 23% including consolidated IAE sales.

Operating profit in the quarter was down 3%. The impact from lower organic volume and unfavorable mix along with
higher pension cost was partially offset by the benefits from the IAE consolidation, lower E&D and restructuring
savings. The quarter also benefited from a partnership settlement and contract close-outs, which more than offset the
absence of last year's contract close-out benefit.
For the full year, we continue to expect Pratt & Whitney's operating profit to be up $100 million to $150 million on mid
to high single-digit sales growth. UTC Aerospace Systems delivered a solid quarter, with operating profit of $509
million on sales of $3.3 billion. As Greg mentioned, Goodrich has gotten off to a better-than-expected start and
contributed $0.18 to earnings per share in the quarter. On a pro forma year-over-year basis for UTC Aerospace
Systems, sales were up low single digit with commercial OEM up high single digit partially offset by weakness in
military aftermarket. Commercial aftermarket sales were up low single digit.
Orders for commercial spares grew 10 – 2% on a pro forma year-over-year basis, and commercial spares book-to-bill
exceeded 1 for the second straight quarter. Compared with the fourth quarter, which was the first full quarter with
Goodrich, Aerospace Systems sales were up 3% and operating profit was up 50%. Operating profit was – growth was
driven by about $90 million of purchase accounting-related adjustments, conversion on higher OEM, and commercial
aftermarket sales volumes, as well as lower E&D. With a solid start to the year, we remain confident in full year
guidance with sales of $13.5 billion to $14 billion and operating profit of $2.1 billion.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 8. Sales declined 7%, driven by lower military aircraft and aftermarket volumes, partially
offset by higher commercial aircraft deliveries. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a total of 40 aircraft, including 30
military and 10 commercial. Operating profit declined 32% as a result of the lower overall sales volumes, headwind
from the multi-year eight-margin reset and higher pension costs.
During the quarter, Sikorsky and Boeing signed a strategic team agreement to support the U.S. Army's Joint Multi-Role
Future Vertical Lift requirements. The joint effort includes proposal to build a demonstrator aircraft based on
Sikorsky's X2 technology. For the full year, we continue to expect profit to be down $100 million to $150 million on
low single-digit sales growth.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay. Thanks, Jay. We're on slide 9 now. So good execution at the business units as we look to – further in our good
recovery as the year progresses. The businesses, as we've said, are focused on integration and execution as we wrap up
the final pieces of the portfolio transformation.
In the first quarter, we closed on the sale of the two regulatory mandated divestitures from Goodrich along with our
fuel cells business. We expect the last two large divestitures, so that's Pratt & Whitney's Power System and Rocketdyne
businesses, to close by the middle of the year. And CCS should have their portfolio transformation essentially complete
by the end of this year.
We also had several notable accomplishments in the first quarter that will drive organic growth well into the future. On
our first GTF engine, the Bombardier CSeries, we achieved flight certification, while the first A320neo engine
completed ground testing and will begin flight testing here in the second quarter.
We also had significant wins across the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems group in this quarter, most notably at
Embraer. With the selection of the GTF to power Embraer's second-generation E-Jet, Pratt & Whitney is
well-positioned on the next-generation regional jets, a key growth market over the next 20 years.
We also won a new position for wheels and brakes at Embraer. The combined wins across the Embraer regional jet
shows the value we bring to our customers and are early examples of the benefit of the Goodrich acquisition. As Jay
mentioned, Sikorsky and Boeing announced a partnership to submit a joint proposal for the Army's joint multi-role
technology demonstrator, and that's going to be based on Sikorsky's X2 technology. Sikorsky also took orders for 15

commercial helicopters in the quarter.
On the CMH program, we continue to have discussions with our customers but there's really nothing new to report at
this time. We remain committed to the program and are ready to begin pilot training, and we are going to maintain our
placeholder of eight aircraft deliveries for 2013.
In the commercial businesses, we continue to win orders in key emerging markets. Otis's 27% order growth in China
included an order for 151 elevators in a high-end luxury residential complex near Shanghai, and CCS was awarded a
contract to provide two data centers in China with
HVAC, fire suppression and chiller control systems. So just as you heard from the Presidents in March, each of our
businesses is well-positioned in our core markets, and continued innovation will allow us to drive long-term organic
growth.
Okay, taking a look at the rest of 2013. No real changes from what we told you last month. We remain confident in our
guidance range of $5.85 to $6.15 despite a potential $0.10 impact from a sequestration. The order rates in our
commercial businesses are good leading indicators for a resumption of organic growth, and we'll keep a close eye on
commercial spares as well as the European market.
We'll also see some easier compares over the course of the year. You'll recall that last year, Pratt & Whitney's organic
spares sales were down only 4% in the first quarter versus 19% decline over the rest of the year. And Transicold
entered 2012 with a very strong backlog in the container business, which they burned down in last year's first quarter.
This was followed by double-digit sales declines in each of the next three quarters. So you should see CCS revert to
organic growth here in Q2.
And we're going to continue to invest in restructuring. With visibility, some additional gains, and good payback
restructuring projects across the business, we now expect to spend about $350 million on restructuring this year, all of
which will be offset by one-time gains. We spent $52 million on restructuring in the first quarter, and we would expect
that to be level loaded with about $100 million of restructuring in each of the next three quarters.
The remaining gains, however, should come largely in the second quarter. So on top of the $185 million of gains you
saw in Q1, we'll see about $150 million to $160 million of gains here in the second quarter. Also, strong cash flow
remains a hallmark of UTC and we continue to expect free cash flow will equal or exceed net income for the year.
In the first quarter, we paid down almost $400 million of debt and we bought back $335 million of shares while
maintaining a cash balance of $4.8 billion. We will continue to de-lever and we now expect to pay down about $2
billion of debt this year, $1 billion that we will target for here in the second quarter and the other $1 billion, which is
due in the fourth quarter.
We're also going to maintain, for the time being, our placeholder of $1 billion each for share repurchase and M&A. So
no surprises. The UTC portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage of the mega trends of urbanization and
commercial aerospace growth over the next decade. As always, we're going to remain focused on integration and
execution in 2013 and on our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable earnings growth.
With that, let me stop and open up the call for questions. Samya?

<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning, Ron.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Quick question on the PW4000. All right, so they were down, I guess, organically a bunch
in the quarter. What – why would they come back, I mean, aren't the 67s getting parked? I mean what do you expect to
see to have that actually come back?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We know you're going to ask that question, Ron. Yeah, look, it's a complicated story. Let me
try and take you through some of the pieces as we see it today. Right now, there's about 2,500 PW4000 engines in
service. And over the last five years, that's come down in total about 3%. And we expect that, that's going to continue
to come down 1% or 2% a year for the next five years. So you're naturally going to see some attrition in the portfolio.
But at the same time, the average age of these engines is only 14 years. We fully expect these things to have a normal
lifecycle of 25 to 30 years. So at some point, they will come back. There's some excess material out there in the – of
engines, obviously, from some of the retirements, but just not significant enough. So they will come back for LLCs. We
will start to see a more normal run rate here as we go throughout the year, so pretty confident.
The other thing just to put it in perspective, so there's 2,500 4000s out there. Today, there are 5,000 V2500s out there.
We're going to sell another 3,000 engines over the next five years or so. So the Vs are really going to be the story going
forward. And we saw that in the quarter. If you dissect that 28% down, what you see is that the 4000s were down about
just under 40%. I think they were down about 39%. But the Vs, on the other hand, were up about 34% on the legacy
piece. So again, I think we've made this bet on narrow body. It's going to pay off. And again, I think it's all manageable
in terms of what we're seeing on the 4000s in the – over the course of the year.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay. Okay. And then maybe if I can, just a follow on to that same question. So are you
seeing, I mean relatively young engines with not that many hours on them, relatively speaking, coming off airplanes
that are getting retired, competing with your own spares? Is that kind of part of the issue?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Not really. In fact, what we're seeing – I mean again, these engines have been out there, I
think there are some engines that are 25 years old. The PW4 is, in fact, more than that, probably almost 30 years old for
some of the early 4000s. So some of the older engines are coming off, which is providing serviceable material. We also
see the airlines continuing to try and take spare engines and use them and not induct them into the overhaul shop. So
inductions actually on the 4000s are lighter than what we had expected just because the airlines are trying to do what
they can to conserve cash. So, okay, oil prices at $90 a barrel. I think airline traffic still very high, capacity very high.
We really think that we're going to see kind of a return to normal on the 4000s. There's just not enough engines out
there in the fleet that have been retired to provide enough spares to support the fleet that's out there.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, Ron. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: First thing is, can you just quantify the partnership settlement and contract close-outs in Pratt
and how much that helped?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. So last year, there was again some contract close-outs that gave us a benefit of about
$0.02. This year, we've got contract close-outs and a couple of other things which benefit us between $0.04 and $0.05,
let's say, so kind of a net $0.03 year-over-year benefit at Pratt.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then just talk about lower E&D at Pratt and also UT Aerospace Systems, E&D is
coming down. And so I'm trying to just understand how come R&D is up year-over-year from $544 million to $610
million. Where is that additional spending going?
<A - Jay Malave>: Ron, that's just a function of Goodrich – I mean, sorry, Sam, that's just a function of the Goodrich
acquisition year-over-year, just consolidating the results versus last year. They weren't in the results in the first quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: All right.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That was about a $100 million of that. So Pratt did come down, I think, $34 million. They're
well on track to come down to $75 million to $100 million. The CSeries, as we said, that's certified. The neo is going to
flight test here shortly. So you will see a real ramp-down in E&D in Pratt as we move through the year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Sam.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: First question is just back on the Pratt spares. Heard everything you said. Could you quantify?
I mean, you're confident this is going to come back. Are you able to quantify what you believe is the new normal level
for this and where are we relative to that? So how much under the long run level of PW4000 do you think we're
running?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, obviously, we're down 40% this year in the first quarter, 39%. That will get better.
Again, we had a very tough compare last year and some strong sales of the 4000 of some LLCs that drove up last year's
first quarter. Yeah, I think that rate that we saw, down 15% last year. We think that kind of the normalized rate that we
saw in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year is the same rate that we saw this year in the first quarter. That
rate should pick up. Again, we still have the airlines out deferring maintenance and just not doing inductions into the
shop. So at some point, these are going to come back.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: And do you think you're still on track for overall 5% organic growth in Pratt spares?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, but I think the mix is going to be different. I think the 2000s have held up pretty well.
We saw good orders there. The Vs have been better than what we expected on the legacy side, and the 4000 is a little
weaker. But I still think with the price increase and everything else that we see out there, we can still get to that 5%.
Yeah, we might be a little light to that if the 4000s don't come back at all, but you do see strength in the rest of the
portfolio there.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And then just one more, Greg. Overall organic growth, you're still saying 3% to 5%.
You were minus 2% in Q1. What do you think the profile will look like over the rest of the year? And did you expect
Q1 to be minus 2%? Or were you thinking more like flat before?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I think when we were – as we were looking at the year back in December, I think we
saw kind of a flattish first quarter. It came in a little bit light there. Again, I think CCS, we knew the issues that we're
going to see there because of the big compare issue on container. We knew Sikorsky was going to be down. We didn't
expect spares at Pratt to be down as much as they were in the quarter. So that's a little bit of it. But again, I think it's
generally you're going to see a gradual recovery. We'll see organic growth in the second quarter, and it will pick up
through the course of the year. And again, what I'm looking at is order intake, especially at the commercial businesses.

good. So again, there is momentum with the backlog. It's growing and we should see that play out in higher sales as we
move through the year.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah, Joe, to that point, we did see sequential growth in the backlogs at both CCS and Otis new
equipment. So that gives us some confidence as we go throughout the year besides just the compares getting easier.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay, Joe.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Jay Malave>: Morning.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: For a moment, just to follow a little bit more on Joe's question with the diversified business
the way you have, you always have some puts and takes. Where else did you see some things outside of the 4000 that
surprised you on the downside? And where were maybe some strengths that you hadn't planned for?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think the one thing I'll say – it's hard to say it surprised us. We knew Europe was
going to be weak. The order rates at CCS on the commercial HVAC side were probably a little weaker, and we didn't
see any real traction on the server side of the business, from the F&S business in Europe either. But I wouldn't say
that's a real surprise. Maybe we had hoped – I think Geraud had talked about kind of 1% to 3% growth in Europe this
year, in his markets. Again, I think we did see good growth in truck trailer in Europe. We also saw good growth in
truck trailer in North America but – so there are pockets of goodness in Europe. It's not as dire as people might think. I
mean we've got good balance across the portfolio. So even if service at CCS is down, I think with truck trailer up, it's –
there's nothing really out there that I would say is a big, big concern as we move through the year.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then on the – you've outlined to some degree what you think the gains and the – and
also where the restructuring is going to be. Could you provide a little more color on that or a little granularity?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: In terms of the restructuring actions?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yes, please.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So again, we have identified about – well, in fact, we probably identified more than $350
million of potential actions, and you're going to see that as you would expect both at CCS, at Otis. You're going to see
some more at Pratt. The Aerospace Systems Group – you know the Goodrich integration is going well but there's about
a $100 million of restructuring we'll do there. And even Sikorsky as they see volumes down on military, you'll see
some restructuring. For the most part, the programs that we're looking at today have paybacks between one and two
years.
So as I do that, as I take up that restructuring to $350 million, it actually gives us a little bit of cushion this year, as well
as some runway next year. So again, I think they'll be the typical actions. We're looking to move to low-cost sourcing.
We're looking to make sure that we right-size the business. We know cuts are coming on the military side. We've seen
that already in the aftermarket. So we've got to right-size the business for what we see as the market demand especially
on the military aerospace side.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then the gains you said, can you just qualify them?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So again, the – yeah, the gains I think we had $185 million in the first quarter. The biggest
piece of that, it's funny to call it a gain, but that was from the tax extenders package. That was the R&D tax credit for
2012 that got passed in 2013. Not sure that's great policy to incentivize us to spend in 2012 and 2013. But that's another
story. The other piece of that was the portfolio transformation. We sold the Hong Kong guarding business at CCS.
Those were the two gains. How many are in the second quarter, we see gains on the divestitures that we've got out there
as well as a little bit of additional good news on taxes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, Greg.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Howard. I'll get off my soapbox.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Carter.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple quick ones. One, I wondered if you might expand a bit on Europe and maybe
quantify how much Europe was down in the quarter in the commercial businesses and just what you saw in terms of the
progression of orders over the quarter, March relative to February relative to January. There seems to be a pretty
significant slowdown there. So I wondered if you might be able to provide some color on that.
<A - Jay Malave>: Sales – I'll start with sales, Carter, and I'll get into orders. Sales at Otis were up high – low single
digit. Sales at CCS were down high single digit. It was pretty much across the board. You had declines of commercial
HVAC. You had high single digit declines in commercial refrigeration and you had declines in the fire and security
businesses. On the orders, as we said, Otis was up 20% in the quarter and CCS was a little bit mixed, as Greg said or as
I said before. Commercial refrigeration was up 11%. Transport refrigeration in Europe was up over 20%. HVAC was
down mid-teens, and F&S was also down, I think, in around mid single digit. But again, none of this was a surprise. We
have built this in and we've had Europe as pretty much a headwind going for the rest of the year and it's embedded
already in the guidance.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. And I would also say there was no big trend change during the quarter where all of a
sudden things just went to hell in a hand basket. I mean it was simply kind of a continuation of what we saw throughout
the – all of last year, southern Europe remaining weaker than northern Europe, and emerging Europe especially Russia
being a lot better and really the biggest growth opportunity. But we saw growth in the U.K. We saw growth in
Germany. It was not just across the board bad news.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: That's great color. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. On the Goodrich accretion, you called
out $0.18 in the quarter, obviously, that tracks to a bigger accretion number than you were outlining for the year at
$0.60. You also called out a $90 million in purchase accounting adjustments. Did that impact Q1 in a particular way
that made that larger? Or how should we be thinking about Goodrich accretion over the course of the year relative to
what you – your previous guidance was?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think Goodrich did do a little bit better than what we had expected and, not
surprising, trying to under-promise and over-deliver here on the biggest acquisition we've ever done. But Goodrich has
been nothing but good news for us. And again, I attribute that really to the Aerospace Systems team down there.
They're doing a great job integrating the business. They've got great people and again, taking care of the problems as
they find them and not having any big surprises. So again, a little bit better in first quarter, and I would hope that, that
trend would continue. Again, as I'm thinking about this, the balance works theme here. Again, a little bit of upside on
Aerospace Systems this year could offset a little bit of weakness on the commercial spares. So in total, Alain's business,
the Propulsion and Aerospace Systems, feel pretty good about the guidance we've got.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gents.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just a couple other follow-ups. Just back to Otis, the strength in both Europe and China, I
guess, in both cases, do you think there is some share gain going on there? Are the markets really that strong? And I
guess in China in particular, if you can provide some color on what's going on in the pricing environment.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, so in China, I think the market is very, very strong. I don't want to think that there's
been actually a big gain in share because, as we saw Conair reported this morning, they've also had very good results in
China. The market in China is very strong. I think property transactions in the first quarter were up 60% in China. So
again, the market's a lot better than what we had anticipated. We saw that starting in the fourth quarter. We're also
getting traction, I think, in China with the new products. We've got the new low-cost gen-2 for social housing. We've
tailored the products to that market. So again, we're getting good traction, but I wouldn't say we're gaining share
necessarily, but it certainly feels pretty good when you have orders up 27%.
As for Europe, again, it was a mixed bag, again, strength in the U.K., strength in Russia. I think obviously, we're
probably gaining share there, also strength in the Middle East. But southern Europe continues to be kind of a drag, and
that's really more of on the service side than it is new equipment. There really isn't much of a new equipment market in
southern Europe today.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And I just didn't totally understand what Jay said when he was talking about container orders. I
wasn't sure if he said off or up. Were container orders up in the first quarter?
<A - Jay Malave>: Container orders were up over 40% in the first quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: They were.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So you remember last year in the first quarter, we came in with this big backlog of
containers, and so sales at CCS were very strong in the first quarter, but the order rates started to decline. And then we
didn't really see any orders in container until that must have been about September. And then it started to pick up and
that trend that we saw in the fourth quarter just accelerated here in the first quarter. So – and containers is a short-cycle
business, but the leasing companies are buying and it looks like they're going to have a pretty good year. I think Geraud
had talked about up to 15% for that market for the year.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And just one last one and I'll pass it. If you could speak to where the HVAC price cost and
what's going on there. Are you feeling cost relief given what's going on with raw mats or are you getting kind of an
associated drag-down on selling prices as the raw mats come down?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. In fact, I think we feel pretty good about cost price. There was a price increase, it's not a
secret, back in, effective, I think January 1. So far, so good there. Some of the commodity benefits that we see again,
it's short-cycle. It's been up and it's down. It's been as high as about 390 last year. We're pretty well locked in on copper
for the year, a little bit above what the current price is but, again, copper is a commodity that continues to come down
in importance at CCS as we move, especially on the commercial side, to more of the aluminum plate fin heat
exchangers. So again, I think generally, we feel pretty good. It's never an easy pricing environment, but I would tell you
that it's – CCS is making some good strides. We've got a great distribution here in the U.S. and good product
innovation and that's helping a lot.

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thanks so much. So your release refers to defense impact at Sikorsky in the first quarter.
Could you kind of explain that and maybe give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of sequester impact on the
total business?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Let me have Jay take you through Sikorsky and I'll take a shot at the sequester question.
<A - Jay Malave>: Cai, Sikorsky, they had lower deliveries on military aircraft. The aftermarket was down. The
military aftermarket was down a little bit over 20%. So that's really where you saw the big impact. The deliveries we
knew about, but that was partially offset by some strong growth in commercial aircraft deliveries. And I think just this
quarter, we had 40 deliveries. We're expecting north of 240 deliveries for the full year. So you would expect that
volume to increase as we go throughout the year. So partly it was just timing of deliveries, partly it was – particularly in
the aftermarket was due to cuts.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: As far as the sequester impact, Cai, I'd love to tell you that we can quantify it any better than
what we did 30 days ago, but unfortunately, the customers aren't sending us invoices with a 10% reduction for
sequester – sequestration. So we're hearing about it, we're starting to see a little bit of it in terms of the order intake. I
think Jay talked about the aftermarket was down 10% across aerospace – military aerospace in the quarter. And that's
really just a reflection. Again; reduced op tempo in Afghanistan but also reduced flying hours here.
We see some of the fighter wings being stood down for the remainder of the year, canceling some of the exhibitions.
And again, all of this is going to have an impact on us. It's just going to take a while for it to play out. So we continue
to say it's probably about a $0.10 impact, but again, it's hard to see it beyond that. I think that the bigger concern is on
the – these furloughs at the FAA, if they start driving the higher cost on the commercial airlines, what that could do to
spares. But again, I think that should be a relatively small impact for us.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: You mentioned military aftermarket down 10% and seeing some cutback in flying hours. I
think in December, you were still kind of asserting at least in March, still asserting military aftermarket would be up at
Pratt. It looks like it was down. So where do you now expect military aftermarket to be for the year at Pratt?
<A - Jay Malave>: Well, Pratt – at Pratt, we're expecting it to be flat to slightly up, Cai, not much growth there. In the
quarter, we actually saw growth in military aftermarket at Pratt, really on the back of F100, F119, and F135 spares.
That was – the F100 and F119 was really more of a reflection of the strong order sales in 2012 just built the backlog
that delivered here in the first quarter. The F135 was more a function of just provisioning. We have over 80 engines
that have been delivered program-to-date and so just a matter of provisioning start to accelerate.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And so do you expect the military aftermarket still to be flat to up for the year at Pratt?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: At Pratt, we do. I think what we're – when we talk about that 10%, what you really saw was
at Sikorsky and at the Aerospace Systems group; you had military aftermarket down about 20%. So good news at Pratt
in the quarter, but offset by bad news at Sikorsky and at UTAS. I think again, the Sikorsky number is a little bit worse
than what we had expected. On the OEM side, we knew exactly where we're going to be from a military delivery side.
But those spares have been a little worse than what we expected at Sikorsky. So we need to keep an eye on that as we
move through the year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And you mentioned you still have a placeholder of eight CMH deliveries. Could you
give us an update on your progress or lack thereof with the Canadians? And I mean if you don't have – you can't say

when you're going to have a settlement, I mean I assume the eight is going to be a zero until you have a settlement,
correct?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, yeah, look, we're expecting that we're going to ship those eight in the back half of the
year. But I wouldn't say we're not making progress. We continue to have discussions – good discussions with the
customer in Canada. Again, this is a very complicated procurement program in Canada between Public Works and the
Department of Defense. We're working with both sides of the Canadian government. We're trying to get to a win-win
solution here and it's just taking longer than what anybody wants it to.
Obviously, we're ready to begin pilot training. There's four aircrafts up at Shearwater. I think number 26 of the 28 is on
the production line down on West Palm Beach. So we're building them. We're still not done with some of the mission
software, but we are making very good progress with that. So yeah, again, we'll get past this. I can't tell you whether it's
next week or next month or the month after, but I still think we have a pathway to deliver additional helicopters, and
the key for us is to get the pilots' training to begin and we're pretty close to that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Dave.
<A - Jay Malave>: Morning, Dave.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Greg, just following up on Cai's question on CMH, the charge that you guys took in the
fourth quarter, does that reflect delivering the interim configuration aircraft? Or does it reflect not delivering the interim
configuration aircraft and waiting until final configuration?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: All right. So the charge that we took, $157 million, I think, it was in the fourth quarter, that
assumed that we weren't going to deliver any aircraft until 2015 when all of the mission systems software would be
done. So it didn't anticipate an interim solution even though we think ultimately that's the best for both ourselves as
well as for the customer to start delivering these interim aircraft to get them flying. But the charge was a more
conservative view of the fact that we weren't going to be able to deliver anything until 2015.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. So if we get to some sort of agreement that reflects a move towards taking – the
Canadians taking on the interim configuration aircraft potentially it could be some good news?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, but I wouldn't – yeah, there might be a little bit of good news. You're right. Again, this
is – but again, I wouldn't think it's going to be a big number.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then China, I know you talked about the strength in China overall in Q1, but can
you talk about maybe what you saw as we went through the quarter. It looks like January and February started off
pretty strong but then as we've gone into March and April, things might have fallen off a little bit. And I think your
guidance for China overall reflects about 7.5% to 8% GDP growth this year. You still feel that's the right place to be?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, we do. In fact, it was a weird compare because the Chinese New Year was in January
last year, February this year. So January started off gangbusters, then February was slow. And then March was even
better than, I think, what anybody had expected. Again, we're – the units are up significantly. We've got good order
intake. And even in April, I think we're continuing to see a solid order intake. We just did the operating review last
week with Otis. They're very confident in the China story for the year.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the aero-systems margins for a second.
The implied guidance, I think, is around 15.6% or even slightly below. So I'm curious, is there – usually or historically
both Goodrich legacy and Hamilton legacy got better as the year progressed on the margin side. And I guess that $90
million purchase accounting, is that something that hit here in the first quarter, or to your earlier point, Greg, how much
conservatism is baked into Aerospace Systems?
<A - Jay Malave>: Myles, the $90 million is simply a charge that was taking in the fourth quarter related to the
inventory step-up. It just didn't – it doesn't repeat because it got – the inventory step-up got fully liquidated in the fourth
quarter. So what you're dealing here with now is just – is recurring earnings, which is consistent with our guidance of
$2.1 billion. I mean based on what we forecast, we expect it to be fairly flat level loaded as far as operating margins
throughout the year. But as Greg said, it's – it possibly could be some upside. It's a little early to make that call.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, as you think about it, we had about just under $50 million of net synergy benefit in the
first quarter. And we're talking about $200 million for the year. Obviously, as those synergy benefits continue to pick
up, that's going to be accretive to margins. And again, I think that there's probably a little bit of good news, but it's just
– it's April. So we're going to wait another quarter here before we decide that it's actually that what the upside might be.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. I mean it just seems like the aftermarket would get better historically those margins
expand through the course of the year. So I'm just trying to get at...
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: ...if there's anything in the first quarter, but it sounds like there wasn't.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No, I don't disagree with your thesis though, Myles.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And the other question kind of clean up was on discontinued operations cash. It looks
like it was a big use in the quarter and I guess I don't know what the cause of that was.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Unfortunately, the federal government requires us to pay taxes when we make a gain. So the
gain on the sale of the industrials, which closed in December 15, we paid the taxes here in the first quarter. So that was
the big cash outflow.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay, makes sense. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning. Greg, Hamilton Sundstrand had no organic growth in the quarter. Is
that a combination of OE growth, aftermarket growth, offset by military being down?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think if you look at it – you know, the commercial aftermarket was essentially flat at
the legacy Hamilton business. Military, as I said, was down significantly and then commercial OE was up, I think, 8%
or 9% in the quarter.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah. Okay. And then at Otis, the margin this quarter was a little bit less than I thought. Is
that still a mix issue and where OE was a little bit worse than service? And does that change going forward or are we
still seeing a lot of pressure from the aftermarket renegotiations?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So, yeah, I mean margins were down and this actually should be the low point for the year in
terms of Otis margins but a big chunk of this was as we picked up about a point of mix in new equipment versus
service so that's actually detrimental. As you know, service margins are obviously better than the OE side, so that was a
piece of it. Again, pricing, tough around the world, tough in China but we're holding the margins, I think, and we
should continue to see benefits.
The other thing to keep in mind at Otis, we're in the process of some of this plant transformation, and we're closing our
Nogales plant and opening up the facility in Florence, South Carolina. We've got the new Chongqing plant and there
are some expenses in the first half for the year, which are actually holding margins down a little bit that should get
better as we complete those transact or transfers.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, gents.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So I hate to ask you obvious question, but where is the contingency now at the midpoints given the
sequester, et cetera?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, it's actually – remember, back in March, we said we were comfortable with analyst
consensus, which at the time was 6.10 with about a $0.10 impact from sequestration. So again, there was no
contingency at 6.10. Again, if you go back down to the midpoint to $6 obviously, we've got a little bit of good news.
And again, as we close out the quarter, again no surprises here. So really there are some puts and takes. Maybe UTAS a
little better, Pratt a little worse in terms of spares, but I think overall, feel pretty good. We got benefit from the euro.
Again, we've seen it at 1.28. It's been 1.32, 1.33. So right now, I would just tell you at around 6.10, there is no
contingency but that includes an impact from sequestration and we'll – that we'll expect we'll see over the course of the
year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. So no change, that's great. And then switching to Otis, obviously, great backlog performance
this quarter, but how does margin look on that backlog?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Actually, margin doesn't look bad. Again, pricing is tough in China so the margins there are
going to be a little bit under pressure. But again, as we fill up the factories with all these orders going through, that's
going to help overall margins there. So even though new equipment, the sold margins are a little light. Maybe we can
pick that up. And then in North America, we're actually seeing much stronger – better – stronger margins in the new
equipment. Pricing has stabilized. We're not seeing, again, all of the cutthroat competition that we had. And again, the
market's picking up. So that's good news on new equipment margins.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah. Otis continues to take out cost. They've done a gate – a great job of taking out cost of the
elevator unit costs, and Geraud – I'm sorry, Pedro showed that in the March meeting. And that's going to continue. So
feel confident that margins will remain, and we'll leverage the volume going forward.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then just going back to Jeff's question on the CCS copper prices obviously down a fair
bit. Assuming that pricing holds on the equipment, why wouldn't the low copper price benefit the second half of the
year as you go through these rolling hedges?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Mostly because we've got the year locked in at a price a little bit above what the current
market is. So the market is, I think, around $3.20 today because of concerns over China. We can see that $3.20 move to

$3.60 or $3.70, I think, pretty quickly, but we're locked in for the year. So the CCS guidance assumes locked in copper,
no real benefit from further commodity cost reductions. Again, that benefit, again, you'll see it next year as we'll start to
lock in buys for next year in today's lower prices.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I see. And just one quick one. Obviously, container was down a fair bit this quarter, but orders
suggested going to come back strongly in 2Q and beyond. How much mix headwind did you have from container this
quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: In terms of...
<Q - Nigel Coe>: On CCS margins?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I don't know that I've got that number off the top of my head.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yeah, I don't – we don't – I mean I guess, look, the one thing I'll say about CCS is their operating
margins across the board are fairly even, so they've got much more balanced, and I'm not sure that it had a huge impact,
but we'll take a look at it again, Nigel, and get back to you on that.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That'd be great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks a lot. Yeah. So I guess my first question is within CCS, you've had a bunch of
companies Ingersoll , Schneider and so on complaining about how weak foreign security is as an end market right now.
Could you just remind us how much of CCS post-release divestments is foreign security and what your sort of
expectations are for the year in that business?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, just one second, Julian. I'll get at that for you. So I think – let's see here. If we think
about fire and security, again, the products piece of the fire and security business has actually done quite well. We see
pretty good strength here in North America. It's been a little bit weaker in Europe. We've really seen kind of the
headwind has been on the service side in Europe and that's been really the result of just what's just going on
economically here in Europe some of the service businesses, the margins have not been very good, been trying to be a
little bit more selective there. But in China, for instance, I think security is up very strong. We had a good traction with
the GST business. I don't know, Jay, do you have the exact...
<A - Jay Malave>: Just rough order of magnitude here, Julian. Out of a $17 billion portfolio, about $6 billion is fire
and security.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Got it. And you're expecting that to be kind of flattish or up in line with CCS overall for the
year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think on the product side, you'd expect it to be up in line. And then on the service
side, a little bit light to that overall kind of 5% growth.
<A - Jay Malave>: It varies regionally.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah.
<A - Jay Malave>: Europe, the expectations again were flattish to maybe up slightly.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Sure. Thanks. And then just my follow-up would be again just circling back to the Otis
margins, as you said, Q1 you had – you didn't have sort of the operational leverage showing up because of the mix of
OE versus service. I guess it's likely that European service stays weak and the orders suggest that OE growth in terms
of revenues should accelerate. So you're probably dealing with that mix hit for the balance of the year. Are you
therefore expecting an offset to come from a lot more restructuring savings coming through, or is it just the falling out

of those costs around the plant transformation?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It think it's a – it's obviously a combination of both. Otis was pretty aggressive with
restructuring last year. They've got more restructuring to do this year, which will be accretive to margins and then
you've got the factory transformations which get done really by mid-year. So that's all going to help, I think, on the
margin mix side.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay. But Q2 you already see the margins going up sequentially and maybe year-on-year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah.
<A - Jay Malave>: Yes.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: They should. Yes, absolutely.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: All right, Julian, thank you much.
