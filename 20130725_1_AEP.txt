MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this
conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Julie Sherwood. Please, go ahead.
Julie Sherwood
Thank you, Ernie. Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Webcast of American Electric
Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website,
aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause
future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.
Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian
Tierney, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. And now, I'd like to turn the
call over to Nick.
Nicholas K. Akins
Thanks, Julie. So, thanks to everyone for joining us today. The second quarter, while on its face may seem uneventful,
there have been some significant developments that warrant further discussion and define the mileposts for future
action. The challenges we face with the economy, capacity markets, and an industry in transition provide the forcing
functions for change. That is exactly what our management team in this company intends to do: face these challenges
head-on and provide the tools for our employees to be agile and adapt to an ever-changing environment.
So from the outset, financial measures for the quarter were on track and respectable, and have not changed our plans for
the year or our guidance that has been previously provided. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.69 per
share and $0.73 per share from an operating earnings perspective, which was slightly less than the $0.77 per share for

second quarter 2012. So, year-to-date puts us at $1.44 per share of GAAP earnings and $1.53 per share operating; while
again, is slightly less than last year. The difference in GAAP versus operating earnings primarily is that the net of an
impairment related to Muskingum River 5, which did not clear the PJM capacity market, and the benefit of a Supreme
Court ruling regarding the tax benefits related to a U.K. windfall profits tax.
Our board yesterday did approve the quarterly payment of a dividend to investors of record of $0.49 per share, which is
AEP's 413th consecutive quarter of paying a dividend; so, steady as she goes from the board perspective. With the
basic financial numbers for the quarter out of the way, I want to give you my perspective on the challenges we face and
what we're doing about them.
But first, let me cut to the chase. We are reaffirming our guidance range for 2013 of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. And
despite the challenges before us, we still maintain expected long-term earnings growth rate of between 4% and 6%.
Albeit, the results of the 2016/2017 PJM capacity auction has tested our business case for the upside beyond this range,
but through capital allocation, particularly to transmission, regulatory recovery support and performance improvements
that benefit our customers, operations, and bottom line performance, our management team is committed to living up to
the 4% to 6% expectation.
You know, too many times we equate only load growth with earnings expectations. While that equation may still be
partially true, our business has changed. It is more about optimization, performance improvement, and disciplined
capital and operating expense management that is driven by a culture of optimism and expectation that we can get the
job done; and we will.
So, let me discuss some of the challenges I see. An economy that continues to be tenuous at best, I think you're seeing
this all across the country, and for the past quarter industrial loads in our footprint has continued to be down;
commercial load was down slightly, and residential load held flat. Brian will discuss the numbers in detail, but because
margins are different by rate class, financially, the impact was only $0.02 per share year-on-year if you look at those
traditional retail footprints. But with the addition of generation and marketing adding $0.04 per share, which includes
our retail earnings, actually the performance – the financial performance of serving load is up.
So now, let's take a look at the regulatory recovery support. The asset transfer cases in Kentucky, Virginia, and West
Virginia are moving along. In Kentucky, a non-unanimous settlement was filed that provides for the transfers of
Mitchell, as planned, with recovery of Big Sandy-related conversion costs. In Virginia, we have made the case that the
Wheeling merger, along with the Mitchell transfer, is in the public interest, as well as the transfer of Amos. And in
West Virginia, we just concluded hearings that we feel confident we demonstrated our case for the transfer of Amos
and Mitchell, along with the Wheeling merger, that's in the best interest of customers.
Why do we believe we just put on excellent cases in these jurisdictions? These are fully controlled units that are least
cost options that provide a secure supply to customers for the future in lieu of the capacity payments that were paid
through the AEP pool to the other operating companies. We believe we have strong cases and we'll soon find out the
outcomes, with the first order expected from Virginia by Wednesday, followed by West Virginia/Kentucky during the
third quarter. A SWEPCO Texas rate case order related to Turk is expected in third quarter that will be retroactive to
late January 2013, and Brian will discuss this timing issue in our second quarter reporting on this subject.
We're hopeful that the PUCT, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, will see beyond the short-sightedness of the
ALJ decision in this case, particularly as it relates to the notion that we should have stopped construction of Turk late in
the game. This is tantamount to hindsight in regulation and should be rejected by the Texas commissioners. The PUCT
commissioners need to send a strong message that Texas jurisdictional capacity can get built and recovered in the state
that desperately needs capacity. Customers are benefiting from the exceptional generating unit that is 15% more
efficient than any super critical unit in the country and, thereby, saving customers considerable fuel costs. This is a win
for Texas customers and should be afforded the recovery in the ROE that is deserved for this major investment, and
sub-10% isn't reasonable.
In Indiana, two positive developments have occurred that further improve the recovery of the Life Cycle Management
program at Cook and the recovery of the dry sorbent injection equipment at Rockport. The $1.169 billion, less about

$23 million of incremental upsizing costs, were approved for recovery, which was $741 million jurisdictional to
Indiana and allowed the deferral of other project-related costs for future recovery related to the Life Cycle Management
program; so, very good outcome in Indiana in this regard.
Regarding the Rockport DSI projects, just yesterday a settlement agreement was filed to allow the full recovery of the
dry sorbent injection systems. 80% would be through a tracker and 20% deferred for the next rate case; so, another
great outcome. Also at Flint Creek, we received an order earlier in this month to allow recovery of the scrubber
installation, and the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved that.
So, now let's talk about performance improvement. I'm CEO of AEP, but many of you may know I'm also a rock
drummer. And one of the biggest challenges – I know that's hard to believe, but one of the biggest challenges for a
beginning drummer is to separate the movement of the right hand and the right foot. At first it's not natural, but after
practice it becomes second nature in its reaction to play and react to different kinds of music. I tell you that because too
many times we assume that work has to be performed one way, or even the old way, only to find out there are better
and more efficient ways of improving processes and – while reducing operating expenses.
This is what we're doing at AEP. Too many times we assume performance improvement is only about cost-cutting;
therefore, we think that expense reductions are not sustaining. This is just not true. I've been involved with just about
every operational business function in this company and what our employees are doing to reinvent this company is
truly phenomenal. So, I've decided to give you a little insight to help you understand our sustainability initiative and
what we're doing relative to our ability to adjust to this changing environmental – environment that we operate in,
particularly in the light with the questions about capacity markets, load forecasts, and so forth. We estimate that we'll
exceed our expense reduction revenue enhancement targets for 2013, do our repositioning and Engage to Gain
employee programs, while increasing O&M spends in specific areas of prioritization, such as transmission, cyber, retail
and other things. So, I think it's important to note that we are being mindful that we need to add O&M in certain places
and prioritized areas and, at the same time, achieve the O&M objectives we set out for ourselves for the year.
So far, as well, are three plants who have gone through the Lean processes; have been just transformational for these
generating plants. We've achieved between $5 million and $10 million of savings per plant in this analysis and that
process hasn't ended. The third plant is only in its eighth week of doing these Lean initiatives and it's just amazing, the
kind of things they come up with. And, oh, by the way, next year we'll have six to eight plants about this time going
through the same process. And we have between fifteen and twenty plants to go through this process. So, it's important
to note that we are far from done. And a lot more work to do, but a lot more savings will enure as a benefit as we go
forward.
We've executed a supply chain RFP that generates substantial savings in the tens of millions of dollars just by going out
for bid with repositioning programs standardized from equipment specs and enabled us to do that kind of buying. And
typically we haven't done that in years, but we've now done that and it will provide tremendous benefits. We've also
done things like changing limestone specs and suppliers, lowering auxiliary loads and minimum loads at power plants;
and the list goes on and on. But, it's also a work in progress and there's many savings initiatives yet to follow.
We would not have increased O&M in some areas if we believed that second quarter O&M timing issues were a
problem. We're putting a culture of continuous improvement in place that will achieve savings this year; and, yes, will
help mitigate the impact of the 2016/2017 capacity auction results. Chuck Zebula will be also looking at this business
like a private equity investor with the help of Generation employees and corporate to reduce expenses commensurate
with what the capacity market dictates.
AEP has issues with this regulatory construct we sometimes call a capacity market in PJM. This version of socialism
that equates DSM and non-firm transmission with reliable capital-intensive steel in the ground is really just capitalism
in a sandbox, where the rules seem to penalize long-term investors. This has to change or we'll eventually have a donut
with PJM being the empty middle and reliability will suffer. PJM is fully aware of our concerns and hopefully will
react accordingly, because change is desperately needed.

Regarding President Obama's speech, I'll refer to Page 5 of the presentation. And in that you'll see – I was actually –
when I heard the President's speech, it was a little different than what the actual write-up of what the initiative was. In
the write-up, it talked about things like clean coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewables, electric vehicles with the eGallon
approach, which I find pretty intriguing to talk about the dollar per gallon equivalent for the electricity side of things,
and transmission was discussed. So for that perspective, it was a balanced approach.
But I guess the proof comes with what the administration will do, and the EPA will do, as a result of some of the
activities they're going through. It's certainly clear that they need to be consistent and reasonable in their approach. And
I think that, as you can see from the Page 5, our 2015 estimate shows that we'll exceed even the Waxman-Markey
litigation targets of 17% by 2020 because of coal retirements, coal-to-gas switching, and energy efficiency and
renewable resources, as well as transmission optimization.
The industry itself has already achieved 16% reduction because of these activities, so this is not a time to really impair
the economy even further. The mercury rules and the natural gas revolution has already achieved the objectives that we
have set out to try to make consistent progress commensurate with the Waxman-Markey limitations before. So, there's
no reason to further cripple an economic recovery of this nation by adding or even – adding a larger burden of onerous
greenhouse gas requirements that further jeopardize the economic recovery, and even the electric grid itself.
I believe a Gina McCarthy-led EPA will be more responsible and reasonable, particularly with what has already been
achieved with the mercury rules where, certainly, we're seeing more retirements related to that; much more than even
the EPA had anticipated. So hopefully, we'll wind up with a reasonable solution that we can work forward with,
particularly as it relates to existing units. We would propose an efficiency type of requirement and, certainly, we have
striven with our plants to find more efficiency gains; and we continue to do that.
Lastly, I'll point to my favorite graph, which is back on Page 4. I know there's been some comments earlier this
morning about this, but this a 12-month ROE view. And as we look at this thing, APCo is continuing to improve. We
expect that to continue to improve. I&M has a rate case that was completed that's not fully reflected in these numbers,
so its ROE will certainly improve upwards toward 10% in the coming year. And then, as we look at SWEPCO – the
SWEPCO rate case in Texas, it is retroactive back to the end of January. So, when – and Brian will talk about this, the
AFUDC part of the analysis versus what's actually going to happen when the rates become effective and they're
retroactive back to that point. So, we'd expect SWEPCO to move up toward the 9%, 9%-plus range. So, we continue to
see improvement in those areas and it's really because of the capital intensiveness, but also the cases that have either
been completed, waiting for an order from the commissions, or they just haven't fully been reflected in these numbers.
So, we continue to be optimistic about how this chart will look as we go forward in the year.
So with that, I'd have to say that, overall, the second quarter has been a typical second quarter: weather-dependent,
load-dependent. But as you know, the third and fourth quarter is where AEP certainly sees the benefits of not only the
timing related to O&M, but also from an earnings standpoint, what occurs during the rest of the year, during the hot
season and the cold season. So again, thank you very much for attending and I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 6 with the reconciliation of this year's second quarter
to last year's. As you can see, American Electric Power's operating earnings were $0.73 per share for the second quarter
as compared to $0.77 per share last year. As I will discuss, this decline of $0.04 is explained by the effect of certain
Ohio transition items, with our regulated businesses showing a net favorable impact for the period. The largest item
adversely affecting the quarter-over-quarter comparison includes a combination of certain Ohio transition items that
were unfavorable, $0.09 per share.
This effect on earnings included the reversal of a prior period fuel provision last year, worth $0.05 per share, and lower
capacity payments from competitive suppliers totaling $0.04 per share. Operations and Maintenance expenses, net of
offsets, increased slightly, adversely affecting earnings by $0.05 per share. The higher expense levels were driven
primarily by additional spending associated with storm restoration and incremental plant outage work performed in

2013. We continue to focus on controlling our expenses across all functions, particularly overhead costs, and expect to
see this impact back-end loaded in 2013. We anticipate that O&M, net of offsets, will be close to flat when compared to
2012 on an annual basis. We will discuss this more, later.
Weather played an unfavorable role in our quarterly earnings comparison. Temperatures were milder across all of our
jurisdictions, adversely affecting results by $0.04 per share. However, weather was $0.02 per share favorable versus
normal. Allowance for funds used during construction, or AFUDC, was off $0.03 per share in 2013 versus 2012 due
primarily to the startup of the Turk plant in December of 2012. With the inclusion of Turk and Louisiana and FERC
wholesale rates currently, and with the anticipated rate order in Texas, this item will be offset in rate relief as the year
progresses.
Other items, in total, were unfavorable by $0.03 per share and include lower results from River Operations segment due
to weaker market conditions and challenging operating results. Regulated retail load was down from the prior period,
adversely affecting the quarterly comparison by $0.02 per share. This decline is being driven by lower commercial and
industrial sales and we'll talk about this later – more, as well.
Items positively affecting the quarter-over-quarter comparison include continued growth in our Transmission
Operations business, for $0.02 per share, and higher interest income for the quarter of $0.06 per share. This latter item
is largely the interest income component of the favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling associated with the U.K. windfall
profit tax treatment. The operating income treatment here is consistent with how we've previously treated this
component of the case. The positive benefit of the tax credit itself is being treated as non-operating and is also
consistent with prior period treatment. Finally, rate changes were favorable by $0.14 per share in the second quarter of
2013 and are the result of rate activity across multiple of our jurisdictions.
Turning our attention to the year-to-date comparison on Slide 7, you can see that the company's operating earnings for
this year were $1.53 per share compared to $1.57 per share last year. I'll focus my remarks on the significant
differences from the quarterly explanations. Adverse year-to-date comparisons include the Ohio transition items that
were unfavorable $0.20 per share, O&M expenses, net of offsets, and River Operations were negative for the
year-to-date reasons similar to the quarterly comparison. And the effective tax rate was negative by $0.05 per share.
The tax rate difference was driven by positive prior-year tax adjustments that were not repeated in 2013, as well as
unfavorable book to tax differences, which are accounted for on a flow-through basis.
On the positive side of the ledger, the most significant contributor to the Other category, which was up $0.03 per share,
was the Generation and Marketing segment, which Nick had mentioned earlier. Transmission Operations and Interest
Income were up a combined $0.09 per share for reasons similar to the quarterly comparison. And in contrast to the
second quarter results, weather through June was favorable compared to the year-to-date in 2012 by $0.07 per share.
Weather was favorable by $0.04 per share relative to normal. Finally, rate changes were favorable by $0.21 per share in
the first half of 2013 versus 2012, with the improvement again coming from multiple of our jurisdictions.
In summary, we continue to face the challenge of offsetting the unfavorable effect of Ohio transition items, but remain
on track to achieve our earnings guidance range for 2013. I'll remind you that the Ohio transition items were included
in our guidance for the year. We're clearly being challenged in the area of regulated load, but expect to exceed our
forecast in other areas. As we always do, we will continue to manage our businesses and adjust accordingly as we work
our way through the year. We are confident we are on track to deliver results within the stated guidance range and we
will discuss this again in more detail, later.
As I mentioned earlier, I'd like to spend some time looking at our regulated load, so far this year. Turning to Slide 8,
you can see in the lower right hand quadrant that weather normalized load was down 2.7% for the quarter and 2.1% for
the year-to-date period. The decline in both periods was driven by lower and industrial sales.
Residential sales were close to flat for the quarter, but the year-to-date results were driven by strong results in the first
quarter. The residential class, shown in the upper left quadrant, was comparable to last year's second quarter, down just
0.1%. Year-to-date, residential sales show a favorable 0.7% increase as compared to the same period last year. We
continue to see some modest Residential customer growth of 0.7% in our western service territories, but none to speak

of in our eastern areas.
In the upper right hand quadrant, you can see the 2.1% decline in commercial sales for the quarter. Year-to-date,
commercial sales were down only 0.9%, aided by stronger results in the first quarter. Our sales to commercial
customers have been the strongest in Texas and Ohio, where growth is being driven by stronger employment growth.
Finally, in the lower left quadrant you can see the declines I mentioned earlier, where industrial sales are down 5.3%
for the quarter and 5.7% year-to-date. If you exclude the effect of our largest customer, which has been operating at
reduced levels, the declines would have been 3.1% and 3.3% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.
While not minimizing the importance of these declines, it's important to note that the effect on gross margin associated
with declines in industrial class is less than in other classes. The average realization from industrial customers is less
than half that of residential customers. And a larger portion of the rate is driven by demand charges that adjust to lower
levels on a lagging basis. Because of this, we are not alarmed, from an earnings standpoint, by overall load being down
relative to forecast. As Nick alluded to earlier, the mix of load and margin differences result in overall year-to-date
earnings only being off $0.02 per share, despite a year-to-date normalized load decrease of 2.1%.
As I have done on previous calls, I'll pause here to share some economic indicators for AEP. The company service
territory continues to experience stronger growth than the U.S. in terms of GDP; although, the growth is not evenly
distributed. For the quarter, GDP growth in AEP's western footprint was 2.7% compared to 1.8% growth in the eastern
part of AEP's territory. That's compared to an estimated 1.9% growth for the U.S., in aggregate.
Unemployment for AEP's total service territory, at 7.1%, is still lower than it is for the U.S. as a whole, at 7.6%.
Employment growth for the U.S. has finally caught up with growth within AEP's territory after having lagged behind
since the start of the recession. Job growth in AEP's western footprint of 1.5% is identical to that for the U.S. as a
whole. Estimates for job growth in our eastern service territory moderated this quarter to an increase of 0.8%.
Let's turn to Slide 9, where you'll find load trends for the quarter from our five largest industrial sectors. Our largest
sector, Primary Metals, was down 16% from last year's second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the curtailed production
at our largest customer – and excluding that effect, this sector would have been down closer to 8%. We are seeing other
customers reducing operations until market conditions improve and some are taking advantage of the situation to retool
their operations and add efficiencies for their ultimate return to operation.
Chemical Manufacturing was down 2.6% for the quarter. This decline was widespread across our service area, with the
exception of Texas. Even with low natural gas prices, market demand remained soft.
Petroleum and Coal Products were up 1.2% for the quarter versus the same period last year, reflecting a new refinery in
Texas that reached full capacity in June of 2012. Two refineries were down for maintenance in the first quarter.
Excluding those customers, this sector would be up 3.5% for the year.
The Mining sector, excluding Oil and Gas, was down 1.2% for the quarter. This continuing decline reflects the effect of
recent mild winters, low natural gas prices and low utility demand. Approximately 90% of AEP's mining load is
located in our eastern footprint.
Paper Manufacturing was up 2.5% for the quarter, driven by higher demand in Ohio that more than offset lower
demand in the west.
Although not in our top five sectors, we also continue to see growing sales in the Oil and Gas Extraction and the
Pipeline Transportation sectors, driven by continued expansion related to shale gas activity.
Slide 10 provides an opportunity to update you on the financial health of American Electric Power. Our debt to total
capitalization remains very healthy at 55.2%. This ranks among the lowest levels for the company in recent history.
Our credit metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to total debt, are solidly triple B and Baa2, at 4.5 times and 19.1%,
respectively.

Our net available liquidity stands at nearly $3.5 billion and is underpinned by our two revolving credit facilities and our
parent term loan credit facility. In order to be able to obtain a private letter ruling on the tax free nature of our pending
corporate separation, we terminated that parent company term loan facility and reinstated the same program at the
subsidiary level. Now, Ohio Power, AEP Generation Resources, Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power will be the
direct borrowers of the facility. The size and tenor of the facility remain unchanged and, due to the ratings of the
subsidiaries, transaction costs should be recovered by reduced borrowing costs.
On the bottom left side of the slide, you'll see that our qualified pension liability is nearly fully funded at 97%. This is a
result of aggressive funding over the last three years and this year's higher discount rate. In addition, due to the changes
that were made last year in our post-retirement medical plans for future retirees, as well as higher discount rates, our
other post-employment benefit liability is now fully funded.
And finally, this week we priced our inaugural securitization for American Electric Power in Ohio. Specifically, $267
million of securitization bonds, comprised of $165 million with a weighted average life of 2.25 years and a $102
million with a weighted average of just over five years, were priced at a duration-weighted yield of approximately
1.59%. The closing date for the issuance is scheduled for August 1.
This marks additional progress in our 2013 financing plan and is particularly beneficial to AEP for two reasons. First,
we strengthen our balance sheet as we transition a regulatory asset into cash. And second, we ease the burden on our
customers who realize a substantial reduction in the carrying charge on the regulatory assets. The net present value of
the savings to the customer is estimated to be nearly $24 million.
The management and board remain committed to the financial health of the company, as exhibited by the items that
you see on Slide 10. We will continue to demonstrate O&M discipline, careful capital allocation, and thoughtful access
of the debt capital markets.
Let me spend some time on Slide 11 talking about our recent success in reducing the baseline utility operations and
maintenance expenses in recent years. We focus on the base spend because we have been successful in getting certain
O&M items placed into trackers with contemporaneous revenue increases for rate-making purposes. From 2010,
through estimated year-end of 2013, the compounded annual growth rate for the company's base O&M spend has been
negative 2.9%. This spending discipline did not happen by accident. The employees of AEP have been hard at work on
repositioning the company for the competitive environment we are facing.
In 2013, we formalized the program and engaged our employees to focus on five distinct areas of efficiency
improvements, cost saving initiatives, and revenue enhancement programs. In addition to the examples Nick provided
earlier in the call, another example of the progress our employees have made is in the Procurement organization. At the
beginning of the year, we asked Craig Rhoades to take the role of Chief Procurement Officer. Among the initiatives
that Craig and his team have undertaken was to select a single integrated maintenance repair and operations supplier for
all of AEP. This selection will allow AEP to take advantage of its buying power on behalf of its customers and allow us
to reap significant back office and process savings. Recognizing the competitive forces facing our business and the
challenges posed by low capacity pricing in coming years, our employees have chosen to continue and expand the
continuous improvement programs in to 2014.
Specific, targeted, and employee-generated continuous improvement is becoming part of our culture at AEP. We have
come to realize that it works. It makes our operations more efficient, engages and energizes our employees, and
provides a mechanism for wringing unnecessary activities and costs out of our operations. Those savings can be
channeled back into customer-focused operations and some can flow to the bottom line.
Nick mentioned some of the challenges posed by the capacity auction pricing in PJM. Expense savings through
continuous improvement will help us fill the gap created by the reduced revenues; so will capital rotation into faster
growth areas of our business, like Transmission operations. This is the same capital rotation that has allowed us to grow
earnings in this segment of our operations from $0.02 per share in 2010 to a forecasted $0.14 per share this year. It
would be a leap of faith for you to believe that we could be successful in these endeavors if our recent track record did
not demonstrate our employees' ability to successfully deliver these positive results. I would never bet against the

dedication, ingenuity, and hard work of the American Electric Power employee.
On Slide 12, I would like to point out some earnings contributors for the balance of 2013. Many of you have looked at
the first half earnings of 2013, added last year's second half earnings, and have expressed concerns about 2013 year-end
results. Those are concerns I don't share due to a number of the balance of year differences reflected on this slide.
First, we are awaiting an order in Texas, as Nick indicated, placing the Turk power plant in the rates. We anticipate an
order shortly, with those rates to be effective to January 29 of this year. Second, in the fourth quarter of last year, we
had a significant charge associated with refinancing of our parent company debt. That charge will not recur this year. In
addition, we had some significant expenses in the third quarter last year associated with the directional wind storm in
the eastern part of our service territory. While we expect some continued storm activity, we do not anticipate a large
storm of that magnitude. We believe the base utility O&M will be approximately flat to last year's level.
We are anticipating better river conditions and grain export shipments this year in our River Operations business as
compared to the dismal conditions from last year. Finally, we expect decreased depreciation expenses associated with
our recent write-off of the Muskingum River 5 unit in the second half of this year.
Given where we are in the year and how we are tracking to our plan, we are confident of our ability to meet our
operating earnings guidance range of $3.05 to $3.25 per share for 2013.
Thank you for your time this morning. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Your line
is open.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey Greg. How are you?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Good morning. Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I'm good. So, I hear your enthusiasm and optimism about the ongoing ability of the company to
improve ROEs in states where you're under earning and control costs. But I – there's still a lot of skepticism about the
very significant headwind between 2015 and 2017 coming from the most recent PJM capacity result, as it pertains to
your ability to sustain your 4% to 6% growth rate. So, will you just talk a little bit more about your planning horizon
and what you think the tools are in your toolbox to plow through that headwind?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. Greg, I guess we sort of learned this early on in my tenure. We had a $250 million
problem with Ohio. And now, this time around we have 2.5 to three years to get this fully resolved from a sustainability
fashion. But as I mentioned earlier on the O&M issues and the revenue enhancements that we have going on – it's
crescendoing over time. You know, like the plant ideas were an example of that, where we have six to eight plants
going through it next year and then the rest of the plants going through the following year.
And then, we also have the buying measures, the differences in the way they operate the plants. Certainly, the
unregulated plants are now looking at – they can look across the board at areas of fuel. Fuel is part of the business case
for some of the things that they do, which typically is hard to do in a regulated environment because of the different
capital versus fuel decisions. But also, Chuck is looking deeply at that team to figure out, okay, what the overhead costs
look like. We have to address that because it's in a competitive environment. These plants are focused on making sure
they survive. And they intend on doing that.
So I think – and really, I guess the optimism is coming from the fact that our employees have already come together to
find objectives in terms of savings and revenue enhancements for the year that are in excess of the targets that we had

in place; and that's sort of confirming this year. But also, it's setting the track record for the future years because we're
only getting partial benefits from some of these in 2013. Some of these things are starting to kick in now and will kick
in later in the year. And we'll get the full year benefits in 2014. And then, with the additional ideas and things that we're
doing, particularly [ph] lean wires (37:21), those types of activities will continue and we'll see those benefits going to
those future years.
So – and I guess another issue with that is mid-2014, there'll be another capacity auction for the future years. So, that'll
give us some insight in terms of how we deal with, in that specific year of late 2016 and early 2017 – which straddles
two years. But as well, we have to decide, okay, how much of this is one-time adjustments where we can move around
outages and those types of things versus how much is actually sustaining into the future. But it really goes to the
question of the volatility of that business and what that means to our planning associated with that. But – so, we're not
wasting any time, obviously. We're acting like we're going to have to have sustainable savings going forward that
compensates for the capacity auction in late 2016, early 2017.
But if it winds up being some – a capacity market moving up in the future, then that can be a different thing. But I think
– you know, we certainly are at a position now, though, to where we're confident that we are changing a culture that
focuses on our ability to address these types of issues. We have to. And that's what we're paid to do. And it's something
I think that our employees are certainly energized around to achieve. So, as I said earlier in the discussion I had – it
probably – I was thinking originally, well, we may be able to exceed 6% if we had more transmission spending and
those types of things. Well, the more transmission spending we have our eye on is going to fortify that 4% to 6% and
that's – so yeah, I mean, it'd be silly for us to sit here and say, well, it hasn't had any impact, because it has had an
impact. But I think it's had an impact on our ability to exceed the 6%, as opposed to being in that 4% to 6% range.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks very much.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yep.
Operator
Thank you. Next, we go to the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey. Good morning. Listen, I'm going to maybe carry on with Greg's question. I know you gave
a very thorough answer, but I guess just maybe a little more simply when you look at the Ohio generation and the
uncertainly that RPMs created around economic viability and visibility to the business, how are you guys seeing that fit
within AEP? Was RPM kind of a point where you were pushed to make a more drastic decision than maybe you were
hoping?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. I think, certainly, if capacity prices had stayed in there at a reasonable level it
probably wouldn't have had everyone questioning the 4% to 6% or the – or our ability to get the cost savings that we
needed to make sure we were sustainable into the future. I think it raises a lot of questions; and we're addressing those
questions. It's – but it also puts us even more focused on how we adjust that particular business.
And we talk about minimum load adjustments, for example. The Amos plant reduced its minimum load by over a
thousand megawatts, which that's a big change and takes a lot of cost out of the way we operate in relation to the
market. Our people have a very – I'm not going to say what it is, but certainly they have a very aggressive measure on
what they're trying to achieve in terms of a clearing price for capacity that they operate under. And that's – but we have
a lot of work to do. And I can say that that business, if it remains as volatile as it is, if we don't get this capacity
construct working to where it should, where it respects the long term investments made by steel in the ground investors
in the territory, then that's not something we're very interested in. And so, I – it doesn't fit what we believe our investors
are looking for and we'll need to make adjustments.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Dan, I know you've talked about this in the past. We were very aggressive in moving on
Muskingum River 5 as we saw the results of this and recognized that the capacity environment didn't lend itself to
further investment in that unit. And we're going to be very disciplined in terms of the capital that we put to work in that

regard. And right now, that's not an area that's attracting a lot of capital from us as compared to lower volatility, higher
growth areas like our transmission business. We've been disciplined in the past and we're going to demonstrate that
discipline as we work our way through this capacity pricing issue.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And, you know, I don't know that the generation function itself can make up that difference.
If you're thinking about what energy prices can be in the future – well, we don't want to bank on what energy prices are
going to be in the future. We just assume they're going to be low. So, we have to adjust accordingly and it's not just a
matter of looking at the generation – the unregulated generation business itself. It's also a matter of looking at the
overhead that's charged to that generation business, because if there's less units running, if they're running in different
ways and you're compartmentalizing the profit and loss picture of each unit, then it drives a very different supporting
structure from corporate that supports it. So, there's a lot of work to be done and we'll be doing it.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And if I could ask just one other question, just kind of looking at the load trends, and obviously
the other bankruptcies kind of skewed the industrial numbers and made it a little worse than they otherwise would be,
but usage trends haven't great. You've seen unemployment fall. You've seen economic growth in the region. What are
the prognoses, do you think, for power demand growth for your territories going forward? Is there something big or
structural happening from usage that's really going to limit the amount of future demand growth?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think we continue to see probably soft load because – and it's probably two things. Energy
efficiency is part of it. Also, it's an area where the economy through the entire country, but certainly in our area as well
– there's been a lasting impact of that. At the first of the year, economists were saying by the third quarter things would
pick up. We were always saying, and have been saying for several quarters now – actually since the third quarter of last
year, the industrials were tenuous, at best; and that continues to be the case.
I think that there are some structural changes that are occurring. We'll continue to have energy efficiency in play. The
question is, can the electrification of the economy outstrip the energy efficiency piece of the business that enables us to
continue to grow? But you can't bank on that, and that's why I say our business is going to be more about optimization
and providing services to customers, as well, that provide additional benefits beyond what you see just strictly in the
load numbers. But I also believe that, as Brian pointed out, the oil and gas activity in our footprint is prevalent, with the
Eagle Ford Shale or the Utica Shale, and others – those are wet gas. We have a lot of dry gas type formations.
If we can – if we ever get to a point where the economy starts to pick up like the economists keep projecting at some
point, we'll benefit probably more than others because of that indigenous growth associated with the shale gas footprint
and the production capability associated with it. So – and that's actually been our saving grace on the other Primary
Metals industrial losses that have occurred. So I'd say, certainly with the growing economy, but also with the intensive
focus on energy-related infrastructure, particularly in our service territory, that could be a benefit. So I'm – and I'm
probably more optimistic. I guess I'm probably – if there's pessimism, it's when's it going to happen? And we've all
been waiting for an economic recovery, and you hear a lot about housing construction. I see a lot of commercial and
housing construction in our service territory. And I also see the top of all the corn in the fields are still green; so, that's a
good sign. But we really do need an emphasis placed on how to move this economy forward.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hey. Good morning. Hopefully, two quick questions. One is, it seems everyone's
focused on the 2016 and beyond. Just wondering how could you help us maybe forecast transmission earnings? I mean,
you guys have a great trajectory in transmission earnings. I think, roughly $0.35 you're projecting in 2015. I mean,
what's the best way we could do to forecast it going forward? And the second question is kind of – you mentioned
during your opening remarks with RPM and it just seems like it's all over the map. It's just kind of throwing numbers
out of a hat. What does AEP think the reserve margin is with actually steel in the ground versus when you're adding in

all these – demand response and everything else?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So, I guess it's what steel you put in the ground that's important. We've already
finished our build cycle related to generation. So, Turk went operational. We bought natural gas. That's all done in our
eastern footprint. And so, we're at a point where we can decide, probably for the first time in a long time, where our
capital is deployed. Much of it was driven by environmental spend. It was driven by new generation spend. Now it's
driven by block and tackle infrastructure spending that typically commissions don't have an issue with. As a matter of
fact, they support it. And they should, because we're at a stage where there's a rehabilitation of the grid that needs to
occur. What we're trying to focus on is whether those no regrets types of activities – and optimization of transmission is
no regrets. Infrastructure build related to distribution is no regrets. Certainly, the investment we're making from an
environmental standpoint – we have about $4 billion to $5 billion left to spend associated with the particular plants that
we have.
But we're doing it in a very different way. We're not going out and building and then asking for recovery of it. We're
going in at the beginning and saying, okay, before we start construction on this thing in a big way, we need to know are
we going to be able to recover it. In the case of Kentucky, we haven't. In the case of Arkansas, we have; because there's
a different set of circumstances and we're more than willing to do that. Matter of fact, we want to move more of our
capital to those infrastructure areas. And that's the kind of steel in the ground that makes sense. With demand side
resources – certainly, I'm all for demand side resources, but not to the point of really jeopardizing the reliability of the
grid by depending on those kinds of resources for only a specific set of hours during the year, as opposed to the things
that we run into in the real world from an operational perspective.
I started out as a electric system dispatcher and my experience is actually in interconnected power system operations,
and I can tell you what's going on now is wrong; and it needs to be fixed. But that said, demand side resources –
certainly, generation with firm transmission coming into the area is a benefit. And we should be mindful of that,
because we're optimizing resources and we're actually defining a new set of resources that includes new technologies,
as well. So, my view is we stay with optionality around the resource side of things, but we've focused on those enabling
areas where we can accommodate those resources and provide better services to our customers.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Anthony, we hope to have some more detail for you on the growth trajectory of transmission
about the EEI conference timeframe. We're working on that capital rotation now. And one thing that we've never done
is showed you earnings that we hope to get, or think we might get, or projects that may come together. We've really
tried to show projects that are either approved or don't need further approval. And that's why we're reluctant to go out
too far in terms of the transmission growth rate beyond areas where we've been through the planning process at the
RTOs.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Anthony, I'll add on to that. We're already looking at additional transmission projects that
can be put in place and addressed more quickly because, frankly, that's part of the revenue stream and the additional
earnings that would partially fill the gap for this capacity issue that we had. So, we have every motivation to continue
with our transmission investment and every motivation to find and release every bit of capital. And one thing that gets
forgotten in all of this: the performance management side of things also produces capital alleviation benefits that can be
redeployed to other areas, including transmission. So, we're not just about O&M changes, we're about capital changes,
as well, to accommodate that – and fuel that future growth. So, as Brian said, at EEI we'll have more information on
that.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great. Thank you.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Jon. How are you?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: How are you doing?
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: I have a quick one on – just the quarterly sales in commercial. You mentioned, Brian, I
think, that you were strong still in Texas and Ohio, but you didn't really say very much about what had underpinned the
big drop. Was it a couple of specific items, or something more broad? Can you just give us a bit more color in what
suddenly turned so negative there?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Sure – and it was largely broader- based across the area. The places where we saw the
increase was really associated with shale gas plays, where we're seeing the growth in employment. And in the other
areas, we just weren't seeing that growth in employment as much as we were. It was pretty much broad-based across
the sector. The one thing, Jonathan, that I'll say, and we look at these monthly – we look at, we discuss with you
quarterly weather-normalized sales. You really need to look at, I think, the trend over time to try and understand what's
happening with load, and can't just take it quarter-to-quarter. Up modestly in the first quarter this year; down greater
than 2% in the second quarter. You need to kind of look at a trend line for these quarterlies to get some sense for what
you think is going on, but – with the exception of Texas and Ohio, the decrease was pretty broadly based.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, on the – just to understand this interest income
item, so there was like $0.06 of benefit relating to reversing a previous negative related to the U.K. windfall tax. Is that
correct?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. So, it's separated into two categories: one is the interest income component of it, and
the other is the tax component of it. Interest income we always reflect in ongoing earnings. To the point where it's
specifically associated with this item, we had a negative in the fourth quarter of last year as we thought that the case
was going against us, and then the PP&L won their case at the U.S. Supreme Court. And since we had previously
adjusted for this in operating earnings, the interest income component, we're just reflecting the same treatment that we
always had for interest income.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So, it was the negative – the negative was booked Q4 last year. This reverses that,
effectively.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Not – it doesn't entirely reverse it. We took a partial write-down of that in the fourth quarter
of last year where we had previously accounted for the interest income, and then we had the full reversal in this year.
But the full treatment of this issue has always been in ongoing earnings.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Is there any ongoing – beyond this quarter, do we have any continued impact from
this item?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Very little bit.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Just in Q3, or is that...?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It'll be true-ups as we work our way through the balance of the year; but very little.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. And then, could I just squeeze in one other thing?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Sure.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: On the whole conversation going on with the commission and Ormet around trying to
reduce their tariff. How should we – is there any kind of guidance exposure to that or how should we be thinking about
that as we watch it play out?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: You know, we – so, I wouldn't want to talk specifically about the discussions with the
commission that we're having. There are issues related to whether or not Ormet stays in business or not, altogether, and
those items are fairly small for us. If Ormet were to stop operations altogether, the pre-tax would be about $2.8 million
per month; so, for the balance of the year maybe $0.025, and for all of 2014 maybe $0.045 per share.

<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: That would be – the incremental would be the difference?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: That would be – if they – that's right. And that would be if they ceased operations, altogether.
But remember, Jonathan, there would be some offset for that, as well, in off-system sales as we'd have the incremental
energy to take out to the market.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, it's a large load, like many of these industrials. But that one, in particular – and if you
– we don't hardly make any money off of it to begin with, but then, if it did go away, then we'd be selling that in the
off-system market. So...
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: I got it. Thanks for the color.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys. Just on the PJM outcome and implications, does it have any
change besides Muskingum 5 to your coal plant shut down plans or EPA spend? Are those under any kind of review
because of that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I'd say, no, not at this point, obviously. We've addressed Muskingum River 5 – that was the
one issue where we had an incremental investment that would have to be made and is related to natural gas. So – and if
the market didn't support making that investment, then we retire it. The others are either planned to be retired, anyway
– which we've already written those off in terms of an impairment. So, the others are fully controlled units that operate
well in the market, but we're certainly focused on that year to ensure that we're driving costs out and efficiencies that
we can drive through the market to make sure they continue to operate. So, we don't see anything else at this point.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Steve, we've been proactive in getting out in front of this, as Nick mentioned. We had those
units that we knew we were going to retire in 2015, and the Ohio components of them we wrote off late last year. And
then we had bubble units – and Muskingum River 5 is one where we thought we were going to be able to retrofit it and
run it on gas through 2028, and the capacity results just made that not a prudent investment for us. So, it went from
being on the bubble to being a unit that makes sense for us to not operate after 2015.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.
