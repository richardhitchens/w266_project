As you saw in the press release today UTC reported solid third quarter earnings per share of $2.04 on 5% organic sales
growth. Gains net of restructuring was $0.22 in the quarter, which is higher than previously expected largely due to the
timing of some tax settlements in the third versus fourth quarter.
Excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items, earnings per share was up 12% and segment operating
margins expanded by 60 basis points to 17.2% in the quarter. That's a record for UTC.
With three-quarters of the year now in the books, we can look back at a pretty good start, 4% organic sales growth and
earnings per share up 11% year to date excluding the impact of restructuring and one-time items. As a result, we remain
confident in our 2014 EPS expectation of $6.75 to $6.85. That's earnings growth of 9% to 10% on sales of about $65
billion.
Okay. Turning to slide two, organic sales. As you see, organic sales grew 5% in the quarter with solid growth across all
five of our businesses. In the commercial businesses, we saw 5% growth in the Americas led by 9% growth in North
American residential HVAC as the U.S. economy continues to improve.
In Europe, where the economic recovery is uncertain, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. The commercial
businesses also saw 7% growth in Asia. In China specifically, sales were up 9% led by Otis which was up 12%.
Shifting to aerospace, for the first time this year, we did see growth in the military business which was up 3% led by
development programs at Sikorsky and solid growth in commercial OE and aftermarket continued where overall sales
increased by 9%.
Okay, slide three, let's take a closer look at our end markets. Overall trends remain positive for a majority of our
portfolio. Just a reminder, we're going to talk to the commercial business orders on a constant currency basis as we
typically do. In our commercial businesses we continued to see momentum in North America.
U.S. consumer sentiment reached a 14-month high in September, unemployment gains and optimism over wage
growth. As I mentioned before, North American residential HVAC sales were up 9% in the quarter and orders were up
a multiple of that. Very strong but driven primarily by early order activity ahead of the SEER 14 standard change that
goes into effect in January of 2015 for the southern and western regions of the U.S.
Positive ABI trends continue and the outlook for commercial construction remains encouraging. We saw proof of that
again at Otis where North American new equipment orders were up almost 60% in the quarter.
In Europe, a little different story. Europe's own PMI was at a 14-month low, although it did remain in modest
expansion territory and economic sentiment fell to a 10-month low in September as concerns over the economy
increased. We're obviously keeping a close eye on the economic situation in Europe and we saw mixed orders there in
the quarter. Commercial HVAC orders are down 11%. Although we did see 15% growth in commercial refrigeration
and fire and security product orders grew by 12%.
Shifting to China, at Otis new equipment orders were flattish versus the prior year reflecting the slower conversion of
pipeline opportunities to booked orders. However, new equipment backlog continues to remain strong at Otis, up 14%
versus the prior year. Orders for CCS commercial HVAC and fire products were both down slightly in the quarter.
Earlier this month in a move to bolster the housing markets, the Chinese government cut mortgage rates for second
home buyers and lowered down-payment rates to 30% from 60% to 70% previously. This actually marked the first time
since the 2008-2009 financial crisis that mortgage rates were reduced in China and signals the government's continued
willingness to use fiscal policy to support growth. While we continue to expect growth in China will moderate, it
should continue to outpace global GDP and our building and industrial systems businesses remain well positioned in
the region.
Moving to aerospace, with robust airline profits and ongoing growth in air traffic, we continue to see solid conversions
of our original equipment backlogs and growth in our commercial aftermarket businesses. At Pratt Whitney, total
commercial aftermarket sales were up 7% in the quarter and large commercial engine spare orders were up 1%. In our

Aerospace Systems business, commercial aftermarket sales were up 10% and commercial spares orders were up 11%
reflecting strength in both parts and provisioning.
You'll notice on the chart that we're highlighting the new metric beginning this quarter that is, commercial aftermarket
sales for Pratt Whitney and Aerospace Systems to better reflect the evolving business model from a transactional part
sales business to a comprehensive service business.
Let's talk a little bit more about that on slide four. You can see that illustrated for Pratt. Ten years ago, only 0% of our
engines were covered under a Fleet Management Program, or an FMP. As you can see, we've migrated. Last year about
50% of the Pratt fleet was under an FMP. This is going to continue to increase with time. The next generation engines,
the GTFs, we'll have about 80% of those engines covered under an FMP, or Fleet Management Program. This creates
value for our customers, the airlines as well as Pratt Whitney. We're incentivized with the airlines to keep the engine on
wing as long as possible and to improve reliability.
As we've entered into these FMPs, our customers have seen a significant improvement in the reliability of the engines
because we're able to maintain those engines at an OEM standard. Over time, we will see a gradual decline in the
transactional spare parts business as the legacy fleet starts to retire. The good news is that you have got the V2500 fleet
and the new GTF fleet replacing those spare part sales with FMP sales. So again, a changing business model and we'll
continue talking about aftermarket sales growth going forward for both Pratt and Aerospace Systems as it's a more
meaningful metric.
Taking a closer look at the third quarter results, total sales reported increased 5%. That's all organic. Segment operating
profit was up 8% and operating margins increased by 60 basis points including the benefit from pension. CCS saw the
benefit from organic growth and cost reduction initiatives where operating profit grew 9% leading to margin expansion
of 110 basis points.
Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems each expanded margins by 130 and 110 basis points respectively. Earnings
per share of $2.04, that's up 32% and of course, that benefits from the $0.22 of favorable one-time items net of
restructuring costs in the quarter. Recall that third quarter 2013 had $0.08 of net restructuring charges. So absent the
impact of these items in both 2013 and 2014 earnings per share were up 12%.
Free cash flow in the quarter was 83% of net income. Capital expenditures were $415 million, that's up 8% versus last
year as we continue to invest for the ramp up in commercial aero. And investment in working capital grew in the
quarter as well. We acquired $425 million of our stock under our share re purchase program and we now expect to buy
back another $400 million in the fourth quarter and that will bring share re purchase to a total of about $1.5 billion for
the year.
Let me stop there now but I will be back to talk more about the full year and provide a glimpse of how we're thinking
about 2015. First, let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the segments.
Jay Malave
Thanks, Greg.
Turning to page 6, Otis sales improved 4% in the quarter led by high single digit new equipment sales growth most
notably in China and the Middle East. Service sales were up low single digit overall with solid mid-single digit growth
in our businesses outside of Europe where we saw a slight decline in service sales in the quarter.
Operating profit was up 3% at constant currency. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contribution from volume
and net productivity offset by continued pricing pressure.
New equipment orders were up 4% in the quarter. New equipment orders in China were flattish reflecting a slower
conversion of jobs in the pipeline to actual booked business. We were encouraged by results in other areas, especially
the Americas, where orders were up sharply for the quarter and year to date. Whereas new equipment orders and
developed Europe were up mid-single digit in the quarter.

The recent strengthening of the dollar is creating headwind on Otis profit and we now expect profit to be up $50
million compared with previous earnings growth guidance of $100 million to $125 million. On a constant currency
basis we still expect Otis to grow profit by about $100 million for the year.
On slide 7, Climate, Controls & Security increased profit 9% in the quarter on 3% higher sales. Margin expanded by
110 basis points from prior year to 18.2%, continuing the CCS momentum in margin expansion. Organic sales were up
4% with growth reported by all regions. We saw strength in the Americas with the residential HVAC business
reporting 9% growth, and commercial HVAC up mid-single digit. Outside of the U.S., both EMEA and Asia reported
low single digit growth. Commercial refrigeration was up mid-single digit while Transicold was up slightly.
Profit growth in the quarter was driven by contribution from organic volume as well as benefits from restructuring and
integration savings. CCS global equipment orders were up 5% excluding the impact of the shift in order timing driven
by the pending U.S. regional cooling efficiency standard change.
Orders for global fire and security products were up high single digit, more than offsetting flattish fire and security field
businesses. Transicold orders were up low single digit. Based on year to date results we continue to expect profit
growth of $225 to $250 million for the full year at CCS on low single digit organic sales growth.
Turning to aerospace on slide 8, Pratt & Whitney delivered solid results with 15% operating profit growth on 5%
higher organic sales resulting in 130 basis points of margin expansion. Higher aftermarket sales across the businesses
including 7% combined growth in large commercial and Pratt Canada aftermarket, more than offset declines in military
OE.
Operating profit was driven by higher commercial aftermarket sales, favorable pension and restructuring benefits which
more than offset higher E&D. The quarter also benefited from favorable aftermarket contract performance and
licensing agreements which exceeded similar benefits from 2013.
Large commercial spares orders were up 1% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially building off the 7% sequential
improvement in the second quarter. Year to date, overall commercial aftermarket sales are up high single digit as
industry fundamentals and demand remain solid. This supports our full year sales growth expectation for the
commercial aftermarket business of up mid-single digit, despite more difficult year-over-year compares as we close the
year.
Given the strong year to date performance, we now expect Pratt & Whitney's operating profit growth to come in at the
high end of the previous guidance range of $175 million to $200 million on low single digit sales growth.
UTC Aerospace Systems recently celebrated the second anniversary of its formation following the July 2012
acquisition of Goodrich. We are proud of the way the teams have come together to integrate the businesses while
improving on our already high level of customer service as well as delivering over $350 million in run rate synergies in
just over two years.
In the quarter, Aerospace Systems continued to deliver strong results with operating profit up 14% on 7% higher sales.
Commercial OEM sales were up 8% as we continue to benefit from growth in new programs such as 787 and A350.
And commercial aftermarket increased 10% while military sales improved for the first time this year, up 2% versus
2013. Profit growth was driven by higher commercial volume, continued synergy traction and the benefit of lower
pension expense. Operating margins increased 110 basis points to 17%. Commercial spares orders increased 11% in the
quarter with strength in both parts and provisioning. Overall commercial aftermarket sales are up 10% year to date.
For the year, UTC Aerospace Systems now expects profit growth of $325 million to $350 million from our previous
expectation of $300 million to $350 million on mid to high single digit sales growth.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 10, operating profit decreased by 11% on 5% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky
shipped a total of 54 aircraft, including 39 based on military platforms and 15 commercial. The sales increase was
driven primarily by development programs as well as higher international military and commercial OE volumes
partially offset by lower aftermarket and U.S. government OE volumes.

The operating profit decrease was driven by unfavorable mix in our military business, the impact of lower aftermarket
volumes and the absence of prior year favorable contract adjustments which more than offset benefits from pension,
lower engineering spend and cost reduction actions. For the balance of the year, we anticipate stronger profit growth
from higher volume and continue to expect operating profit growth of about $25 million on low single digit sales
growth.
Earlier this month, Sikorsky unveiled the S-97 Raider prototype featuring X2 technology and we are pleased to
announce that the Sikorsky/Boeing team was selected to continue development of the Sikorsky/Boeing Defiant
demonstrator aircraft, with first flight expected in 2017. We believe our technology's well positioned for the next
generation Future Vertical Lift program.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.
Gregory J. Hayes
Thanks, Jay. So in summary, I think all we can say is a really solid quarter for UTC and what a difference a quarter
makes. You'll recall in the second quarter there were some concerns around organic growth and development program
execution. I hope that we put all that to rest with our performance this quarter where we saw solid organic growth
across each of the businesses with good bottom line conversion and key development programs on track as well as
major program awards which will drive top line growth in our businesses for years to come.
Let me just take a minute and highlight a couple of the big wins in the quarter. As you know, of course, Pratt &
Whitney and our Aerospace Systems business supported the maiden flight of the Airbus A320neo aircraft on
September 25th in Toulouse. All of our systems, including the Geared Turbofan engine, performed well on this historic
flight. We're confident that the flight test program will further validate the performance characteristics for reduced
noise, lower emissions and significantly higher fuel efficiency, and we look forward to the continuation of that
successful test program.
I'm sure you also all saw the announcement from Gulfstream last week. We're delighted to see the introduction of the
PW800 engine for the new Gulfstream G500 and G600 long range business jets in yet another platform for our engine
business. The PW800 engine is optimized for long range business jets and shares the same proven rigorously-tested
core technology used in Pratt & Whitney's award winning, PurePower family of commercial engines. We're equally
pleased with the Aerospace Systems content where we will provide several critical systems for these new business jets.
The Building & Industrial Systems businesses also had a solid third quarter with Otis and CCS delivering 5% and 4%
organic sales growth, respectively. As you know, the third quarter marked the one year anniversary of the formation of
our Building & Industrial Systems business and integration activities continue to progress well.
In the quarter, we saw another example of revenue synergies in Australia at the Sydney Airport. At Sydney Airport,
Otis has had a long term maintenance contract which allowed CCS to win a contract covering the installation of
detectors, fire indicator panels and emergency warning systems across one domestic and one international terminal and
a five year service contract for maintenance and repair work across the airport site. BIS does work.
As you can see, each of the businesses is well positioned in our core markets. We're delivering real value to our
customers and securing key orders that will drive top line growth well into the future.
All right. Taking a look at the rest of the year, as you know, the compares will get tougher in the fourth quarter, but
order and end market trends through Q3 continue to support our expectation of 4% organic sales growth for the full
year.
As I mentioned at the start of the call, Q3 gains were stronger than previously anticipated and this was driven mainly by
U.S. tax settlement that closed a few weeks earlier moving the gain from Q4 to Q3. We continue to anticipate that net
one-time gains and restructuring costs will offset for the year. And we see a path to the high end of the range of $6.75
to $6.85 although there is some pressure given the recent strength of the U.S. dollar.

For the year, we continue to anticipate debt pay-down of $1 billion and we now expect share repurchase of $1.5 billion
up from our prior expectation of $1.35 billion, and we expect M&A spend will be a little less than $1 billion.
Year to date free cash flow is 82% of net income and cash is generally strongest in Q4, as you know. We expect free
cash flow of about 90% of net income for the full year of 2014.
Okay. Moving on to slide twelve, let's look at 2015 briefly. As we move with any year, of course, there's some
positives out there, there are some headwinds and a lot of question marks, but let me touch on a few of the big ones
here.
A couple of things that we know are going to be headwinds next year: commercial aero OE margins, both at Pratt
Whitney as well as Aerospace Systems business. As we ramp up production on the GTF, we'll see margin headwind at
Pratt. We'll also see a little bit of that at Aerospace Systems as production rates increase on the new platforms and as
you would expect the margins on early units going out the door are pressured with the learning curve. These are great
long term programs that point to a bright future for both Pratt and our Aerospace Systems business and are key building
blocks for our long term strategic plan.
On the military side, the biggest issue here is the C-17 program. Pratt, as you know, supplies the engines on the C-17,
four per aircraft, volume that will decline as production ends next year. So that will be a headwind as the F-135 engine
production has not yet ramped up.
Looking at the middle column here, some questions, first of all, what happens in Europe? When do we see a sustainable
recovery there? Emerging markets, and I would put China in that category, you know they will grow. The question is,
how much will they grow?
Pension as you know is also a big driver at UTC and if we were to snap the line at the end of September, the discount
rate was 4.2% and would give us a headwind of about $160 million next year. As you know, every ten basis points of
discount rate change there's nearly $30 million of earnings impact year-over-year.
On the positive side, the pension portfolio has performed well and should offset the discount headwind of 4.2%. I put it
in the question mark column because it's too tough to call what rates will be when you snap the line on December 31st.
We also expect the new mortality rate tables to be introduced in the coming months. While it's great that we are all
living longer, this does increase pension expense by about $180 million a year. Just not clear yet whether this starts
next year or the year after, so again, a question mark as we sit here today.
In the plus column, well first of all, we think the U.S. economy will continue to recover, even in the face of slightly
rising interest rates, and our businesses have good, solid momentum here. Commercial aero aftermarkets as well as the
business in general aviation should continue to benefit from solid fundamentals and of course cost reduction. Since
2009 through the end of last year, we've done some $2.6 billion of restructuring. We've got another $375 million this
year which will give us a couple hundred million dollars of tailwind into 2015, so as always, some pluses, some
minuses and a few question marks as we look toward next year.
As we sit here today in this challenging and uncertain macro environment, earnings for next year look to be around the
mid-single digit mark, but it's still early and we continue to work the plan for next year. We're executing the long term
strategy that we presented earlier this year at our March investor day. The portfolio is well-positioned to take advantage
of the urbanization and commercial aerospace mega trends through the end of the decade and beyond.
The investments that we're making today position us for sustainable earnings growth well into the future. We'll
continue to leverage our industry-leading franchises and global scale and we believe we've got the right strategy, the
right portfolio and we've made the right investments to continue to drive sustainable, long term earnings growth.
With that, let's open up the call for questions. Stephanie?

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays; your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Hey, Carter.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a couple quick ones. First, with the decline in the service sales in Europe at Otis, was
that related to pricing or something else? I think you had said previously that the pricing had kind of stabilized there.
Did that change given the change in the macro environment there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, Carter, we still continue to see some pricing pressure there. It's moderated from what
we have seen over the past couple of years but there's still a little pricing pressure on the portfolio. I think we've done a
pretty good job in terms of stemming the tide there. We entered – got some new programs out there trying to be a little
more aggressive in terms of the retention of the portfolio but it's still a pretty tough environment on the service side.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Can you characterize the magnitude of the pressure relative to what you have seen in the past
couple years?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, you're talking less than a penny in the quarter of pressure from pricing.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay, great. And then with respect to the SEER 14 transition and the order trends that you
talked about, can you help us think through, beyond the order trends in terms of production and shipments and how that
impacts Q4 versus Q1? My recollection was that you – this was when they were – when they could be manufactured in
Q4 but shipped in Q1. How are you thinking that's going to work out as the year end approaches?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think that's exactly right. I think we saw really, really strong order growth on the resi
[residential] side. We don't actually think that's indicative of what's going on in the market. It's probably closer to the
9% growth that we saw in the sales for the quarter. The plan, as we sit here today, of course, is to manufacture all of
these SEER 13 units that have been ordered and most of them will sit in inventory through year end and we'll ship them
into the first and second quarter of next year.
So you'll have a more, I'll say, steady-state in terms of what the market really looks like as opposed to 2005 where we
had the big like a million unit pre-order across the industry and there was huge shipments in the fourth quarter. You
know, we're not planning to do that. That obviously has an impact on inventory, probably $150 million or so of
additional inventory that we'll see on the books at year end but the fact is, we don't want to push this out to the
distribution if it's just going to sit on the shelves. So again, good solid order growth rate. We think, again, share is
remaining where we expected it to be, so no big bump this year in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks, Greg. I'll pass the mike.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Carter.
Operator
Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi, thank you. Just on the aerospace businesses, I think R&D had been up company
funded about 4% in the first half. A lot of that was in UTAS and you talked before about flat R&D for the year as a
whole. So I just wondered how was R&D in UTAS in Q3, and how are you thinking about it for the next sort of twelve
months?

<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah. In fact, if you think about the plan going into the year was that E&D was going to be
relatively flat. I will tell you, that's not going to happen. It's probably going to be up about $100 million across all of
UTC and really that's the aero units. The big increase in the quarter where we saw, I think it was up almost $50 million;
that's all Pratt Whitney. UTAS is relatively flat year-over-year in the quarter but we're going to continue to see a little
bit of additional E&D into the fourth quarter but think about that as $100 million or so year-over-year and then again,
benefit next year as we expected that to go back down to prior year's level.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks and then at Pratt restructuring the last six months has been very low even though
the two minus points you call out in the 2015 outlook both pertain to Pratt.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Again, keep in mind, Pratt has done a significant amount of restructuring in the last three
years. They did a 20% across the board reduction in SG&A at the beginning of last year. We continue to take cost out,
closing floor space both in Canada and here in the U.S. So I think they have done what they needed to do from a cost
reduction standpoint in terms of the back office and the factory footprint. The cost reduction focus today at Pratt is all
on the new products going out the door. I think you won't see big restructuring dollars but what we're doing is
obviously focusing on GTF cost reduction to hit those target costs that we have out there as the production ramps.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. Very quickly, you don't call out anything on the balance sheet in the 2015
outlook but I guess share count is a small tailwind exiting this year. Anything else you'd like to say on the balance sheet
for 2015?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Well, it's a little early. I think Louis will probably talk about it. The only thing I would point
out that is obvious is that the share count will probably increase a little next year absent share buyback because of the –
what do we call those?
<A - Jay Malave>: The convertibles.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Convertibles. MSUs that are out there. So we will issue, I think, 11 million shares first of
July. Obviously, we going to probably have share buyback that will try to offset that but full year share count might
creep up a little bit next year.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great, thanks.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much, good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Rob.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Greg, I was wondering if we could carry on on the previous vein. I wonder if you could talk
about your plans for debt retirement and any sort of impact that could have on the income statement next year?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: So again, we have some debt that's coming due I think in May. There's a 6% note out there.
The thought is, again, that we'll probably just refinance that on the short end with commercial paper, so again, we'll pay
down $1 billion of debt this year just exactly as we had expected to do, but next year I wouldn't expect to see further
debt reduction.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Then on the commercial aerospace aftermarket, in the past, you would give us a little bit of
breakdown of Pratt in terms of the trends you've seen in the V2500 versus the wide body engine. I was wondering if
you could give us that again? And also, at UTAS, I was wondering if you could break out how much the provisioning

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Greg, if I heard you correctly, basically, you're pointing us toward mid-single digit EPS
growth in 2015. Obviously, there's a long list of pluses and minuses. Just on the ones that you do have dialed in a little
bit better, I just wanted to make sure I was clear. On pension, are you telling us that asset issues offset discount rate and
therefore, the headwind, if there is one, is simply on mortality tables?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: That's exactly right. I think if we snapped the line at the end of September, despite a lousy
September in the markets, the pension performance is going to trump the discount rate down at 4.2%. If I snapped the
line today, of course, the discount rate is 4%. I'm just going to ignore that for now. The real issue is whether we adopt
mortality tables. We're waiting for them to be published. If they get published this year, we'll probably adopt them. If
they get published early next year, we'll wait and adopt them in 2016.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And your comment about earnings growth next year assumes the mortality table is adopted?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It assumes that the mortality table is adopted, yes. Right now, it would be a headwind, but I
put it in the question column because, again, it's middle of October as opposed to middle of December. So when Louis
stands up, we'll obviously have some clarity there.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And it sounds like you've got a pretty good dial on Pratt margins or headwinds next year.
Obviously, unforeseen challenges on ramps can occur, but can you give us a little bit more color on what you're
pointing us to there, kind of what the ramp pressures look like? I don't know if you can express it in dollars or margin
points or what.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Maybe the best way to think of that, Jeff, is you've got a couple of big known headwinds,
that is negative engine margin. That's on the V2500 as well as the GTF, primarily the neo as that enters service at the
end of next year, and so we know that's out there and it's a pretty good sized number, as well as the U.S. military. The
C-17 production stops. We make good money on that, both on the OE and on the support side of that. So that kind of
goes away next year, but you do have some offsets.
I think, obviously, the commercial aero aftermarket will be better. Pratt Canada continues to get better. You've got
good news, probably, on the E&D front. I think right now I would tell you that Pratt will struggle to grow earnings, if at
all. That's really the challenge that we have in the next couple of months is to understand – you know, Pratt right now is
signaling there's no growth there and I think that is probably our biggest challenge for next year because of these big
headwinds.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And just one more, and I'll move on. So we've had the questions and the discussions about aero
ramp, CapEx and working capital and you have some working capital noise in Carrier here at quarter end. Would you
foresee conversion actually moving back above net income next year, or would kind of net income be the reasonable
bogey?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think net income is a reasonable bogey. I think, obviously – even this quarter, we had 83%
of free cash flow to net income. You had about $400 billion of gains or one-time items that flowed through that had no
cash impact. So there's a little bit of noise outside of just the pension. Obviously, pension becomes less of a tailwind
next year, but also from a cash standpoint, there's no cash coming in from pension; good news, anyways. So CapEx
ought to come down a little bit next year. All in all, I would say I think we ought to be targeting, as we typically do,
free cash flow equal to net income. Always bumps in the road as you put the plan together, but I'm pretty confident
when Louis stands up he'll be guiding towards that 100%.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with J.P. Morgan; your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks, good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Just a couple on Otis to start. The guidance for profit is lower – profit growth is lower
exclusively because of currency, or is there anything else in there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Currency is the biggest driver. It's about $50 million year-over-year of headwind. I think,
again, the pricing pressure that we talked about in Europe earlier continues to be a bit of a headwind, but it's not the big
driver. It really is primarily FX. Again, I would say Otis is recovering. The Florence factory is doing much, much
better; still some room to go there, but there's no big operational misses here, it's really just pricing in Europe, I would
say, and FX.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And then on Otis China, can you tell us about unit orders year-on-year? Was that also
flat or was there a change there? And maybe just provide some color on what you're seeing more qualitatively as we
head into Q4 and into next year.
<A - Jay Malave>: Joe, the units were up in the range of mid-single digits, so we continue to see growth in units
year-over-year. The other piece of it is we still see strong award activity; and just as a reminder, we do not record
orders until such time as we receive a deposit. It's been a little bit slower converting the awards into booked orders
from a cash conversion and deposit perspective, but the activity still remains pretty solid.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think you've got to keep in mind, Joe, the backlog is still up 14% year-over-year. So I think
the sales forecast that we have for the year is solid and we should continue to see solid growth next year despite what
is, we all recognize, a very – or a slowing housing market there. The Chinese government has taken some steps here
with reducing down-payments on second homes to try and stimulate some growth there, but, you know, it'll be
challenging.
It is a 600,000 unit elevator market, though, just to keep in mind. It's the world's biggest by a factor of probably 5. So
it's a huge market and the opportunity there, as you know, is going to be on the service side long term, and that's really
where we're focused. I think service will probably grow 20% or so, again, this year after growing 20% in each of the
last two years. So the team's focused on service and delivering, you know, service across the entire region, which is,
again, a big challenge; but, that's where the growth is going to come from.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, and then, Greg, I just wanted to clarify one item, which was the Pratt guidance. I don't
think – I don't know if I heard you say this specifically, but are you guys going to stop providing guidance or color on

spares, specifically, and just move to aftermarket? Because I understand longer run as, you know, you move to 80%
type of pickup on service contracts, that's going to be maybe the more relevant benchmark, but in the nearer term, the
next couple of years, just the one off spares sales is still going to be extremely important.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Peace, peace. Look, we will be transparent on the spares orders. We put it out there in the
press release. We're not trying to obfuscate anything. The fact is we know spares will continue to be going – or
declining as the retirements kick in on the 4000 and the 2000, so we wanted to put both metrics out there.
The point of this is that longer term we really need to start thinking about commercial aftermarket as opposed to just
the spares, because, as you know, the fewer spares we sell, the better we are on the FMP contracts. So during – for the
next couple of years we'll continue to report both spares and commercial aftermarket. Just understand – and, again, the
point here is that there is a transition here in the business model of Pratt that is significant and we think, again, an
opportunity for Pratt long term on the margin side.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Just wanted to go back to one question. You mentioned about China and the elevator market
and you talked about some of the stimulus. I thought there also was some movement toward changing some of the rules
in terms of the aftermarket contract that might help the OEM do a little bit more. Can you talk a little bit about where
that stands and what your attachment rate has been in terms of some of the more recent selling there?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: This was a regulatory change that started to get rolled out last year. It's been rolling out
province by province. This is a requirement that the OEMs actually do service the elevators. As a result, again, if you're
seeing that in the increase that we're seeing in our aftermarket attachment, I think we've got 135,000 elevators under
service contract in China today versus 110,000 last year. So we're getting good traction. The regulatory change, though,
will be slow to be adopted, I would say, across the country, but it is a net positive trend for us.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Then just on Sikorsky, I was wondering if you could clarify something. If you are
going to generate $25 million growth in terms of adjusted profits this year, it would seem to imply a very strong fourth
quarter. I just want to make sure I understand that and related, just wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about the
energy market and what that's doing to commercial helicopter demand right now.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, that's – let me just talk about Sikorsky. They've got a big fourth quarter as they
typically do. We'll have about $2 billion of sales at Sikorsky in the fourth quarter, so growing – I know they're down a
little bit year to date but the $25 million ought to be well within the reasonable range of what they can deliver for the
full year. Again, on a strong fourth quarter delivery.
As far as offshore oil, we actually had a conversation with them yesterday about this and they are seeing some pressure
because of offshore oil and with fracking in the U.S. growing so significantly, we're seeing less of the oil and gas
exploration expansion, which had driven the big ramp up in commercial helicopters. We're going to deliver 40 S-92s
this year. We'll probably deliver a couple more than that next year. Is there still a market for the helicopters? It's just
that we're not seeing quite the same growth because of the prevalence of fracking here in the U.S.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: That's great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley; your line is open.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Greg, I wanted just to go back to the 2015, I guess, framework and obviously a big question mark
around the magnitude of the OE mix headwinds and I'm wondering, can you give us some sort of working range?
Because it is a key debate and I'm wondering around that, you know, will there be an impact from the collaboration
accounting or is this just primarily GTF? Is there a circumstance in 2015 where you get the OE ramp up and the
headwind but not a corresponding reduction in R&D?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think, again, the R&D is almost a natural reduction when you think about it. You know,
we're going to be done on C series flight tests, we've got the engine certified, the neo engine is certified. You have got
MRJ, right? We just rolled that out. You are going to see a natural progression of E&D coming down over the next few
years. Still have some spending out there, you've got the Embraer, the E2 jets, you've got the Irkut jet, but it should just
be a natural roll-down in E&D d to more normal level.
As far as the commercial OE, the headwind, I guess the way to think of that is probably somewhere around, I don't
know, $0.10 to $0.12 a share for next year, maybe a little more than that, but kind of in that range.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Is that just GTF ramp or is that also including some collaboration accounting?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: It's not collaboration. There is some additional Vs, some new Vs out there that weren't
included in the contract when we bought Rolls' share of IAE. So those new engines will go out with some negative
margin as well.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, and then just a quick one on pension, Greg. You mentioned the possibility of adopting the new
mortality tables this year, but does that put any incremental funding pressure on next year if it does get adopted?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: No. In fact, I think under – with the new pension rules that our friends in Congress passed,
we don't actually have to fund it until sometime in 2020. I would tell you, though, we we'll probably fund its service
cost level for the next few years. As you know, we've sunset the plan. Right? The old FAE plan and we took that really
tough action back in 2009. That's been paying off but as we switch to the new, newer pension scheme, the cash balance
plan, we will probably be funding that on a more normal service level going forward. You think about $300 million or
so of cash next year for pension funding in the U.S. and probably a couple hundred million for international.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: A quick one on euro rate 4Q, what euro rate are you using for Otis in 2014?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think we are at $1.27 in our current forecast, which is right about where we are today. I
think it dropped a little; it was at $1.28 yesterday and came down a little today. I think we're kind of in the ballpark.
Now recall, last year or going into the year, we were kind of in the $1.30 range and for the full year, we were at $1.33
this year so there is some certain FX headwind year-over-year going into the fourth quarter
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, thanks, Greg.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Greg, one of the things you talked about was the opening or the
difference between restructuring and gains. Could you refresh us where you are then for the fourth quarter?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. So we spent in restructuring $243 million, not to be terribly precise on a $375 million
forecast for the year, meaning we've got $132 million of additional restructuring teed up in the fourth quarter and that's
all subscribed. We got plans in place to spend all of that. And in fact, you know, there could be some additional gains
in the fourth quarter. We'll see what happens with the taxes.
We've also got tax extenders out there that could happen in the fourth quarter which might allow us to do some
additional restructuring. You know, as we talk about the plan for next year, one of the keys is what additional cost
reductions or restructuring actions can we take to help ensure we have a decent plan going into next year. So that's
where we're going to focus on in the next couple of months is looking for additional restructuring opportunities and
don't be surprised if that $375 million goes up a little.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Sorry. The reality is that without that, you'd actually do a little bit better than the high end of
your range for the year.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yes. So again, I don't think there's any – look, we're going to stay within the range. As I said
before, we have a path to $6.85. It's a little tougher with this big currency headwind we've got in the fourth quarter, but
there's still a path out there. I would not look for us to significantly over-deliver on the basis of additional gains.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I under... – no, it wasn't gains so much as the absence of re... – I get it, though. Just to stay
for a moment on restructuring, could you provide some indication of the successes you've had combining CCS and Otis
internationally?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think the biggest, from a restructuring standpoint, the biggest success is think about Otis as
2500 branch offices out there and the ability to consolidate offices, I mean, it saves a lot of money. I think Geraud has
got a target of about $300 million of savings from the synergy of collapsing the offices and running the business as not
just Otis, not fire and security and Carrier but as BIS, so you have one back office, you have one management team.
Again, sales forces are all different, field service is different, but you are getting synergies out of the consolidation of
the offices.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just one last, if I may. When I look at your tax rate at we'll call it 30% versus your
peers or other large multinationals, they all have something that begins with a 20, high 20s. Going forward, is it
possible that we could see a tax rate in the, I'll use 28% plus range?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You know, it's hard to imagine us absent – of course, with tax reform, Howard, anything is
possible. And again, I think that's the real issue. Our tax rate normally wants to be about 32%. We do some tax
planning that allows to us get it down to around 30%. That's primarily permanently reinvesting foreign earnings. But
the fact is, you know, the rate wants to probably be around 30% absent the tax extenders. You get the R&D tax credit
and the CFC look-through rules and that will drop the rate about a point.
We're obviously hopeful we're going to see something in December from Congress on that to hopefully make
permanent the R&D credit because it's crazy to wait and spend money in anticipation of a tax law change. That's an
opportunity, but again, as the tax rules become more and more difficult, and you've heard of this BEPS Project out
there where everybody is looking for additional tax revenue and the tax authorities around the world are becoming
more aggressive. We've taken a relatively conservative view on the tax rate. We can certainly drive it down for a year
or two but we're viewing this over the long term, it probably wants to be 29% to 30%.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, Greg, very much for your time.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Howard.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Greg, there was a comment in the press release on increased revenue synergies being
realized in Building & Industrial Systems. I wonder if you can put a little bit of color behind that, kind of substantiate
the rationale of the combination and also give us some color on the hunt for larger industrial M&A. Thanks.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: I think on the BIS revenue synergy, it's obviously early. The businesses have been together
exactly a year here as of September 30th. We highlighted we had this project in Australia with bringing in some fire
and security products, some CCS products. Last quarter we talked about a project in Hong Kong. We were able to bring
an Otis elevator contract. In the Middle East we've seen some good pull-through where the legacy Carrier business has
a very good relationship in the Middle East and were able to bring in the Otis elevators and win relatively large awards,
but you know, these are all kind of one-off today.
I think the whole focus here of managing this as a BIS organization is to make that more routine as opposed to one-off
and I think that will take some time. We're certainly getting some market acceptance today and as we talk to
developers, we talk to the building owners, they see the benefit of BIS versus the individual businesses going to market.
So we've got a key accounts leader in place today for the U.S. We're working that internationally, and again, there's
momentum building here. I think when Geraud stands up in March next year, he can share some more of the wins with
you then.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Are you looking at something like combined capture rates or combined bid rates? Is that the
way you're internally looking at the metrics?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: You know, Myles, I'm not sure I actually have seen the exact – in fact, we've got our
business review tomorrow with BIS. I haven't actually seen the new metrics that we're using. Obviously, we're looking
at this more holistically as opposed to just order rates at Otis or order rates at fire and security or Carrier. Again, we're
trying to attack this from a top down level with the customer. I haven't actually seen what the new metric is going to be.
We can come back to you with that.
I'm sorry. What was your second question?
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: M&A, the hunt for the big fish.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: [Laughter] We're still fishing. Like I said, I think back a couple of months ago, you know,
the pipeline is not terribly robust. There are opportunities out there obviously on the commercial side that were focused
on building out, the building side and the systems side, continue to look for opportunities there, but the market's been
tough. As you know, equities have run up quite a bit, prices are very difficult and even with the recent price correction,
if you will, we haven't seen M&A prices correct along with the rest of the equity market
So we are going to be disciplined. We're going to be patient. We're going to look for properties in the core. Obviously,
the focus is on the commercial side. Not to say we wouldn't do an aero deal if one came along, but you know, the
pipeline is – the pipeline's not terribly full but we continue to spend a lot of time looking at various opportunities.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And then, I want to follow up a little bit with Pratt, because if Pratt gets like maybe $50
million of the pension income, you still had profits at Pratt up $20-plus million year-over-year despite R&D up $50
million and spares up 7%. I mean, that obviously offsets some of it, but still seems like there had to be some strong
performance elsewhere to get the number as good as it was. So I just wonder if you can provide a little bit of color. I
mean, V2500 engine deliveries are probably a little higher this year than last year, so...
<A - Jay Malave>: George, we saw nice growth in Canada. I mean, that was up low double digits, both in OE as well
as the aftermarket. So again – and also strong with their spare parts business; so Canada contributed. As we saw, as I
said, we also had strong performance under our contracts and we saw a benefit there in the range of about a couple
pennies; and so those contributed. And again, as we talked about, we did get some – we have seen benefit from cost
reduction and restructuring. So all that taken together has helped really offset that higher E&D in the quarter, as well as
any margin pressure. You know, the OE business was up a little bit in the large commercial business, but really not a
significant factor.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And, Jay, you said that spares were up a combined 7% at Pratt Canada and large Pratt. Was
it about equal at both?
<A - Jay Malave>: That was the total aftermarket was up 7%, not just the spares. But on a sales basis, Pratt's – the
large commercial spares were pretty much flat and the spares at Canada were up high teens.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Okay, George, thank you.

Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: On – Greg, on Otis China, you talked about services and that's clearly long term the target
here. But as services grow, how should we think about margins on that given that in the early couple years if these
elevators are under warranty and you don't have the scale yet that you have in Europe or in the U.S.?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, I think, Doug, you hit on a key issue with service. Today, the margins on service are
not much higher than what they are on the OE side; although, they're still very good. The opportunity, obviously, long
term as you get root density across China as we build out all of these branch offices and add all these service
technicians, margins should continue to improve. It's not clear we'll ever get to developed country type margins in
service, but there is still opportunity here. And, again, I think the idea here today is to focus more on getting the
contracts and servicing the customers as opposed to margin expansion. That will come naturally over time as we get
more productivity from the sales – or the field force. Keep in mind, we're adding 1,000 people a year to the service
network in China and we've got to bring them in. We've got to train them. We've got to teach them how to service
elevators, and we've got to deploy them out into the field. All of that is holding down margins in the near term; but,
again, still a profitable business in China, still good margins, just not the kind of margins that we would expect long
term.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: And then on Pratt, when you look at 2015 – and clearly for the Geared Turbofan the
A320neo is the really big deal here, but when you look at the C series, how are you looking at – in 2015, what are you
looking at in terms of the trajectory of deliveries? And if that were to get delayed, is that something that would have
any kind of a material impact on your – either revenues or margins at Pratt?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: In fact, we're delivering some engines this year. I think we'll probably deliver the same
number of engines, roughly, maybe a few more next year. So it's not a big driver of year-over-year margin degradation

at Pratt. And, again, you know, they've had some recent wins. We feel pretty good about it. The plane's up and flying
again and they should be on track to get this thing in service by the end of next year. The bigger ramp will obviously
come on the Airbus A320neo. Again, there will be huge volumes by 2017 where we could be delivering 500-plus
engines a year from zero today.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: So the C series itself, you're not – that's probably not – the timing on that is probably not
much of an issue for next year then?
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: We don't see it as a big year-over-year driver as we sit here today.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Jay Malave>: Thanks, Doug.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Thanks, Doug.

Our final question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes, good morning, Greg, Jay.
<A - Jay Malave>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Just a quick one regarding an update on the synergies you mentioned, back to Howard's
question. The Goodrich synergies, can you remind us where they're tracking to? And is the number still $500 million
that you had previously indicated? And also, if you could also give us an update on the CCS synergies, too.
<A - Gregory J. Hayes>: Yeah, so if you think about the synergies, I think through last year we'd recognized about
$270 million or so of synergies. There's another $100 million plus this year. We're on track probably next year to
deliver close to another $100 million of synergies, and I'm sure there are more synergies beyond the $500 million. But,
again, I think talking about synergies versus typical normal cost reduction and other restructuring activities gets very
difficult as we get past about the third or fourth year of the acquisition. So we'll talk about them this year and we'll talk
about the tailwind next year. And I think, again, we'll hit that $500 million by the end of next year and then we're just
going to keep going and continue to drive margins up. You can call it synergies. You can call it cost reduction. You can
call it just what we do at UTC, but we're going to continue to drive margins up beyond that which the benefit we're
going to get from the $500 million of synergies.
In terms of the BIS synergies, we talked about a $300 million number. Not a big number this year; maybe $50 million
of savings between what we're seeing in the segments. And, again, the – part of the issue is where we still keep Otis
and CCS separate from a reporting standpoint. So when we close a CCS office, that restructuring savings may show up
there. If we close an Otis office, it shows up in that segment. But, again, that will accelerate in the coming years as we
continue with the consolidation process.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Greg.
Gregory J. Hayes
Okay, thanks, everyone, for listening today. We look forward to seeing you at our annual investor and analyst meeting
on December 11 in New York where Louis will give guidance, complete guidance for 2015. The IR team will be
around throughout the rest of the day to take your questions. Thank you very much and have a great day.
