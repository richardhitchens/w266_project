MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Target Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Release
Conference Call. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will invite you
to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded Wednesday, November 19, 2014.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hulbert, Senior Director, Investor Communications. Please go
ahead, sir.
John R. Hulbert
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. On the line
with me today are Brian Cornell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Mulligan, Chief Financial Officer; and
Kathee Tesija, Chief Merchandising and Supply Chain Officer.
This morning, Brian will discuss our third quarter performance and our priorities for the fourth quarter and beyond.
Then Kathee will provide more detail on recent performance and outline our plans for the fourth quarter, including the
holiday season. And finally, John will provide more detail on our financial performance and outlook for the rest of the
year. Following their remarks, we'll open the phone lines for a question-and-answer session.
As a reminder, we're joined on this conference call by investors and others who are listening to our comments via
webcast. Following this conference call, John and I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up
questions you may have. Also as a reminder, any forward-looking statements that we make this morning are subject to

Finally, in these remarks we'll refer to adjusted earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. A
reconciliation to our GAAP EPS is included in this morning's press release posted on our Investor Relations website.
With that, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the third quarter and our priorities going forward. Brian?
Brian C. Cornell
Thanks, John, and good morning all of you. We're pleased with Target's third quarter financial performance, which we
announced earlier this morning. Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 was better than our guidance of $0.40 to
$0.50, driven by U.S. Segment comp sales growth of 1.2%, which is also better than our expectations.
Importantly, the U.S. Segment saw positive comps in all three months of the quarter and we're encouraged that the pace
of U.S. traffic continues to recover from a very challenging trend earlier in the year. While U.S. traffic still declined
slightly in the third quarter, performance was more than a full percentage point stronger than traffic trends through the
first half of the year.
As we mentioned, in our second quarter earning call, we saw a strong start to back-to-school and to the back-to-college
season. And that strength continued in September. Like many others, our sales flowed as we entered October, but
recovered nicely towards the end of the month as we approached Halloween.
While our Canadian Segment continue to see robust year-over-year growth, third quarter sales in Canada fell short of
our expectations.
As Kathee outlined in our last earnings call, the team in Canada has been working diligently to make improvements to
operations, assortment, and pricing in preparation for the fourth quarter. With these changes we believe we're better
positioned to serve our guest at a time of the year when traffic will naturally be higher. The guest response to these
changes both in their shopping behavior and overall sentiment towards Target will inform our perspective as we
continue to assess our longer-term potential in Canada.
As I visited stores across the U.S. and Canada, and work with the Target team, I've been continually impressed with the
level of their talent and passion to perform. As a leadership team has begun, our work to develop Target's longer-term
goals we've aligned around five key operating principles.
First, we will provide strategic clarity to the team. Second, we'll articulate what Target stands for in today's retail
marketplace. Third, we will thoughtfully prioritize what we do, applying discipline to ensure we're focused on work
that adds the most long-term value. Fourth, we'll invest resources and build capabilities to support our priorities, so the
team is equipped to deliver on these goals. And finally, we will foster a culture of accountability at all levels of the
organization.
While our work to define Target's longer-term vision is not yet complete, we've made significant progress in defining
the short and longer-term priorities for our business. First, omnichannel and flexible fulfillment capabilities are key to
our long-term success. Target's digital sales are growing much faster than the industry, and they've been accelerating all
year and we're planning for even faster growth in the fourth quarter, but our omnichannel journey is just beginning; as
we plan for the future, we will take a channel-agnostic view of our growth, allowing our guests to interact with us
where and when they want; online, in stores, and on their mobile device. And because an increasing number of Target
business began on a digital platform, we will continue to push ourselves to innovate and build capabilities and features
into our digital experience that will inspire our guests, while removing friction from their daily lives.
Second, we're defining how we'll strategically segment our categories and increase our focus on signature categories we
can, and should be known for. Categories like baby, kids, wellness and style.
Over time, we will work to grow these areas more quickly by investing a higher share of our resources including;
capital, marketing and product development. Importantly, this view of segmentation doesn't mean we're abandoning our
other categories. Let me restate this, it does not mean we're abandoning our other categories, but we will have different
expectation for those categories compared to the ones in which we're investing to outperform.

For example, we believe we should continue to present a meaningful food offering in our stores and online. But we
need to ensure that our food offering is uniquely Target and clearly differentiated from our competitors.
Looking ahead, we know our identity in food will continue to involve a combination of national brands and our own
and exclusive brands with increased emphasis on natural and better-for-you products.
Third, we know that localization and personalization will be a key focus going forward. 15 years ago, all Target stores
were virtually identical and were focused on providing consistent assortment and experience across the country.
In today's world, we need to continue to maintain our brand standards across every store, but our guests expect each of
our stores to reflect the local communities in which they operate. In the past, we've taken some initial steps to localize
our store environment and assortment, but we've only scratched the surface of this opportunity.
Similarly, Target's digital experience will become increasingly personalized for every guest. This year, we've
developed and rolled out a new personalization engine, which is currently generating product recommendations for
guests on our digital platforms. Even though, this new engine is still in the beta rollout stage, conversion rates from its
recommendations are already exceeding what we were previously seeing with a third-party product.
As we continue to make changes based on initial learnings, we expect conversion rates will expand further over time.
Looking ahead, we expect to leverage this engine's capability to provide customized experiences across our digital
platforms.
As we contemplate potential store growth, we believe that smaller formats present an exciting opportunity for Target,
because urban consumers have such a high affinity for our brand. If we can reach more of these guests with small,
flexible formats, like CityTarget and TargetExpress, we can offer urban consumers greater convenience, unique
merchandise and an outstanding value with extended assortment available at Target.com.
And finally, as we plan for the future, we must focus on ways to responsibly control costs to help fuel investments in
our growth. The team has made solid progress in its expense optimization efforts over the last few years, but we believe
we must continue to find cost-saving opportunities in the years to come.
In the coming months, the leadership team will continue our work to more fully map out longer-term aspirations for
Target and we will communicate those plans to you early next year. In the near-term, we are focused on strong
execution of our fourth quarter plans in both the U.S. and Canada. These plans are designed to embrace the core of our
Expect More. Pay Less brand promise, inspiring our guests with unique products and experiences, while providing
unbeatable value through our low prices. Kathee will provide more details in a few minutes.
In Canada, we're expecting much better fourth quarter performance than we experienced last year. But, we know that to
succeed in Canada we will need a major step-change in performance. The fact is, given where we are performing today,
we need to see improved financial performance from every Target store in Canada over time. The team has worked
hard to prepare for the Canadian operations for the fourth quarter. And we'll be watching to see how those
improvements connect with our guests during the holiday season.
While there is much more work to be done, I'm very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. business and
the changes we've implemented to better position our Canadian Segment. My confidence in the potential of this
company and this brand have only been reinforced in the last three months, as I've gained deeper knowledge of Target
through my work with the team.
I'm committed to realizing the potential of this great American brand to the benefit of our guests, team, shareholders,
and communities, and I believe we're taking the right first steps in that journey.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kathee for a recap of the third quarter performance and our plans for the holiday season.
Kathee?

Kathryn A. Tesija
Thanks, Brian. On our last conference call, we outlined that we'd already seen a strong start to the third quarter, driven
by initial results in the back-to-school and back-to-college season. A key question at the time was whether this early
strength would prove to be temporary, resulting in a pullback later in the quarter.
With the quarter now behind us, I'm happy to report that we continued to outperform our U.S. forecasts throughout the
quarter and saw positive U.S. comps all three months. As Brian mentioned earlier, third quarter U.S. traffic was down
slightly from a year ago, but we're encouraged that our traffic trend has improved meaningfully every quarter this year.
Consistent with year-to-date trends, average ticket increased 1.6% in the third quarter, driven by growth in average
retail per item, partially offset by a decline in items per basket. At a category level in the U.S., third quarter comparable
sales performance was strongest in healthcare and beauty, led by beauty, which continues to benefit from this year's
store fixture innovations and the introduction of new brands.
Third quarter comps in home were up in the low single-digits, with particular strength in seasonal categories benefiting
from back-to-school/back-to-college sales early in the quarter and late quarter strength in Halloween.
Third quarter comp sales in grocery were up in the low single-digits and hardlines was up slightly, led by toys, which
saw a high single-digit increase on strength in licenses like Frozen and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Comp sales in apparel were down slightly, as strength in baby and kids was offset by softness in jewelry, accessories,
and intimates. From a mix perspective, it's worth noting that our combined comp in home and apparel was the strongest
we've seen in two years. In October and early November, we completed the rollout of our new apparel fixtures and
layout to an additional 600 stores, bringing the total to about 650 locations featuring this enhanced presentation.
Consistent with our expectations, the U.S. third quarter gross margin rate was about 50 basis points lower than last
year, about half the decline we saw in the second quarter. This reflects continued moderation of our promotional
intensity, which we intentionally moved higher in the wake of last December's data breach.
Digital sales were up more than 30% in the third quarter and contributed about 60 basis points to our U.S. comparable
sales growth. Consistent with the rest of the industry, all of our digital traffic growth is on our mobile platforms, where
third quarter traffic grew more than 50%. Conversion this quarter was up strongly on both the conventional site and on
mobile, compounding the benefit from the traffic growth.
Following the success of our second quarter decision to offer free shipping on all Target.com orders over $50, in
October we announced that we're offering our guests free shipping on all orders this holiday season. Since the
announcement, our guests have responded enthusiastically. We've seen a meaningful increase in both orders and
conversion compared with trends prior to the announcement. Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that REDcard
holders continue to receive free shipping on all orders year round.
In Canada, third quarter sales were up 44% from a year-ago, moderately below our expectations. Our third quarter
gross margin rate of 19.5% was consistent with our expectations as we continued to clear excess inventory from earlier
in the year.
As Brian mentioned, the team in Canada has been working diligently to improve operations, assortment, and pricing,
and our internal measures show that we are making progress. However, we're also measuring the impact these changes
are having on Canadian consumer sentiment, and that data is more mixed. We will continue to measure guest sentiment
in the fourth quarter, when all of our recent improvements will be fully in place and traffic will be naturally higher.
As we look ahead to the fourth quarter and the holiday shopping season, we're excited about our plans to inspire our
guests with unique products, outstanding deals, and increased convenience provided by our flexible fulfillment efforts.
On our digital platforms, we're coming into this holiday season with many more capabilities than we had a year-ago. In
fact, it was about a year-ago that we rolled out in-store pickup across all of our U.S. stores. So far this year, store
pickup orders have averaged about 15% of digital traffic, with more than 80% of orders ready within an hour.

Based on last year's results, we expect in-store pickup orders will become a much higher share of digital traffic in the
days leading up to Christmas, as consumers increasingly value the certainty this service provides compared with the
potential risk posed by weather-related shipping delays. And we continue to explore potential enhancements to flexible
fulfillment, like our curbside test – pickup test in 10 San Francisco Bay Area stores and our same-day delivery test in
Minneapolis, Boston and Miami.
The Target app and Cartwheel are both top 10 retail apps, and we continue to innovate to maintain our leadership
position in this space. In the third quarter, we re-launched our mobile and tablet apps, making it easier for guests to
locate and purchase what they're looking for with interactive store maps and shopping lists, streamlined checkout, and
the addition of Apple Pay for the iPhone app.
Our new list function automatically notifies guests when an item is on sale or eligible for an offer on Cartwheel, and
our new interactive store maps show item locations throughout each store. For our in-store Black Friday guests this
year, special interactive maps will show doorbuster locations throughout each store. We completed a successful
nationwide rollout of ship-from-store capability in October. With this rollout, we are now shipping about 60,000
eligible products from 136 stores in 38 markets, covering more than 90% of the U.S. population.
The ability to access stores' inventory to fulfill online orders improves our digital in stock and drives incremental sales
in situations where we are out of stock in our fulfillment centers and while shipping from stores significantly lowers
shipping costs; most importantly, it allows us to get items into our guests' hands more quickly. This change is already
being noticed. In the third quarter, Internet Retailer reported a survey showing that we were leading our competitors
with the fastest delivery having been near the back of the pack earlier in the year.
We've recently rolled out an improved omnichannel experience for our registries with new web-enabled smart scanners
and a matching Target.com user experience. The new smart scanners allow guests to add items more quickly to our
registry and new features like collections and checklists provide inspiration and help guests build registries more
quickly.
Guests can add online-only items like specific colors or models right from the device in the store without having to edit
online at home later. And companion and related products are suggested immediately when a guest adds an item to
their registries. And when gift givers access a registry on our new in-store iPad kiosks, they can send gift lists to their
smartphones via SMS with saving time, reducing costs, and eliminating waste from paper printouts.
As we enter the holiday shopping season, we're featuring a dazzling array of unique and exclusive products, and of
course, outstanding deals. In September, we announced that Target would be partnering with TOMS on a limited
edition holiday collection of home goods, apparel, accessories and shoes for women, men and children. Similar to
TOMS one-for-one giving model, for each item purchased a donation will be made with the potential to provide more
than 11 million meals, blankets and shoes to those in need. The collection rolls out at all Target stores in the U.S. and
Canada, and on Target.com on November 16.
We also recently announced our holiday collaboration with Faribault Woolen Mill founded in 1865 and located on the
banks of the Cannon River in Faribault, Minnesota. This mill is part of American history, having provided woolen
blankets for pioneers headed west and for American troops in two world wars.
On November 2, we rolled out a variety of American-made giftable items from this iconic company featuring 100%
wool scarves, throws, tote bags and tech accessories in four patterns available exclusively on Target.com.
If there's one thing we've learned from our past three partnerships with Taylor Swift, it's that our guests can't get
enough of Taylor and her music. Even though, gifting season is yet to come, our Target-exclusive deluxe edition of
Taylor's CD, titled 1989, featuring three exclusive songs and voice memos that give fans unique insight into her song
writing process has already become our best-selling album of all time.
Disney's Frozen has been huge for us all year and it's positioned to be one of the most popular licensed brands at Target
this holiday season with 600 Frozen products, 60 exclusive to Target, across 20 categories. For the holidays, we're
partnering with Renée Ehrlich Kalfus, costume designer for the contemporized Annie film to offer guests a limited

edition collection of kids, apparel and accessories inspired by the films. Annie for Target will be available through
December 26, or while supplies last at all U.S. Target stores and on Target.com. The film debuts in theaters nationwide
on December 19.
In beauty, we continue to experience strong growth in natural products, and we are constantly on the lookout for new
lines that will appeal to our guests. We've already launched seven premium skin care brands this year and we're thrilled
to announce that two more super-lux lines are on the way.
Available now on Target.com and in select stores in March 2015, Target is adding S.W. BASICS of Brooklyn and
NUXE to its lineup of premium skin care products. Also new in beauty, Skinfix the experts in steroid-free skin healing
solutions for the whole family, debuted its incredibly effective products, exclusively at all U.S. Target stores and online
at Target.com. Skinfix products are based on an original formula created over 150 years ago, by pharmacist Thomas
Dixon in Yorkshire, England.
And in hair care, we're seeing continued momentum in naturals with our Made to Matter products and we're excited
about recently added salon products like Proganic from Vogue, and exclusives like Procter & Gamble's hair food and
L'Oréal's Dessange.
In healthcare, we announced earlier this week that Target and Kaiser Permanente are teaming up to launch four Target
clinics in Southern California. For the first time at Target, guests will have access to expanded services not typically
available in retail clinics, including pediatric and adolescent care, well woman care, family planning and management
of chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. And coming in 2015, our new pharmacy app, Target
Healthful, will allow guests to organize and transfer prescriptions, check prescription status and order refills.
And finally, of course, we're designing our marketing plans to bring the entire holiday season together from amazing
products to outstanding deals. Our holiday marketing campaign is designed to encourage people of all ages to let loose,
get into the spirit and feel the unmistakable joy of the holiday season. The advertising will boldly embrace the iconic
elements that make Target, Target: lots of red, white and our lovable mascot, Bullseye. The campaign will include
broadcast, radio, out of home and catalogs, and we're increasing digital media support by 50% over last year.
Target stores will be transformed with fun and whimsical in-store décor created in partnership with David Stark, one of
the top event planners. This year, we're partnering with innovative New York retailer STORY, which brings an
editorial lens to retail and reinvents itself every four weeks to eight weeks, from merchandise and store design, to floor
plans and fixtures, bringing to light a new theme or trend.
From Target's design partnerships to its everyday collections, STORY has curated its favorite holiday treasures from
Target, alongside its other must-have items for the season.
We just launched our kids' Wish List app on October 31, a modern and digital take on the classic tradition of creating
holiday wish lists for parents and kids. Kids can add must-have items to their list, while parents can share the list with
friends and family. Plus, guests can save 10% on their Wish List on one day of their choosing before November 26.
Through the holiday shopping season, Cartwheel, Target's industry-leading savings app will offer daily deals for its
more than 11 million users, and from November 2 to December 24, it will feature 50% off a different toy every day.
The app will have new features for the holidays, including special deals for top users, personalized recommendations
and a select number of popular offers that don't expire.
As always, REDcard holders get 5% off nearly all purchases, free shipping at Target.com, and an extra 30 days for
returns. Since 5% REDcard Rewards rolled out in 2010, Target has saved guests more than $2 billion and we will thank
guests for their loyalty with perks throughout the holiday season.
We know our guests are pulled in a million different directions as the holidays get underway, so we're helping them
save time and money by offering more access to Black Friday deals. Whether shopping online, on their phone or in our
stores, Target guests will find Black Friday deals on top gifts throughout November. We already offered early access to
Black Friday deals for one day only on November 10. We've announced a pre-sale on Wednesday, November 26, and
Cartwheel will feature access to additional Black Friday deals between November 23 and November 29.

On Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday deals will be available first in the morning on Target.com, then at 6:00 p.m. Target
stores will open for Black Friday shoppers and the first several hundred guests will receive a Christmas cracker, a gift
synonymous with the holidays in many parts of the world, which will include a Target GiftCard or a coupon.
On Black Friday, from 6 a.m. to noon, guests can purchase up to $300 in Target GiftCards at a 10% off at Target stores
and Target.com. The first time Target has ever offered a discount on Target GiftCard purchases. The following day,
additional Saturday-only deals will be available in Target stores and at Target.com.
And finally, beginning Monday, December 1, guests will find new deals every day at Target.com as part of Target's
largest-ever Cyber Week sale with more than 100,000 items on sales throughout the week. The offers will include
category-wide sales in key gifting areas and steep discounts on apparel, toys and housewares. More information and
deals will be available at the end of November.
As we look back at an eventful year, we're pleased with the steps we've taken to improve our performance in both the
U.S. and Canada and our financial results show that we're making meaningful progress. While there is much more work
to be done, we are confident in our plans for the upcoming holiday shopping season and pleased with our progress in
charting a longer-term course for the Target of the future.
Now, I'll turn it over to John who will share his insights on our third quarter financial performance and our fourth
quarter outlook. John?
John J. Mulligan
Thanks, Kathee. Our third quarter financial performance was better than expected, driven by stronger-than-expected
sales and operating margin performance in our U.S. Segment. Adjusted EPS of $0.54 was $0.02 or 2.9% below last
year, reflecting a decline in U.S. Segment profit, partially offset by the benefit of reduced losses in our Canadian
Segment. GAAP EPS of $0.55 was $0.01 or 2.7% higher than last year, benefiting from the resolution of tax matters in
the quarter.
Our third quarter U.S. comparable sales increase of 1.2% matches our best performance in the last two years. Digital
sales in the U.S. including flexible fulfillment grew more than 30% contributing about 60 basis points to our U.S.
comparable sales. With ship-from-store capabilities now fully in place, we expect digital sales growth to accelerate to
nearly 40% in the fourth quarter.
Our third quarter U.S. Segment EBITDA margin rate of 8.5% was ahead of our expectations, driven by a
better-than-expected SG&A expense rate of 21%, which is about 20 basis points lower than last year. This performance
was the result of our expense optimization efforts, better leverage on stronger-than-expected sales, and retiming of
some expenses into the fourth quarter.
U.S. REDcard penetration was 21% in the third quarter, up about 110 basis points from last year, driven by growth in
both credit and debit penetration. As we described last quarter, applications for new REDcard debit cards are running
below last year, causing penetration growth to decelerate from last year's pace. We believe this trend will continue in
the fourth quarter, when we expect U.S. REDcard penetration will be flat or up slightly compared with last year.
With the success of recent initiatives designed to increase REDcard applications, we expect the fourth quarter will mark
the low point in year-over-year penetration growth, after which we should see a reacceleration in 2015.
In our Canadian Segment, third quarter sales were below our expectations, growing 44% above last year, reflecting
sales from new stores and a comparable sales increase of 1.6%. As I mentioned last quarter, the comparable sales
metric in Canada will be noisy, until we fully annualize the rapid pace of last year's store rollout, given the sustained
grand opening searches we experienced in those stores and the densification around early cycle stores that occurred
later in 2013. REDcard penetration continues to grow in the Canadian Segment, reaching 4.2% in the third quarter
compared with 2.9% last year.

As expected, third quarter Canadian Segment EBITDA and EBIT margin rates improved somewhat from last year. And
EBIT dollar losses were about 18% lower than a year-ago. While this improvement is encouraging, financial results in
this segment remain unacceptable. And, as Brian mentioned earlier, we need to see a significant step change in
Canadian Segment financial performance.
Outside of operating results in the U.S. and Canada, our third quarter GAAP EPS of $0.55 reflects a few items not
included in adjusted EPS. Specifically, $0.05 of accretion related to the resolution of income tax matters and $0.04 of
offsetting dilution from data breach-related costs, reduction in beneficial interest asset, and impairment losses.
Moving to consolidated metrics, third quarter interest expense was flat to last year, and we paid $330 million in
dividends in the quarter, an increase of 21% over last year. As expected, we didn't repurchase any shares in the third
quarter. And given current performance and our goal to maintain our single-A debt ratings, we don't anticipate any
share repurchase in the fourth quarter as well. Of course, the timing and magnitude of any future share repurchase
activity will depend on the pace of improved financial performance in both the U.S. and Canada.
Before I move to our outlook, I want to first address our inventory, which at quarter-end was about 7% above last year.
This increase was entirely driven by our U.S. Segment and was the result of two factors. About a third of this increase
relates to our recent efforts to reduce out-of-stocks on commodity products; while the remainder reflects receipt timing,
including the impact of our efforts to manage around the slowdown at West Coast ports. Bottom line, we feel very good
about our current U.S. inventory levels.
Now let's move to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As we consider the broader environment, we see some
encouraging signs, including lower gas prices than we've seen in some time. However, consumer spending patterns
remain quite volatile, and we expect the competitive environment will remain highly promotional this holiday season.
Based on this backdrop and the Q3 to Q4 expense retiming I covered earlier, we're continuing to plan cautiously and
maintaining our prior full-year guidance despite stronger-than-expected third quarter performance.
In the U.S., we're expecting a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of about 2%. So far in November, we're running
ahead of our forecast, but I'll quickly remind everyone that the bulk of the season remains ahead of us. We expect our
fourth quarter U.S. gross margin rate will improve somewhat from a year-ago.
Last year in the U.S., we faced unexpected gross margin headwinds because of the data breach, including the
pre-Christmas weekend in which we gave our guests 10% off every transaction, along with incremental clearance
markdowns resulting from softer sales. So while we expect the typical year-over-year gross margin pressure from an
intensely promotional and highly competitive fourth quarter, we believe that pressure will be more than offset by the
benefit from annualizing last year's breach-related markdowns.
We expect our U.S. Segment SG&A expense rate to be flat to down slightly from last year, as the benefit from expense
optimization and better leverage on a 2% comp is expected to be offset by the timing of expenses which moved from
the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Altogether, our outlook is for the U.S. Segment EBITDA margin rate to improve
50 basis points to 60 basis points compared with last year.
In Canada, we expect a high single-digit increase in total sales, driven by a mid to high single-digit increase in
comparable sales. We expect a gross margin rate of around 20%, much better than last year's 4% rate, which resulted
from extreme clearance activity and reserves taken on excess inventory.
With an expected SG&A expense rate of between 35% and 40%, we anticipate fourth quarter Canadian Segment
EBITDA losses of about $100 million, an improvement of about $160 million compared with last year.
Turning to consolidated metrics, we expect a small increase in fourth quarter interest expense compared with last year;
and for the first time this year, we expect our tax expense to be higher than last year, in light of the expected
improvement in profitability.
Altogether, these expectations will lead to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.13 to $1.23, well above the $0.90 we
earned last year. Fourth quarter GAAP EPS is expected to include $0.02 of dilution from the reduction in the beneficial

interest asset and any future data breach expenses, which are not expected to be material.
For the full-year, the center of our adjusted EPS expectation remains at $3.20. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45
lower than adjusted EPS, reflecting a variety of adjustments, including debt retirement and breach-related expenses.
Fourth quarter will mark a notable inflection point, as we annualize the data breach and expect to see the first
year-over-year increase in operating profit this year. This would provide clear financial evidence of the healing
progress we've been engaged in throughout the year, and we look forward to entering next year with an energized team
and positive momentum in our financial results. With that, we'll conclude today's prepared remarks.
Now Brian, Kathee and I will be happy to respond to your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sean Naughton from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So, John, you mentioned this, there has
been a lot of talk about gas prices and the potential positive benefits on the consumer. But just curious if you could
speak to the potential benefits you may receive on the P&L from a distribution standpoint, and if those are savings that
are there, how would you guys look to use those additional distribution savings between flowing through to earnings
and potentially reinvesting to drive traffic?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, I think a couple things. Certainly, there would likely be some benefits if we continue to
see fuel prices come down, but we haven't reached the threshold where fuel surcharges begin to come out of our
contracts. And I think importantly, given the great work the team has done to manage some of the port issues out West,
we're working around that and moving some freight further, expediting some freight, flying some freight, and I think
net-net, that will probably be more of a drag than any fuel savings we will see.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. And then, I guess just the second question on the overall basket. The UPT continues
to decline and actually looks like it decelerated a little bit on a two-year basis. Just wondering, if you can give us a little
bit more color around that particular dynamic, either at the store level perspective; given the higher food concentration,
I would be expecting that to improve, but maybe this is being offset by online? And I guess, the follow-up would be is,
how do you improve that dynamic moving forward? Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah, Sean. This is Kathee. It's predominantly a mix story for us. So, we have higher ticket
items like all the Apple products, including the launch of the iPhone 6 in the quarter. We've got video game consoles
that are higher. We have a lot of trade-up strategies, both in essentials like you talked about, like in grocery with
organics, but also in areas like skin care, which I described a little bit earlier. So, this is really a mix story.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. So, it's less about the shift between online and store at this point in time?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Correct. Correct. Yeah.
<Q - Sean P. Naughton>: Okay. Thank you. And best of luck for the holiday.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Thanks.

<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Good morning, and congrats on improved U.S. results. My first question is on expenses in the
U.S. They basically have been running flat on a dollar basis this year, or down a little bit per foot. I'm wondering, if
you can get into a little more detail on what's driving the cost savings? And then, in terms of the outlook, is this a line
that you think you can run flat to up in dollars, up slightly in dollars, over the next year or so? Or should we expect it to
grow a little faster than that?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Hey, Matt. Yeah, I think the expense savings, I would tell you, we've talked about the
expense optimization efforts all year, been very focused on that and has been across the entire enterprise, and we've
seen good news in SG&A and also in cost of goods.
The couple of areas I would point out, the stores' performance has been outstanding, driving productivity increases,
while still continuing to remain very strong guest service scores. Frankly, our guest service scores, historically, so
we've seen great performance there. And then, it's just really many other areas. There's been great work done in
marketing around the circular. There's been great work done in our transportation and how we optimize our network of
transportation; so really across the enterprise.
I think importantly to your question about going forward, we believe there continues to be significant opportunity for
us to continue to take expense out, and so for the foreseeable future we would expect to continue to see expenses very
well-controlled and to lever expenses at really relatively modest increases in sales.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Matt, it's Brian. And to build on John's point, and as I discussed in my prepared comments, as
we move forward, we recognize that we're going to continue to need to focus on expense management to fuel the
investments we're going to make to drive continued growth across our store base and our digital platform.
So, as we come back to you in the spring and we talk more specifically about our strategies, you should expect us to
continue to talk about cost optimization efforts and how we'll use those efforts to reinvest in the fuel that's going to
drive our growth.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. That's great. And then secondly, on Target.com, I wanted to ask a question about the
free shipping program. Does the incremental volume offset the incremental shipping expense? Is it profit accretive?
And do you think that the customers that are utilizing this offer are high lifetime value customers?
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Yeah, it's not accretive. I will tell you, we do ship even prior to the holiday free shipping,
we do free ship a lot more than perhaps you would think, and certainly more than some of our competitors, given
REDcard and the fact that, that ships free all year round.
So, we have seen – we know it's the number one frustration with our guests and the number one reason for abandoned
carts. And so, it was important for us this holiday season to be able to take that friction away and we have seen a
meaningful move in orders and conversion because of it. So, we are very pleased with the results so far.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah, Matt, the only thing I'd add, while not accretive, the other thing I would add is not
material either to our results in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Matt R. Nemer>: Okay. Very helpful. Best of luck this holiday.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Thanks, Matt.

Your next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Co.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thank you, and congrats. Regarding the great idea regarding signature categories and where
you're focusing there, how would you help us just prioritize, which categories have the most opportunities in terms of
lead-time and revenue mix and timing of impact? And is the extrapolation there that traffic will be the biggest kind of
comp upside driver as you do focus on these categories? Thanks.

<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Yeah, Oliver, I think as we go forward and as Kathee and the team really elevate our focus
around those signature categories. Categories like baby and kids, wellness and style, you should expect to see
additional focus in store. You should see additional innovation, partnerships, but really ensuring that we're leading with
trend. We're anticipating what our guest is looking for in those categories and those are categories that Target becomes
famous for.
And we're certainly going to double down our efforts in those categories, because our guest has asked us to. There are
categories that are very important to our guests. They're synonymous with the Target experience the guest is expecting
and you'll see signs of that as we move into 2015 and beyond.
Certainly, some of the work that Kathee and her team have done in preparation for the fourth quarter are already
bringing our efforts to life in apparel, some of the things that we've done in home. The partnerships that Kathee talked
about in her prepared comments, our continued focus on baby and kids and we know how important toys are during the
holiday season. So, we're already making progress in those spaces.
But, I also want to make sure, it's really clear that does not mean we're walking away from other categories in our
stores. They just play a different role in our future strategy. And they'll continue to be areas where we're going to look
to improve our execution and performance.
But from a prioritization standpoint, we think those signature categories that we've talked about are key to the guests.
The guest has told us, those are critically important to them and Kathee and her team are working rapidly to ensure that
we continue to build our position, enhance our assortment and bring great newness and innovation to those key
categories.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: So, couple things that I would add to that, that you will already see in stores right now,
Brian talked about those four areas, baby, kids, wellness and style.
So in baby, about 200 stores have a new presentation, where we've invested in labor in the stores to help guests create
registry and gift givers find a perfect gift. We've added mannequins and things that help the presentation. I also shared
today, the registry that we've re-done completely – the whole experience from the in-store hardware to the software that
we use and how that helps guests create registries much easier. We're already seeing the benefit of that.
Wellness, we've talked a lot about Made to Matter, better-for-you product. So, you see that already this year. And then,
in style, just to touch on that for a minute, we now have about 650 stores that have our new presentation in apparel,
including mannequins. So, already some progress and we will continue to push forward in those areas and you'll see
more and more as the months and year goes on.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Oliver, the final point I'd add, as we think about style, certainly apparel and home are
critically important in that space, but so is beauty. And as John and Kathee have referenced, beauty was one of our
standout categories in the third quarter and we expect continued strong performance as we exit the year.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thank you. And just as a follow-up that's related, there seems to be a lot of energized agility Brian
regarding thinking about what Target stands for, from a bigger-picture perspective. What are some of the initial
thoughts on where you see that opportunity as you work to further differentiate and innovate yourself?
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Yeah, Oliver, I think we're making progress across a number of different areas. Certainly, we
talked about omnichannel and really making sure that we are a significant player in this space. And we're seeing very
strong performance up over 30% in the third quarter. John talked about the fact we expect that performance to
accelerate in Q4.
We clearly took away the pain point of shipping by announcing free ship in the fourth quarter and we think that's
another way for us to declare we are significantly committed to this space. We're seeing a great response to Cartwheel,
11 million users to-date. And we're going to use that to make sure that we use digital as the front door to connect to the
Target brand going forward. We've talked about some of the progress that's being made in merchandising. And we've
added 35,000 new items in stores for the holiday. And we're going to continue to test and partner as we continue to
make sure we're bringing the right solutions to our guests.

If you haven't seen some of the holiday creative, I think it's some of the best Target's delivered in years. And I'm getting
e-mails and comments from guests and friends and people I know every day talking about their reaction to the holiday
creative. And how the creative campaign, it's uniquely Target. And we're certainly upping our game both in-store, but
we're also going to spend significantly more in digital this year to touch our guests no matter how they're connecting
with the brand.
In-store, we've made significant progress in a very short period of time going from testing ship-from-store to now we're
in 38 markets, 136 stores where our stores are acting like flexible fulfillment centers. You can shop there. You can
pickup there. But, they're also shipping directly to our guests and allows us to cover 90% of our marketplace in a very
short period of time. It takes the pain away from that last mile. So, I think you're going to continue to see us make these
points and as a sneak peek of Target in the future. And I think that is creating positive energy in the organization.
Kathee and I are hearing really positive things from our vendors. Our organization knows we've got to show more
ability. We've got to be responsive. We've got to make sure we're externally focused and following the guests. So, I
think you're seeing some of those things take shape today.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thank you. Thank you very much. Best regards for the holidays.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Wayne Hood from BMO Capital.
<Q - Wayne Hood>: Yeah, Kathee, I had a question. This is maybe a little bit longer-term and it plays into the context
of how you evolve the company and that is related to where you see AUR trending, because you're talking about more
emphasis in kids and baby, which typically is lower ticket and maybe pulling back on promotions and electronics
because that's not a core.
And I'm just wondering, where you think your AUR might land over the next few years in light of kind of the 2% to
3% growth you've been experiencing under the existing strategy. And then John, if you could talk about the growth in
inventory next year and its impact on working capital as you think about being better in stock on the ad merchandise
and the like? Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Tesija>: Wayne, we haven't modeled exactly what that will be yet. But I would tell you, I think that
it will be moving up for a couple of reasons. So, you heard Brian talk about those areas that we're going to focus on and
really being famous for them in delighting our guests.
And when we are at our best, we offer both Expect More, Pay Less together in all of these categories. And that means a
really thoughtful balance of good, better, best, having clear features and benefits as we move up that ladder, allowing
guests to be able to buy whatever is important to them; but importantly, offering really good trade-up opportunities.
So, you're seeing some of that right now in some categories, but I think as we move forward, and we become famous
again for some of these categories, there will be a lot of trade-up opportunities. So, I would say overall, seeing it
moving up.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: And Wayne, your second question, inventory. I think the one thing I'd say, if you look at our
number this quarter, 6% to 7%, all the U.S., really only about a third of that do we view as temporary. The vast
majority of that was receipt timing. But that third we expect to stay around. We started that in second quarter this year.
We'll cycle it again next year in second quarter, somewhere around a 2% to 3% increase for the first half of next year.
But offsetting it ultimately, as we start to get back to positive comp sales, we should see faster turn, that should
ultimately lead to better payables leverage. So, not a meaningful impact overall, once we get past fourth quarter here on
our working capital.

Your next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi, thanks. I had two questions that are maybe a little bit linked. John, if we start on dotcom,
which if my algebra is right, it's around 2.5% of sales in the quarter. What does that do to the margin going forward? I
know you mentioned it's immaterial for the fourth quarter, but could you tell us what it did in the third quarter and how
we should think about it? It's probably dilutive of some effect, and whether it's more in gross margin or SG&A? And
then I had a follow-up.
<A - John J. Mulligan>: On margin, it's definitely dilutive, Greg, if for no other reason than the shipping expense.
And I think as it continues to grow, that will put margin pressure on the P&L. And we've talked a little bit about this;
there are lots of puts and takes in gross margin as we think about it going forward that we're working through today. As
that business grows, it will be margin dilutive.
But as we increase penetration of ship-from-store and pickup in store, that significantly, not only improves our guest
experience, but significantly improves the P&L. We're also balancing how we look at pricing right now, and balancing
inventories across the network as we ship-from-store. So, some of those are up, some of those are down, and we're
working through right now where ultimately gross margin will land.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And then the follow-up, and maybe, Brian, in your comments, you talked about making sure in
the five key operating principles, the invest to build capabilities; I love your perspective on – this year CapEx is down a
lot and we're running, I guess a little over $2 billion is the run rate. What do you think is the CapEx need going forward
to invest in what Target really needs to do to be the best it can be?
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Greg, we're assessing that right now as we think about 2015 and beyond, but you should
expect us to be investing in the capabilities to continue to build out our digital experience, to continue to enhance our
in-store experience, to make sure we have the analytical tools to properly manage expenses and margin even more
surgically going forward.
And I talked about, while certainly in the early stages, we're going to continue to look at smaller formats and how we
use smaller formats to penetrate urban markets, allow our guests a chance to interact with the Target brand, both
in-store, but also continue to build out the opportunity for them to purchase online.
So, we're in the early stages of assessing our long-term capital needs, but you should expect us to be investing in the
right capabilities and tools to provide long-term shareholder value and allow us to continue to fuel our growth and
enhance both margins and continue to manage operating expenses effectively.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Would that mean CapEx would be above D&A at some point in the future? Or do you think
you can stay below that?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Greg, we think – at least, Brian said, I think, with the caveat that we're working through this
right now, we think we're probably in about the right range right now. The spend may move around a little bit.
I think the one wildcard is the point Brian made about small formats, but I would note that obviously, the investment
there is significantly below what a prototypical Target would look like. So, it would take a lot of those to meaningfully
move our CapEx number. So, like we've talked about something for the U.S. in that $2 billion, $2.5 billion range still
makes sense, but we're doing the work right now.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great. Thanks a lot. Good luck for holiday.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. I know there's a lot of big picture questions to discuss, but
I actually have two quantitative ones related to the quarter. First of all, John, can you talk about the magnitude of the
expense dollars that shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, and talk about perhaps, functionally speaking,
what they're related to?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Yeah. Most of it is marketing moved around. And the magnitude, if you think about us
beating by somewhere in the neighborhood of $0.09 is a little bit less than half the beat. So, somewhere in that $30
million to $40 million moved between the quarters.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. Thanks for that. And then secondly, you talked about running ahead of the fourth
quarter plan. Just as we think about the cadence of that plan, obviously you had a tough January, as did many retailers,
particularly given the breach. So when you say running ahead, is that running ahead of the 2% number as we speak, or
running ahead of a plan that's maybe a bit more nuanced than that, as we think about where we are in the progression of
the quarter and your compares a year-ago?
<A - John J. Mulligan>: Well, I wouldn't want to get into that level of detail. Clearly, last year pre-breach was
stronger than post-breach, and we took that into account as we thought about the calendarization of the plan. And right
now, we're running ahead of that, and we feel good about where we're at, not only relative to the plan, but on an
absolute basis, is what I'd say. But there is a lot of business left to be done before we get to the end of January.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. Thank you for both of those. Appreciate it.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Thanks, Matt.
Operator
Your final question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It's on the food category, and recognizing
that you're not going to de-emphasize it, you're just going to streamline it, how are you thinking about the return profile
of that space within the store? And then, could there be any differences in amongst how space is allocated? Could that
area get less over time?
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Yeah, let's drop back and make sure we clarify our point on the food category. We have no
intention today to streamline those categories. But Kathee and the team are certainly stepping back, listening to the
guests, really understanding what the Target guest is looking for in food; from an assortment standpoint, from a
newness standpoint. We talked about the fact that as we go forward, you should expect to see more natural and organic
offerings.
We've seen a terrific response from the guest as something that we call Made to Matter, a collection of items that are
on-trend for our Target guests, feature a number of exclusive items that Target from manufacturers that are in the
organic and natural space that can bring great innovation, gluten-free, on-trend products to our guests. And, we
certainly recognize that we have an opportunity to connect with the guests in a different way when it comes to food.
But, you shouldn't expect us to de-emphasize those categories. That's not the point. We're not streamlining our food
offering, but we are stepping back and really listening to the guests, making sure we curate on their behalf the right
items that are uniquely Target, that meet the needs of our guests in the food categories.
So, a lot more to come as we talk about this in the first quarter; but to make sure, we're really clear, we're not
streamlining food, we're not de-emphasizing food, we're not waking away from food. But, we certainly want to make
sure we put our mark on the food category with items that are uniquely Target, that are right for our guests, that are

<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. That's very helpful. And you think you can manage the return profile on that space to

<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. That's very helpful. And good luck with the rest of the holiday.
<A - Brian C. Cornell>: Thank you. Appreciate it.
