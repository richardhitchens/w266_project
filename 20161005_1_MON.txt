MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, and welcome to the Monsanto Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Meyer, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, you may
begin.
Laura J. Meyer
Thank you, Christine, and good morning to everyone. I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO;
Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and by Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also, joining me
from the IR team are Priyal Patel, Ben Kampelman and Christa Chancellor.
Our fourth quarter call marks the close of the fiscal year, and importantly provides our initial outlook into the
operational plans and financial guidance for fiscal year 2017. This call is being webcast, and you can access the
webcast supporting slides and the replay at monsanto.com. We've provided you with EPS and other measures on both a
GAAP and ongoing business basis; where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the nearest
GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may differ
materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements.

A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in our most recent 10-Q and in today's press
release. The forward-looking statements are current only as of the date of this call, and the company disclaims any
obligation to update them or the factors that may affect actual results.
First, let me review our year-end results as shown on slide six and seven. We delivered as-reported full-year earnings
per share of $2.99, reflecting $0.56 of expense for Argentine-related tax matters, $0.59 for restructuring charges, $0.38
of expense for environmental and litigation matters and $0.04 of income from discontinued operations.
On an ongoing basis, earnings per share were $4.48 for fiscal year 2016, slightly above our most recent guidance for
the year. Finally, our free cash flow for the fiscal year was $1.7 billion and exceeded the high end of our guidance
range due to a strong start for the South American season.
With that brief overview, let me hand it to Hugh to provide the strategic outlook.
Hugh M. Grant
Thanks, Laura, and good morning to everybody on the line. I'd like to begin this morning with our agreement to
combine with Bayer in this new era for agriculture. Our Board of Directors underwent a comprehensive evaluation
process and assessed a broad range of strategic options and opportunities. We unanimously determined that a
combination with Bayer represents the most compelling value for our shareowners with the most certainty through the
all-cash consideration.
So with this agreement as the backdrop, our two priorities going forward are as follows: first, delivering on the 2017
operational plan and key business milestones; and second, executing on the necessary steps to close the deal, which is
targeted for the end of calendar year 2017.
To be clear, our long-term growth plan and our pipeline remain intact, and consistent with what we shared at our
Whistle Stop investor event in mid-August. However, we recognize that what matters most to our owners now is
delivering 2017, and closing the deal. So that will be our focus for the year ahead and in these updates to you.
This deal was struck because the overarching needs to deliver innovation to growers continues as demand continues to
climb. I know that, that may seem incongruent, especially when corn is below $4 a bushel and soybeans are below $10.
However, the most recent WASDE report demonstrates that the demand trend remains both intact and robust.
In fact, as seen on slide eight, the trend line is more than 1 billion bushels of growth a year for corn and greater than
500 million bushels of growth a year for soybeans, which is consistent with the historical growth trends. Meeting that
demand over the next decade would require a two-fold increase in the rate of yield growth for corn and a four-fold
increase for soybeans. Innovation, quite simply, is the best way to increase productivity to meet this projected demand.
And our unique platform advantages provide this innovation as shown on slide nine.
That all starts with our industry-leading seed and trait technologies, which reach approximately 400 million acres
today, as a result of strong grower demands and our historical broad licensing approach. This footprint serves as the
foundation for future upgrades and new technologies, which includes the global annual corn germplasm upgrades,
Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO, the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System, seed treatments to do our BioAg Alliance
with Novozymes, and finally our unique Climate FieldView platform. This platform has become the digital ag standard
for growers large and small, with its reach now on 95 million acres.
To reinforce our innovation platform leadership, we recently expanded our capabilities in genome editing. In addition
to those with target gene in Nomad, we now have agreements in place with Dow AgroSciences and the Broad Institute
to further unlock technological capabilities in this rapidly expanding area of science. Further, these unique innovation
platforms are highly complementary to Bayer's Crop Protection business.
As you know, at Monsanto, we've discussed the value of an enhanced agricultural portfolio for a long time. We're
entering a new era in agriculture, one of which growers are demanding new solutions and technologies to be more
profitable and more sustainable. By pairing Bayer's exceptional Crop Protection portfolio with our Seeds and Traits and

Climate FieldView platform, we expect to accelerate the rate and the delivery of advancements that will make a real
difference on the farm.
To get there from here, we need to close the deal, and we're confident in our path to do so. This confidence stems from
the following points; first, these are two different but complementary businesses, that we're proposing to combine, with
limited overlap in products and in geographies.
Second, we've a long history of making our technologies widely accessible through licensing and open infrastructure,
and Bayer has indicated that they're committed to continuing that practice. And third, Bayer's backed up this confidence
with a $2 billion reverse break-up fee.
Our early outreach to various stakeholders in the recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, led by Senator Grassley,
bolsters this confidence, as there's an indication of a broader understanding of the factors and the regulatory process.
Moving to slide 10, we've provided our anticipated timeline for the transaction, and we look forward to updating you
on the status as we move forward. Until then, we're committed to operate as an independent company, and we're
focused fully on the year ahead. With strong demand for new soybean technologies and improved cost of goods, we
expect to return to growth in our ongoing earnings per share in fiscal year 2017, anticipating up to 9% growth
year-over-year.
So with those brief headlines, let me pass it to, Brett to discuss the operational plans that support our outlook. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning, everyone. Before I outline our operational plans for fiscal year 2017, it's important
to put 2016 in context. No doubt, it was a challenging year, but despite those challenges, we stayed the course on
several key deliverables, including outstanding penetration of our Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO technology, the
launch of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans, our continued global corn germplasm upgrade, which resulted in record
corn seed volumes in the U.S., and our disciplined to spend management. Executing these deliverables provides the
base for growth, positioning us well for long-term earnings power, and I'll spend my time today outlining the growth
drivers for our fiscal year 2017 operational plan.
Let's begin with corn on slide 11. At a high level, we expect corn gross profit growth from global price mix gains, share
gains and continued momentum in South America. When we take a closer look, we see greater than 25% acre growth in
Argentina, strong price increases planned across South America, and an expected strong season in South Africa.
In the U.S., we have plans in place to grow genetic share yet again, and we've priced the majority of our existing
hybrids flat to down slightly and our new hybrids at a premium. This maintains our premium pricing, which reflects our
higher performing portfolio. And all of this together – add all of this together, and we expect, first, our global corn
germplasm price mix lift in local currency will be roughly flat to up low-single-digits in terms of percentages. And
second, we plan to grow our global corn germplasm footprint in an environment where global corn acres are expected
to be roughly flat.
In soybeans in 2017, we expect to reach several significant milestones, as shown on slide 12, and deliver improved
margins as well as greater than 20% growth in global soybean gross profit compared to 2016.
For Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO, we plan to reach an expected 45 million acres to 55 million acres in South America
as shown on slide 13. We expect the vast majority of this footprint will be in Brazil. And with continued progress
towards maintaining reliable value capture in Argentina, we are optimistic about that country's contribution to that
overall total.
Let's move from a product with an opportunity on 100 million acres to the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System
opportunity that more than doubles that figure, as shown on slide 14. We now expect supply for more than 15 million
U.S. acres of Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans. With key import approvals now in hand, and the expected approval
for the in-crop use of dicamba on the horizon from the EPA, we expect Xtend-related COGS to decline significantly

year-over-year.
In addition, we have priced Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybean varieties at a $5 to $10 premium for the improved
genetics and weed control flexibility, and demand for the technology is high. Also, we recently shared that Syngenta is
a new licensee of the Roundup Ready 2 Xtend trait. With this addition, the number of seed partners offering this new
option has a footprint on more than 90% of the acres in the U.S.
Moving to our complementary crops, the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System story continues. We expect the Bollgard
II XtendFlex cotton area will exceed 3 million acres in 2017, and we expect those traded acres to generate a premium
for the weed control benefit they provide.
We also see 2017 as the third consecutive year of share growth. Between our branded and licensed cotton business in
the U.S., we have grown by more than eight share points in the last year, and I expect share growth again for this year.
Moving to Ag Productivity, we plan to maintain our emphasis on cost discipline, and focus on the construction of our
new dicamba facility, while launching some of our new formulations of dicamba. We also plan to remain consistent
with our strategy to price just above generics, with our high-volume glyphosate-based herbicide portfolio, and this is
expected to create another year of pricing headwinds. Longer-term, our plans are to add new dicamba formulations as
well as new molecules like the new PPO weed control technology we are developing with Sumitomo.
And finally, the platform that serves as the technology integrator, Climate FieldView, as shown on slide 15, continues
to see major advancements as the business and platform continues to evolve. We just released four new product
enhancements for 2017, that will give growers better insight into their farms to help manage field variability and
analyze seed performance in ways they've never had before. We expect these upgrades to help drive paid acres and our
goal for the year ahead is to hit 25 million paid acres.
We have also made progress with partnerships and collaborations in the industry to continue connecting fields and
decision points faced by our customers. We have six total retail partners and our FieldView Drive, now works on most
tractors and more than half of the combines in the U.S.
In fiscal year 2016, we exceeded our objective with greater than 14 million paid acres. In fiscal year 2017, we are off to
a strong start with FieldView Drive sales, which ramped up since Farm Progress and provided an additional 5 million
paid acres, accelerating us towards our objective of 25 million paid acres.
In addition to equipment and retail linkages, we are also attracting new platform partners, such as Veris Technologies,
which manufactures and markets the world's first high-resolution soil sensing technology. Climate can now begin to
analyze this data in conjunction with other information to help growers and their trusted advisors make more informed
decisions on how to optimize productivity on their farm. And we expect to add several more partners to the platform in
the coming year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre for the financial translation of these operational plans. Pierre?
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone. In a very challenging environment, financial discipline and balanced
capital allocation were key to delivering 2016; and I am proud of what we accomplished.
First, we successfully delivered on our restructuring and cost saving plan targets of $165 million. Second, we
maintained our premium pricing approach and inked several new strategic licensing agreements. Those two examples
demonstrate our ability consistently deliver return on innovation. And third, we concluded our capital allocation
commitments, returning more than $30 billion in cash to our owners over the past three years through the combination
of share repurchases and dividends.
In the fourth quarter, we closed out the year with an as-reported loss of $0.44 per share, and delivered ongoing earnings
per share of $0.07. The primary difference between the as-reported loss and the ongoing earnings per share was related

to approximately $280 million in litigation settlement costs associated with a group of legacy PCB personal injury
claims.
In September, after diligent efforts, we were pleased to reach an agreement to potentially settle all the legacy PCB
personal injury claims, including those on appeal. The settlement and final payment amounts will be contingent upon
the level of claimant participation which we anticipate will be met at a very high level.
In addition to the settlement expense, we incurred some additional restructuring costs and trued-up our overall
restructuring planned cost estimates which we now expect to be lower, and in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion for
the entire plan.
The ongoing results of $0.07 for the quarter were better than last year, driven by the previously discussed $157 million
gain from the formation of the sorghum joint venture with Remington, a strong start in South America, reflecting
stronger corn acres, as well as slower seed returns in the U.S., in both corn and soybeans. The positive earnings results
in the fourth quarter, along with strong prepays for Intacta in Brazil, translated to better than expected free cash flows.
Moving to the full year results. On an as-reported basis, we delivered earnings per share of $2.99, reflecting costs
associated with our restructuring actions, Argentine-related tax matters, environmental and litigation matters and
income from discontinued ops. On an ongoing basis, this translated to EPS of $4.48, slightly above our most recent
guidance, and stronger than expected free cash flows of $1.7 billion, which was $100 million above the high end of our
guidance range.
Continued focus on innovation and cost discipline set up a strong base for 2017, where we are expecting a return to
gross profit growth in our Seeds and Genomics segment, driven by our soybean blockbusters and improved cost of
goods sold.
On an as-reported basis, and as shown in our reconciliations, we expect our EPS to be in the range of $3.83 to $4.35
with proposed Bayer transaction-related costs, anticipated restructuring charges and continued Argentine-related tax
matters expense as the primary drivers of the difference from our ongoing estimate.
Our fiscal year 2017 ongoing earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.90 as shown on slide 16.
This translates into up to 9% growth in our ongoing earnings per share year-over-year and strong free cash flows.
Within these estimates, we have assumed that currencies are relatively stable year-over-year.
Our Seeds and Genomics segment gross profit is expected to increase mid-single-digits as a percentage year-over-year,
with soybean gross profit alone expected to grow by more than 20%. This is driven primarily by the expected increases
in Intacta and Xtend soybean penetration and related trait fees plus a significant expected reduction in the cost of goods
sold.
In corn, growth is expected to come from global genetic share gains from the annual germplasm refresh and germplasm
price mix lift in local currency. However, we are prepared to respond as necessary to any emerging competitive
dynamics in fiscal year 2017. From a strategic licensing perspective, we are expecting the benefit to decline in this
segment with an expectation of approximately $60 million in gross profit towards the end of the fiscal year.
Shifting gears, our Ag Productivity gross profit is expected to be in the range of $900 million to $1 billion, reflecting
year-over-year price declines in our glyphosate-based herbicides primarily affecting the first half comparison. In
addition, we expect a contribution of approximately $140 million in strategic deal opportunities in this segment's gross
profit in the latter half of the year pending the final deal structures.
We also expect to see the early contributions from sales of dicamba-based herbicides that Brett referenced and some
expenses associated with the construction of the dicamba facility in this segment as well.
Our restructuring and cost savings initiatives are on track, as shown on slide 17, with the opportunity to deliver
approximately $380 million in annual savings at the close of 2017 in operating expenses and cost of goods as compared
to fiscal year 2015. However, overall operating expenses in 2017 are expected to increase slightly with inflation and the
costs associated with a return to growth of the business more than offsetting the savings from restructuring and cost

savings initiatives. Finally, the tax rate for 2017 is expected to be in the range of 25% to 28%.
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we expect to effectively convert our anticipated earnings into cash, with
free cash flow expected to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. These consists of operating cash flows in the
range of $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion, while cash used for investing activities is expected to be in the range of $1 billion
to $1.2 billion, assuming the successful sale of our Precision Ag Equipment business, and our first year of meaningful
investments in the dicamba production facility.
In closing, these plans, with our focus on return on innovation and financial discipline, build a solid foundation for
growth as shown on slide 18, and underpin our Integrated Solutions strategy and vision for agriculture.
With that, I will now pass it to, Laura for the Q&A.
Laura J. Meyer
Thanks, Pierre. We'd now like to open the call for approximately 20 minutes of questions. As we typically do, I'll ask
that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as possible.
You're always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up.
Christine, we're ready to take questions from the line.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Don Carson with
Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don Carson>: Yes. Thank you. Hugh, I want to go back to some of your comments on the Bayer transaction.
You've got $128 firm bid, your stock's trading at $102, so there seems to be some concern over antitrust risks. Now,
you mentioned reasons why you don't think that it's a big issue, but the regulators have said they're going to evaluate
this transaction, but also not just in its own merits, but in light of the other two major transactions that are out there. So
how do you assess that risk from an antitrust standpoint?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah. Don, thanks for your question this morning. I'd go back to my opening remarks, the
unique thing about this transaction is, there's very little overlap. So you are bringing together a Seed business and a
Crop Protection business, and I think we can bring these two businesses together with much better insight for the
grower by using digital agriculture. So, I can't speculate on regulators or opine on how regulators are going to view
this, but I think, it's a really unique combination, and the focus on this will be driving the innovation curve.
So – producing better products faster, and as we embark on that conversation with regulators, we will be stressing that
innovation curve, and that was certainly emphasized in the hearings with – that Senator Grassley hosted a few weeks
ago, when Rob had a chance to talk about innovation.
I guess, the last thing I'd talk about, when we IPO-ed this business 15-plus-years ago where we spent about $300
million in innovation, this year will be northwards or around $1.5 billion. And I think, the combination going forward
allows us to more efficiently drive R&D, and get to those much-needed solutions.
So that will be the conversation when we get in front of the regulators, but the irony, Don is, in a tough time in
agriculture, there's never been a greater need for innovation, and those seem to be at odds, but that's the reality of the
marketplace we're in.
<Q - Don Carson>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: I'm looking at your comments about your price cards, it could be somewhat flat, it looks like.
Your major competitor is also saying, their price cards are flat. But we know that most of the competitive pressures
occur at the end of the season, maybe in January, February. So what are your expectations for realized prices in seeds?
And how realistic are they in light of what happened last year?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, P.J. Thanks. I'll maybe ask, Brett, to say a few words, but the sequence in this, we price
in late summer. We truck in early fall. We start trucking and logistically shift; and seeds are planted in the spring of
2017. But Brett, just – feedback on price cards, and how you see it playing out?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, thanks, P.J. Good morning. I think a couple of things. So first of all, the idea that
we're pricing most of our portfolio relatively flat to down a little bit is very consistent with our overall pricing strategy
that we typically use as we put new products in the marketplace. And just like in other years, our new better-performing
products that went out this year are priced at a premium.
And that premium is based on the value that they bring to the farmer, better than the products that are already there.
Commodity price obviously is part of that equation, and we do that calculation, so that premium is a little bit less than it
would be in years where you have higher commodity prices, but they're still bringing a significant value. And I think
what that does, it holds in place, our portfolio being priced above others in the marketplace, which we fully expect.
So we don't anticipate to match up with everybody else's price card. We expect to be at a premium. I would suggest that
some of the shenanigans, if you want to call them that, that happened late in the year are ineffective for everybody. It's
– farmers are making their decisions now as they're running their combines, they're looking at harvest. They're working
with their seed reps, making a decision on what they're going to plant. And the biggest driver on that decision, as it
always is, is going to be performance. How are the products performing in the field; and we'll continue to have that
conversation with our farmers. But we'll be on the ready if something is developed in the market to compete.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Hey, guys. How's it going?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Can you just talk a little bit more about the longer-term trends in seeding
populations in both the U.S. and even Brazil longer-term, and how this translates into your own expectations netting
out acreage trends going forward? Do you just generally believe this is a longer-term trend? And also, how does this
translate into the competitive environment given the technological differences amongst your germplasm portfolio
versus others? Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Chris, thanks for the question. As you kind of hinted at this, this is a trend that's increasing.
We breed towards that, so as we're looking at new varieties, we're breeding for varieties that thrive in higher density
populations.

And then I think the developments with climate and digital agriculture allow us to [indiscernible] (29:53) that plant
population across a field. But Brett, if you look right now, this coming year or the near-term, how is it shaping up?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, if you look at the year we just finished in 2016 and the year we're going into in
2017, you can clearly see the trend continuing across corn, particularly in North America where planting populations
are increasing a bit, and it's exactly what Hugh was describing. That's part of how you drive yield is increasing your
plants in the field. You just have to have genetics that work in that environment.
That's starting to happen in South America, not to the extent that it has in North America. My anticipation is, is tools
like Climate are going to help dramatically in South America to help the farmer better understand the value of
increasing seeding populations, because it's counterintuitive; sometimes when they're stressed on commodity price and
profitability, they look at seed and they want to back off, but that's the worst thing that they can do.
Now, I will tell you, some of the data we'll show you in soybeans, that there are – there may be opportunities. In some
varieties, they are being over-planted. So again, I think that's the beauty of the analytical tools that we're developing in
Climate. It isn't always to sell the farmer more. It's to optimize the decisions that they're making to increase the
profitability on the farm. And I think that sometimes is misunderstood. It's all about helping them make a better
decision.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Hugh and Pierre, can you talk about tailwinds in 2017 from lower COGS and lower Xtend
launch costs?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: Sure. So when we're looking into 2017, I mean, we see definitely a return to growth in
our Seeds and Traits business. And actually, just stepping back into 2016, and Brett partly covered that, but when you
look at 2016, if you just look at corn and soybeans, if you exclude the impact of currency in a extremely challenging
environments, I mean, we've been able to grow gross profit in both segments, in corn and soybeans, if you exclude the
currency. So there is some really nice momentum that's been building, and I think our corn business has shown some
very nice resilience there.
If you assume entering into 2017, more stable currencies, we are confident this is a business that's going to be growing
in 2017. And two of the elements you mentioned related to the tailwinds are effectively going to help us continue to
grow, but it's really the dynamics of our two blockbusters in soybeans, Xtend and Intacta, now that the bases have been
set. And in corn, this is, as Brett was mentioning, this ability to continue to have some level of germplasm mix lift and
some level of share gains.
Now, regarding the tailwinds, we see fairly significant tailwinds in terms of cost of goods when it comes to Xtend, as
you mentioned. So we quoted about $150 million of headwinds this year and we said about two-thirds of those, we will
be able to recover next year, and this is still absolutely valid.
And in terms of corn, we will see the tailwind associated with more production, and that's – as we mentioned.
However, in corn, we are also seeing some higher cost in Brazil related to commodity price, currency and a couple of
other elements, and we are also upgrading our seed treatments across the board on our corn cost of goods. So we're not
going to see as much tailwind as we were expecting, definitely, in the corn business, but in soybeans, the Xtend-related

expect to lose money in Q1?

remarks. However, when you look at Q1, the way we are thinking about Q1 is that, it should be similar to slightly better
than what we saw last year.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Stephen Byrne>: Yes. Thank you. Given the new Seed Law in Argentina has not yet been promulgated, are you
guys selling the Xtend soybean down in that region for the upcoming growing season? And what do you think of the
draft language in that law that specifies a maximum of three years of royalties payable by the growers? What do you
think of that?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Steve, thanks for the question. We've obviously been involved in these discussions. Brett,
maybe just some headlines?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Steve. I think let's start with the Seed Law, and then where we go
from there. I think you used the operative word, the draft language for the Seed Law that included the three years. We
continue to work with the coalition down there and that's a coalition made up of seed companies, trade and technology
providers both from Argentina and outside of Argentina, grain handlers and the interested farm groups to work with the
government on the new Seed Law.
So we pushed back substantially on that. I mean, they're looking for investment in agriculture and that just discourages
investment in agriculture. So we've given that feedback, and we think that's been well understood. But we'll continue to
work with them on that draft language.
In the interim, there is a resolution in place that we can work with that we did this year. We will continue to work with
the government and the coalition to execute that resolution going into next year while we're in conjunction working on
the new Seed Law. And we will continue to look for better and better integrity in the system.
As it speaks specifically to Xtend, we will continue to hold back on our Xtend technology until we see a system that
has a higher level of integrity than what we currently see today. And that can either be a new Seed Law that's
negotiated to a better place or it can be improvements in the system that we already have operating that are satisfactory
to the coalition. So we'll keep working on them, but we're going to hold back Xtend until we're confident it's in a better
place.

<Q - Christopher Evans>: Good morning. Can you discuss the current sales environment in South America? Most
importantly, I guess your expectation for a local currency pricing expectation sort of excluding your high adoption rate
of Intacta?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Chris. This is Brett. Happy to. And by coincidence, I was just in
Brazil last week, so fresh on my mind and had the opportunity to talk with a number of folks down there. So a couple
of things. One, I think, first you mentioned Intacta and we're still finishing out the agreement we had with farmers from
a number of years ago when we made the transition. So we're priced the same as we were last year, and the feedback
from farmers is, Intacta continues to deliver phenomenal value in the market. Anticipation is strong for increased yield
or sales as reflected in the significant prepay that we enjoyed this year based on Intacta.
In regards to corn, we took significant double-digit price increases across the corn portfolio, and I look at it as trying to
get back some of that loss from currency that we've experienced in the last year or two, and so far, so good. I mean, it's
working. The farmers understand, and we just have to be respectful of their situation and work with them and
communicate and so far, so good. And we'll continue that approach as we start looking at safrinha, which will be on top
of us right around the corner.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: I think the only thing I'd add, Bob (sic) [Chris] (38:27), is the impact Intacta's had on
insecticide sales [ph] there, too (38:32). So growers are seeing – they're seeing great results and they're – they've been a
lot more accurate and a lot more careful in their insecticide application, so we're seeing some nice substitution
opportunities in the last two seasons.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John Roberts>: Thank you. Maybe an easy one for Pierre, and then maybe a harder one for Hugh. Pierre, how
are you defining strategic licensing as opposed to the rest of your licensing? And is that comp of $200 million for the
upcoming year versus $370 million last year at the comp?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So answering the second part of the question, yes, this is a comparable. These are
comparable numbers. I mean, it's just the balancing between the segments that we tried to represent today in our
prepared remarks. And the way we are thinking about those strategic deals is more in terms of important transfers of
either IP or, in certain cases, assets compared to ongoing licensing that we have on our lines and some of our traits.
So it's really – those are more unique in nature and compared to what we see in our business. So that's a distinction that
we make in terms of the strategic licensing compared to the ongoing licensing that we have commonly.
<Q - John Roberts>: And then, Hugh, when you bid for Syngenta over a year ago, I think Monsanto was willing to
divest all of Syngenta's Seed business. I believe the Bayer agreement has $1.6 billion divestiture revenue threshold,
which I think if they had to divest all of the Bayer Seed business plus glyphosate would be exceeded. So how do we
think about that threshold?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, John, you're right. You did ask Pierre the easier of the two questions. Thank you for
that. So it's $1.6 billion threshold. The composition of that are the properties that will be sold versus retained hasn't
been made public yet. So it's hard for me to comment on that. But I would go back to my earlier point that, compared to
the Syngenta deal that never happened, the overlap in this deal is significantly less, because there is a much smaller
overlap in the seeds – in the seed properties. So we'll see how this plays out, John. But I think as we look at the overlap
or the lack of overlap, I'm encouraged on how the two properties line up.
<Q - John Roberts>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Thanks very much. Do you expect to file your definitive proxy in October or even by
mid-October? And secondly, the point of the Bayer combination is to enhance innovation. Given how long it takes to
bring new agricultural products to market, is it really the case that we'll find out if innovation is created 10 years to 20
years from now rather than, I don't know, three years to five years from now? Do you think that that's an appropriate
characterization?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Jeff, thanks very much for the two questions. I think, taking the last piece first.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Sure.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: So as you look at innovation, I think, number one, [ph] the needs now have been great (42:26).
And number two, I think there's a capacity to accelerate innovation, particularly in the area of digital agriculture and
particularly in the area of precision agriculture where we're developing software and where we're using literally
harvested data to improve decision quality on farm.
So I don't – there's a piece of this, I don't think you wait 10 years or 20 years, there's a piece of this. I think you see very
quickly, and Brett used some of those examples in his prepared remarks. So I think there'll be evidence of that
acceleration as you bring these platforms together. And to Brett's point, I don't think that's increasing costs for the
grower. I think, it increases efficiency that unlocks that extra bushel.
And then it's hard to see on the proxy, but our expectation would be, by the end of October. So the merger agreement's
already out there. The frequently asked Q&As are out there already. And then the proxy will contain the next tranche of
information around the deal and the history on the lead up to the deal. And I would expect we'll see that around the end
of October.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: You spoke of innovation and digital and precision. Does Bayer accelerate innovation in
digital and precision agriculture or can we see that on your own?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, I think for – to your point earlier, time will be the proof of this, but I think...
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Sure.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: ...the more that you can bring up in that platform faster, the quicker you build insights for the
grower. So if you think back the – between Climate and Precision Ag, we're in our third season. Brett, talked about 95
million acres, so very, very fast growth. But it's the quality of the data that you bring in the platform, so the machinery
company is now up, all of U.S. distribution now up, and I think when we bring the Bayer and Crop Protection materials
up, you just increase the density of the – and the subsequent quality of decision-making.
And we've always said that, there would be space in that platform for all of our competitors as well, so I think that this
will be a broadly licensed platform and then the competitive element of this will be who delivers the best insights, and I
think Bayer will really help in that.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Okay. Good. Thank you so much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.
<A - Laura J. Meyer>: Christine, we'll take questions from one more analyst, please.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question at the end, here. You talk about a 20% increase
in soybean gross profit in fiscal 2017. Can you break that down a bit into different buckets of how you get to 20%
increase looking at, you know, was it acreage increases, is it trait upgrades? Maybe give us a little more clarity on that?
Thanks.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So this is Pierre. When you're looking at the 20%-plus growth, we are looking at in
terms of the soybeans business, it's really, I mean, three different things, and all are significant in matter. So the first
one is the continuation of Intacta, the growth of Intacta in South America where we are anticipating to be on 45 million
acres to 55 million acres. So this is a fairly large buckets of the growth we are looking into soybeans.
The second element is related to our Xtend launched in the U.S., where based on the launch we had or the limited
launch we had in 2015, early 2016, we feel very confident that we'll be able to reach the 15 million acres. And the
feedback we get from the field, the demand there is really very strong. So we feel very good about also those 15 million
acres.
And then, the third elements of the growth is what we discussed earlier, which is basically the absence of some of the
costs we saw, the launch costs we saw in 2016 and we were talking about $100 million there. So these are the three key
drivers of the growth in soybeans, and that's why we are very confident that we're going to see this 20%-plus growth in
our GP in soybeans.
<Q - Joel Jackson>: So, the last question, I'd kind of fit in is on currency. You do talk about expecting stable currency
in fiscal 2017 in your guide. Because we've obviously seen South American currencies really re-appreciate, so is there
room here for earnings to really hit the top-end of the range if currencies kind of hang around spot level? Thanks.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So the way we've been thinking of the guidance in general, and as every year when we
enter the year, we've got a range of assumptions, and currency is definitely one of the assumptions. And definitely this
is a sensitivity, and the way we are looking at South America currencies right now, I mean, especially the Brazilian
reais, it's fairly favorable, but this is part of our range of guidance, so definitely this is an element that we've been
considering.
<Q - Joel Jackson>: Thank you.
Hugh M. Grant
So thanks very much for your questions this morning. Let me just briefly summarize as we try to respect your time. So
a big year ahead for Monsanto. Our plan to return to EPS growth in 2017 is on solid ground, and we are now eager as a
team to get started. And simply, if you look at the year ahead, we've two priorities: delivering on the operations and the
key milestones for the year to deliver that growth, as well as executing on the necessary steps to close the deal with
Bayer. So as the year progresses, we look forward to updating you as the process unfolds. And thanks, again, for
joining us on the call this morning. All the very best.
