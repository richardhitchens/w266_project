MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for standing by and welcome to Accenture's first quarter fiscal 2014
earnings call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. KC McClure.
Please go ahead.
K. C. McClure
Thank you, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Announcement.
As Tom just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre
Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter.
Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our business outlook for the
second quarter and full fiscal year 2014. And then, we will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the
end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or
net revenues.
Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You should keep in
mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause

obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our results for the first quarter, which
were in line with our expectations. We, again, delivered profitable growth and returned substantial cash to our
shareholders.
I'm particularly pleased with our new bookings, which demonstrate that we continue to provide differentiated and
highly relevant services to our clients, and which position us well for the rest of the fiscal year.
Here are a few highlights for the quarter. We did get very strong new bookings of $8.7 billion, including consulting
bookings of more than $4 billion. We generated revenues of $7.4 billion, a 3% increase in local currency and at the top
of our guided range. We delivered earnings per share of $1.15, an 8% increase.
We expanded operating margin 30 basis points to 14.8%. We generated free cash flow of $122 million. And we
continued to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $4.5 billion. And we continued
to return substantial cash to shareholders through a significant increase in our share repurchase this quarter versus Q1
last year and the payment of a semi-annual dividend of $0.93 per share which is a 15% increase over our prior
dividend.
So, we are off to a good start in fiscal 2014 with our business developing in a way that makes us confident in our ability
to deliver our business outlook for the year.
Now, let me hand over to David who will review the numbers in greater detail. David?
David P. Rowland
Thank you. Thank you, Pierre. Happy holidays to all of you and thanks for joining us today. As I review the results on
this morning's call, you'll see that we delivered very good results in quarter one as compared to the business outlook
that we provided for both the quarter and the full fiscal year.
Our results continue to reflect good profitability and cash flow. And our revenues landed at the top end of our guided
range for the quarter, with signs of positive momentum in several areas of our business.
So overall, I was pleased with our quarter one results, which came in as expected and represent a solid start to the new
fiscal year.
Now, let's get to the numbers starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were $8.7 billion, the third
highest quarter on record as we saw strong demand for our services across many dimensions of our business.
Consulting bookings were stronger than expected at $4.3 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Outsourcing bookings were
very good as well at $4.4 billion, following a very strong quarter four with a book-to-bill of 1.3.

Taking a closer look at our new bookings, there's several additional points worth noting. Consulting bookings were the
second highest quarter on record and exceeded $4 billion for the first time since quarter two fiscal 2013, reflecting good
demand across the three components of our Consulting business. In particular, systems integration bookings were the
strongest in three quarters, reflecting double-digit sequential growth and a book-to-bill at the upper-end of our target
range.
Outsourcing bookings reflected good demand in technology outsourcing, with strong sequential growth and a
book-to-bill of 1.3. BPO bookings were solid this quarter following very strong bookings in quarter four, and the
overall demand environment remains robust.
Bookings in Financial Services and H&PS both reflected double-digit sequential growth, providing a solid foundation
for the remainder of the year. And lastly, we continue to see strong demand for helping our clients tackle their largest,
most complex projects, resulting in 13 clients with bookings over $100 million.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in
local currency, reflecting negative 1% FX impact as compared to the approximately negative 2% impact provided in
our business outlook last quarter. Adjusting for FX, we were at the top end of our guided range for the quarter.
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.9 billion, down 1% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. Outsourcing
revenues were $3.4 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars and down (sic) [up] 6% in local currency.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, the results were also very consistent with our expectations so let me share
some of the highlights.
Products and H&PS led the way, with both operating groups posting 6% growth. Products, our largest operating group,
continued their track record of driving a very consistent level of growth and, once again, the results were characterized
by broad-based growth across the dimensions of the business, meaning they delivered positive growth in both
Consulting and Outsourcing in all three geographic areas and in the majority of industry segments.
As expected, H&PS did see some moderation following nine straight quarters of double-digit growth. Our Health
business grew double-digits driven by the Americas. Public Service growth was also positive for the quarter, with very
strong growth in the Americas offset by a decline in EMEA.
For H&PS overall, we expect some further moderation in the growth in the second quarter before building in the
second half of the year.
Financial Services grew 3% in local currency, very consistent with what I signaled last quarter. The transformational
agenda continues to be a central theme with our clients, which builds strong Outsourcing growth in the quarter across
most industries and geographic areas, offset by a modest decline in Consulting.
Also, it's important to note that we saw overall positive momentum in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific, with low-single
digit growth in EMEA and very significant double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific.
Resources showed improvement with 1% local currency growth as the business continues to stabilize and position itself
for positive growth this year. We continue to focus on repositioning the business in North America and EMEA. That
said, we're seeing pockets of strength emerging in certain areas of our Resources business, most notably in both our
global energy business and Asia-Pacific.
CMT posted negative 2% growth in the quarter, but we continue to feel good about the actions underway to position
the business for sustained positive growth this year. Our efforts to diversify our CMT business are taking hold and we
see strong demand for transformation-led, value-driven projects where we are uniquely positioned. We continue to be
pleased with our progress in the Americas, including very significant growth in electronics and high-tech.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared with 32.8% for the same period
last year, up approximately 50 basis points.

Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 12.6% of net revenues compared to 12% of net revenues for the first
quarter last year, up approximately 60 basis points. General and administrative expense of 6.1% of net revenues
compared with 6.2% of net revenues for the first quarter last year.
Operating income was $1.1 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 14.8% operating margin compared with 14.5% for
the same period last year. This 30-basis-point increase reflects a benefit of approximately 20 basis points from a
reduction in reorganization liabilities.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1% compared with 26.8% for the first quarter last year.
Net income was $812 million for the first quarter, and it was $766 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of
6%.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.15 compared with $1.06 in the first quarter last year, an increase of $0.09.
Turning to DSOs, our day services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 34 days, up from 31 days
last quarter.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $181 million,
net of property and equipment additions of $59 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at November 30 was $4.5 billion, compared with $5.6 billion at August
31 last year and reflects our share repurchases this quarter in addition to the higher dividends we paid in November.
Moving to some other operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global head count of about 281,000 people and
we now have approximately 186,000 people in our global delivery network. In quarter one, our utilization was 87%
compared with 88% in quarter four last year.
Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 11%, down from quarter four and in line with quarter one last
year.
Lastly, we now expect that at least 60,000 people will join our company in fiscal 2014.
As it relates to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter we repurchased or redeemed
approximately 9.7 million shares for $722 million at an average price of $74.27 per share. At November 30, we had
approximately $6.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
Also in November, we paid a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.93 per share for a total of $630 million. This represented
a $0.12 or 15% increase over the dividend we paid in May.
So in summary, in a market that offered many opportunities but also many challenges, our results came in as expected
and gave us a good foundation to build on as we progress throughout the year.
With that, let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
At our Investor and Analyst Conference in October, I shared with many of you how we are investing across the board
to further differentiate Accenture and capture new waves of growth. Today, I'm going to provide a brief update on
some of the steps we are taking to drive further innovation and to continue to build differentiated capabilities and
solutions for our clients.
Earlier this month, we launched two new growth platforms, Accenture Digital and Accenture Strategy. We continue to
invest in strategic acquisitions to enhance our capabilities in key growth areas, and we remain focused on positioning
Accenture as the partner of choice for large-scale transformation.

Let me bring this to light with a bit more detail. Starting with Accenture Digital, over the last few years we have made
significant investments in building our digital capabilities through Accenture Interactive, Accenture Analytics, and
Accenture Mobility. With Accenture Digital, we are bringing all of these together to create what we believe is the
world's largest end-to-end digital capability.
Accenture Digital includes 23,000 professionals working across the entire digital landscape, including developing,
implementing, and running digital solutions. It leverages the breadth and scale of Accenture's cloud, systems
integration, and enterprise application capabilities, as well as our global delivery network. Combined with our industry
expertise and broad global footprint, we are very well positioned to help clients transform their businesses to compete
in a digital world.
For Unilever, we built a digital social platform in 12 weeks to connect its marketers, brand managers, and partners in
190 countries. We helped BT Sport reach millions of broadband customers by delivering an end-to-end video solution
that spans live streaming, video on demand, mobile apps, and cloud services. And for a leading European automaker,
we are leveraging our mobility capabilities and our Connected Vehicle business service to bring customers new
innovations inside their cars, from real-time traffic information to voice-controlled entertainment.
We also launched Accenture Strategy, a unique capability focused on strategy at the intersection of business,
technology, and operations. This new growth platform is all about helping C-suite executives shape and execute their
transformation agendas, focusing on issues relative to growth and innovation, industry convergence, geographic
expansion, and enterprise transformation. In short, we help them define and implement industry-specific strategies that
are enabled by technology. This is our sweet spot, and we truly believe Accenture Strategy will be a highly
differentiated capability in the marketplace.
For example, we are helping a global consumer products company increase its competitiveness and reestablish its
leadership position across key product categories. Leveraging our strategy, technology, and industry-specific operations
expertise, we are helping the company deliver more than $1 billion in bottom line impact.
At the same time, we continue to invest in strategic acquisitions to further differentiate our capabilities in key growth
areas. Earlier this month, we finalized the acquisition of Procurian, making Accenture the clear leader in procurement
BPO. The combination of Procurian's strategic sourcing expertise and our industry expertise will significantly enhance
Accenture's end-to-end sourcing and procurement capabilities.
We also continue to invest in differentiated industry-based business services. In manufacturing, we are expanding our
product lifecycle management services through the acquisition of PRION Group and PCO Innovation, which will
enhance our ability to help automotive and industrial equipment companies deliver products more quickly and
efficiently.
And finally, we remain the partner of choice for our clients' large-scale transformation programs. We continue to see
strong demand for this type of work, as demonstrated by our 13 bookings over $100 million in Q1, which David
mentioned.
We have a longstanding relationship with Dow Chemical and are now helping Dow with one of their most strategic
transformation initiatives, positioning the company for cost savings and value creation of about $2.5 billion over five
years.
And we helped Ducati, the Italian motorcycle company, transform the way it interacts with dealers and customers.
Their new global dealer communications system is accessible through mobile devices across 88 countries, helping
Ducati analyze sales and services activity to respond in real time to customer demands.
Now let me turn to the geographic dimension of our business. In the Americas, we grew 4% in local currency, with
high single-digit growth in the United States, which is our largest market. However, we are facing challenges in both
Brazil and Canada. In EMEA, revenues were up 1% in local currency, driven by growth in Switzerland, France, the
Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. And in Asia-Pacific, we grew revenues 5% in local currency, driven primarily by
growth in Australia, ASEAN, and Japan. That is the strongest growth we have had in Asia-Pacific since the first quarter

last year.
In a global economic environment that I would characterize as more or less sluggish, we are managing our business
with discipline to increase our competitiveness while continuing to invest to drive further differentiation. I feel
confident that we are well-positioned to drive more growth in the second half of the year, where we will benefit from
the return on our investments in launching new growth platforms, building new business services and acquiring new
capabilities.
With that, I will turn it back to David, who will provide our business outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Before I get into the business outlook, I was told that I may have misspoken on a key metric, so let
me just clarify that right now. Our Outsourcing revenues were $3.4 billion. They were up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 6%
in local currency.
So, let me now just turn to the business outlook and let me start by providing some brief context for how we see the
remainder of the year before I get into the numbers.
From a revenue standpoint, as we've said, the first half of the year is shaping up very consistent with the expectations
we had when we provided our initial business outlook. At the same time, we're seeing signs of momentum in certain
areas of our business and that is reflected in our strong quarter one bookings as well as a very healthy pipeline as we
move into the second quarter.
Given that, as Pierre said, we're even more encouraged about our ability to drive higher growth rates in the second half
of the year.
So, let's now turn to our business outlook. For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range
of $6.95 billion to $7.25 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of approximately negative 1.5% compared to
the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
For the full fiscal year 2014, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the
impacts of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to be negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2013.
For the full fiscal 2014, we continue to expect net revenue to be in the range of 2% to 6% growth in local currency over
fiscal 2013.
For the full fiscal year 2014, we continue to expect new bookings to be in the range of $32 billion to $35 billion.
For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2014 to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point
expansion over adjusted fiscal 2013 results.
We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%.
For earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $4.44 to $4.56, or 5%
to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal 2013 results.
Now turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2014, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.6
billion to $3.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $400 million, and free cash flow to be in
the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion.
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $3.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to
reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning a
substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. KC?

K. C. McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Tom, would you provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Bryan Keane, representing Deutsche
Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys, congratulations on the solid results. I just want to ask about Consulting. What can
we expect for second quarter 2013 (sic) [2014]? I guess it came in about flat in revenue in the first quarter. It's about as
expected. Should it be another flat or should we see a little bit of improvement as we move into 2Q? And then, I
assume the back half of the year gets a little stronger in Consulting. I'm just looking for some color. Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, in terms of tying to the overall range that we gave, we think Consulting could be flat to
low-single digit positive. We are encouraged by the bookings that we saw in the first quarter. We're also encouraged by
the pipeline that we see going forward in our business. But in the second quarter, flat to low-single digit positive, and
we see the potential for building momentum in Consulting as we go through the year.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just to follow up, I guess I saw you guys increase head count,
just your thoughts around that.
And then secondly, on SI bookings year-over-year, is there a growth rate we can think about? I know sequentially they
were up double-digits but I'm just kind of curious how they're trending year-over-year. Thanks so much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: The head count, frankly, just reflects – we're 90 days further into the year. We're that much
further with our supply/demand management, our recruiting planning. We certainly have the visibility of the bookings
that we just had in quarter one. So it really just reflects we're further up the curve, if you will, within the year in terms
of our supply/demand management. So, that's why we increased the number to at least 60,000 to give you the best
possible view of how we see it at this point in time.
The SI bookings, I did anchor to the sequential growth really because I was trying to give you an indication of current
momentum. I actually don't have the number in front of me, but I believe the year-over-year growth in SI was healthy
as well.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Next, we'll go to the line of Tien-tsin Huang, please go ahead, representing JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great, thanks, good results here, just a similar question to what just Brian just asked. Just on
the Consulting front, it's the first time we've seen book-to-bill up in the first quarter sequentially in quite a while. It
looks like since 2009, if I'm right. And I guess my question here, is the timing of bookings conversion, has it changed
at all in terms of what you've observed in the last several quarters because it sounds like second quarter should be at
least flat based on your prior answer. I was just trying to gauge how that could fill out the rest of the year based on the
book-to-bill.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, I don't know so much, Tien-tsin, about the timing point. As much as it is, I think last
quarter I mentioned that we felt good about our Consulting pipeline, but it was a little bit less mature. And what we had
in the first quarter was we were just very successful moving deals apace through the pipeline and getting work

contracted. But it was broad-based improvement when you look across the three components of Consulting that we
talked about. We were particularly pleased with the Consulting bookings activity in North America. But within North
America, we saw good activity across most of our industry segments. And so, it was fairly broad-based in that sense,
both in terms of the type of Consulting work that we do as well as in North America where we saw the strength across
many of our industry segments.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: All right, good. And then just in systems integration, you said the bookings were strong. But
can you be a little bit more specific? I mean what type of integration work is being demanded? I know that this is a hot
topic, obviously.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, I don't know that I could characterize a common theme if you look through the
bookings. It's the mix, as you would expect. I think it crosses the platform of services that we provide. Certainly, we
also have in there situations where we have application maintenance type contracts where we are also doing
development work, new development work within those longer-term contracts. That would be in the mix as well. And
certainly, Digital would be a component of that as well as we continue to be very encouraged by the activity that we see
in the digital space and how our capabilities are lining up against those opportunities with our clients.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great, that's great. Thanks so much.
Operator
Next, we'll go to the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you. I was just wondering if I could kind of follow on to Tien-tsin's question. I
mean obviously, there's been a lot of speculation about how tightly your growth is correlated with some traditional lines
of business, like the ERP license growth. And I'm wondering just how much work really remains in the installed base
independent of license growth? And how does the migration of the major ERP vendors as well as these other
cloud-based applications impact your model?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I will take this one and provide the context of the third question, especially around the
ERP, and let's start with the question around ERP. First, ERP remains an important part of our business and it's still an
important part of the bookings, David alluded to. We are still selling, implementing ERP. And by ERP, I mean mainly
finance and accounting application solution, human resources application solution and supply chain application
solution. I think this is the definition given to the core ERP business.
As you know, there's been very significant ERP program two or three years ago, where all the giants, they invested in
creating their backbone solution to organize their operations, especially on a global basis. This last couple of years had
been a cycle of lower growth in ERP but it's still a good business for Accenture.
That being said, the vast majority of what we do at Accenture is not falling in that category of application packages, if
you will, around finance and accounting, HR and supply chain. We have a much more diverse portfolio of business.
David is mentioning Digital, where we are enjoying double-digit growth in that category of our business. I'm thinking,
of course, about the BPO. I'm thinking about older, which is obviously some integration of course; about Digital. I'm
thinking about all the custom solutions we're still developing with some clients.
And as you know, there are industries out there which are not so much ERP-heavy but more custom-made heavy. I'm
thinking about Financial Services. If you take banking and insurance, the core banking system and the core insurance
system are still more custom-made package but that's not ERP per se in the definition of ERP.
If you take Communication, Media & Technology, or what we're calling the OSS, the BSS, the system, the billing
system, the customer systems, are not ERP-related in the strict sense of the definition, and we're doing a lot of this as
well. So ERP, important at Accenture but not at all the vast majority of what we do; so we are not that dependent on
ERP, as you might imagine.

<Q - David M. Grossman>: Very good, that's helpful, and if I could just ask a little bit about the flow of the year. I
mean, obviously, we've gotten off to a very good start in bookings. But the guidance, I think you mentioned in your
prepared remarks, still remains back-end loaded, if you will, on the revenue side. Can you help us better understand?
What are the dynamics that give you that confidence that revenue growth does accelerate in the back half of the year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, I mean there are several things that we look at. First of all, as you said, the strong
bookings in the first quarter give us a great foundation to build on as we move forward. The second thing is that we do
feel very good about our pipeline and how it has shaped up during the quarter, even with the very high bookings we
had, and we see the opportunity for another good bookings quarter in the second quarter.
But beyond that, there are really three things that I think I would point to that give us confidence in building growth.
The first is that you've heard us talk quite a bit over the last several quarters about our success in selling large-scale
transformation programs. We've been very transparent with those numbers each quarter. For example, this quarter I
said we had 13 deals over $100 million. We can now see specific instances, specific contracts where those contracts are
building to generate meaningful sources of incremental revenue as we turn the page to the second half of the year. So,
one element of our confidence ties to the uptick in those large transformation programs starting to impact revenue.
The second thing is the investments that you've heard us talk about in creating these new business services, these
end-to-end solutions from Consulting to BPO such as Accenture Post-Trade services where we announced the pilot bill,
I think it would have been in the fourth quarter of last year. I think I specifically commented at a point that the
interesting thing about that opportunity – one of the interesting things was that the revenue ramp occurred after we had
been in the program for several months. And so that's another example where some of these new business services, we
believe, will start to drive incremental revenue as we turn the page to the second half of the year.
And then, of course, the third thing would be the investments that we have made in acquisitions as an engine for
organic growth, and so Procurian is the one that is the most noteworthy that we closed earlier this month. And so if you
look at how – take Procurian as an example, and as we fold that into our Accenture BPO business and we look at the
revenue accretion that we'll get from that, that is our third source of confidence as we look at the back half of the year.
And so we look at those things in combination. And that, again, gives us reason to be optimistic in terms of our revenue
trajectory as we move past the second quarter into the back half. Hopefully, that's helpful.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: No, it is. Thank you very much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, great, guys. So you posted 3% revenue growth in constant currency in the quarter,
and your Q2 guidance implies revenue growth in constant currency may not show acceleration. And clearly your fiscal
year guidance implies that acceleration is in the cards. Is your February quarter guidance embedding an extra layer of
conservatism due to uncertainty about clients' upcoming budget decisions in the new calendar year, or are you seeing
certain parts of the business that will show added struggle in the February quarter? You had a little bit of that in the
November quarter, where a couple of the verticals took a step back because of timing. Do have any of that going on in
the February quarter, or is this just you're being careful with guidance as the new calendar year turns the corner?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Rod, thanks for the question. The upper end of our range is 4%. If you were to take it at a
decimal, it's maybe 4.x% growth. And so the upper end of the range does show momentum over the 3% that we just
delivered this quarter. And of course, our range is established to reflect the possibilities of what could happen in the
quarter, but we work very hard to try to drive the business as high in the range as we possibly can.
There are a number of things about the second quarter that are just structural aspects of the second quarter. You have
holidays in there around the world, including the New Year holiday. You do have the page-turn to the calendar year,

which you alluded to. We don't have any particular concerns about client budgets based on what we see now. We don't
have any evidence that client budgets would be under pressure per se. But we have seen years where, even if the client
budgets are expanding in a year, you can have some slower ramp up. In certain instances, we've seen that in the month
of January.
And so the second quarter is always a more a tricky quarter to predict revenue momentum. And so I think the guidance
reflects some of that as well. But again, the guidance that we provided is consistent with how we really saw the year
building up in the first half of the year, and it's pretty much as we expected and very much in line when we
communicated our original guidance 90 days ago.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: All right. And just the follow-up to that is, can you quantify how much sequential revenue
growth you'll get in Q2 from new acquisitions, particularly the ones that you've done since your last earnings report?
How much sequential and year-over-year revenue growth do you expect in the February quarter? And it would be
helpful then to see if your guidance implies revenue growth acceleration at the upper end even after accounting for the
newly added acquisitions.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Rod, what I would tell you is that 90 days ago on the earnings call as well as IA Day, we
said that our inorganic contribution would be around 1% plus or minus. Since then we've closed Procurian. And so I
would tell you that the inorganic would be maybe a tad higher for the year, in the plus or minus 1.5% range, and that
reflects Procurian and some of the other deals that we've closed.
That will vary quarter to quarter. And really I'm cautious about getting too much in the weeds on the inorganic each
and every quarter because, again, you have to remember in our case the inorganic is really just an engine for organic
growth. We fold these businesses in very quickly and they, in many ways, become indistinguishable from our organic
business in a very short period of time. So let me just stick with for the full year it's going to be in that 1.5% range, and
that will vary by quarter.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: And just to clarify on that, is that 1.5% range for the year for inorganic growth, is that pretty
secure, or could that number get to 2% before the year ends?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Certainly, it depends on to the extent we do other deals as we progress through the year that
are outside of what we assume in that 1.5%. But that 1.5% plus or minus is the ballpark that we think it's in.
I'll remind you as well not to get too much in the weeds on this, but I will remind you of something that I shared at IA
Day. The way we think about inorganic is we look at deals that we have done on a rolling four-quarter basis, so that is
the way we will describe inorganic. That's the way we do the calculation. And again, we do that logically because when
we get to the one-year anniversary on these deals, they are very much embedded in our organic business.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: That makes sense, thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you, Rod.

Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks, good morning. You talked about Brazil and Canada, weighing on Americas' growth.
But I think you said U.S. grew high-single digits and that number was double-digit all of next year. So, can you just
talk about what you think is driving that modest deceleration in the U.S. market?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: As you said – this is Pierre here – it's a modest deceleration for that quarter. I mean
definitely, I continue to be extremely pleased with our activity in the U.S. U.S. is very important. So, we were
double-digit. I guess the last time we announced something, around 10%, even when we said double-digit, kind of
10%. So high-single digit is, in the grand scheme of things, close enough to where we are expecting to be.

For us, what is very important is we grow more than the market. And I guess that this is what is happening in the U.S.
as well. We continue to gain market share. And this quarter, it's high-single digits. But they have absolutely no
concerns that we continue to develop very well in the U.S. It's interesting to see that U.S. performed very well, both
Consulting and in Outsourcing. So, it was a very balanced growth across the different dimension of our business.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: And then just as a follow-up, as you know, some of your technology partners are talking
about weakness in China due to spygate, or whatever you want to call it. Have you seen an impact on your business in
China as it relates to that weakness at some of your partners?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: China, what happened last year, indeed, you have the change in the government. It was in the
first half of 2013, if I remember well. And it's very typical when you're in China that it is not only the government is
changing, but all the leaders in the state-owned enterprises, the famous SOEs, are all changing as well. And inevitably,
it's creating a kind of pause in China around the major investments theme, if you will, until the new teams and the new
leaders will establish them. They'll review the program and we launch a project.
So again, very pleased with what we delivered this last year in China. Indeed, a couple of – a form of pause due to this
leadership changing in China. But again, on the long term, we continue to be extremely – very positive with the
prospects in China.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thank you, congrats on the quarter.

We'll go to the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. I just want to touch on Europe in a little more detail, if you don't mind. It
obviously showed at least very mild acceleration versus last quarter, but maybe more specifics as to what actually is
going on from a regional standpoint within Europe as well as more in an industry vertical. And how sustainable is the
acceleration? Obviously, that's been a driver for I think a lot of investors recently.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I guess it's for me, David here, the specialist of Europe. I guess we might start to see the light
at the end of the tunnel in Europe, so let me explain. First, the macros in Europe are not fundamentally better. So I
would characterize it's stable, which is probably an improvement compared of all the uncertainties Europe faced this
last probably couple of years.
Second, you can indeed see some signs, to paraphrase David, of positive improvement. I'm thinking about the UK. You
can see the UK economy coming back. I'm thinking about France slowly getting out of the recession. I'm thinking
about even Spain starting to rebuild competitiveness and better position.
We know that all of this is going to be incredibly slow for all sorts of reasons, so there's not going to be any dramatic
improvement. But we have some signs of stabilization plus, and I'm pleased to see that it started to reflect in the
progress we are making with some of our large markets in Europe. And I mentioned Germany, I mentioned France, I
mentioned the Netherlands and I mentioned Belgium, to mention a few, which are doing very well despite economic
environments still complex but I would characterize as slight incremental progress but progress.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: When we look at – that's helpful. When we look at your health, the second half of the year
acceleration, I mean is Europe part of that? In other words, do we expect Europe to pick up steam further into the year
as well?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right, that's great, and then just a quick question. A couple years ago at your Investor Day,
I think you gave a good overview of how large a smash that was for different areas, whether it's Mobility or Analytics

in terms of revenue size. You've mentioned $1 billion here, $2 billion there. To give us a good idea as to what
percentage of your revenue was, is there a way to update that either now or maybe in other near-term way, or maybe
just give us some color now if you can?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: As you know, we're launching Accenture Digital and we're going to think on how we would
provide more information in due course when we will add finally – cleaning all the data, all the information in
Accenture. We want to be extremely accurate and to define a very strict protocol in the way we communicate the
information so you have a base to measure and a base to evaluate the progress. But indeed, you'll remember very well
that many across the $1 billion when we announced. So without saying too much, it's a multi-billion-dollar business
we're talking about
<A - David P. Rowland>: And growing very well.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Multi-billions.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right, if I could just sneak one quick one now just on the industry verticals. There were
some weak pockets in Resources obviously. Communications had a contract also. It seems like that's been resolved,
David. Are we on the other side of that now?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I'm going to jump on this one, David.
<A - David P. Rowland>: He's in a talking mood.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: When we're talking about business, I can't explain my instinct. But looking at industry – and I
will comment more specifically, we are covering it with just looking 19 industry segments in Accenture. This is the
way we are measuring our different industries, such as banking, capital markets, insurance. Those are our industry
segments. 17 out of 19 posted positive growth.
Just to give you a flavor first of the depth and breadth of the portfolio of business we're doing, the diversity of what we
do across-the-board, 17 out of 19 in Q1 positive growth, with a few, I'm thinking about life science; health; energy;
EHT, electronic and high-tech; capital markets, high-single digit if not double-digit for some. Now, the fact of the
matter is, and you've spotted this one, two of the 19 are yet have turned the corner, communications and natural
resources, but David will explain.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. In the case of Communications, we have talked, Darrin, several times about the
ongoing transformation in the Communications sector. We've talked about the challenges of some of the incumbent
telcos as their business evolves. And then, we've also talked about the headwind we had with the large CMT client in
Europe.
That headwind will essentially go away in the second half of this year. There is some residual headwind that we
continue to have in the first and second quarter of this year, frankly, as it turns out, not too different than many of the
quarters last year. But once we get past the second quarter, I can say definitively that that year-over-year compare
dynamic goes away for CMT. So, that is still in the mix of CMT's results this quarter and will be in the mix next
quarter.
In the case of Resources, we've also talked – that was a business that for many, many quarters for an extended period
enjoyed very strong growth, and it was driven by a very strong Consulting business in particular. And we had several of
those contracts that wound down as we turned the page from fiscal 2012 to 2013, and that was right about the same
time that natural resources as a sector came under significant pressure, including in several markets around the world,
Brazil being one.
But with Resources, we've done a very, very nice job kind of repositioning the business, moving into new business
services areas, new asset offerings, kind of focusing on the new world around digital, et cetera. And we feel very good
about the momentum that's building there.

Our next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sara Gubins>: Thank you. It looks like you grew your non-GDN staff. It's been over a year since you've done
that, and I'm wondering what drove it, if it should continue and if you think that we're now at a more of a steady state of
GDN versus non-GDN in terms of employee ratios.
<A - David P. Rowland>: We did see some expansion in our head count in some of our larger, more established
geographies. I think the United States in particular, we saw a growth in head count, and that simply reflects what we're
doing on the supply side to have the skills that we need to match the type of work that we're doing as we go forward.
In terms of the balance between GDN and non-GDN, I think that will continue to evolve and be fluid. And ultimately,
the market will dictate what that mix is. But you are correct in pointing out that we did have growth in our non-GDN
head count.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And I think it's reflecting as well the nature of the services of the businesses we are investing
in, and I'm thinking about the Digital. If you look at the Digital business, at least as a starter, it is more onshore-driven
than offshore-driven. I think over time, it's probably going to follow the same path as we've seen historically from
onshore to offshore. But the skills required to be competitive in Analytics, in Mobility, in Digital Marketing are still
more onshore which might as well reflect this take-off, if you will.
<Q - Sara Gubins>: That makes sense. Second question. To hit the bookings guidance for the year, it looks like the
rest of the year bookings would have to be down quite significantly to maybe up very slightly. But given the first
quarter strength and your commentary around the second quarter, I'm wondering if you're really expecting weakness in
the second half or is this more just a function of being conservative since it's early in the year.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Sara, as you know, bookings can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, so I'll just remind you of
that. But I'll also say that bookings is like every other metric. We're working as hard as we can to be as far up in the
range as we can. And we don't – I mean we just finished one quarter, right? And so, as much as we see some reason to
be encouraged after one quarter, I guess I don't remember a fiscal year where we've changed the annual guidance after a
quarter. And all the possibilities and scenarios that we evaluated when we started the year are still in play.
<Q - Sara Gubins>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you. Thank you, Sara.

Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman, representing SIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Thanks. Pierre, did bookings growth on a regional level support your expectation that
Europe should accelerate in the second half?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, absolutely. I mean the nature and the constructs of the booking by region is supporting
the fact that Europe should accelerate in the six months of the year.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Okay. And then with regard to Digital, I just wanted to go back to a previous question
about sizing that market. And without getting too specific though, I was just wondering about how you're defining
Digital. Is that the Brian Whipple group, which is Accenture Interactive? It seems much larger than that, seeing that
you're saying there's 25,000 people there. So, what do you mean when you're saying Digital these days?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, it is. What we're putting in it, you would find Accenture Interactive, which is the
organization dedicated to end-to-end digital marketing capabilities. We are adding Accenture Mobility, which is all
about developing, implementing, and potentially running mobile solutions. And three, it's Accenture Analytics, which
is all about mining and doing all the analytics information, including the most advanced analytics and productivity
analytics. So it's all the three, from design to implementation, including the run. That's why we have 23,000 people
because of course a part of our people in the current GDN, Global Delivery Network, are providing the services as well
for the execution.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Thank you, and then last question. At the IA Day on October 18, you had previewed
movement in some of the operating groups. I was just looking for some update from this vantage point about two. You
had said I think accurately that HPS would decelerate. And then Resources, you had a cautious view for the full year.
So looking forward at the dynamic of growth of both of those, should we continue to – that sequence to play out for the
rest of the year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, we see some potential for further moderation in H&PS in the second quarter, which I
said in the prepared comments. But to be clear, we feel very good about our H&PS business, and we think were very
well positioned as we then progress through the rest of the year.
On Resources, we do think that Resources will be positive this year. And as I commented earlier, we see good
momentum in certain parts of the Resources business to give us reason to believe that, so we are pleased with the
progress. There's still work to do in Resources, but we do think they will be positive for the year.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Thank you, David, for the update.

Operator
All right, thank you. Our final question today will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg, representing Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to circle back on the back half a little bit just to make sure
that we're in full command of the numbers here. So I guess if you come in at the midpoint of your Q2 revenue range, it
looks like that would put you through the first half of the year at roughly 2.5%-ish in terms of constant currency
growth. And so what I'm really trying to get at here, is it prudent for us collectively to be thinking about the lower half
of your full-year range as being more likely than the upper half? Obviously, you aspire to do better than the midpoint.
But just based on where you'll be through the midpoint of the year and given that conversion of Consulting bookings to
revenue over time has been a little bit unpredictable, can you just comment on whether or not the lower half looks more
likely at this juncture in time?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Jason, it was a noble attempt, but I'm not going to color within the range after just one
quarter of results. We set the range to represent the range of possibilities that we see. If we didn't think that there was a
possibility of being in the upper half of the range, we would have narrowed the range. And so as we progress through
the year, we'll get more specific and the second quarter will be important in terms of how that plays out.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: And just lastly, a bigger picture question around Europe. We've been picking up more
data points that seem to be suggesting more willingness among European clients on the continent to use more low-cost
delivery, if you will, and obviously that offshore market is quite underpenetrated. Are you guys seeing that? Do you see
that as being purely additive? Is some of it stick to your traditional Onshore work in Europe? We'd just love your
thoughts on how that might play out.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No, we believe first, indeed there is, for all sorts of competitiveness reasons, appetite for our
clients in Europe to leverage more Outsourcing, fueled by offshore. That's a fact. This trend started more, as you know,

in the UK, in the Nordic countries, and now it's going south in more Continental Europe and touching France,
Netherlands, and other markets. But the point of the answer is yes, this one is there. It's playing, we believe, in our
favor.
A few data points on this first, our Outsourcing business is Europe is developing very well. If you look at the last
couple of years, Outsourcing has been our strongest growth point in Europe. And from a cost standpoint, we believe
that with our network of delivery centers and with our GDN, we have indeed the right cost-effective response to this
market as we invested earlier in the GDN, if I may say, compared to more local players.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Okay, all right, thank you for all the color.
Pierre Nanterme
All right, it's probably time now to wrap up, and thanks again for joining us on today's call.
