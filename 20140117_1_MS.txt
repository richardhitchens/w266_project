MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Celeste Mellet Brown
Good morning. This is Celeste Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also
include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of
such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties
that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.
This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our
consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.
I'll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
All right. Good morning. Thank you, Celeste. As we begin another year, I wanted to update you on our thoughts on the
state of Morgan Stanley and where we're headed as well as provide you with a list against which you can mark us to
market through 2014. Let's walk you through the list we laid out last January and then take you deeper into some of the
strategic areas on which we have focused, in particular, those that will drive the greatest earnings and ROE upside for
the firm. There are slides available on the website, and then Ruth will take you through the quarterly review, and
together, we'll take questions at the end.
2013 was a year of playing offense for Morgan Stanley. Outside of some of the legacy legal issues from the crisis
period, our focus was on moving the firm and our strategy forward and advancing down the path to meeting and

beating our cost of equity. We achieved or advanced a number of strategic objectives, including the six defined in
January of last year. Specifically, we acquired 100% of the wealth management joint venture. We achieved our wealth
management margin goals through expense management and exceeded them through revenue growth. We made
significant progress toward our RWA reduction goals through fixed income and commodities and exceeded our 2013
and our 2014 targets.
We're on track to meet our expense targets for 2014, excluding litigation. We're also on track to meet our long-term
goals of growing earnings through Morgan Stanley's specific growth opportunities. And finally, we've made progress
towards returns that meet and exceed the cost of capital, excluding litigation, and we began our first buyback since
2008 in the middle of last year.
Like all of our peers, we have litigation exposure, which is laid out in extensive detail in our filings. In addition to the
high legal expenses we incurred in the first three quarters of 2013, we took a charge of $1.2 billion in the fourth
quarter. Obviously, we cannot predict the future, but we believe this move represents significant progress towards
putting these matters behind us.
The steps we will outline for you today are a continuation of what we discussed a year ago and are consistent with the
strategy that this management team put in place four years ago. We have six strategic focus areas, and again, you can
follow along with the slides on our Web site. We will achieve our goals in a prudent manner without taking outside
risks and taking in consideration the need of all of our stakeholders.
Number one, continue to drive Wealth Management through margin goals and improved cost initiatives and revenue
growth. In mid-2013, we increased our margin targets to 20% to 22% by the end of 2015, driven by the upside from
earning 100% of the Wealth Management business. We reached the bottom of that range in the fourth quarter excluding
the impairment, driven by partial recognition of the benefits of earning 100% as well as higher markets. Based on
where the S&P closed 2013 and our expectation for deposit deployment, we are now raising our target for year-end
2015 to 22% to 25% even without the benefit of higher rates.
Second, Fixed Income and Commodities. We have a threefold plan to drive our returns to greater than our cost of
equity in Fixed Income and Commodities. Number one, optimize the Commodities business by reducing our exposure
to physical commodities. Number two, improve the efficiency and ROE of our other Fixed Income businesses through
centralized or federalized management of resources. And number three, continue to reduce risk-weighted assets.
In regard to Commodities, we announced late last year that we're selling our Global Physical Oil business. This will be
done in two parts. The first is the transaction we announced with Rosneft, which included the sale of our Oil
Merchanting business. The second component is our intention to explore strategic options for our stake in
TransMontaigne, which is a separate, discrete entity that provides a wide variety of distributions and storage services
for oil-related products in North America. We believe we can generate an acceptable ROE at the remaining
Commodities business, which is also more consistent with our client base across Sales and Trading.
Outside of Commodities, we have philosophically changed the way we run Fixed Income from a highly segregated to a
highly federalized model with a more strategic approach to resource allocation division-wide and a particular focus on
expenses, technology, capital and balance sheet. We have achieved normalized ROEs around or above our cost of
capital in almost all product areas except for rates. We're aligning our approach in Rates to be more consistent with that
of the rest of Fixed Income with a leadership team that has a heightened focus on balance sheet utilization and high
velocity. Finally, we have moved forward our Fixed Income and Commodities RWA target by one year. Previously our
target was to reach the $180 billion RWA level by the end of 2016. Now we expect to reach that level by the end of
2015.
Third area was expenses. Let me update you on where we are versus the targets we set out a year ago. We said that
assuming flat revenue, our expenses would be down $1.6 billion by the end of 2014, which implied an expense ratio
then of 79%. Of course, our revenues grew in 2013, and we're on track to meet or beat the 79% expense ratio implied
by the $1.6 billion target, assuming the revenues in 2014 are higher or in line with 2013 and excluding litigation above
2012 levels. Because we expect revenue to continue to grow in 2014 and beyond, we will focus our discussion in the

future on these ratios. Our target expense ratio for 2014 and beyond is less than 79%, assuming flat or higher revenues
and excluding legal expenses, again, above the 2012 levels.
Marking to market 2013, our expenses were up for several reasons. First, we had expenses that are not likely to recur in
2014, including several write-offs in Wealth Management. Second, we, along with the industry, experienced elevated
legal expenses. Adjusting for those two factors, our expense base in 2013 would have been $26.1 billion, reflecting a
79% expense ratio. Additionally, revenue grew 9% during the year and we, thus, experienced growth in activity
relating expenses to those revenues including compensation, brokerage and clearing. Excluding activity-based
expenses, our fully-adjusted expense base in 2013 would have been $24.5 billion, more than halfway through the
reductions we discussed with you a year ago.
Let me now turn to the fourth topic, which is Morgan Stanley's specific growth opportunities and, most notably, in the
bank. We've spent a great deal of time in the last year, introducing you to the upside associated with the bank and, in
the deck you have on slide 11, we've laid out the upside very clearly.
Revenue growth in our bank will be driven by three tailwinds including: growth in the deposit base and associated
assets, the optimization of these assets, moving cash into AFS and lending and, finally, upside from high rates. The
significant revenue growth will flow through Wealth Management and Institutional Services with exceptionally high
incremental margins, well above the margins we're generating today as we've already made the infrastructure
investment.
By the end of 2015, we expect to have an asset base of approximately $160 billion. Based on current market rates and
expected asset mix at the end of 2015, the blended yield would be 1.8%. If we substitute the yields indicated by the
forward curve on the same asset base, the average yield would then be 2.7%.
The fifth topic is, of course, the return of capital to shareholders. We intend to prudently increase our return of capital
to shareholders over time subject, of course, to regulatory approval, increasing both our share buyback program and our
dividend, reflecting a greater percent of our revenue and earnings coming from more stable businesses. The key driver
of increased returns to shareholders over time are our increasingly consistent earnings, our strong capital ratios and,
finally, our strategy that is consistent with evolving regulatory requirements.
Finally, the sixth point, which is, of course, our ROE returns. Our focus is to drive higher returns for shareholders
through sustainably improving our ROE to levels equal to, or in excess of, our cost of equity even without a cyclical
recovery. Assuming no improvement in the institutional and retail market; normalized litigation expenses; execution of
our bank strategy and expense initiatives; a strategic solution for physical commodities; and centralized fixed income;
as well as Wealth Management margin improvement; we believe we can reach ROEs above 9% and ROTEs of 10%.
Then assuming excess capital would get us to or above 10% levels on ROE and 11% on ROTE. Of course, an improved
operating environment would drive those numbers further.
I will now turn it over to Ruth to walk you through the fourth quarter results. Thank you.
Ruth Porat
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided
reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.
The impact of DVA in the quarter was negative $368 million, with $285 million in Fixed Income Sales and Trading
and $83 million in Equity Sales and Trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.2 billion, up
1% versus the third quarter. Earnings and earnings per share included $1.2 billion, or $0.40 per share of legal expenses.
The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter reflects an overall benefit of $348 million,
including a discrete benefit of $192 million. Earnings from continuing operations, applicable to Morgan Stanley
common shareholders excluding DVA, were approximately $384 million. Earnings from continuing operations per
diluted share excluding DVA were $0.20, after preferred dividends.

On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion. Earnings from
continuing operations, applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, were $144 million. GAAP results also
included $1.2 billion, or $0.40 per share, of legal expenses. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted
share were $0.07 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $32.29 per share and tangible book
value was $27.21 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $832 billion at December 31. Deposits as of quarter end were $112
billion, up $8 billion versus 3Q. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $202 billion, compared with $198
billion at the end of the third quarter.
Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will
be approximately 12.8% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 15.7%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I
are expected to be approximately $389 billion at December 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal
Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 10.5% at December 31. Pro forma risk-weighted
assets under Basel III are estimated to be $428 billion.
Our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was negatively affected by approximately 50 basis points due to an
increase in our operational risk RWAs, which resulted from higher legal costs in the quarter. This was partially offset
by earnings accretion and the ongoing reduction in fixed income RWAs. We expect our pro forma supplementary
leverage ratio to be approximately 4.2%. This estimate reflects the United States proposed regulatory rules for the
numerator and the denominator and is subject to change if rules evolve. We continue to expect to exceed the required
5% level in 2015, including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders.
On slide 14 of our strategy deck, we have outlined the drivers of our path to an SLR of greater than 5% in 2015.
Sources within our control include: exposure compression and RWA reductions; earnings accretion; and other
numerator drivers, including DTA reductions, increased investment capacity, preferred issuance and other reduced
numerator deductions, which in aggregate could drive approximately 180 basis points to 210 basis points of
improvement in our ratio. Potential offsets include balance sheet growth and capital returns.
Turning to expenses. Total expenses this quarter were $7.9 billion, up 20% versus the third quarter, but up 1%
excluding the legal item I noted. Compensation expense was essentially flat to the prior quarter. Non-compensation
expense was $3.9 billion, reflecting higher legal costs.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $3.7 billion,
down 4% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $4.4 billion, up 34% versus the third quarter. Compensation was $1.6
billion for the fourth quarter, down 4% versus the third quarter, reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DVA.
Non-compensation expense of $2.9 billion reflects the elevated legal expenses due to settlements and additions to
reserves related to legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters associated with the credit crisis.
The business reported a pre-tax loss of $745 million, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the
pre-tax loss was $1.1 billion.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.4 billion were up 37% versus last quarter. Results were driven by increased
revenues in all products: Equity Underwriting, Advisory and Fixed Income Underwriting.
According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number three in global announced and completed M&A,
global IPOs and global equity at the end of the fourth quarter. Notable transactions included, in Advisory, Morgan
Stanley is a leader in cross-border activity with transactions, including Portugal Telecom's $15.7 billion merger with Oi
SA, which represented the largest M&A announced deal for the quarter, as well Perrigo's $8.6 billion acquisition of
Elan.
In Equity Underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as the advisor to Crown Castle International as lead-left bookrunner and
stabilization agent on common and mandatory offerings while also acting as lead-left bookrunner on a $3.4 billion
senior unsecured committed bridge facility.

In Debt Underwriting, event-related financings included Morgan Stanley acting as lead-left bookrunner on Devon
Energy's $2.3 billion debt offering in support of the company's acquisition of GeoSouthern Energy's Eagle Ford assets.
Advisory revenues of $451 million were up 64% versus our third quarter results, driven by increased revenues across
regions. Equity Underwriting revenues of $416 million were up 76% versus the third quarter, also driven by increases
across regions, in particular in Europe, as well as a significant increase in IPO volume. Fixed Income Underwriting
revenues were $495 million, up 3% versus the third quarter, driven by loan syndication fees partially offset by
decreases in investment-grade underwriting.
Equity Sales and Trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 12% from last quarter. Results were
strong for our fourth quarter, with robust client activity across regions and products. Cash Equity revenues increased
driven by higher volumes in most major markets. Derivatives revenues remained healthy although declined from a
strong 3Q 2013. Prime Brokerage revenues and balances were up in 4Q and were the highest since 2008.
Fixed Income & Commodities Sales and Trading revenues excluding DVA were $694 million. Commodities revenues
were meaningfully lower in a difficult market. Revenues outside of Commodities were up slightly sequentially despite
a larger sequential drag from CVA. Revenues were driven by increases in Credit, Foreign Exchange and Securitized
Products, partially offset by lower results in Rates.
Client volumes held up relatively well across businesses in the fourth quarter though remain subdued, in line with the
industry. Investment revenues of $177 million were down versus the third quarter, which included the sale of the
insurance broker, Hub. Average trading bar for the fourth quarter was $51 million, essentially flat to the third quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management. Revenues were $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Asset Management revenues of $2
billion were up versus the last quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the quarter and
the positive flows.
Transaction revenues increased 10% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $576 million, which
were up 14% versus the prior quarter due to a pickup across products; Investment Banking-related fees of $206 million,
up 11% versus last quarter, reflecting an increase in Equity Underwriting activity; and trading revenues of $323
million, up 2% versus the third quarter, reflecting higher deferred compensation plans.
Net interest revenue increased 7% to $528 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our Bank Deposit
Program and continued growth in our lending product. Other revenue increased to $110 million from $75 million.
Non-interest expense was $3 billion, up versus last quarter. The compensation ratio was 58%, flat versus the third
quarter. Non-compensation expense was $876 million, up 10% versus last quarter due to an impairment charge as well
as the typical seasonal increase in expenses.
The PBT margin was 19% and was 20% excluding the impairment charge. Profit before tax was $709 million. Total
client assets were up versus the third quarter to $1.9 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $12 billion. Fee-based
Assets Under Management increased to $697 billion at quarter-end, representing 37% of AUM.
Global representatives were 16,456, essentially flat to the third quarter. Bank deposits were $134 billion, up versus the
third quarter. Approximately $104 billion were held in Morgan Stanley Bank.
Investment Management. Revenues of $842 million were up 2% from the third quarter. In Traditional Asset
Management, revenues of $430 million were up 17% from the third quarter, driven by higher market levels. In Real
Estate Investing, revenues of $160 million were down 31%, driven by a decline in carry as last quarter we had a
significant benefit from carry catch-up. Merchant banking revenues were $252 million, up 12%, reflecting increased
deferred compensation plans as well as higher investment gains from an IPO of an existing private equity investment.
Expenses were $505 million, down 4% from the third quarter. Profit before tax was $337 million, up 12% sequentially.
NCI was $46 million versus $64 million last quarter. Total Assets Under Management increased to $373 billion, driven
by market appreciation.

As to our outlook, in Investment Banking, the momentum evident in the fourth quarter persists as we enter 2014. In
particular, the M&A pipeline continues to build on the back of improving global economies. The drivers evident in
2013 remain, namely cross-border transactions, financial sponsors and activists. We expect further upside from, one,
the pick-up in corporate as distinct from sponsor buyers, as well as, two, the uptick in activity in EMEA after very
muted levels for the last several years.
The outlook for Equity Underwriting in 2014 remains healthy, especially relative to the low volumes in EMEA and
Asia experienced in 2013. Trading volumes and client activity across Sales and Trading are beginning to reflect
confidence in global growth.
In Wealth Management, our outlook for 2014 is similarly constructive, given higher markets, lending growth and
ongoing improvements in retail investor engagement. Our revised PBT margin targets help quantify the upside we see
in this business.
Finally, we would expect return-on-equity to further benefit from an increase in capital returns upon completion of the
CCAR process at the end of Q1.
Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thank you. Within your plans for Fixed Income, I was wondering if you could elaborate on
how we get the ROE up in Rates and is it an ROE-focus as opposed to a revenue-focus. I appreciate that.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, the focus is an ROE-focus as opposed to a revenue-focus. And as we indicated, we have a
number of areas that are driving the overall ROE higher. First and foremost, we talked about Commodities and the
steps that we're taking in Commodities. We are selling two physical oil businesses there. The first one we've talked
about – we've announced the sale to Rosneft in December. We expect it to close in the second half of 2014.
The PBT in that business is essentially breakeven and it has about $4 billion of risk-weighted assets, so accretive to
returns there. With respect to the second business, TransMontaigne, we'll share more when we have something to say
on that.
With respect to moving to centralized – the move to centralized management, we have a very systematic and clinical
approach, really, to optimizing returns within each of our businesses. It's a focus on revenues, expenses and capital, and
we're continuing to balance those to drive returns in Rates as we have in other businesses across the platform.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Rates right now is still the business biggest revenue piece of FICC, I take it?
<A - Ruth Porat>: As I said, we're really focused on the overall returns in the business and we're looking at, within
each of the product areas, optimizing revenues, expenses and capital. And so, we've really driven returns within FICC
across products to levels on a normalized basis that are at or above the cost of capital. We, in fact, made significant
improvement in Foreign Exchange this year – this past year and are at this point operating with returns basically in line
with our cost of capital when you look at RWAs on a normalized basis. So, the next one to add here with the same
approach is Rates.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, cool. Speaking of RWA, hopefully I did the math right. I think Basel III RWA was up
3.5% almost quarter-on-quarter. And I'm just curious, because I know the overall focus is down in Fixed Income and
down overall, was there anything particularly droved that this quarter because I know the direction is going the other
way.

<A - Ruth Porat>: So, you're right. We've been reducing risk-weighted assets within Fixed Income. But the reason,
there's an addition here, is a key component of the calculation is ops risk that captures litigation. And so with the higher
reserve here in the fourth quarter, that would change the overall calculation of the ops risk capital charge. So, that's
what you're seeing.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: A question on that, Ruth. Is that happened in the quarter that you realized higher legal costs,
or is that a permanent addition that kind of sticks through the process until further notice?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the way it works is, with the addition of a sizable data point within the overall distribution of
data points, you have to calculate ops risk. Once you add a more sizable data point as we did here, data in the tail would
affect the overall calculation. Smaller pieces, kind of in the belly of the distribution, don't actually have an impact on
the capital charge. And once it is in the data set, it remains in the data set until you see a change in the distribution. So,
it is in there for some time.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got you. I guess, I mean, if James is right on his comment of putting most of these stuff to
bed, and maybe within a year's time you start to get the benefit of that. I know the C corp process moves slow.
Last one. Wealth Management loans and commitments were up another 10% this quarter, up almost 50% year-on-year.
I guess there's the PLA component and all the securities-based stuff and the mortgage part. I don't know if you can
share with us which one of those is growing. And of the overall pie, how important is it to Wealth Management in
general, because I know it comes on a different comp grid?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So overall, loan growth is important to Morgan Stanley across businesses for having deployment,
supporting growth in Institutional Securities, as well as Wealth Management. And in fact, on the ROE walk, it's the
most important incremental driver to return.
But to your question, with respect to Wealth Management, what you're seeing is the benefit of the growing deposits that
are asset optimization and then what that translates into. Growth is across both PLA or the securities-based lending
product and residential mortgage. There's more of it in PLA. Although I would say in the mortgage side, we've
continued to see strong demand.
Historically, we were deliberately constraining production there because we were more focused on client experience
and, in fact, applications dropped in the quarter. But the bigger part of the growth has been PLA. And again, what we're
benefiting from here, as we've talked about on prior calls, is we're underpenetrated relative to our peers. This is very
logical, consistent product for them.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Thanks, Ruth.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just a quick question on the SLR, first of all. Did you have a chance to think about what the
impact of the final BIS add-ons that were announced last weekend would be?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We have been working through that. It's a complex calculation, in particular with respect to the net
long CDS sold portion of it, as you know well. Our preliminary calculation is we are approaching 4% on that basis,
well above the 3% required.

up to the 5%. Can you talk a little bit about what the implications might be of some of those moves for revenue, and I
guess that's where maybe it gets into the overlap with what you're doing on the Rates side?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, the path to greater-than-5% in 2015, and again that's including an assumption about
increasing returns of capital, if I just break them down into the numerator and denominator, in the numerator, not only
do we benefit from earnings accretion, but there is a multiplier effect because of certain deductions, most notably DTA
and the investment capacity deduction.
The investment capacity is based on the size of Tier 1 capital. So clearly as Tier 1 capital increases, you have a larger
basket, smaller deduction. We're holding capital against certain items that fall into that basket amount, like our joint
venture in [pm] moms (31:50) that eats into the bucket. So when the bucket gets bigger, there are fewer deductions.
And then, there are specific steps that we can take to focus on and that we are taking to focus on items that are captured
in the investment bucket. So I would think of it as it's earnings accretion, then a multiplier impact on that for the
reasons that I just described. And one is being efficient with some of those numerator deductions that doesn't have an
impact on revenue.
Preferred, obviously, also adds to the numerator. You can do – so the dividends, you could say, would be the deduct but
it adds to the overall Tier 1 capital and as well to, therefore, the investment bucket.
In the denominator, we continue to have a benefit from the RWA rundown. And as we've talked about, that's in areas
that are not accretive to revenue. And I'd say the other one that is important is compression and I would put that in the
bucket of just good hygiene. So we've invested quite a bit in central clearing, back-loading into central clearing. It gives
us greater opportunity for compression. We're seeing more interest in that from banks on both sides of the Atlantic.
And again, that's just in the category of good hygiene. So I think that we're very comfortable with the implications of
the various levers we have to move up to the greater-than-5%.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So it doesn't sound like you've loaded into that a lot of the strategic changes that you might
be making in Rates.
<A - Ruth Porat>: The...
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Like for example, maybe changing the way you look at repo or anything like that.
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. The assumption that's embedded in the slide is consensus earnings. But I'd say that the other
items that I enumerated are quite – are very important. And no, there isn't a change in assumption on some of the other
items.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Is there a new sort of breakeven level of FICC revenues that you need to achieve to
get to that ROE equal to your cost of equity? And when I say breakeven, I mean specifically a level of revenue that you
would need given your cost base in order to get the whole FICC business to earning its cost of equity? I think in the
past, you've talked about $6 billion or so, and I just wonder if it's lower.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So let me answer that by just pointing you back, for example, to Commodities. We've talked about
--the thing we are clinically focused on is driving returns higher in that business. And to your question, you focused on
one of the three levers: it's revenues, it's expenses and it's capital optimization.
So as I indicated, with the business that is being sold to Rosneft, at this point it is essentially PBT breakeven for
Morgan Stanley. It has about $4 billion of risk-weighted assets in it. So, yes, there may be a diminution in revenues
there. But when you look at the cost structure, running that type of business within a BHC, it's more valuable in the
hands of an industrial player if we have higher capital liquidity levels associated with the business.
And that's why we say what we're looking at is ROE. That is a smart move for us, for the business, for our stakeholders.
It's accretive to ROE, although there are some revenues that go with it.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it; that's helpful. One of your big competitors took a large charge for FVA as they
adopted that approach on their Derivatives book. Maybe you can tell us whether you currently do that or not and
whether that's something that you're contemplating.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So that obviously refers to the potential implied financing costs for uncollateralized derivatives to
the extent that those are observable. We do continue to evaluate it. There's been a lot of industry discussions around
FVA. In our view, transparency has been lacking. And to date, in our opinion, there is not a basis to take the
adjustment.
From a risk management perspective, we do allocate capital and liquidity down to the product and debt level across our
Sales and Trading businesses. So liquidity is allocated based on our liquidity funding model, which models outflows in
a stressed environment. And those are, as I said, allocated down to the product level. So from a risk management
perspective, the businesses are being charged appropriately. That is different from seeing transparency in the
marketplace.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Last one for me. You mentioned FX and having achieved some success there in terms
of getting the returns to where you want it to be. I did notice that in the quarter, your FX bar is up a significant
percentage off where it was before. Does that reflect changes in the business or just market volatility?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No, the FX was up quarter-over-quarter and it just reflects client activity.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. So within ISG, was there a shift this year to less deferrals and would that
maybe have put a little bit of upward pressure on your GAAP comp expense figure? Just trying to maybe think about
that, even if we don't get specific numbers, just from a narrative perspective.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the ISG comp ratio, I think you [ph] have this, (37:30) is down from 45% to 42% this year. We
did bring down the deferral rate as we indicated we would. So, the deferral rate has come down. And when you think
about our kind of comp ratio on a go-forward basis, our view is that it will trend down to about that 40% range.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. But with deferrals coming out, that would've put, all else being equal, even with the
comp ratio coming down, some upward pressure on that ratio. Isn't that the right way to think about it?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, great. And then, thinking about dividend that you guys sort of introduced in slide 13,
if we think back to 4Q trailing GAAP earnings when you guys submitted the CCAR, which clearly includes some
headwinds, but in any event we know that the Fed sort of looks at that, and very simplistically we just apply a 30%
payout ratio to that, it would apply a $0.50 dividend per year. Any issue with the math on that? Do you think that
people thinking about it that way would be too aggressive?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, let me answer it this way. Our view is that the way to maximize return of capital over the
longer term is to request steady consistent increases in capital returns in the interim as opposed to any type of
discontinuous move. So given the ongoing accretion of capital and the higher ratios at Morgan Stanley, we think it's
now the right time to increase the size of our share repurchase program and begin to increase the dividend. But just – I
started with our philosophy because I think it's an important way to frame how we think about legging into any kind of
change.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, okay. That's helpful. And as we think about Wealth Management and you guys have
had terrific momentum there, clearly, in your outlook for improvement there and high net worth engagement continuing
to improve, do you expect that that would increase the fee rates that you guys get on your managed assets? That had
been under a little bit of pressure recently and it's sort of at lower levels. Does that reflect the lower level of
engagement? And does your expectation for increased engagement mean that that probably should, all else equal, have
some upward pressure there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, all right then – I'm sorry, go ahead.
<A - Ruth Porat>: It's asset mix. So no, the answer is no.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then, last one. You guys are looking for, like, a near-doubling of the loan book,
as you laid out in the slide deck, from now until 2015. How much of that doubling should we count on from Wealth
Management versus Institutional? And as we watch the disclosures that you guys give in the supplement, is it mostly in
the held-for-investment line that we should be watching?
<A - Ruth Porat>: I think you have a couple of questions in there. We laid out the asset growth by product and I
discussed it in a conference earlier in the year. The loan growth overall is supporting both, as I said, product in Wealth
Management as well as Institutional Securities.
So, we talked already about mortgage and PLA within Wealth Management. In Institutional Securities, the product is
similarly very consistent with our client franchise where we have strong domain expertise there, like commercial real
estate, project finance, continuing to expand with our clients. It is primarily HFI. We've really migrated to HFI over the
last several years, and we see this is as prudent steady growth across a suite of products to support growth in those two
businesses. We laid out the products in the deck that James went through so you can get a sense of the suite of products
on both sides.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks for the color, Ruth.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I think you said the margin, ROE targets do not reflect a change in interest rates. So, what is
Morgan Stanley's sensitivity to higher interest rates? For example, a 100 basis point increase in debt funds?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So there, we gave two targets and let me make sure we're very clear. When we focus on increasing
the PBT margin in Wealth Management, we kept it on a basis consistent with the way we described it last year. So last
year, we had a Wealth Management target of 20% to 22%. We said were holding Rates and Equity Markets constant.
And so, as we hit our 20% PBT margin this quarter, excluding the impairment so 20% of DBT margin, we took our
guidance up for Wealth Management and that again is holding Rates constant. We don't give ourselves the benefit of
even the forward deal curve. It's holding Rates where they are today and holding Equity Markets where they are today.
If we now switch over to our ROE walk and look at the upside that comes from the bank, with respect to the upside in
the bank and the slide that looks at asset optimization and the yield on the various categories, in that we've embedded
the forward yield curve and nothing more than the forward yield curve.
So we've tried to give you a lot of the pieces with respect to asset growth and the mix and that assumption so that you
can deal with all the sensitivities that you think are appropriate given your outlook on the market.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So, if you did have 100 basis point increase in debt funds, then we could assume a higher PBT
for the Wealth Management business?

<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes. So Rates obviously are a benefit to the bank overall and to the Wealth Management business.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: You mentioned Prime Brokerage is back to the best levels since 2008. Is it all the way back? I
know the business was hurt during the crisis and you're trying to get customers back. Are you back at a steady state?
Are you still gaining share?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We're in a very strong business with PB, and I'd say that there has been a quite substantial change
overall in Prime Brokerage over the last several years, the restructuring of that business and the way the business is
funded post 2008. And so, we're in a strong position with balances, I think best reflecting the strength of it and the
overall contribution of the franchise. So, we feel very good about where we are in that business. A very important
business to us and the team continues to deliver.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: In FICC, compared to your peers, it looks like you underperformed. And it's tough to break out
how much of that underperformance is due to the deliberate downsizing versus poor execution. I mean, are you
satisfied with the execution this quarter or not?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So, a couple of parts to that question as well. As a reminder, Fixed Income & Commodities is made
up of the Fixed Income product and Commodities, two separate – two different businesses. FICC on the one hand,
Commodities on the other, we were substantially weaker in Commodities, down meaningfully quarter-over-quarter.
The FICC revenues excluding commodities are up quarter-over-quarter, notwithstanding the bigger drag in CVA due to
spread tightening. So in our securitized products area, in credit, in foreign exchange, they were all up in the quarter.
So to your second part of your question, feel good about the direction of those businesses. Rates was down as was the
market, and our view is that we can continue to deliver more in that business, which is why it was highlighted in James'
comments.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And I would just add to that, Mike. I wouldn't draw a lot on percentage movements off
of that number, which is a fairly modest number to begin with, to be perfectly frank. So I'd focus more on the business
mix, as Ruth described. Parts of the business did well, parts of it didn't. The new management has a plan to drive this
higher and we're confident about their plan.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then, last question. Ameritrade last quarter said that the wire houses have made some
moves which make it more difficult on the breakaway broker's side. And I'm not exactly sure what the online broker
was referring to, but can you just address what you're doing, say, to either retain customers or brokers or how the
environment's changed from several years ago, say, for example, against online brokers or other competitors? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, attrition in our business, you can see it from the head count numbers, continues to be very
low. It's actually down a bit this quarter from the very low levels that we've been talking about. We think that has a lot
to do with the quality of the platform. And when you look at our ongoing growth in assets, they are reaching $1.9
trillion this quarter, I think, again, the clients are speaking and the FAs are speaking.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: It's a different market segment.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thanks.

Your next question will come from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks. Maybe for James, just on the walk, the ROE target, I guess I'm just trying to
figure out, when I look at like the pre-tax margin being increased, the risk-weighted asset reduction coming on sooner,
expenses in line, the market up 30%, but the ROE target is still in that 9% to 10%-plus range if we get a better
environment. So I guess I'm just trying to figure out, it seems like it should be better, meaning it seems like things have
gone better than current expectations or what the expectations were a year ago. So anyways, I'm just trying to get a

sense on have some things gone the other way to keep the ROE target there, or is it just being conservative?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Listen, we – this is a journey. Three years ago, I think our ROE was close to 2%. Two
years ago, it was about 5%. This year, ex-litigation, it's about 7%. You'll see on that chart, Mike, that we've got a return
target of 10-plus-percent. And then, we talked about the additional upside so you can draw your own conclusions from
that. But I think we've stayed pretty consistently, we're a kind of one-step-at-a-time-management team. The one step is
to get us to 10%, and we'll deal with that happy opportunity once we get there. So let's just play it out at a time.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow up. Based on getting more clarity around Volcker,
I mean you guys have been probably more strategic in terms of moving forward in FICC than maybe some other firms.
But in any other areas, particularly Investment Management maybe on like the merchant banking side, are things fairly
much set? Or should we be expecting much more to change in that part of the business, based on what you know on the
Volcker side as of now?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I don't expect material changes to the Investment Management business post Volcker.
I mean we had a lot more capital tied up in that business pre-crisis. The bad news is we wrote a lot of it off
unfortunately. The good news is we now have much less capital tied up in the business.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.

The next question will come from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to try to ask maybe the
interest-rate sensitivity question another way. I think the last formal update that we received was that 100 basis point
curve shift would increase net interest income by about $700 million. So is that still the firm's view? And if that's still
in the range, can you give us any insight around how you're thinking about the liability side of the equation, meaning,
how much of the benefit of the rate increase do expect to have to pass along to customers?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the rates have moved up a bit since we provided that guidance, and that's why we attempted, in
the material here and in the slide deck, to break out the various component parts. So that you can apply whatever
timeline you want to it and look at it at various points in time. And so, clearly in a rising rate environment, there would
be some – there would be a modestly higher increase in deposit costs as well, but overall we have meaningful operating
leverage from this.
I think, again, one of the key points for us, with respect to the bank, is the cost structure of the bank. We don't have
client acquisition costs because we're talking about our embedded client base, both on the Wealth Management side
and on the Institutional Securities side. We don't have bricks and mortar. We've made the investments, virtually all of
the investments that need it. We continue to invest in the businesses, of course. In particular, to continue to improve the
customer experience.
But, as a result, the incremental margin on this product is very high for Morgan Stanley, substantially higher than it is
today. And it's not just – we clearly benefit from a rising rate environment and look forward to that, whenever that may
occur. But it's also the cost structure, that business that is very different.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Appreciate that color. And then just with respect to the litigation expense, how should we
think about that moving forward? I know it's going to be lumpy, but can we think that maybe some of the outsized
provision this quarter could reflect some pull-forward from issues that maybe you were thinking that were going be
addressed next year? Just any other additional color there would be helpful.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, as James said, this reserve, coupled with the reserves to date, are appropriate based on what
we now know. And that being said, litigation is the biggest headwind for the industry, but this is obviously a substantial
move.

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yeah. The key on the litigation is, we wanted to make significant progress. It's
estimable and probable and working with our legal team and finance and some, that's where we came out. So from
what we see, we've made significant progress.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, within the investment banking backlog, can you guys give
any more granularity around what you're seeing in just kind of the businesses from a cyclical perspective, kind of
where you are today versus maybe what you think the upside may be, as we do get a cyclical recovery?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the pipeline does remain strong. I think most gratifying is the pickup in M&A momentum
coming from CEO confidence that we've all been looking for for quite some time now. And it's really on the back of
more data that supports the thesis of global economic growth. We are seeing more cross-border activity. We've talked
about that on some prior calls. The Centauri deal that we announced earlier this week is yet another data point in that
trend. We think that's an important one.
I did comment that we're seeing more activity with corporate. I think last year much of it was much more about
financial sponsor activity, but now we're also seeing more corporate activity. And very valuable is increased
participation from Europe as well. It's been pretty subdued there for quite some time. So, yeah, we feel good about
where this is, and if you look historically, M&A's still at pretty low levels. Equity underwriting momentum continues
industry-wide and globally, and I think with debt underwriting, it's less of a forward calendar, but given event-related
financings, we expect some ongoing strength in that area as well.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Great. Appreciate all the color.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

The next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning. As we think about the ROE progression from roughly 7% ex the litigations
and the noise right now to the 9%, it seems like the improvement in PBT is worth about 1% to ROE, and then the FICC
and the Commodities is a big driver. Can you quantify how much ROE upside there is from that? And I understand
there's been a lot of questions asked what the revenue opportunity is, the expense opportunities and there's kind of some
moving pieces there. But from an ROE point of view and if you get FICC and Commodities where you want, how
much of a driver is that to firm-wide ROE?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well, what I'd like to add to your list because it's the most important incremental driver to ROE is
the bank. I've commented on higher yield through asset optimization and the cost structure we have. We also have
growing deposits and those are contractual. It's part of the acquisition from Citi that we're now getting in $1.75 billion
of deposits per month through the middle of next year. So the result is a higher return on a larger base.
Given the cost structure, the incremental margin is substantial, as I've already noted. So it essentially just all drops to
the bottom line. So you start with that. I'll let you do your own forecasting and math on that plus the Wealth
Management and higher profitability that we laid out here on the slide.
And Fixed Income, yes, we are taking steps, we're moving it forward, but we're not assuming a recovery in the FICC
market. So that's not the biggest driver. Not much there. And then we have more on the expense reduction program to
come and, as James said, then finally the increasing returns of capital over time. So I just want to make sure you've got
the full list and, again, the importance of the bank is not to be understated.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just add at a sort of macro level, if you think about it simplistically, our comp
to revenue ratios aren't going to change a whole lot. Certainly we brought them down this year, given revenues went
up, and we would expect them to come down as revenues go up. So that's kind of known.

The firm is being managed very tightly from other non-comp expense basis. We have a comprehensive worldwide
effort, as Ruth just referred to, making progress on that. And we're not going to take our foot off that. We're going to be
driving those non-comps very aggressively. So really it's just a question of what the revenues are. I think the clarity of
our expense base is probably as high as it's been for a long time and now, as we said, with the substantial progress on
the litigation behind us, it really is a revenue share right now.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Just a follow-up on the expenses. Sorry if I missed it, but of the $1.6 billion of savings, how
much is in the run rate either for the full year 2013 or for 4Q?

components of it.

The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a
follow-up on an earlier question on the 100% growth you expect in lending. Just be helpful to get some color on where
you're seeing such robust loan demand. Is it completely new loan demand from your clients? Or is it your clients
switching from existing lending providers to you? And what is it about your lending program that is driving such
outsized growth relative to the industry?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So we're, if I break it down into the two sides of the business that are benefiting most from
deposits, first on the Wealth Management side, the lending to clients where we have a deep relationship. Their assets
are here at Morgan Stanley, and what we have talked about is we're underpenetrated relative to peers with lending
product. It has not historically been a focus for our system, and over the last several years, we've been building up the
number of bank advisors who sit with financial advisors providing the requisite support for their client base.
So we're starting in a position where we're underpenetrated, have the client assets with us. This is product the clients
want. It's simple product. For example, PLA, our securities-based lending program, enables clients to maintain their
portfolio as is but continue to invest as they want to. So it's a very productive add-on to the work that they are already
doing with us. And again, given this is product that's significantly over-collateralized and, as I've said, with our existing
client base, we've had virtually no credit losses to date. It's mostly floating-rate product, and we're seeing nice growth
in that. It's the bigger part of lending growth within Wealth Management. And I'll refer you back to the conference I did
earlier in the year where there's more detail on that one.
In the Mortgage side, we are continuing to see strong demand. To be fair, it's off of a low base, but we were
deliberately constraining production there, as I already noted. So continuing to see upside in that business.
If you switch over to the Institutional Securities side, we have historically been focused on relationship lending and
event lending, as you would expect, and what we're now adding are what I always characterize as like sleeves of
product, all modestly sized that are consistent with the client franchise that we have. So this is business that otherwise
we were not doing with our existing client franchise. This gives us the opportunity to continue to build, and that's what
we've been doing in areas like Commercial Real Estate and Project Finance.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Great. Thanks. Thanks for the detailed answer.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Just switching over to capital return. I'll concede that the quantum of capital Morgan Stanley
can return is -- would be subject to regulatory approval. But as you consider the future capital structure of Morgan
Stanley, do you envisage being able to return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders in the foreseeable future?

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Listen, I think let's take one step at a time. We're in the CCAR process now. We had
our first capital outlay last year which was the final acquisition of Smith Barney, we had our first buybacks last year
since 2008 which was starting the $500 million tranche. We're participating in CCAR right now. We'll get the results of
that in the first quarter, and let's just take our projections from then on.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Apologies if I missed this earlier on, but with regards to your 9% ROE target, what fixed
income revenue assumption are you making? Is it kind of $4.2 billion you did this year? Or is it more like the fourth
quarter's run rate? Just trying to get a sense of what's embedded in that 9% ROE target.
<A - Ruth Porat>: The main point, as I said, about the 9% ROE starting point for the firm is that within fixed income
we're driving a return on capital that's in excess of our cost of capital. And as I indicated with the steps in Commodities,
there's continued improvement in net ROE, in Fixed Income. Across a number of products, we've already reached that
type of return.
Looking at RWAs or capital on a normalized basis, we've added foreign exchange in 2013, notwithstanding what was a
challenging, more challenging foreign exchange market environment and we're looking to do the same with rate. So it
is very much, if we're looking at what's the return for the overall firm, it is about achieving those types of returns for
fixed income. But I'll repeat what already said, which is we're not assuming a recovery in the FICC market
industry-wide in 2014 so it's not much of a driver to the upside in our ROE.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Got it. And just lastly for me, question on just regulation in the Wealth Management space. As
one of the largest financial advisor networks in the country, just been curious for your thoughts around kind of potential
harmonization of regulator regimes between the SEC and FINRA regulated advisors and any potential implications for
Morgan Stanley's competitive positioning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Boy, that's a pretty broad one. Honestly, we run the business and aspire to run it as
well as anybody in the industry, work constructively with the regulators. There are obviously some differences across
FINRA and SEC, but I'm not going to get into projecting harmonization impact on our side. I would be very, very
surprised if there are any material impacts on that business based upon any harmonization.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Great. Thank you.

The final question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Ruth, just to go back to slide 14 for a moment. Obviously, the simple
math is that looking at the potential numerator benefits gets you to 6% to 6.3%. But I'm just curious about the box that
you have in terms of potential offsets, which first cites the balance sheet growth. I'm just trying to reconcile that with
what James indicated the targets are on page 11. So does this outlook on 14 embed this asset growth, and driven by the
deposit growth over the next two years?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So when we described or showed the growth in assets for the bank, to be clear, that's looking at the
asset side. So we have deposit growth, but we have equity supporting the bank, so that's the asset side of the equation, a
bit higher than the deposit growth that we're talking about.
When we go to the potential offsets, we are looking at this ongoing onboarding of deposits and, yes, it is built into our
statement that we'll be at greater than 5% in 2015 with growing returns of capital. We manage overall the balance sheet
to put our balance sheet and capital behind growth areas within the firm. So we built in the capacity to have growth
within the firm across our various businesses, including the obvious deposit onboarding. And so that's one potential
offset that has been incorporated into our outlook and the greater than 5% and then capital returns, I think, speaks to
itself.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. And so does the same view get you to the SLR target on the bank level as well?

<A - Ruth Porat>: We're already at about 6% on our larger bank, MSBNA, and even higher than that on the other
bank. We capitalize those banks to support the growth that we anticipate, and so those are already in a strong position.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. And so just finally on this, so as I think about the ROE targets and all of these going
forward, is it fair to say that the governing issue at this stage is much more the compliance with SLR than CCAR
capital?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Our view is that we have a very strong flight path to greater than 5% in 2015 and that incorporates
returns of capital. And so that doesn't serve as a constraint. And so the CCAR process is obviously an annual process.
We feel very good about what we've done over the last several years and last year with the consistency of the
businesses that we have, the ongoing accretion of capital, the ratios that we have, but we don't view the SLR as a
constraint on that because we built into our forward look a return – increasing returns of capital.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. Thanks so much.
