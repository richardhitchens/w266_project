MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the 3M first quarter earnings conference call. During the
presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 25, 2013. I would now like to
turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.
Matthew Ginter
Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I'm here with Inge Thulin today, 3M's President and Chief Executive Officer,
and David Meline, 3M's Chief Financial Officer. And thanks for joining our first quarter business review. Note that
today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying the call are posted on our Investor Relations website at
3M.com under the heading Quarterly Earnings. Also note that our next two earnings conference calls are set for July 25
and October 24. In addition, we will host an investor meeting on the afternoon of Tuesday, December 17, at the Grand
Hyatt hotel in Midtown Manhattan. For now, block off 1 to 5 p.m. on that day, if you would.
If you'd please turn to slide number 2, during today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that
reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain
assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent
Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.
So now I'll turn the call over to Inge, and please turn to slide number 3.

Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt. And good morning, everyone. I appreciate your joining us this morning. Overall, this was a good
quarter for 3M. We delivered solid results in the face of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower factory utilization in a few
businesses. Double-digit organic growth in China, Latin America, and Middle East/Africa helped us overcome
weakness Western Europe and Japan. I am pleased that we posted sale growth of around 2% against a backdrop of
0.8% worldwide IPI. Four of our five business groups achieved positive organic sales growth in the quarter. Health
Care posted a 4% gain in organic local currency, as did Consumer, coming off a very strong Q4.
This is the first quarter of reporting based on our new structure, and as a result, we have clearer visibility on all of our
business groups. Let me make a comment on the importance of this change to the Electronics & Energy business group.
Here, the new structure not only gave us better visibility but also set the stage for better asset utilization in the future.
We are seeing early progress today, and I know that we will see even more as this team takes shape. On the customer
front, Electronics & Energy creates for us a launching pad from which we can quickly introduce a broader range of
technologies into the market and fully capitalize on the outstanding customer relationships 3M has earned in this space.
In other words, it creates opportunity. So Q1 gave us many things to be happy about. That said, I want to be clear that
we view this quarter in a much longer and much larger context. We will continue to manage 3M for the long term and
for the sustained success of the company.
That approach is clear when you look at our ongoing investments to improve the business. For example, as we told you
last November, we are increasing our investments in research and development and intend to be closer to 6% of sales at
the end of the five-year planning period. We continue with capital investments to improve productivity and grow the
business. We remain on track for CapEx investment of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion this year. We are building new
strength in emerging markets, and in a number of push-forward businesses like Health Care, we are adding resources
and on-the-ground expertise. In summary, we are moving forward on all fronts. We will be pushing hard to take
advantage of any recovery in the second half. Note that we have not adjusted our expectation on the organic local
currency growth, which remains at 2% to 5% for the year. We remain focused on driving growth everywhere.
Now, let me take you through a quick look at Q1 results. EPS was $1.61, up slightly year over year. Operating margins
were 21.6% on GAAP basis, basically flat year on year and up sequentially, consistent with historical patterns. Four of
our five business groups came in above 21%. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, margins were 22%, very strong.
Sales were $7.6 billion, up 2% in dollar terms and a record first quarter for us. Organic local currency growth was up
2.1%, with Health Care and Consumer up 4%, Industrial up 3%, and Safety & Graphics up 2%.
Geographically, Latin America/Canada was up 7%. The United States and Asia Pacific were up 2%, and
Europe/Middle East/Africa down 1%, with Western Europe the main area of challenge. Currency had a negative effect
on sales of almost 2% in the quarter, and acquisitions added about the same amount. Finally, in the quarter, we returned
$1.25 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
The first quarter validated our previous view about the beginning of this year. As you recall, we anticipated continued
uncertainty and slow growth in the first half of the year, especially in the electronics space, and that is exactly what we
saw. Today, as we look back at Q1 and forward through the rest of the year, we see reason to adjust our guidance in the
interest of credibility and clarity.
Two primary factors are driving this decision. First, macroeconomics. The economy remains uncertain, and external
forecasts have declined a bit since the year-end, the developed economies in Western Europe and Japan in particular.
On a market level, consumer electronics continue to present challenges. While there are some indications of an upturn
later in the year, our optimism is tempered by the current reality. We expected a challenging start to the year, but in fact
market conditions were tougher than we had expected.
Second, the stronger U.S. dollar. We previously anticipated that 2013 currency effects will be neutral to sales and
earnings. We now expect a 1.5% sales headwind and a $0.05 per share earnings impact for the year. The recognition of
these realities leads us to an EPS outlook for the year of $6.60 to $6.85 per share.

In the quarter, we announced 3M's 55th annual dividend increase, an increase of 8%. In addition, we announced a new
share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion. I will now turn the call over to David for more color on the quarter.
David?
David W. Meline
Thank you, Inge. Let's begin with slide number six, where I will break down the first quarter change in sales. Organic
local currency growth was 2.1% against a challenging economic backdrop, as Inge mentioned. In fact, the most recent
forecast from Global Insight calls for a 0.8% worldwide IPI growth in Q1.
Volumes contributed 1.7% to our growth, and selling prices increased 0.4%. Acquisitions added 1.7 points to sales
growth in the quarter. Three deals contributed to this growth: Ceradyne in our Industrial business, FSTech in Safety &
Graphics, and CodeRyte in Health Care. Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.8 percentage points in the
quarter, due in large part to a 14% devaluation of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. In dollar terms, worldwide
sales grew 2% versus the first quarter of 2012.
On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada led the way again this quarter, with organic local currency growth of
7.3%, and all five of our businesses posted positive growth in that region. In particular, Health Care and Safety &
Graphics grew double-digits.
In the United States, organic local currency growth was 2.3%, led by a 5% increase in the Consumer business. We also
generated positive growth in Industrial, Safety & Graphics, and Health Care. Asia Pacific grew nearly 2% organically
in the first quarter. China/Hong Kong grew by 10% in Q1, and Japan declined by 8%. In EMEA, or the combined
Europe, Middle East, and Africa, first quarter sales declined 0.8% on an organic local currency basis. Health Care
generated low-single-digit organic growth in EMEA, Industrial was flat, and the three other businesses declined year on
year. On a regional basis, we achieved solid organic growth in both Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa, and
Western Europe declined 3%.
Let's move to the income statement. Please turn to slide number seven. First quarter sales were $7.6 billion, up 2% in
dollar terms. Our gross profit percentage was a strong 48%, equal to last year's comparable quarter. SG&A spending
rose in line with sales, and we increased R&D investments by 5% year on year to $430 million. Operating income
increased nearly 1% to $1.6 billion. GAAP operating margins were 21.6%, down 20 basis points year on year. Included
in these results was a 40-basis-point headwind from acquisitions. Therefore, underlying margins increased 20 basis
points in Q1 to a solid 22%.
Profit leverage on organic volume growth added 20 basis points to first quarter operating margin, and lower
year-on-year pension and OPEB expense added another 60 basis points. The combination of lower raw material costs
and higher selling prices added 90 basis points to first quarter margins. Lower factory utilization reduced margins by 1
percentage point, largely related to excess inventories in pockets of our Electronics & Energy and Industrial businesses.
First quarter earnings were $1.61 per share, up 1.3% versus the first quarter of 2012.
One more item which is not on the chart relates to our Corporate and Unallocated segment. You will see a first quarter
expense in Corporate and Unallocated of $74 million, which is a $64 million improvement year on year. Pension and
OPEB expense declined, which accounts for one-half of that improvement. Part of the remainder relates to our ERP
project. Now that we are moving from the development stage into deployment, more costs are being borne by the
businesses rather than corporate. On average, this reduced operating margins in each of our businesses by
approximately 30 basis points in Q1, with the benefit coming in corporate. We expect this 30 basis point margin impact
to each of the businesses to continue throughout 2013. For the full year 2013, we anticipate a total expense in Corporate
and Unallocated of approximately $350 million to $400 million.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Turn to slide number 8. First quarter operating cash flow rose by $166 million, or 20%, to
nearly $1 billion. Cash flow benefited from $269 million of lower pension and OPEB contributions, offset in part by
higher tax payments. We invested $324 million in capital expenditures during the first quarter, up $63 million versus

first quarter of last year, and are projecting $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year 2013. Free cash flow rose by
$103 million or 18% to $670 million. Free cash flow conversion was 69%, a 9 point improvement versus the first
quarter of 2012. First quarter is typically our seasonal low point for free cash flow conversion and improves as the year
progresses. We returned $1.25 billion to shareholders in the first quarter, comprised of $440 million in cash dividends
and $805 million of gross stock repurchases. For the full year, we are now tracking towards $3 billion in gross share
repurchases, which is at the high end of our previously expected range of $2 billion to $3 billion.
Let's review in more depth our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis, starting with Industrial.
Please go to slide number 9. First quarter sales were $2.7 billion in Industrial, up 3% on an organic local currency
basis, against a tough 7% comp in Q1 of 2012. Most of Industrial's businesses grew organically in the first quarter.
Aerospace again grew double digits due to a combination of market share gains and strong end market growth.
Industrial adhesives and tapes, which is 3M's largest operating division, had solid organic growth in the quarter, as did
the personal care business. Organic sales declined in our advanced materials business. Automotive OEM grew 2%
organically in the first quarter versus a 1.5% estimated decline in Q1 global auto production. We continued to gain
relevance and higher penetration levels in this massive market.
On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales in the Industrial business rose 6% in Latin America/Canada and 4%
in both APAC and in the United States. Organic sales were flat in EMEA, with broad-based declines in Western
Europe offset by double-digit increases in Central/Eastern Europe and in Middle East/Africa.
The Ceradyne acquisition added 3.6% to this quarter's growth in Industrial. Integration is progressing very well, with
newly combined technical teams working to identify a number of future growth opportunities. We are injecting Lean
throughout the operation to drive maximum efficiency and capture value quickly. Profits are ahead of plan, while sales
were short of plan in the first quarter, largely defense related, whereas sales in the industrial parts of the business are on
track. We were encouraged in March when Ceradyne was awarded a $40 million-plus order from the U.S. government
for small arms protective insert armor plates for the government of Afghanistan. First quarter operating income was
$576 million, and reported margins were 21.5%. Ex acquisitions, Industrial operating margins were 22.5%.
Now let's move to Safety & Graphics; turn to slide 10. First quarter sales were $1.4 billion, up 2.3% on an organic local
currency basis. This growth was led by our commercial graphics and architectural markets businesses. We also posted
positive organic growth in building and commercial services, personal safety products, and roofing granules. The traffic
safety and security systems business posted an organic sales decline in the first quarter, largely due to weak
government funding levels and a slow start for the U.S. construction season. We also restructured part of the business
in Q1 to improve its competitiveness going forward with associated costs of $4.5 million in the quarter. On a
geographic basis, organic local currency sales rose 10% in Latin America/Canada, 4% in Asia Pacific, and 3% in the
United States. Organic sales declined 4% in EMEA.
The FSTech acquisition added 2.2% to growth in the quarter, and integration efforts are tracking well versus our
expectations. This business also secured a major contract during the quarter for highway tolling with the Bay Area
Transportation Authority in San Francisco. Operating income in Safety & Graphics increased slightly to $335 million,
and operating margins were a strong 23.7%. Excluding acquisitions, first quarter operating margins increased 20 basis
points to 24.3%.
Next up is Health Care, found on slide 11. Health Care sales totaled $1.3 billion, up 4% on an organic local currency
basis. We grew organically across the Health Care portfolio, with particular strength in food safety, critical and chronic
care, and health information systems. On a geographic basis, Latin America/Canada grew 12%, Asia Pacific grew 7%,
EMEA grew 3%, and the U.S. grew by 2%. In developing markets, Health Care grew 13% on an organic local currency
basis, with notable strength in India, Middle East/Africa, Brazil, Central/East Europe, and Southeast Asia. Developing
markets represent one-fourth of our Health Care sales today and a significant opportunity for tomorrow. In developed
markets, the business grew 2% organically, including 6% in Japan.
Operating income rose 1% to $404 million, and margins were 30.8%, down 60 basis points year on year. Starting
January 1 of this year, we began absorbing additional costs related to the U.S. medical device tax. The first quarter cost
was just over $5 million, representing a 40 basis point drag on Q1 worldwide operating margins. For many years, our

Health Care business has grown organically, each and every quarter, with consistently outstanding margins. The
business generates tremendous value for our customers and for shareholders.
Please turn to slide number 12. In Electronics & Energy, sales were $1.3 billion for the quarter, down 2% in organic
local currency terms. Growth was slightly positive on the energy side of the business, with strength in electrical
markets offset in part by in weakness in telecom and renewable energy. Electronics, which is 60% of the segment,
declined about 4% organically. Lower market demand also triggered sizable inventory reductions by some of our OEM
customers and their tier suppliers. As a result, our factory utilization ran lower than we had been expecting, and we
expect this will persist into the second quarter. From an electronics end market standpoint, we're expecting a second
half recovery for three primary reasons. One, inventories should be in good shape after Q2; two, wafer starts and
capacity utilization are gradually increasing; and, three, the semiconductor book-to-bill is indicating an upward trend.
Operating income in Electronics & Energy declined 16% year on year to $196 million, and margins declined 2.4
percentage points to 15.3%. Lower volumes and utilization were the primary drivers here.
Finally, let's review the Consumer business, found on slide number 13. Sales in Consumer were $1.1 billion this
quarter, up 4% on an organic local currency basis. All of our businesses delivered positive local currency organic
growth this quarter, with particular strength in the consumer health care, DIY, and home care businesses. From a
geographic perspective, organic sales growth was 8% in Asia Pacific and 5% in the U.S. and in Latin America/Canada.
EMEA declined 6%. In developing markets, the Consumer business grew 9% in organic local currency in Q1.
Consumer is one of our most significant opportunities in developing markets, as the middle class is growing rapidly in
many of these countries, and retail is growing with it. 3M's global capability and local presence around the world gives
us a distinct advantage in serving those retail customers. Quarterly operating income was $237 million in Consumer,
equal to the first quarter of 2012, and margins were 21.9% for the quarter. Margins declined 40 basis points year on
year, due to higher investments in areas such as e-commerce, design, and advertising and merchandising.
So that concludes our review of the first quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, David. Before we go to your questions, I wanted to update you on our progress in several areas.
First, portfolio management. On the Q4 call, I referred to actions to consolidate our traffic safety systems and security
systems businesses. These restructuring actions were completed in the quarter with associated cost of $4.5 million in
the quarter. The point here, of course, is that we are directly addressing the more challenging segments of our portfolio.
You should also know that we are increasingly directing a larger percentage of resources towards our heartland and
push-forward businesses.
Second, a word on Ceradyne. As David mentioned, the integration of Ceradyne is progressing very well, and profits are
ahead of plan. I'm excited about the emerging technology synergies from our newly strengthened ceramics platform.
Finally, we announced new leadership in APAC region. Our new area Vice President of Asia Pacific, Jim Bauman, has
successfully managed a wide range of businesses and functions across the company and has extensive international
experience. He's a proven leader. In addition, Kenneth Yu, the energetic, longtime head of 3M China, will now be
applying his impressive business-building skills in developing markets around the world. The new leader for 3M China
is Donald Chang, who most recently led and developed our business in Southeast Asia very successfully. Donald is
another great builder of businesses, and the ideal new leader to implement our new China plan. So our history of very
strong leadership in APAC region continues.
To wrap up, we remain confident looking ahead and are keenly focused on elements within our control: advancing our
long-term strategic objectives, driving productivity, and improving the business. 3M's unique combination of
technology strength, manufacturing excellence, and global capability will enable us to deliver sustainable increases in
sales, earnings, and cash flow. As I said earlier, we are moving forward on all fronts. Thank you. We will now address
your questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Just so I understand, how are you thinking about the cadence of I guess what's an implied
2% to 6% top line growth for the rest of the year? You've mentioned a lot of different dynamics going into that, but if
you sort of take us through the quarters and how you're thinking about that – or if it's just maybe how you're thinking
about that ramping up, that'd be helpful.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So if you look at how we think the quarters are going to develop, Steve, we think that
it's really looking, to us, more like a first half, second half story right now. So we think that the second quarter
specifically in the Energy & Electronics is going to run in a similar fashion to what we saw in the first quarter, followed
by an improvement in that segment in the second half. And then likewise, if you look at the other businesses, we are
observing that we will expect to see some level of improvement in the second half.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And then could you also maybe just go through a little bit more of expectations or
what you're seeing in China in terms of stocking levels and liquidity across the different businesses?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So if you look at China, first of all, I've observed that we saw 10% organic local
currency growth again here in the first quarter, and if you take that and separate electronics and the balance of the
business, we ran at 8%. So if you think of base business at 8% in China versus it was at 10% in the fourth quarter of
last year, so viewed pretty steady. And then you saw a decline in the electronics, and, in this case, energy segment,
including renewable, that caused the total growth in China to go from 16% to 10%. So we're seeing – part of the
electronics issues that I referred to, and energy, are based in China, as they have a big renewals business there. So we
saw a decline in that area, which we expect will continue into the second quarter. Whereas in the base businesses,
Industrial, for example, and Safety & Graphics ran at 10% and 11% respectively, which is very consistent with what we
saw as we finished the year last year.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And -
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Steve, this is Inge. I think on the growth piece, the way I think about it is this is the second
quarter now when we have showed growth. And the 2% growth in this quarter, based on the IPI growth, we feel okay
with. Now, that is one of the reasons – you said 2% to 6%. We're saying 2% to 5% in the growth range for the year, so
not 2% to 6%, 2% to 5%. And we don't change that because we're coming off of a growth quarter of 2%.
Second quarter, as David said, looked very much like the first quarter. And relative to China, it's good to see we had
growth in Q4, we had 10% growth in Q1, coming out of three quarters earlier of basically no growth. Now, we believe
still it's fragile in China, when you look upon external data, and in Q2, it could sidetrack based on growth, right? So we
are optimistic, but we still need to see more evidence of growth coming in that market.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. Great. Thanks, I'll hand it off.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Obviously I think you're going to get a lot of questions just on growth and such, and 2% is better
– a lot better than we're seeing at other companies. But still in that regard, when you think about taking the CapEx
numbers the way you have, I think it's about a 24% increase quarter over quarter. I mean, what types of – maybe you
can give us some examples of what types of growth projects are you working on or what type of end markets are you
expecting that type of – the growth that would justify really ratcheting up spend in a low-growth environment?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, this is Inge. As we said, we're not changing the guidance for this year relative to the
CapEx. And as we all know, the CapEx investment is based on long-term growth. So that is why we are saying this is
something we would continue and, of course, there is some markets that are doing better that need more investment,
that over time some is more of a challenge. But for end, we would like to build out very much close to the market in
international as we have talked about earlier.
So without going into specific segments per se, you can think about it as we build out our Health Care business on a
global base. We're doing very well in Health Care. We're growing well now against, as David referred to, a business
where we are growing everywhere, both from a business unit perspective and division and on a geographical base. And
we need to build that out as we move ahead. That portfolio is basically 75% in developed economies, so the developing
world is a huge upside for us with very attractive margins. So you will probably see over time additional investment in
that area. In many cases, in order to be successful in health care, you need to be very local in order to provide that
services.
The same goes for Consumer. Consumer is another business group for us that are performing very well. Our relative
penetration in developing world is much, much lower than in the developed, and specifically versus United States.
That's another business over time that we will build out. So I think you will see that. And then have you to think about
one of the strengths for 3M is our vertical integration in the business model. That means that we will utilize a lot of
capacity and places around the world when we build this out. So I would say that think about it as we are not changing
it now, because we invest for the future, and the future, we still believe in the plan we have laid out, and so it looks
very favorable for us.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Scott?

Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes, good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, so if I look at your full-year guidance, obviously maintained at the full-year 2% to 5% organic,
you've got, I guess, a bit of modest margin expansion, maybe flat margins for the full year – flattish, anyway. Given the
1Q performance and since you still had some of these headwinds on utilization in the second quarter, you've got pretty
tough comps coming up in 2Q, 3Q. Are you confident you can maintain flat margins for the full year?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure, yeah. Yeah. From what we can see now, if you look at kind of the headwinds and
tailwinds that we see for margins for the year, Nigel, certainly as we knew would be the case, we have some positives
in terms of margins year over year, in terms of the pension and OPEB expense. As you would note, in the first quarter,
we did see continued benefits in our margins from raw materials and pricing, so although we've indicated we think that

– in our planning that that would moderate through the year, certainly it's notable in terms of supportive of margins.
And I think, importantly, if you look at the headwinds there, we do have some higher level of integration costs of the
acquisitions which we did late last year. So those are hitting more heavily in the first quarter. So that will tend to
subside through the year.
And then, finally, utilization, and the utilization piece, there's several areas where we have underutilization in the
quarter. One of them is in the film-making equipment, so if you think about the fact that the renewable energy business
has seen a – quite a substantial downturn, there's inventory adjustments going on in that space that we think will have
the biggest impact here in Q1 and, to a certain extent, still in Q2. If you think about film-making for electronics, as we
mentioned likewise there, we see inventory adjustments that have been taking place in Q1, which we think, by the
midyear, those will be up and completed, and so we'll see a better utilization pattern in that area.
And then, finally, we do mention Industrial, and you have some specific areas of Industrial, some materials that we
make that are specialty materials that go into areas like high-performance gaskets that are used in automotive products
where they've had an inventory correction which now we see that actually will have been completed here by April. So
we see those areas which will enable that underutilization to be addressed, and that is obviously supportive of margins
as we go forward. So in summary, as we entered the year, we felt good about our ability to continue to deliver both
growth and margins, and we continue to believe that's the case.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And as a follow-on, I just want to tackle Scott's question from a
slightly different angle. 2.1% organic growth is actually one of the better ones we've seen so far, but you mentioned
that growth is coming in weaker than expected, and that continues into second quarter. And I'm wondering to what
extent you've managed discretionary costs a bit tighter than maybe envisaged or whether that is an option that you can
use as we go into second quarter and second half of the year?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So what I would say is that as we entered the year, we were quite cautious, not
dissimilar to how we operated the business throughout basically in the entire 2012. And so we've been managing costs
quite cautiously through last year, through the first quarter, and, frankly, we're in a position now where we'll continue
to do that until such time that we see our growth picking up more strongly, which would support incremental
investments in certain areas.
At the same time, and I think it's apparent, and hopefully you've picked up from some of our comments here, we have
no intention of backing off the investments that we believe are appropriate for the long-term health of the business, so
whether that be building out this emerging and developing market presence, whether that's building out our capabilities
with our systems, as I talked about, which are significant commitments we're making, ramping up the R&D with a
particular focus on the innovation area for some of these longer-term breakthroughs, we have the capability to do that,
and we expect to continue there.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Thanks, David.

question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question on your outlook cut. So we've said that $0.05 is FX, but we've left the organic
growth untouched. So how should I be thinking about the remaining $0.05 cut? Is it margin electronics; what is it?

<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. Basically, Andrew, what we're signaling with that, with the overall cut, is frankly a
level of uncertainty overall in the business that is a little bit higher than we had when we entered the year. So, first of
all, we've identified specifically $0.05 due to exchange, but, quite honestly, to pick a point estimate on that number is a
little bit difficult to develop that level of prevision. But I think directionally, we tried to size that impact for people so
they could understand it. And the balance of the cut is really reflecting what has turned out to be some areas of
incremental weakness in the business here in the first quarter and the first half, particularly related to the areas in
energy and electronics we mentioned. So I would take it as an indication directionally that we think there's more
uncertainty out there overall this year than perhaps we expected as we entered the year.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just to understand Ceradyne, I guess in your waterfall chart you highlighted margin drag
from M&A. You've also noted that sequestration was a drag, but you've also stated that Ceradyne is performing ahead
of your expectations. So how do I reconcile that?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so a couple things. So if you look at, first of all, the impact that would impact us from
sequestration, first of all, if you think about our business overall, we've got about 3% of our worldwide sales are related
to the U.S. government. That's at federal, local, and state levels. And about 40% of that, which is $1 billion, is related
to federal. So we think that the sequestration impact for us would be somewhere in the area of $10 million to $20
million on the year, and that would likely be here in the second and third quarters, and we're working to offset that with
market share gains.
Separately, if you look at what's going on with Ceradyne, there's an additional impact. So if you look at what's going on
with troop drawdowns, that would impact Ceradyne's revenue, we calculate, in the tune of $40 million to $50 million.
And so, again, we're working on offsetting that. This contract that we were able to win for $40 million as it relates to
body armor for the Afghanis is offsetting that. And secondly, we've got a series – actually, at last count, I think there
are 27 sales synergy programs that the guys have identified with existing and new products from Ceradyne that we can
push through our channels around the world for 3M.
So a couple of separate issues. If you look at the income of Ceradyne, as we said, while we've got transition costs that
are pulling through the income statement, including inventory step-up, which still hits us in Q1, we do see that the
overall performance on an income basis versus our original acquisition plan for Ceradyne is running ahead of the plan.

<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Maybe a clarification on pricing, raws, the comment – do you expect that spread to moderate
from here, or was that more a comment on pricing? And then also what you expect on raws. Looks like it was a nice
tailwind here.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so, right. So in the quarter we had 0.9% favorable impact on our margin year over
year, combination of both price and raws, as you know, Ajay. And if I just take the pieces, first of all, on pricing, as we
entered the year, we expected to see relatively minimal benefit from pricing through the year. And in fact Q1 was a
little bit better than we expected. As I look at the year on pricing, I would say it's still too early for me to think about
adjusting my view on pricing for the year. And if I look at raw materials, likewise, we did benefit in the first quarter

from continued tailwinds from lower raw material costs. We had said for the year we thought we would have a plus or
minus $0.05 impact as a result of raw materials, and quite honestly there it depends very much as to the direction of the
economy as to how that one is going to play out.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Got it. And then on the underutilization of capacity, we've seen that for a couple quarters. Looks
like continues into 2Q.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yep.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: And I know you talked about a second half pickup. But I guess the question is on the excess
capacity, are you positioning yourself for that uptick, or should we expect some capacity rationalization here?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, it's a good question, Ajay. So what I'd say is the particular area that we've called out
here is in the Energy and Electronics business, and what you see happening is that we put those businesses together
with a very specific intention to better utilize our assets, and more effectively, across those segments over time. So if
you think about the assets that we use to support our renewable business and our film-making business pointed at the
electronics space, by having those under a single umbrella, what we're already seeing now is the guys are able to even
more adeptly manage that capacity, so in this case, as we see renewable energy which is going through a very swift
downturn, we've already made some adjustments to our capacity plans so that we're repurposing that capacity towards
other film-making activities.
What's also true, and an example of that, would be we have a growing segment right now in the touchscreen area, and
so we've already repurposed some capacity that we'd originally expected to be adding. We've been able to repurpose
existing pointed at that touchscreen market. So while we wouldn't foresee right now any need to rationalize, per se,
what you could see over time, which is a typical 3M type model, which is, okay, we're repurposing and redirecting
capacity towards another business that's growing when we've got one that's not doing as well in the future.

<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning, Steve.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hi. On the raw mats, could you just maybe clarify what was the year-over-year decline in raw
mats? I think it was like 3.5% in the fourth quarter. I think you've been giving that in every conference call.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so – that's right. Last year the raw materials in the second half, including the fourth
quarter, was over 3%, and a little over – if you look for the full year in 2012 – a little over 2%. This first quarter we saw
that decline somewhat, but it was still over 2% favorable.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So it's – sorry. The benefit declined somewhat, is what you're saying.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, the benefit declined. Still, obviously the -

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then on your comment on electronics, I guess you said you expect a similar 2Q to
1Q. Does that mean the similar growth rate or similar – just like basically steady from an absolute perspective?
<A - David W. Meline>: Generally speaking, as we looked at the electronics outlook, what do we see? We see a first
half, second half phenomena, quite frankly, not dissimilar to what we experienced last year, and if I think about that
first half, first quarter, second quarter, whether it be growth percentages, whether it be dollar numbers, we think that it's
going to be pretty stable through the first half.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And sorry, one last question on -
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: And that is very consistent with external data that you see, right? So I think that's
[indiscernible] (50:10) -
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Oh, yeah.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: So I think it's -
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah. The macro on electronics.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: That's also why we are very cautious, right? So we do not see it yet, even if there is some hopes
for the future there. So that's why we type of move it forward.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Sure. Sure. And then lastly, just – you did say corporate was still guided $350 million to $400
million?
<A - David W. Meline>: For the year, that's correct. Yeah. So -
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, great.
<A - David W. Meline>: – you look at the quarter as a little lower because of some things that happened in Q1 of last
year. We think for the year $350 million to $400 million.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So with these dynamics, will you guys grow earnings in the second quarter?
<A - David W. Meline>: Certainly we are holding our guidance for growth for earnings for the year, $6.60 to $6.85
versus $6.32 last year. We saw modest growth of income in the first quarter. And, quite frankly, we're driving to
generate earnings and growth every quarter, and that'll certainly include the second quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you, gentlemen. Just a few questions, if I could. Just the R&D tax credit, it didn't appear
you guys had any benefit in the quarter. Why is that? And is there something that follows subsequently?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So, Steve, on taxes, what's true is actually the R&D – the pickup we got for the
deferral of the extenders actually was beneficial to us in the first quarter by 1.7%. So inside of that first quarter 29.1%,
we did have a benefit. But what's also true is if you look at the first quarter, the underlying run rate was closer to 31%
for the quarter. Typically our highest tax rate is in the first quarter of each year, and it moderates through the year. So
we expect 29.5% to 30% for the full year, same as we'd originally set out, and we think it'll run fairly stable through the
year.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. And then just on the Japan and the yen situation, obviously the translation is
understandable in a mathematical exercise. Are there any particular export opportunities for you out of Japan that are

new or different around the yen weakness that could possibly be a mitigating factor?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, let me make some comment on Japan in a bigger picture. We have – what is
happening in Japan now is something that we, in a way, could predict quite some time ago. So we have worked on
Japan as a business for quite some time. In fact, we started in the beginning of 2009 was when we took a big charge in
order to reset our operation there. And since that, we have done a lot of things in order to make sure that we have a
better competitive position in Japan. And that have been resetting of the manufacturing footprint, we made an
acquisition later, as you recall, A1, which is into the Consumer business group. And we have start to shift our
resources, I would say, to more domestic businesses – and for us, more domestic will be the Consumer business, the
Health Care business, and some of the safety businesses – while we have really put emphasis on the local
manufacturing for automotive specifically and the electronic area, per se.
So we have been working this for quite some time. And when we look upon our results in Japan, the interesting thing
for us is we look now in terms of growth for Health Care for the quarter was over 6%. For Consumer, over 7%. And so
we get traction there, and I think we are very well set for the future in Japan. Well, it will take some time for us. And
now for them, I think when you talk about export and import in and out of Japan, this will take some time for them to
get the plan working. So we hear good thing. If you have interacted and worked with Japan over time, you also know
this will take some time before there will come traction.
But generally speaking, we have a good, solid manufacturing footprint in Japan that we can capitalize on already now if
it pick up for them in terms of domestic manufacturing, which is what they will like by definition. That's where they are
driving it, right? So – and we have, in fact, our biggest super hub in the world is in Yamagata in Japan. So we have
incredible capabilities there already now to capitalize, if they will take off, which we assume they will in terms of
domestic manufacturing. I hope that helps.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: That does. Thank you, Inge. Just one other quick follow-up. David, can you just give us some
color on what the share count is implicit in your guide? And the reason I ask is looks like you had a lot of options
exercises and everything. You actually did more than a quarter of your annual buyback in the first quarter, with share
counts up sequentially?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So what I would say, Steve, is the guidance we gave, which still looks good for us, is a
gross buyback of $2 billion to $3 billion for the year. And as I said earlier, we're running, as you can see, at the high
end of that range. And if you look at the net buyback that we called out, I think it was around $1 billion to $1.5 billion
for the year. And, in fact, you're right. We expect that to be towards – the reissuance towards the high end, in that there
was a lot of reissuance this first quarter as we saw record share price for the company. So I don't know how to predict
how that's going to play out, but we're continuing to maintain our view that both gross as well as net will be able to
achieve the original allocation plan we'd set out.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So just a clarification on Electronics & Energy. If we're forecasting a similar growth rate for
the second quarter, even the low end of your guidance then implies roughly 4% growth in the third and fourth quarter.
And so my question is really regarding your confidence around that and then specifically how that relates to the
margins as well, because based on the data we have, it looks like this is the lowest-margin quarter we've seen in this
business over the last 12. So would love to get some color on the trajectory of margins there as well.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah, maybe I can address that, Joe. So if you look at the Electronics & Energy
business. A couple of, I think, relevant kind of context points. One is, as we did enter the year, we did put the widest
range on sales growth of the five sectors we defined around this business, because it was our perception that there was
some uncertainty coming into the year. So we've got – if I recall, 1% to 6% for the year is the range. We continue to
believe that that's a good range for the segment, despite having run below that, obviously, in the first quarter, and we
expect to run at a low level in the second. So we do expect to pick up in the second half, which, again, is I think not
inconsistent with indicators that you would observe elsewhere.
In terms of the margin performance for the business. As we kind of set up the year and tried to give some indication as
how we thought that would develop, we did indicate that we thought E&E for the year would have margins below the
company's average, in fact in the high teens. And we continue to expect that to be true, so I think you can infer that
you'll see a first half, second half pattern, both in growth as well as the consequent margins related to that sector.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Great. And I guess one other – one follow-up on the margins. Your Health Care
margins have been strong for several quarters. Saw a bit of a down tick on a year-over-year basis. Any color you can
provide there on mix? That would be very helpful.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so I guess what I'd say on Health Care margin, likewise, we'd indicated we thought this
year we would continue to run at similar margin levels as we've seen through last year which has been 30%-plus for
that sector, even though we think maybe long-term view is a little bit below that. You did see it come down a little bit
in the quarter year over year. Certainly we have identifiable aspects, one being a 0.4% impact of the new device tax on
a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned, the ERP costs that the businesses are picking up in the first quarter creates an
additional 0.3% headwind on a sector-margin basis in the first quarter, and that'll continue. So if you think about those
couple of factors in the context of the overall margin performance, I think you could and you should take away a view
that we continue to believe that the business and the sector is very healthy and will run pretty stable at a high level
through the year.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: And in addition to that, as I made in my comments, that we are giving additional investment to
some of the push-forward businesses. And Health Care is of course -
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, that's right.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: – one of them, right? So we are very, very positive around our outlook for Health Care. So
we're not only pleased with current performance. In fact, I would say I'm very, very pleased with current performance
in Health Care. But the outlook is also very, very solid for us. So we are supporting that business. They're on
push-forward. We're moving resources – very cautiously, though, in order to make sure we get productivity at the same
time as we build out. And most of the build-out is in developing economies and in international broad-based. And as
you know, 75% of our portfolio today is in the developed world. So as those economies now start to be ready to take on
more advanced Health Care and we have a very good value proposition with our product line, broad-based, I would
say, in both hospital supply and in the orthodontic field as well as in food safety. So it looks very good for us as we
move ahead.

Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, guys. Sorry, I jumped off earlier. I had the phone on mute. My fault.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Did you hear the answer at all?
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: It's not my first quarter I've ever listened to calls on, but you'd think it is. Anyways, I wanted to
follow up on this U.S. medical device tax. And is this somewhat of a timing issue where it just takes you awhile to pass
this on to your customers? Or is this something you've got to eat for a while until we anniversary it?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, great question, Scott. I guess we don't think about it as a pure pass-through that you
receive a cost increase and then you pass a price through to the market. Our view is that we need to look at the
offerings that we provide to the market, and we need to remain competitive. And we need to make sure we manage our
costs so that we get a margin for our efforts. So I don't think of them as having such a direct relationship, if you will.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Oh, okay -
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: And as you probably know, right, in that field specifically, in the health care field, it's very
difficult to pass it on because you have to pass it on, then, in terms of price increases, right?
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah. No, I'm sure that can be tough.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, so that's tough. And if you look upon the price increases for health care, as you stand into
the year, they are able of course to take a little bit higher in the developing world versus in United States.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Right.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: So I think it's correct. As David said, it's nothing we [ph] can push on (01:03:40). We need,
however, to drive efficiency in the manufacturing operations, which I would say in the health care space is a very
effective operation for us, right? So one of the reasons why we are successful there with very high margins is many
things in addition to the value of the product. But it's also very good manufacturing operation. So – and we, as you
know, can always do more. And we have Lean Six Sigma all over that in order to improve even more. So I think that's
how we -
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: – need to compensate those type of things we cannot control.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: No, I understand. And just a real, real quick one. When you look across the companies who we
cover, it seems that you guys get a little bit more stock dilution than the average on [ph] bolt (1:04:26) option plans and
share offerings and share grants and stuff. Does that start to tail off over time, and I guess my point being, as your
compensation strategies change either to be more cash-based and less option-based, or is it just – this is just kind of
how it is and -
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: – so we should just model that type of dilution going forward?
<A - David W. Meline>: No, that's a good question. So a couple comments. One is, if you look at an overall basis, the
historical pattern of the share count, we, over the last decade, have seen a decline, typically, on average, around 1%
annually. And as we looked into this next five-year plan that we talked about late last year, our current expectation is
that decline will increase somewhat to 1.5% to 2% area going forward.
And that's a few things. One is, as we think about how we allocate capital in that direction. And secondly, importantly,
there have been some changes to the compensation plans that have been put in place over time. So, for example, in
2007 there was a change in terms of the mix of comp, which resulted in the number of options being granted to be
reduced in about in half. So it's a little bit like a longer-term phenomena. But we're now seeing, coming to a step-down

in terms of the overall number of options that are outstanding and have not been reissued the shares yet. And if you
look at the first quarter, to your comment, quite frankly, with the way the stock price performed, we saw a lot of
reissuance occur then. So we think that the total outstanding on unexercised count of options probably will be cut in
half by year-end from where it was as recently as a few years ago.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: That's very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Thanks for letting me back in the queue.

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Covered a lot of ground. Just a couple cleanup questions
here.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: First for David, could you update us on the currency hedging that you do have in place, and is
it fair to say you've got about half of your yen exposure hedged?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, Deane. And thanks for the question. So yeah. So we continue with the same approach
that we've had in the past, which is on a rolling basis to be hedging 50% of our exposure, so that would certainly
include the yen. I think more specifically, if I look at the pattern and we compare the impact of this devaluation on a
year-over-year quarterly basis, what we do see is we called out a $0.05 headwind year over year now as we move
through, and that's concentrated in the first half. So – and specifically, we think we'll have, if exchange rates stayed at a
similar level to where they ended these recent days, we would expect to see something akin to $0.03 to $0.04 of that
impact impacting us in Q2.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Would that also show up as you're mark to marking these currency contracts, or would they
roll off and it's a P&L impact?
<A - David W. Meline>: They would show – what happens is, is we have hedge accounting treatment on both the
exposure and these matching hedges, so that's how we're able to predict, as I just described, the P&L impact in the
second quarter, because we know what those unrealized gains and losses are. And so if exchange rates are unchanged
as we move forward, those contracts will be maturing throughout the year, including the second quarter. And therefore
what I'm referring to is the unrealized gains and losses that we can see on the book right now.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: That's real helpful. And then just my last question for Inge. I was hoping you could update us
on the portfolio review. We've seen how you've gone through the sell, fix, combine process with traffic and security
being combined, but what else is on that hit list, and where do you stand in that review process?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, I don't know – I don't refer them as a hit list. I like most of those businesses, as you
know. All of them make money. All of them are good. But they are – in our world, they are below average relative to
performance. We are working our way through there, and I would say we take them business by business. I've not
announced a specific timeline, because, as you know, business is not conducted in that way. So I will let you know
after we have let internally and people know if there's some changes coming there. But the point I can tell you, which is
very encouraging, is that those businesses have improved dramatically the performance in the first quarter versus a
quarter ago, so they've got tougher targets and they are meeting those targets. So I think that's good.
Now the heartland and push forward, the heartland divisions had a very good performance in the first quarter. In fact as
David said, our biggest division in the company, industrial adhesives and tapes, had over 7% growth. So, yes, fantastic,
but that category is doing very well. On push forward, I would say, as that is lower leverage for us, we are allocating
resources. There is more to come in terms of execution of the plan.

Point is we are very focused on it. We spend a lot of time. They are different measurements, and people know it, right?
And I think that's the key element on how we are driving this forward. So I'm very encouraged around it, because both
myself and David and our whole management team believe in this approach in order to improve the portfolio and the
performance of the company. So rest assured we're on it, and as some announcement is coming, you will know as one
of the first when we have told people internally.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. Thank you.

And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Just one quick one. Within your portfolio, do you have any businesses
that are more leading-indicator businesses for the rest of the portfolio that are not just benefiting from an inventory
swing in the channel but are actually – are improving enough to give you confidence on the back half? Or is it all sort
of top down and your historical patterns?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: We probably don't look upon it product line by product line. We are [ph] forward from the
(1:12:20) market perspective, and I would say that we have very good customer insight and interaction with customers.
So we are able to follow very well. I think one of the advantages for us is the closeness that we have to our customers
and the customer intimacy based on a lot of technologies that we are working together with them on, both on platforms
that they are developing, which is an indicator of when that can be launched, yes or no, and also consumables in the
industry.
So we can have some businesses that we will see an early uptick that is a good indication, but I will not say – we're not
following it that way. We take an approach of following each marketplace, if you like, and get solid input and then
have those dialogues, which is a combination of external facts and data and what our teams are talking about. So that's
the answer to that question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.
