With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Steve. I'd like to apologize in advance for some coughs and sniffles, as I'm fighting a cold, and losing badly, I
might add.
Today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit, credit loss performance, funding and liquidity highlights, including
our outlook for 2014; automotive cash, debt and liquidity, an update on our pension and then we'll wrap things up with
a summary of the year.
Let's turn to Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide 1. Ford Credit remains key to Ford's global growth strategy,
providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid
profits and distributions. Ford Credit had another solid year with pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion and $368 million for the
fourth quarter. Net income for the year was $1.5 billion and $568 million in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter net
income reflects a reduction in our tax liability, primarily explained by favorable one-tax (sic) [one-time] (03:06) tax
items recorded in the quarter.
Managed receivables were $103 billion at the end of the year, up $11 billion from 2012 and slightly higher than prior
guidance. Full year charge-offs were $176 million, up $40 million from 2012. Fourth quarter charge-offs were $52
million, up $3 million from a year ago. The full-year loss-to-receivables ratio was 18 basis points, up two basis points
from a year ago and our second lowest full-year results on record, with 2012 being the lowest. The ratio was 20 basis
points for the fourth quarter.
At December 31, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $380 million or 37 basis points of receivables. Ford
Credit paid distributions of $445 million to our parent during 2013. Managed leverage was 8.5 to 1 at December 31
compared to 8.3 to 1 at December 31, 2012. At year end, our equity was $10.6 billion.
Slide two shows the $46 million decrease in fourth quarter pre-tax profit compared with a year ago. The decrease
primarily reflects unfavorable residual performance related to lower auction values and lower financing margin, both in
North America, as well as credit loss reserve changes. Higher volume was a partial offset. Ford Credit's higher volume,
primarily in North America, was driven by an increase in leasing, reflecting changes in Ford's marketing programs, as
well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher dealer stocks. As shown in the memo, our pre-tax profit
was $59 million lower than the third quarter.
Slide three provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit's full-year profit compared to 2012. The improvement
of $59 million is more than explained by higher volume, primarily in North America, driven by an increase in leasing,
reflecting changes in Ford's marketing programs, as well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher
dealer stocks. Partial offsets are higher credit losses due to lower credit loss reserve reductions in all geographic
segments and unfavorable residual performance related to lower-than-expected auction values in North America.
For full-year 2014, Ford Credit expects full-year pre-tax profit about equal to 2013. Profit from growth in receivables
should offset the continued normalization of credit losses, the continued run-off of higher-yielding assets and the
impact of Ford Credit's strategy to increase its percentage of unsecured debt, as we continue to build a stronger
investment-grade company. Managed receivables at year end to be about $110 billion. Managed leverage will continue
in the range of 8 to 1 to 9 to 1 and distributions to our parent of about $250 million.
For the next several slides, we'll be discussing annual key metrics as they relate to asset performance. The normal
quarterly data slides have been included for your reference in the Appendix. Slide four shows the annual credit loss
metrics for our worldwide portfolio for the past five years. Our charge-offs were up from our record low in 2012,
primarily reflecting higher severity and lower recoveries in the North America segment and higher losses in the
International segment. The loss-to-receivables ratio is up two basis points from 2012, and as I mentioned earlier, is our
second lowest on record.

Reserves and reserves as a percent of end of period receivables were both lower than a year ago, reflecting the
continuation of low charge-offs. Fourth quarter charge-offs, shown in the Appendix, were up slightly from fourth
quarter 2012 and third quarter 2013, primarily reflecting higher severity in North America.
Slide five shows the annual trends of our U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail and lease business, which comprises about 72%
of our worldwide consumer portfolio. The upper left box shows the stability of our average placement cycle reflecting
our commitment to maintaining consistent underwriting standards through all business cycles.
The rest of the metrics on the page give you a sense of how the portfolio is performing. Over 60-day delinquencies are
consistent with prior years. Our repossession ratio of 1.18% is our lowest on record. Severity of $7,600 in 2013 is up
$700 from 2012, primarily reflecting lower auction values and is consistent with the decline in the 2013 average
Manheim Index. Charge-offs and the loss-to-receivables ratio increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower
severity and lower recoveries. Fourth quarter charge-offs, shown on the Appendix, were up from fourth quarter 2012
and third quarter 2013, primarily reflecting higher severity.
Slide six shows the annual trends of the lease residual performance for our U.S. Ford and Lincoln brands over the past
five years. Lease return volumes in 2013 were up significantly from 2012, reflecting primarily the higher lease
placements in 2011 relative to prior years. Our 2013 lease return rate was 71%, up nine percentage points compared
with 2012, reflecting lower auction values.
In 2013, our auction values for both 24-month and 36-month vehicles declined, consistent with industry trends. Our
worldwide net investment in operating leases was $18.3 billion at the end of 2013, up from $13.6 billion in 2012. As
shown in the Appendix, fourth quarter of 2013 return volume increased from fourth quarter 2012 and third quarter
2013. Fourth quarter 2013 auction values were lower than the fourth quarter 2012, reflecting primarily the
non-recurrence of Hurricane Sandy's effect.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike.
Turning to slide seven, we will walk through our full-year 2013 funding highlights. With the upgrade from S&P in
September, we are now rated investment grade by four major rating agencies. In addition, all four have us on stable
outlook. This a key proof point of the continued progress of the One Ford plan.
In 2013, we issued $25 billion of public term funding, which included about $11 billion of unsecured debt. In the fourth
quarter, we issued $7 billion, of which $3 billion was unsecured. We also established a new two-year syndicated
committed asset-backed liquidity facility that together with growth and other private asset-backed capacity will replace
the FCAR asset-backed commercial paper program.
We ended the year with about $35 billion of committed capacity, and net liquidity was $21 billion. Our funding
strategy remained focused on diversification, and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and
investors. We remain focused on maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet.
Slide eight shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of 2013, managed receivables were
$103 billion, and we ended the year with about $11 billion in cash. Securitized funding was 44% of managed
receivables, down from about 47% at year-end 2012, reflecting a greater mix of unsecured debt. We are projecting
2014 yearend managed receivables at about $110 billion, and securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables
in the range of 38% to 42%. This percentage will continue to decline going forward.
Slide nine shows our final 2013 and projected 2014 public funding plans for Ford Credit, which excludes our
short-term funding programs. For 2014, we project full-year public term funding in the range of $21 billion to $27
billion, consisting of $9 billion to $12 billion of unsecured debt and $12 billion to $15 billion of public securitizations.

Over the past few years, we have been successful issuing increasing amounts of unsecured long-term debt. Therefore,
as our balance sheet grows, our funding needs will grow at a slower rate. So even though our assets are projected to
grow this year, the amount of our public term funding plan is flat compared to 2013.
Turning to slide 10, we highlight Ford Credit's 2013 yearend liquidity. Our liquidity remained strong at $21.4 billion,
down $1.2 billion from last quarter, reflecting growth in fourth quarter receivables, and up $1.7 billion from a year ago.
Ford Credit sources of liquidity include cash, unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines
and other asset-backed bank capacity. As of December 31, we had $45.3 billion of cash in committed liquidity sources,
up $1.7 billion from prior quarter. Utilization of our liquidity totaled $2.8 billion and we ended the quarter with gross
liquidity of $22.5 billion. Capacity in excess of eligible receivables was $1.1 billion.
As previously noted, we will transition away from our FCAR program in 2014. We ended the year with $3.3 billion of
FCAR commercial paper and our plan is to completely wind-down the program by second quarter 2014. Included in
our conduit and bank ABS sources is a new two-year syndicated committed facility to support asset-backed program.
We are focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet our funding and business requirements through economic
cycles.
Slide 11 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.7 billion, $100 million lower than the third
quarter. We ended the year with net cash of $9.1 billion, $900 million lower than a year ago and automotive liquidity
was $36.2 billion, $1.7 billion higher than a year ago.
Slide 12 provides an annual update on our global pension plans. Worldwide pension expanse in 2013, excluding special
items was $1.6 billion, $400 million higher than 2013. Special item charges were about $800 million, including about
$600 million associated with our U.S. salaried voluntary lump sum program, which is now concluded.
In 2013 we made $5 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, up $1.6 billion compared
with a year ago. In 2014, cash contributions to our funded plans are expected to be $1.5 billion globally, most of which
is mandatory. This is $3.5 billion lower than last year, reflecting our improved funded status. Worldwide, our pension
plans were under-funded by $9 billion at the end of 2013, about $6 billion of which is associated with our unfunded
plans. In total, this represents an improvement of nearly $10 billion compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher
discount rate and cash contributions.
Consistent with our de-risking strategy, we continue to increase the mix of fixed income assets with the objective of
reducing funded status volatility. The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at yearend of 2013 was 70%, up from 55% at
yearend 2012. Asset returns in 2013 for the U.S. plans were 3.7%, reflecting strong growth asset returns, offset partially
by fixed income losses as interest rates rose. For 2014, our expected long-term return assumption for the U.S. is 6.89%,
down about 50 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the higher mix of fixed income assets.
Now let's close with a summary of 2013. The company had a solid fourth quarter, achieving our 18th consecutive
profitable quarter. Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive and liquidity was strong. Among the business
units, North America delivered a strong profit, Asia-Pacific earned a record profit for the fourth quarter, South America
incurred a loss as expected and Europe reduced its loss compared with last year.
For the full year, the company's pre-tax operating profit was among the best in our history and automotive-related cash
flow was a record. These full-year results reflect an automotive sector operating profit that was the highest in more than
a decade with record profits in North America and Asia-Pacific Africa and about breakeven results in South America
and a lower loss in Europe than last year.
At year end, automotive gross cash was $24.8 billion and liquidity was $36.2 billion. Ford Credit had another solid year
with pre-tax profits of $1.8 billion and net income of $1.5 billion. Growth continues with managed receivables of $103
billion at year end, up $11 billion from 2012. The full-year loss-to-receivable ratio was 18 basis points, our second
lowest full-year result on record. We completed our 2013 funding plan, including $25 billion of public-term funding
and maintained a strong net liquidity position at Ford Credit of over $21 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it to Steve to begin the Q&A session.

Steve Dahle
Thank you, Neil. And with that, we'll conduct the question-and-answer session.
Matthew, may we please have the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Steve. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Doug Karson with Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great, guys. Thank you. Can you hear me all right?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yes.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yes. Good morning.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Good morning. So my first question relates to the operating cash flow. You may have kind of
gone over some of the detail, but I was hoping to get a little more color. In 2013, it was $6.1 billion and the outlook
calls for substantially lower. We know we have two elements, higher CapEx by about $1 billion and total company
profits may be lower by about $1 billion. We're trying to kind of foot what substantially lower means. Is there
something else in there in working capital or some other timing differences? We're just kind of trying to model out
2014 cash.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah, Doug. Stuart Rowley here, and thanks for the question. In terms of the year-to-year,
I'd point out to you that we described this year's outlook as substantially higher than last year, which was something
over $3 billion. Certainly, that provides you some texture. The lower profits as you point out, higher capital spending;
we've guided to about $7.5 billion this – 2013 was $6.6 billion. The other piece is that, particularly in the timing
differences which were strongly favorable in 2013, we would expect some of those to reverse in 2014, I think those are
the major elements.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great, that's helpful. And then I'll turn to a big picture question on Europe. I know you've
been – you had discussed in Europe and a turnaround for a year now, but as I look at slide 28, it talks about incoming
data in the economic setting with growth 1% up in Euro and 2% in the UK, and we try to foot to your mid-decade
breakeven target. I'm looking at different elements of how you'll get there, volume and mix and pricing versus costs. If
you were to direct this towards one area that will drive most of the improvement, because you're down about $1.6
billion I think in 2013, there's quite a lot to go; can you help us kind of think about how to frame that?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah, I think there's a number of pieces that will come in. The first piece is in the $1.6
billion that you referred to for 2013. There's about a $0.5 billion there of restructuring costs, similar to we'll have about
$400 million in 2014. Those costs won't be there in 2015. In addition, the end of 2014 we closed the Genk facility so
we'll sort of recognize the benefit of the lower cost as a result of that action as we get into 2015. The other piece then is
investment in products.
We've communicated the 25 products in Europe and a big element of those are the commercial vehicles and we
highlighted the improved commercial vehicle share in 2013, but we are now just launching our large transit and that's
built in our [ph] Ford-Autodan (21:14) joint venture, we're launching that in the early part of 2014. That's obviously a
very important part of our business in Europe. And then we're also launching a smaller commercial vehicle. And then
later in the year we'll be launching the Mondeo, which was going to be built at Genk, and now will be built in the
Valencia facility, and that's obviously also a very important passenger car for us that we delayed as a result of our
restructuring actions. So we have a positive impact from – that's just some of the products, but some important ones.

And then finally we do expect the industry to – the economies to recover, albeit at a slow pace, but that will also be
favorable to us. Finally, I'd say, although our stock changes in 2013 year to year were negative, we did still reduced
stocks in 2013 calendar year, and our stocks are very much where we want them to be now. So we won't continue to
experience negative effects of stock changes.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great. That was very helpful. I appreciate the walk-through. That's it for me.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby of Goldman Sachs. Please
proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Thanks, guys. Yeah. Just two questions. One, just regarding what was kind of talked about on
the earnings call and just some clarification on the F-Series launch. I mean is the read-through that you're obviously
going to try to build out some of the older outgoing model in conjunction with taking down one of the plants and
launching the new, I mean it sounds like you're saying that you feel like there will be some periods there where you're
going to overproduce a little bit in anticipation of the changeover and we may get some months in there of pretty high
inventory levels? Because I mean one of your cross-town rivals launched a truck a year ago, right? And they had some
months there where their inventories got pretty high. So I just want to clarify to make sure that I'm understanding that
correctly; that's the first question and then maybe I'll follow-up with the second.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. I think just to clarify, I mean you may see some month-to-month
variances on inventory that will depend about as and when we time the shutdowns to changeover. The point I'd make is
we are and will build every current model F-Series truck we can build. The only reasons we'll have any downtime in
our plants is to facilitate the changeover to the new truck. We have a very, we think, robust plan that we're very
satisfied with to manage the changeover and the team here in North America has done that on a number of occasions.
So because of the downtime for the changeover, you'll see inventories move around period-to-period and our
production of F-Series in 2014 will be lower than in 2013 because of the 13 weeks that we talked about in the call.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. Great. And then my second question was just around off-lease vehicles, and there just
continues to be more and more chatter in the various publications out there about how there's a slew of off-lease
vehicles coming and that it's going to have potentially negative ramifications for pricing just on new vehicles
potentially, and just wanted to get your thoughts on that. I mean you guys have covered a lot of this in the past and you
guys seem to have been very much on top of it, but maybe if you could just give us some color on how you're thinking
about that? And then I had a housekeeping question regarding you're talking about net interest expense about flat
year-over-year, but I'm just curious why that number doesn't say down slightly year-over-year given that you are going
to be reducing some DOE debt and along with the convert?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Okay. Brian, I'll take the first one. And as we've said before, as we're trying to set future
residual values, we're not counting on prices today. We've got models that are trying to take into account the growth in
the industry, what's happening with our brand and our expectation for what prices are going to be a couple of years out.
With that, we are seeing a little bit of growth in average amount financed consistent with the net pricing growth that we
have seen. But overall our outlook going forward is pretty benign assuming auction values continue to behave as they
are behaving.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. And I think on the – this is Neil. On the net interest being flat you are – the DOE pays
off about $150 million a quarter. That comes off at a very low interest rate relative to the rest of the portfolio. We don't
see a lot of debt changes of maturities in 2014. A lot of our maturities are in 2015. And also the convert which doesn't
really become – we could advance the forcing conversion in the end of November and so there isn't really much of a
full-year benefit associated with that.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Right. And then the cost on that, Neil, they said what, about $1.6 billion...?

<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. It varies depending on the market value of that which is what we would actually use to
settle if we chose cash, varies between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion depending on where the stock price is. And there
would be an averaging period on that event.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And you'll notice in one of the appendices to the earnings deck, that in our fully-diluted
earnings per share calculation, it's worth about 98 million shares. So once that were – if we were to use cash, it's
essentially a share buyback for 100 million shares.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Thanks.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Next call, please.
Operator
Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Eric Selle of
JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey. Good morning and Mike, I hope you feel better. And, Neil, I hope it's not contagious. I hope
it's not contagious through the phone, either. Anyways, looking at slide six, just dovetailing off of Jacoby's question,
have you changed any residual assumptions year-over-year to drive that spike in return rate? And then secondly, is that
rising return rate the reason why the auction values on the 24 months dropped year-over-year?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: No. There's a couple of things on that, Eric. Normally between the third and the fourth
quarter, and you can probably see it a little better in the Appendix, this is the year-over-year slide, you see a decline of,
call it, $800 to $1,000 normally. We didn't see that last year in either the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2013
because of the impacts of Hurricane Sandy. So as you're looking at that kind of 2012 number, that's a little inflated of
where it ended at the end of the year. So and when auction values are higher, generally people are going to keep their
vehicles because they will have equity in it. So now as you're getting back to a more normalized auction value
performance, you know as auction values decline, some people tend to turn them in. And as we've said before,
24-month customers tend to return their vehicles at a higher rate than 36-month.
So overall, the total industry for late model used vehicles saw about a, call it, 4.5% decline fourth quarter over third
quarter. We're about 5%. We don't see that as a trend. We think it's primarily related to Hurricane Sandy. You'll
probably see a similar type impact year-over-year in the first quarter, but overall for 2014, we're guiding that our
residual performance will be pretty benign year-over-year.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Okay. And then moving on to the regulators, we saw the CFPB levied a fine on Ally late last year.
Do you guys have any – I mean I know you guys don't go as deep as others, and it probably will keep you above the
fray, but I'm not looking for a number, just kind of any view on the liability; was my statement correct? And then do
you have any view on potential changes to dealer reserves, because I saw that Ally accepted the fine, but there was no
change to dealer reserves. Is this just going to be a witch hunt around the [ph] Fin cos (30:17) or do you think there is
actually going to be a change in the business and kind of how do you guys look at your potential liability?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: All right. Well, obviously, I am not going to comment on Ally. As we've said before, we're
committed to compliance. We've built this into our corporate culture and we'll continue to operate a sound responsible
business under any regulations that they come out with. Our goal is to focus on operating a strong financial service
business, drive sales, satisfaction, long-term relationships with customers and dealers. As it relates to compensation, we
have no plans to change our compensation policies at this time. However, one of the things we have done in line with
CFPB guidance is we have told dealers that we've begun regularly analyzing data on the retail contracts. So, we think
we're okay with the way we're proceeding and obviously we're going to comply with all laws.

<Q - Eric J. Selle>: I appreciate that. Moving over to the auto side, Neil, it looks like South America got a big boost in
pricing in the fourth quarter and I was wondering is that due to the global products coming down there and how much
of that are we going to see in this year that could help offset some of the FX problems?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah, it's Stuart here, Eric. I'll try to take that. Your observation is correct. We've seen
significant pricing in South America in the fourth quarter and actually also for the full year and that pricing is – it does
reflect pricing on the new global products, principally this year that was around the EcoSport, the new small SUV, but
importantly it also reflects pricing to recover devaluation effects of the currencies in South America and the related
high labor and material economics that we see in those markets. And actually the pricing has been significant, but not
sufficient to fully offset all of those effects and that's one of the reasons that we've seen deterioration in our overall
profitability this year in South America.
Going forward into 2014, we continue to deploy the product portfolio so we will – they are global One Ford products
that we're bringing to market, and we will be pricing in part to reflect that, but also again for the currency and
inflation-related effects, and that's really why we make some of our comments around uncertainty and in South
America you've seen the data just over the last number of days with accelerating levels of depreciation. So it's
somewhat uncertain and our teams there in South America are – they've been there before. They understand the
markets and will stay very close to it, but exactly how that will come out, it's hard to predict right now.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: I appreciate that and love the global product. I love seeing the impact of that. And then just finally,
just generally get a sense of the calendarization of the EU savings; when is Genk going to be closed? Is that aligned
with when most of the workers are gone? Just trying to get a sense of kind of how that flows through in 2014? Is that a
fourth quarter closing and we get all the labor savings thereafter? And then the restructuring then? I mean, just trying to
get timing on that.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes, Eric. It's at year end 2014. I mean there may be a small number of people that leave
ahead of that, but it's really an end year event.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Great. I really appreciate the color.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Thanks, Eric.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Thank you.
