Our performance gives us confidence that we're on track to deliver our full year guidance. In addition, consistent with
our expectation that 2014 will be a data-rich year, we have already reported significant data on evolocumab and TVEC
and expect Phase III data on four other programs in the remainder of the year.
Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call today. Bob will provide a brief review of our operational
progress followed by our interim CFO, Michael Kelly, who will review our Q1 results. Following Michael, our Head of
Global Commercial Operations, Tony Hooper, will discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that
we see going forward. Sean Harper, our Head of R&D, will then provide a brief update on the many late stage
opportunities that we have in our pipeline. After Sean's comments we should have plenty of time for Q&A.
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you
separately by email.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor Statement, which in summary says that through the course of
our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thank you, Arvind. With the first quarter of the year complete, we're confident that we're on track to deliver our
financial and operational targets for the year.
Revenues were up 7% for the quarter reflecting strong performance in Europe and the benefit of our international
expansion, including having acquired back from Roche our rights to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN in a number of
emerging markets.
In the U.S. while underlying demand for our products remains strong, sales were affected by inventory draw-downs
across the portfolio as Tony will describe shortly. We maintained discipline around our capital and operating expenses
in the quarter as reflected in our 18% growth in operating income and strong cash flows on the quarter.
Turning to our operational progress, we said in January that we expected 2014 to be a data-rich year for us, and that's
certainly what it has been so far. We're excited about evolocumab and the data we generated in our pivotal programs.
And we're moving rapidly now to file our regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe this year. With both once
monthly and twice monthly dosing options, we believe evolocumab will be an important advance for patients with high
levels of LDL cholesterol.
Onyx is performing well, and we're encouraged by the prospect of Kyprolis moving into earlier lines of therapy in
multiple myeloma as further data become available later this year.
We'll be presenting data on TVEC and blinatumomab at the upcoming ASCO meeting and expect to report on four
other Phase III programs during the course of the year.
In addition to our innovative portfolio our biosimilar portfolio continues to progress favorably with three of our six
programs in pivotal trials currently.
Heading into the balance of the year, we feel we're in strong position to continue investing in the long term growth of
our business, while returning capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividend payments.
Before turning to Michael Kelly to walk us through the financials, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their focus
on delivering for our shareholders and the patients we serve. Michael?

Thanks, Bob. Let me start by highlighting a few important points on our financial results.
The underlying operating performance of the company is tracking well against our plans for 2014, and accordingly our
revenue and EPS guidance remain intact. Our full ownership of Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada drove 18% operating
income growth, as we were able to keep operating expenses flat even after absorbing the operations of Onyx.
Turning to page 4 of the presentation, you will see revenues grew by 7% with 5% product sales growth and $78 million
of growth in other revenues, primarily due to our Nexavar and Stivarga partnerships. Revenues declined on a
quarter-over-quarter basis, which is consistent with our historical pattern for the first quarter. However the decline was
a bit exacerbated this year by the wholesaler and end user inventory dynamic at the end of 2013.
As I mentioned operating income grew 18% as operating expenses were flat year-over-year. Within operating expenses
cost of sales margin improved by 0.5 points to 15.7%, driven by lower royalties.
Research and development expenses increased by 17% year-over-year with roughly half of that growth driven by the
addition of Kyprolis and the balance due to other late-stage clinical programs.
SG&A expenses decreased by 14% driven by a significant reduction in Enbrel-related expenses. Other income and
expenses were $160 million in the quarter, unfavorable to the first quarter of 2013 due to realized gains on our cash
investment portfolio a year ago.
Despite 14% growth in pre-tax income, net income declined 4% and earnings per share declined 5% due to favorable
tax items in the year-ago period. Specifically you will recall that last year we recognized the full amount of the 2012
federal R&D credit and resolved Federal audits, which enabled us to release provisions we held against potential tax
liabilities. The tax rate in the first quarter this year was 15.4%, in line with our full-year tax rate guidance.
Finally, our share count increased 1% as we did not repurchase any shares over the last 12 months.
Now turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page 5. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the first
quarter of 2014, a year-over-year increase of 9% ahead of revenue growth. We also increased our quarterly dividend
per share by 30% with payments totaling $0.5 billion in the quarter.
At the end of the quarter we held $23.2 billion in cash, short term and restricted investments, up approximately $2
billion versus a year ago. And our debt balance was $32 billion, reflecting the financing of the Onyx acquisition and
our commitment to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating.
Lastly turning to page 6, we are reconfirming our revenue guidance of $19.2 billion to $19.6 billion for the year, and
our earnings guidance of $7.90 to $8.20 earnings per share. Our guidance on tax and capital expenditures remains
unchanged as well. On the tax rate let me remind you that our guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be
extended in 2014 and retroactively applied to the full year.
Let me now turn to Tony. Thank you.
Anthony C. Hooper
Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon, folks.
You'll find a summary of our global sales performance for the first quarter on slide number 7. Product sales grew 5%
year-over-year. Our international business grew 9% driven by strong performance in Europe and the acquisition of
filgrastim rights in several new and emerging markets.
In the U.S. our business grew 4% year-over-year. As Michael said, quarter-over-quarter global sales were down 9%, a
trend which is consistent with the first quarter of last year. This was driven predominantly by U.S. inventory
draw-downs in the first quarter, following wholesaler and end customer inventory builds in the fourth quarter of last
year. This affected nearly all products, but most notably Enbrel.

Total U.S. wholesaler values on hand declined from 15 days at the end of 2013 to 13 days at the end of this quarter.
Our underlying business however, as evidenced by the IMS in-market prescription demand data across our products
remains strong and in line with our expectations. As Bob mentioned, we are confident that we'll achieve our full-year
revenue guidance.
Let's review of our first quarter product performance beginning with Enbrel. As I said, sales were impacted by
wholesaler and end customer inventory builds at the end of 2013. The in-market IMS data shows underlying demand in
rheumatology continues to be strong, while we have seen a slight decline in the dermatology segment. Both of these
segments however, are growing at double digits. These demand trends for Enbrel have continued into second quarter.
With the extent of the exclusivity of Enbrel, and its established track record of long-term efficacy and safety, we will
continue to invest in growing this important brand.
Turning now to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. As a reminder, Neulasta represents over 75% of combined sales for these
two products. As I noted earlier, this quarter includes sales in several new and emerging markets where we acquired
commercialization rights effective January 1. This is a further step in our strategy to expand globally.
On a year-over-year basis, Neulasta increased 5%, while NEUPOGEN declined 3%. We have seen nominal impact
from recently launched, short-acting competition in the U.S. and long-acting competition in Europe. Nevertheless, we
have taken this competition seriously and are responding accordingly to maintain our leadership position across both
brands. NEUPOGEN and Neulasta have a long history of safe efficous (sic) [efficacy] (10:45) and reliable, high-quality
supply.
Moving on to Aranesp, Aranesp sales were down 2% year-over-year. Looking forward, we continue to expect pricing
pressure and competition in Europe. EPOGEN increased 6%. We continue to monitor hemoglobin levels and dose
utilization within the new bundled payment system.
Sensipar sales increased 2% year-over-year driven by higher unit demand from continued segment growth.
Next, Nplate and Vectibix. Sales in aggregate were higher by 18% year-over-year driven by strong unit demand. For
Vectibix we continued to gain share in both Europe and the U.S. In Europe, which represents over 50% of Vectibix
sales, we continue to highlight the recent addition of first line metastatic colorectal cancer to our label, and we're
excited about the opportunity to serve these patients.
Now a few comments on our denosumab franchise. Let me start with Prolia. Sales grew 38% year-over-year driven by
segment share gains in both the U.S. and Europe. We did see some seasonality that we've come to expect during the
first quarter. The second quarter is off to a good start, though. Our new direct to consumer campaign on television
launched in January this year, led to a significant increase in unaided awareness from 10% to 23%, as well as driving a
four-fold increase in traffic to the Prolia.com website.
As announced earlier this month, we've also ended our collaboration with GSK in Europe and selected markets. We are
in the process of transitioning all commercial activities. We believe this will better enable us to leverage our experience
by successfully launching Prolia in other parts of the world to drive greater growth in these markets. Further, it will
build experience and capacity in countries that will be important in accelerating future growth of our pipeline products.
XGEVA sales increased 25% year-on-year driven by strong unit demand growth in both the U.S. and European
markets. In the U.S. we continue to see share gains despite generic Zometa competition. Outside the U.S., sales grew
76% driven by the momentum of several successful launches in Europe during 2013. Our focus remains on highlighting
the superior clinical profile of XGEVA.
Let me now turn to our newest product, Kyprolis. Underlying demand trends remain consistent. Kyprolis continues to
be the therapy of choice in third-line multiple myeloma in the U.S. We expect the next major revenue inflection point
for Kyprolis will be when second line data is included in the label.
Lastly, the other products in the category which includes our businesses in Turkey and Brazil decreased 36%
year-over-year. This is a $250 million business with annual growth inclusive of negative foreign exchange impacts in
mid-single digits. They are contact or tender driven businesses, and therefore fluctuate quarter by quarter.

In conclusion, we feel very confident in the strength of our underlying business. With the first quarter inventory
draw-down behind us, we expect the second quarter to be in line with underlying demand. We remain confident that
we'll deliver on our full year revenue guidance.
Let me now pass you to Sean.
Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony. Good afternoon.
2014 is a data-rich year for us and we're off to an exciting start. The reception by cardiologists and lipid experts to our
pivotal Phase III evolocumab studies at the American College of Cardiology was remarkable. The data themselves,
coupled with the flexibility of every two week and monthly delivery options, were overwhelmingly viewed as positive.
In addition, positive results from our Phase II evolocumab study in Japanese patients were recently presented at the
Japan Circulation Society. We are working diligently on our 2014 evolocumab global filing packages, including the
U.S. submission.
Further within our cardiovascular portfolio the FDA recently granted fast track status to ivabradine in chronic heart
failure and we're on track to make this submission in Q2. Together these two innovative molecules, evolocumab in
dyslipidemia and ivabradine in chronic heart failure, represent very meaningful potential value to patients at
cardiovascular risk.
Turning to our oncology program, we continue to look forward to new Kyprolis data including a review by an
independent data monitoring committee of an interim analysis of the ASPIRE study in relapsed multiple myeloma
patients, and the final analysis of the FOCUS study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. In both of these
event-driven studies, making precise estimates of the timing of the analyses is quite challenging. Our best estimates are
that one or both of these analyses could occur in 2Q, although either of these analyses could instead occur in 3Q.
Our immuno-oncology programs continue to advance. In 2013 we reported that our Phase III TVEC study in metastatic
melanoma met its durable response rate primary endpoint. We recently announced that with a P value of 0.51, we
narrowly missed statistical significance on the secondary end point of overall survival. A pretty strong result, given that
the study was not statistically powered for survival. These data will be presented at ASCO and we are currently
reviewing the results with clinicians, regulators and payers to determine the best course forward.
In addition, we continue to believe that there's an opportunity for TVEC to prime the immune system with checkpoint
inhibitors. We are investigating TVEC in combination with ipilimumab or Yervoy in a Phase Ib/II metastatic
melanoma study. The Ib portion will be presented at ASCO this year.
We're moving forward with our collaborative efforts with Merck on PD1 antagonism, and exploring other such
collaborations.
We also recently reviewed the blinatumomab confirmatory Phase II results in relapsed refractory adult acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. These data, which will also be presented at ASCO, continue to support a positive benefit-risk
profile in these patients, who have exhausted other therapeutic options. We are therefore initiating discussions with
regulators on the potential for filing based on these data.
Our psoriasis program for brodalumab, which we're developing with our partners at AstraZeneca MedImmune, consists
of three Phase III studies, one placebo-controlled and two head-to-head studies comparing to ustekinumab or Stelara.
We expect to see the data from the placebo-controlled study in the second quarter, with the other two studies reading
out during the course of the year. We look forward to seeing in these programs what we hope will be not only
remarkable efficacy, but also of paramount importance in psoriasis, a strong safety profile. I'm also pleased to
announce that we've initiated our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis.

As you may recall, we've developed the only monoclonal antibody antagonist of the CGRP receptor in the clinic, AMG
334, which has demonstrated a potent ability to block this access in humans. We therefore moved directly into Phase
IIb dose ranging studies in the setting of migraine prophylaxis with what we feel is the most optimal modality of
receptor antagonism, using the monoclonal antibody. We expect to see the results of our episodic migraine Phase IIb
study by the end of this year and the results of our recently initiated chronic migraine Phase IIb dose ranging clinical
trial next year.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to thank my colleagues in R&D and many other parts of the company for helping to
make possible the data flow we're experiencing this year to help patients in need. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thank you, Sean. Marvin, why don't we open up the call to questions? And could you please remind our
listeners to the process for the Q&A?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Thanks very much for taking the question. At ACC it sounded like you guys weren't quite sure
if you would be able to file evolocumab in the U.S. this year, but now you're talking about global filings in 2014. So the
question is, what has changed? Is that based off of an FDA interaction? And how confident are you that you can get
that done this year? And once you have, now that you have the data, how do you think this product is going be used
ahead of outcomes data? What are the docs telling you? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Thanks, Matt. Those are good questions. Sean, why don't you – first one?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, I'll take the first part. Yeah. I think this is clearly an evolving situation, which we assess
on an ongoing basis. Our interactions with regulators as well as where the program stands with respect to the
accumulation of the weight of evidence required for a file. And all around I think at this point we have a good degree of
confidence in our ability to file this year, including in the United States. So that's why we're making that statement.
Tony, would you want to – from a medical perspective it's clear to me that there are individuals who have a high
cardiovascular risk residual despite the use of existing therapies, particularly statins, either because despite full-dose
intensive statin therapy, they still have a modifiable risk factor in elevated LDL, or they are unable to be subjected to an
intensive or even moderate intensity statin regimen.
And it's clear to me that those patients are viewed by the physicians that I talk to as patients who would be appropriate
for a therapy like evolocumab even prior to the availability of outcomes data. So from just a purely medical
doctor-to-doctor interaction, that's the sense I get. There's a real patient population out there in need.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: The only thing I would add to what Sean just said is that we have physicians talking about
patients in three buckets. Obviously the [ph] effects (21:53) patients are the unique sub-population. And then secondly
the high-risk patients, and the high-risk patients are those that either can't take the statin or can no longer tolerate the
statin, or those who are on the statin but not yet at the goal level.
So those continue to be the areas physicians see this drug will bring the greatest [indiscernible] (22:14) value, truly
again, all around high risk cardiovascular patients.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay. Let's go to the next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks. Just two quick ones for me. First on Enbrel. Tony, I wondering if you can
quantify the inventory impact in the quarter for us? And then on the PCSK9 outcomes trial, Sean, I was just wondering
if you can give us any sense of enrollment at this point? And then any insight on powering of the interim and final
analyses? Thank you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So let me take Enbrel first then. As you look at our data it's clear that our fourth quarter is
always slightly larger than the first quarter. And during the fourth quarter last year we did have some strange
snowstorms in the East Coast, which resulted in about $120 million of product that moved from one year to another.
When I look at the Enbrel data itself, and what I was looking at this morning that was the NRxs from IMS. And to me
the NRxs, which accounted for about 35% of total Rxs, are the true indicator of where the brand is going in the future.
On the rheumatology side NRxs grew quarter-on-quarter 14%. And on the dermatology side the NRxs grew 11%
quarter-on-quarter. So just to give you an idea of the brand's volume, large growing segment areas with Enbrel itself
getting new prescriptions as well. Sean?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah. We're quite pleased with the outcome study enrollment. The study is very adequately
powered to detect an effect size that would be clinically relevant to patients and to physicians. And this of course is a
product that we think has great potential. So we spared no expense in the design of the trial.
There is no interim analysis, formal interim analysis of an outcome study of this sort.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay. Let's move on.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the cost side, and you guys
had talked a little bit about this on the call. But it looks like quarter-over-quarter – I mean sorry year-over-year, you
were down about $160 million. And you had suggested Enbrel was about [ph] $800 million (24:50) for the year in
terms of savings. So there was a $40 million delta. I'm just wondering if that was all Onyx related expenses? And if we
should expect to see that amount of the Enbrel savings drop to the bottom line for the rest of the year? Thanks.
<A - Michael Anthony Kelly>: Thank you, Matthew. I think – yes you should assume that you would see sort of this
run rate of Enbrel drop to the bottom line offset by the Onyx expenses.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Thank you.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay. Let's go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Tony on the G-CSF business. I thought you pulled
in about $200 million from the Roche acquisition in terms of ex-U.S. sales. It didn't look like we recognized nearly as
much in Q1. Is that $200 million on an annual basis, $15 million on a quarterly basis? Is this a tender business also
that's quite lumpy going forward?

<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: The acquisition looked like it was about $200 million acquisition, obviously broken into
the quarters. The quarters tend to trend sort of about 25% each. I think the first quarter was slightly lighter than that
normal 25%, about 23%.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Okay. So that's offset by some share losses then?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Well, as I said, we have GRANIX entered the marketplace competing against
NEUPOGEN in the U.S. and we have long-acting competition in Europe. We haven't seen a huge impact from them
but of course there was a small impact, yes.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay. Let's take the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thanks for taking my question. So just trying to get – drill down a little bit more on
inventory versus what's going on with some of the products. So are you seeing any impact from generic NEUPOGEN
and are you seeing any impact from Otezla in the market on Enbrel?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Well, we'll try and take those two points. First, Tony on NEUPOGEN again if you
want to address.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So as I said, with NEUPOGEN, we have GRANIX on the market from Teva. They've
been on the market since late last year. We have seen a nominal impact from this product in the marketplace.
As regards Enbrel, we think all the excess inventory has now been worked out the system and as I said earlier, when I
look at the NRxs, those are showing double digit growth as we go from quarter-to-quarter.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: All right. Marvin, can we take the next question?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Hi. Thanks for the questions. Couple on the CGRP receptor antibody program for migraine.
First, do you have any data from the deCODE data set, what the phenotype is for patients with CGRP or CGRP
receptor mutations? And then second, who do you think is in the lead amongst the CGRP antibodies either receptor or
[indiscernible] (27:54)? How close to the lead are you if it's not you? Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, so there are not – the sort of the validation for this particular drug target is less from
human genetics and more from the work that's been done with the small molecule receptor antagonist. And now
reportedly by a couple of the ligand sequestering antibodies where we haven't seen detailed data but there's been
releases of positive results. So we kind of have a reverse pharmacology level of human validation of the target.
With respect to an antibody that blocks the receptor, we're clearly well in the lead. We have the only antibody blocking
receptor because they're very difficult to engineer.
In the case of just any antibody, I would say that I think we're in a very strong position right now to potentially make it
first to market of any of the antibodies, but that's a little hard to say when you're still in Phase II.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: We're excited about this program, Josh, and excited about the early data. But as was the
case with evolocumab, we want to just keep our head down and keep executing against the program. And it looks
exciting to us but the competitive profile here is not completely transparent. Let's take the next question.

The next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question. A question for Bob. Look, there's a lot
going on in pharma and sort of larger biotech and spec pharma for that matter these days in terms of asset swaps,
relocations of assets. And I'm just wondering, from the outside Amgen has two businesses, legacy products and growth
products, and with all of the restructuring going on, has Amgen considered any different structures or ownership of the
assets that might enhance shareholder value? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, Geoff. As you'd expect we continually review things that we can do to drive
shareholder value and that's absolutely what we're focused on. And we continue to believe that the strategy that we're
following is the one that will enable us to drive most value for our shareholders. And that obviously includes executing
against the innovative programs in our pipeline, and we've talked about a few high profile programs here on this call
already, continuing to advance our biosimilar programs, and we have six programs there that we think we're very
competitively positioned for that we've begun to launch in 2017 and of course international expansion we think is an
opportunity for further growth for us as well.
So we're focused on executing our strategy but we obviously pay close attention to what's going on in our industry. And
we'll continue to look for opportunities that may offer us a chance to drive incremental value for our shareholders.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Thanks for taking my question. It's actually a little bit of a question on Kyprolis and I'm just
trying to understand a little bit, what are you guys expecting from FOCUS and ASPIRE? I mean based on our analysis
ASPIRE may be unlikely to stop at the next look, but FOCUS has been taking quite a long time. So I'm trying to get a
sense, what should we read into your comments that you're not expecting much in terms of acceleration until label
expansion in second line? That's technically an ASPIRE program, not a FOCUS program.
And then just a follow-up question on oprozomib, you really buy into the same study, it's my understanding, as
Kyprolis and your thoughts about potential heart failure and also what are you guys seeing on the GI side
tolerability-wise for the new formulation? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: All right we may take these questions in two parts, Yaron. I think there's a piece of the
first question for Sean on the timetables on FOCUS and ASPIRE and then Tony you talk about moving into earlier
lines of patients and Sean why don't you take...
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, so I think it's always tempting when we see these event-driven studies take longer than
is expected through the original kind of estimates that are made to read into that, that there's something going on, that
the therapeutic is having a bigger effect than what's anticipated or what have you. And I've sort of learned through
experience that's not a wise thing to do generally, that whatever is going on with the kinetics of collecting lapsed events
that are necessary to do these studies which at this point we're talking about single digit number of events coming in per
month and it can be quite stochastic month to month in both the studies. This is fairly typical as these studies accrue up
to their final numbers. So I don't think it's wise to try to read anything scientifically into that around whether the agents
are having the desired effect or not in the trials.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Do you want to touch on oprozomib, Sean and then we'll have someone...

<A - Sean E. Harper>: On the oprozomib, yeah, I mean with oprozomib we're still in early stages and this product we
know can have GI toxicity at some doses and so we are developing the product with that in mind, working on
formulations, working on dose and schedule to try and make sure we can deliver the greatest therapeutic benefit
without having an intolerable GI safety profile. So that's kind of the name of the game with developing an oral version
of this class of drug.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: And then my comment about the next inflection has no hidden meaning at all. We've
always assumed that the ASPIRE data would give us the second line indication in the U.S. first which would be
followed by our launches outside the U.S. because we have to post registration negotiate pricing.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Let's go to the next question.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: My question. Number one, has the commercial performance of Kyprolis since the
acquisition of Onyx, has it met your expectations, exceeded your expectations, or come in below your expectations?
Number two, I'm sorry to beat this horse guys, I still don't understand – it's a late night over on the East Coast here. I
still don't understand what exactly happened with Enbrel in the quarter. You said NRxs are up, but is it your assertion
that total patient demand increased 1Q sequentially over the 4Q? Thank you very much.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Thanks, Mark. We'll get to both those questions. Tony, why don't you start with
Kyprolis?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Starting with Kyprolis, I think the Onyx team going through the transition and the
acquisition have done a superb job in maintaining focus and keeping the people's attention locked to the business. We
continue, as we speak now, to be the number one drug of choice for third line, which is exactly where the label is. Our
market share in this particular indication we estimate to be at least double that of our nearest competitor. In terms of our
ability to deliver value linked to the label, we've continued to deliver what we expected. We continue to believe in the
drug, that this particular class will be the backbone of the treatment of this disease, and we look forward to expanding
the label with the second line, and later perhaps the first line data.
Let me go back to Enbrel. Enbrel, as you know what happened was purely an additional buy-in. Because we're shipping
biologics, we want to make sure that the product will reach the customer within 48 hours. So therefore we're very
careful about when we ship product. The snow delayed some shipments. We held them back and there was an
additional demand from wholesalers, about $120 million that took place in the last week of 2013. The majority of that
was Enbrel.
When I look at the end market data to date, in fact, I see growth in both rheumatology and in the dermatology business.
To me, I look at the NRxs as being a predicator of how the business is growing. In this particular area, Enbrel NRxs at
about 35% of total TRxs. I do see a distinctive growth between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, although the
first quarter exactly looks smaller than the fourth quarter, I see a 14% growth in rheumatology and an 11% growth
quarter-on-quarter in dermatology.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sharing a lot of data with you there, Mark. Fundamentally we think the demand is intact
for Enbrel and the rest of the base business. Let's go to next question.

<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One for Tony on Kyprolis. Is there
anything on the demand side, either post the ASH meeting or the market share that you can talk about on a sequential
basis?
And then one for Sean also on Kyprolis, but does the slower event rate for FOCUS or ASPIRE, does that change your
assumption or make you think differently about the head-to-head study that's ongoing with VELCADE?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Geoff, thanks for the question. When we look at our best ability to read in-market demand,
we do see positive growth between the fourth quarter 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, yes. It's low single-digit
growth.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, and with respect to reading again anything through from the time it takes to accrue the
last of these events in these type of trials, it's very difficult for me to read anything through scientifically that would
project anything about the design or strategy of having the head-to-head studies to VELCADE. I think that those
remain kind of unrelated in my mind.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Sure.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Marvin?

Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Thanks. Just another question on Kyprolis. Maybe just a follow-up to Geoff's. What would
lead to you maybe reconsidering the size of the head-to-head studies versus VELCADE? Just what would you need to
see in the ASPIRE study or the FOCUS study to have you rethink the sizing or maybe trying to get the data set before
VELCADE ultimately goes generic?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: That's a tough question to answer, Ian. You're asking us to respond to a hypothetical. Sean,
I don't know whether you have anything you can add to help Ian there?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah. No I don't. I think it's relatively unlikely that we'll see anything from these two studies
that would change what we're doing in the head to head studies. And they're moving along right now at considerable
pace. And changing the designs would be potentially challenging to do at this point anyway. But I would doubt that the
results would warrant that.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Let's go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Yes, thanks. A question on FOCUS and ASPIRE. From an expectation standpoint both from
the Street and maybe from your expectations, do you believe that FOCUS is a higher risk study than ASPIRE? And if
FOCUS for some reason does not hit on survival, how confident are we that ASPIRE would still support a European
approval given it's a PFS endpoint? Could you walk through some of that thinking?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah. So I think probably with FOCUS, you're looking at Kyprolis mono-therapy against a
combination therapy of some older drugs that are not used as frequently these days but do represent kind of standard of
care in many of the European countries. And that is one picture.

The other picture is of course you're taking Kyprolis and you're adding it on top of Rev/Dex and comparing to Rev/Dex
alone.
So I suppose I would say that the ASPIRE study is the one that is most likely to have a positive result, because we
know what happens if you put VELCADE on top of Rev/Dex. You get a pretty reasonable additional clinical benefit.
So just from the scientific perspective that would be how I'd look at that.
Now we do believe that the ASPIRE study will stand alone in leading to an indication for the population that it studies.
It won't cover the later line type patients who would be the subject of FOCUS. But it will – we do believe that in
Europe it will stand alone. PFS is a very well-accepted surrogate endpoint in this particular type of a malignancy.

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Thanks for taking my question. You touched on this briefly but just to go back to the Prolia
ex-U.S. buyback from GSK. Was that deal mainly driven by the want and need to change the trajectory of that product?
Or to lay down operational bedrock? And if the operational bedrock comes in can you just remind us what of the ROW
infrastructure you've brought in or acquired recently?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yeah. Let me just take a crack at the high level, Ravi, and then Tony, you can speak to the
details behind Ravi's question.
Obviously our business has changed a lot, Ravi, since the time we formed that venture with Glaxo. We've been very
successful in expanding internationally over the past several years, including with the transactions that we referred to
on this call, buying back NEUPOGEN and Neulasta in a number of markets around the world from Roche.
So we have a presence now in regions of the world that we didn't previously. And we remain very excited about the
potential for Prolia. And so this was a good opportunity for us to take full control back of that product.
And we had designed the deal in such a way that we could exit the partnership if we felt it was in our interest to do that.
And I think both we and Glaxo felt that we had found a fair way to transition full ownership back to us.
But, Tony, why don't you talk a little bit about some of the specifics in the marketplace and why we're optimistic for
the growth potential of Prolia?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So there were a couple of things. One, the final label for Prolia was slightly different to
what it was envisaged when we first did the negotiation. So it was a slightly more focused target audience we call on at
the moment.
Number two, we have been very successful on our own in developing strong market share with this product. And
clearly working in a partnership is not as effective as doing it ourselves. So we truly believe that the clear focus by
ourselves will result in us calling on a defined target audience and have the ability to pick up and to grow this business
more effectively. Secondly, that would then result in us having a broader footprint in this particular area.
The filgrastim acquisition gave us rights in quite a large number of countries around the world, but predominantly
increased the size of our businesses in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America, Mexico, and Southeast Asia. Those
were the big ones. Okay?
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: That's very good. Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. First of all I guess Tony mentioned that the
inventory for this quarter went down from 15 days from last quarter to 13 days. Do you guys see that stabilizing at this
level or you continue to see a declining level for inventory for wholesalers?
Then secondly, maybe for Sean, so you mentioned that we can't just take the point that Kyprolis is outperforming
expectations given that the timeline has been delayed twice already. So just confirm your view on this. Does that mean
also that comparator arm, which is Rev/Dex, is also doing better than the expectation when the trial was designed?
Thank you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So let me take that inventory question first. When we look at the average days on hand for
2013, they really fall around 13 days. So we don't think the 13 days is going be changing much as we go forward. That
should be our average days as we expect them.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, yeah, and again with the situation with these trials, again, when we make these – these
are event-driven studies and always when we make these estimates of when we expect the events to accrue, there's
pretty big confidence intervals around that. Then as you get closer, they narrow. But then as you get toward the end, it
becomes really again very stochastic, so you might have in one month you'll have nine events. The next month you'll
have two. Then you have seven. Then you have one. It's that kind of thing where drawing a projection from that data is
very difficult.
I don't think there's – what I've learned over the years, 20 years of doing this is you can speculate a lot when you're
blinded to this kind of thing and say well this could be happening because the treatment effect of the drug is bigger or
the control arm's doing better or the baseline population that was enrolled is just sicker or less sick than you expect. But
you actually have no way of figuring out that based on a blinded situation that we're in. And I think it's just – you just
have to wait to get the data.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: It's frustrating I know but you just have to wait and look at the data once we get it.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thank you. So based on what we hear from docs, the average baseline LDL levels in the
outcomes study for PCSK9 inhibitor, that could be lower than 100-milligram per deciliter. So question is, are there
ultra-low LDL levels where no further CV benefits can be gained?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Well, so first of all, I don't know where that information comes from because it's difficult for
anybody to know what the average LDL level is that's accruing in these trials by running individual study centers and
investigators may have their own individual experiences. But in general, what you want to be doing here is targeting
people who are still well above the range of the sort of 70 or below that are still the target, that people are looking for
even the new guidelines that are not supposed to be target-based mentioned repeatedly 70. And the reason for 70 is
largely because when you get below 70 you start seeing the reversal of atherosclerosis rather than just holding its
progression.
So the question of whether, I mean, certainly in absolute terms, as you begin to go lower and lower in LDL, the
absolute amount of benefit that you'd expect to gain with statin, for example, does go down. But in percentage terms,
it's been maintained as far as it's been possible to push LDL. And in large outcome studies with intensive statin therapy,

there is, as you might imagine, a big bell curve of response in terms of LDL lowering. And the low end of that bell
curve, the tail of that bell curve, those individuals get pushed down quite low in terms of LDL. And those individuals
appear first to have, to the extent that you can make these assessments in a subgroup like that, they appear to have the
same degree of benefit and they appear not to suffer any adverse effects.
Certainly the genetic data all suggests strongly in humans that there would not be a breakdown of this relationship
between LDL and outcomes. Or that the safety would be problematic because it's clear humans can have very low LDL
levels and be just fine. Most of us are born, you know, just to remind you, with LDL levels in the 20s and they climb
over time with diet and so on. So I think we're exploring new frontiers here being able to push LDL levels down to and
test whether the lower-is-better hypothesis continues to be true as you get into uncharted water. My prediction is that it
will but we have to generate the data to see.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks. Just a question on XGEVA. You guys mentioned in your prepared remarks that
you're still seeing generic Zometa sort of impact. I think it's been over a year I think now since the first generic Zometa
launched and at least as far as I understand it, the impact is most acute in the first two full quarters of that availability,
which I would have thought might have washed out. Can you maybe sort of talk about what other impact you're seeing
here?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Chris, it's Tony. So in the U.S. we saw market share in units grow from about 42% to 43%
quarter-on-quarter and we saw the dollar value market share growth from 70% to 76% quarter-on-quarter. Zometa went
generic in about March last year, and when you think about the ASP plus 6 reporting situation, it's calculated on a
rolling 12-month reported two quarters in arrears. So by definition your ASP impact is anywhere between 12 to 18
months.

<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi. Thanks. Sorry if you might have already mentioned this but what's the total inventory draw
down for the quarter and then when might you start or restart the share repurchase?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay. Why don't we take that into two parts, Joel? Tony has talked about inventory but
let's go back through it for you.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Let me remind you again that historically our fourth quarter has always been slightly
higher than the first quarter. What we did see in 2013 at the end was a strange week at the end with about $120 million
of additional buying by both wholesalers and end user customers. We think all of this has worked through the system
during quarter one and we enter quarter two without any excess inventory.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And, Joel, with respect to buy-backs, we're not expecting any major activity this year. But
again cash flow growth was attractive in the first quarter and we'll continue to look for ways to return that to our
shareholders as appropriate through a mix of dividend growth and buy-backs.

Operator
The first question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. A couple questions for Sean. First is on your thoughts about filing for
TVEC given the OS data. I know you're still talking to regulators but your thoughts on that would be great.
Second, blinatumomab do you already have all the data to potentially file? I know you're presenting it at ASCO. Would
that be registrational data?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yeah, so TVEC we really are fresh with the data and I think that there's little question that we
could file. The question we have to understand more about the product in its current form, with the formulation and the
data that we have in hand from a single study in monotherapy with physicians, regulators, payers, and figure out what
the best way to proceed is. We have a lot of sense of value to this product over time as an important potentially kind of
cornerstone therapy in immunotherapy. So we want to make sure that we proceed in the best way possible for this, from
a long-term view sense.
With blinatumomab, we clearly feel at this point that the data set that we've generated is worthy of consideration for the
filing data we have in hand for filing and approval. And that's the discussion we're beginning to have with regulators is
around the data set that we actually have in hand. Now, that said, we're always accumulating more data. As you might
recall we actually started a randomized controlled Phase III study in the same population and that will be accruing and
we have pediatric programs et cetera, et cetera. So all of those data continue to accrue and all of that information would
be submitted in the filing whenever we determine the data cutoff date.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Let's take our final question, Marvin.

Final question comes from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Boris Peaker>: Thank you for squeezing me in. Just have a question on the G-CSF franchise. Specifically, how
are the competitors in the U.S. and Europe positioning themselves in the market? And what do you see their strategy
for gaining share in the future over the next few years, and do you see them talking or you're aware of them talking to
insurance companies, or is that coming back to you in some way in any kind of discussion? What's the general thoughts
on that market intelligence.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: It's tough for me to comment on the competitive strategy, Boris. Probably be better to talk
to them. But obviously, as you know, in the U.S., GRANIX is not a biosimilar. It has a very different label to our
product, and their positioning has been around a different product, a different price. In Europe they have the same
situation. They are having to lean upon the label, which is different than ours, and in both cases the Amgen label is
broader. The Amgen label has many more years of experience, much more data around both efficacy and safety, and
we have an incredible track record of delivering quality product on time every time.
<Q - Boris Peaker>: And have you adjusted your marketing message to some extent to counter detail to GRANIX?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: No. We still talk about the fact that we have the longest level of data available. We have
the highest quality product available.
