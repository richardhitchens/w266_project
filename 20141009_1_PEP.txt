release and to the Investors section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab.
As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our third quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended September 6 for
our North American operations and the months of June, July and August for most of our operations outside of North
America. As you saw in the release, we're no longer reporting PepsiCo Americas Foods as a business unit consistent
with our prior practice, we continue to report results for the divisions that had comprised PAF namely Frito-Lay North
America, Quaker Foods North America and Latin America Foods. This change does not have any impact on the overall
results of PepsiCo or these divisions. Also reflected in our Q3 2014 core earnings results are aggregate gains associated
with the divestitures of approximately $34 million and a $23 million impairment of a brand in Greece.
Now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone.
We are pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date, particularly given the continued macro challenges we
see across the globe. Specifically in developed markets, the consumer category demand continues to be sluggish. And
in developing and emerging markets there's continued macro and political volatility, most notably in Eastern Europe,
the Middle East, and a number of markets in Latin America.
In other key emerging markets, China, India, and Brazil, even though the political environments are relatively stable,
GDP and consumer spending growth remains mixed. Despite these challenges, our businesses performed well in the
third quarter and year to date.
Global volume grew in both snacks and beverages in the quarter and year to date. Organic net revenue grew at a rate
ahead of volume in the quarter and year to date, reflecting execution of effective revenue management strategies and
successful introduction of innovative new products.
In the quarter, organic revenue grew 3.1%, with developing and emerging markets up high single digits, led by key
contributions from the BRIC markets. And notably, our developing and emerging markets business has proven to be
resilient, with high single-digit organic revenue growth year to date, including double digit growth in Egypt and India,
high single-digit growth in China, Brazil, and Turkey, and mid-single-digit growth in Russia.
In North America, Frito-Lay led performance with 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter and year to date. And core
gross and operating margins both expanded by 45 basis points in the quarter, aided by the benefits of our global
productivity initiatives. Year to date, core gross margin expanded 50 basis points and core operating margin expanded
35 basis points.
Overall, core constant currency EPS grew 11% in the quarter, driven by the solid operating performance supplemented
by responsible financial management. Importantly, these results have translated to strong cash generation and,
consequently, strong cash returns to shareholders.
Returning capital to shareholders is a top priority, and we're pleased to report that year to date we have returned $6
billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we remain on track to return a total of $8.7
billion to shareholders in 2014, which is a 35% increase over our 2013 shareholder cash returns.
Based on the strength of our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we raised our full-year core
constant currency EPS growth target to 9% from 8% previously.
We believe our year-to-date performance is a good reflection of the strength of our business. In today's difficult
environment, retailers value the benefits of partners with strong brands and high velocity products that drive traffic,
build basket size, and generate attractive cash flow. And that's exactly why our retail partners like to do business with
PepsiCo.

And as a company, we continue to strengthen our business to position it for continued successful performance well into
the future. And we are encouraged by the progress we're making in three areas in particular: first, leveraging our
complementary product portfolio and global scale; second, product and packaging innovation; and third, productivity.
So let me give you a quick update on each of these areas and share some of the tangible evidence we're seeing as proof
of our progress, starting with how we are increasingly leveraging the complementary nature of our products and brands.
A case in point is Mountain Dew and Doritos. Dew and Doritos have extremely high co-purchase incidence. In the
U.S., over 60% of Mountain Dew households buy Doritos. Both brands are deeply rooted in gaming, with legacies of
high engagement partnerships and activations around Blockbuster video games.
So in the U.S. this fall, Dew and Doritos are giving consumers access to Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. They're
going to give them exclusive in-game gear, Double XP and Rapid Supply Rewards. And all of this is to dial up their
gaming experience. Only Mountain Dew and Doritos consumers will be able to unlock these coveted advantages and
customize their gaming experience through the Fuel Up for Battle promotion. A number of our largest customers will
run Better Together programs linked to this promotion, and we are concurrently reintroducing on a limited time basis a
true gamer favorite, Mountain Dew Game Fuel in original citrus cherry and a new lemonade flavor.
Across many of our international markets, we're focused on driving greater co-purchase incidence of Lay's and Pepsi
with joint packaging graphics, sports properties, point-of-sale material, ad copy and promotions.
These cross branding activations are now taking place in many of our key markets across the globe. For example, in
Poland we created excitement for the Lay's brand by hiding coupons for 100,000 free Pepsis and bags, the promotion
was supported by ads and point-of-sale material featuring the soccer great Lionel Messi. Similarly in Columbia, we ran
joint Lay's, Pepsi and Tropicana Quaker soccer team's promotion offering discounts and prizes for joint purchases in
the organized trades. And across the Middle East we had great success by joint Lay's, Pepsi promotions during the
Ramadan season.
In addition to the commercial benefits afforded by these cross category promotions, we continue to yield cost synergies
through continued integration; for example, integrating our snack and beverage media sourcing in China, fully
consolidating and integrating our administrative functions under one roof in Russia, and consolidating common carriers
for snacks and beverages in the more rural regions of India. So that's the Better Together story.
The second area is product and package innovation. We continue to make very good progress. As evidenced, on a
rolling four quarter basis, our innovation as a percentage of sales is steadily increasing and is up 90 basis points versus
the comparable year ago period. And in our biggest market, United States, we were the largest contributor to retail sales
food and beverage growth both in third quarter and year to date which really benefited from the strength of our
innovation.
And we're seeing innovation success across brands and geographies. For example, at Frito-Lay North America, we
launched our 2014 Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign and this followed its past success in the U.S. and 12 other markets
around the globe. This year's consumer submitted finalists are Cappuccino, Cheddar Bacon Mac & Cheese, Mango
Salsa and Wasabi Ginger hard-bite. This program helped drive strong mid-single digit Lay's net revenue growth in the
third quarter.
At Quaker Foods North America, we've launched Quaker Express Cups to capitalize the ever-growing demand for
greater on-the-go convenience. And Quaker warm and crunchy granola which delivers both the wholesome goodness of
Quaker oatmeal and the satisfying crunch of multigrain granola. So while center of the store category growth remains
challenged, the success of these and other new products launched by Quaker have contributed to value share gains in
each of Quaker's key categories. Hot cereal, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bars both in the quarter and year to date.
Our North American beverage business has strong innovation in both product and packaging. Over the past several
years, we have significantly increased the variety of primary and secondary package configurations. With greater
packaging flexibility, we now have more tools in our kit to drive price realization and higher-margins through
price/pack management. The case in point is our 12 ounce glass bottle which sells at more than 100% premium to the
12 ounce can.

And our innovation is becoming increasingly more durable. For example, a number of 2012 and 2013 introductions,
Tostitos Cantina, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Lipton Pure Leaf have all achieved more than $100 million in retail sales in
the launch year and have generated double digit retail sales growth in their second year.
Our beverage product and packaging innovation in the U.S. has led to improved sales, improved price realization and
improved market share performance.
We held LRB value share in measured channels for the third quarter and year to date. Held CSDs at retail in the third
quarter led by Mountain Dew. And gained or held value share in a number of important subcategories including CSD,
sports drinks, ready to drink tea and unflavored water.
And in our international markets we're both leveraging our global scale and capitalizing on local insights to fuel
innovation. For example, within snacks, since its initial U.S. introduction in 2012, Doritos Jacked was launched in 10
international markets. We also lifted and shifted a larger and thicker cut chip with deep ridges which originated from
our ruffles brand and launched it into several key countries such as Russia, Brazil, the Middle East and India under the
Lay's Max brand. And in the UK, we launched a new range of premium potato tortilla and pita chips under the Market
Deli brand. The Market Deli brand really caters to local taste preferences with flavors such as balsamic vinegar of
Modena and Wiltshire cured ham. Mature cheddar and farmhouse chutney.
Within beverages, the SPIRE family of digital fountain dispensers continues to build momentum. Currently SPIRE is in
the United States, Canada, France, Turkey, Ireland and Switzerland. The equipment capabilities range from pouring
eight brands in four flavor shots to a maximum of 16 brands and eight flavor shots resulting in over 1,000 flavor
combinations.
And the global expansion of our highly successful Mountain Dew franchise continues. The brand was expanded to two
new markets in 2014 and is now available in over 40 countries around the world. And we've built terrific brand
recognition with a continued expansion of our DEWmocracy and Dew Tour support program.
And finally, turning to productivity,. We achieved our targeted productivity savings for the third quarter and year to
date and we're on track to achieve our full-year target of $1 million in savings. This year, we expect to successfully
complete the three-year $3 billion productivity program we launched in 2012. And we're now focused on our
next-generation five-year $5 billion productivity program announced earlier this year which we expect will extend
annual savings of $1 billion through 2019.
Our next generation of productivity will focus on four areas. First, embedding more automation in our operations to
replace labor with capital. At the same time, removing bottlenecks from operations which will increase capacity
utilization.
Second, expanding shared services including global financial shared services with the handling of routine back-office
transaction processing. Third, restructuring manufacturing to optimize our global manufacturing footprint and fourth,
restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network.
As a result of these initiatives, we expect to see continued improvement in net revenue and core earnings before interest
and taxes per employee as well as margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital.
So to conclude, we feel pretty good about our results for the quarter and year to date. We remain focused on generating
cash and providing attractive cash returns to our shareholders. And we're encouraged by the continued progress we've
made to strengthen our business which we expect will make our performance all the more durable and reliable looking
to the future.
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?

Great. Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and our
upwardly revised core constant currency earnings-per-share outlook for 2014.
For Q3, organic revenue grew 3%, on a reported basis net revenue was 2% versus year ago reflecting one point of
unfavorable foreign exchange translation.
Commodity costs had low single digit inflation. Our core gross margin and core operating margin each rose 45 basis
points. Core constant currency operating profit grew 5.5%. Our core effective tax rate was 24.2%. Our diluted share
count declined 2% reflecting the benefits of our ongoing share repurchase program. And core constant currency EPS
grew 11%.
On a rolling four quarter basis, our net capital spending is 4.1% of sales which is well within our long-term target of
less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. And our core net return on invested capital improved by approximately 40
basis points and now stands at 16.9%.
And we returned $6 billion to shareholders in the first three quarters in the form of dividends and share repurchases
which is almost 30% above year ago levels and reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
Turning to guidance, as Indra mentioned, we have increased our full-year core constant currency EPS growth target to
9%, up from 8% previously. In addition, for the full-year we expect mid-single digit organic revenue growth, low
single digit commodity inflation and productivity savings of approximately $1 billion.
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiencies, driven by productivity initiatives, a core
effective tax rate of approximately 25%, and a reduced share count from our share repurchase program.
Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue by three percentage points and core earnings per share
by four percentage points for the full year 2014 based on current market consensus rates.
Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37 and applying our guidance implies a 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.57.
As you model out the fourth quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. We expect advertising and marketing
expense to grow at a rate ahead of net revenue growth. And below the operating profit line, net interest expense is
expected to increase in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect full-year free cash flow excluding certain items of more than $7
billion. We'll continue to drive cash flow through efficient working capital management and continued tight controls
over capital spending. Net capital spending is expected to be approximately $3 billion, which is well within our
long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue. And we expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to
shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013, through $3.7 billion in dividends and $5 billion in share repurchases.
So to summarize, we've increased our core constant currency EPS growth outlook for the full year 2014 to 9% from 8%
previously. We expect to drive improved full-year margins and net ROIC. And disciplined capital allocation and
returning cash to shareholders remain top priorities for the company.
With that, operator, we'll take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: A question just about the balance between reinvestment in the business and the focus on
productivity and dropping it to the bottom line. If you look at this quarter's results, the results over the course of the
year, and really beginning last year, it's been a pretty good balance of maintaining a good relative organic sales growth
relative to a lot of your competitors and peers with also driving some margin improvement.
And I guess as you move into this next productivity program and also just some of the challenges you're facing in some
key markets, developing markets at least in the next year, macro challenges, can you just give us a sense for how you
feel about that current balance of investment in A&M, in R&D, in selling effectiveness or selling systems versus
dropping some of that to the bottom line? Do you feel like you have the right balance? And especially as things maybe
get a little bit more challenging in some of these markets, do you feel like you might have to tweak that balance into
next year?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Bryan, it's a great question. And at this point I'd say we feel good about the balance. We
increased A&M spending. We're running at about 5.9% of sales. We increased R&D spending significantly over the
past three to four years because we really believe that investing in R&D in particular is critical to the future success of
the company, and we invested in that. We invested in foodservice equipment. That's why the SPIRE equipment has
come out and is very successful today. So at this point, we feel good about the investments we are making in product
line transformation, media spending, advertising spending against our brands, and most importantly, long-term
investment in R&D platforms.
I agree with you that there is volatility in the world. And as we model out 2015 and beyond, we'll come back and talk
about what the outlook is for the financials. But at this point, we feel comfortable with what we've articulated in terms
of a long-term algorithm for the company, and we feel comfortable about our productivity programs. So I think we
have to watch and wait.

Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on...
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Good morning, Indra. I wanted to follow-up on some of the comments about raw materials,
but also start off with pricing in the context which is you're getting a lot of pricing in Latin America which is helping
the organic revenue number. And I guess can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a real pricing
standpoint in Latin America not just related to the FX? And then as you look out over the next 12 months to 18 months
on raw materials, have you – we've seen some favorable movements in things like corn, are you guys still continuing
that process of trying to capture some of that benefit through the hedging, can you talk about how we should look at
that going forward? Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Go ahead, Hugh.
.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yes, happy to. Hey, John; it's Hugh. In terms of the Latin American numbers, we are
obviously, as is everyone else in this space, benefiting from the relatively high overall inflationary environment there.
What I can tell you is we are getting positive real pricing there and it is in line with what you would see the
commodities basket cost growing in those markets. So if you look at it more from a global perspective and think about
commodities inflation from a global perspective, we're getting pricing in line with that on a more real basis.
Regarding your broader question on commodities, without a doubt the commodities numbers overall are coming down.
The couple facts I would remind you on that, number one, we have a very, very broad basket, not one commodity
accounts for even 10% of our overall commodities basket. Number two, we do continue to follow the forward buying
strategy that we've had the past, so we tend to be about six months to nine months out. So as those prices come down,

we will tend to see them reflected in our basket over time. We do that again because we want to give the businesses and
our customers pricing predictability and it's been an effective strategy for us over the last few years.
And number three, people tend to focus on a few market traded commodities. Those market traded commodities
represent somewhere between 30% or 40% of our overall basket, so I'm not sure often times that the market focused
commodities give a full picture of it.
In terms of 2015, as has been our practice in the past, we'll comment on that in February timeframe because we think
that's the right time to give guidance to investors overall and we won't try to parse out the pieces right now because it
tends to create more confusion then benefit.

Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So your organic sales growth was about 3% which translated to core constant currency operating
profit of about 5.5% and EPS growth of about 11%. And if you look the gaps between top line operating profit and EPS
growth rates seems to be widening more and more as the quarters progress here. So can you please give us a
quantification of, first, how much of the operating profit to sales gap was negative commodities and negative mix
versus cost-cutting positive and acquisition divestitures positive which for some reason you guys keep considering
core.
And second, how sustainable is the operating profit to EPS growth gap driven by lower net interest expense even
though there's a little bit higher debt it looks like, but lower net interest expense and buybacks. And the spirit of the
question is to understand sustainability of these gaps. Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Thanks, Ali. I'm going to have Hugh walk you through the details and I presume the first thing
you're saying is it's good that PepsiCo is delivering good results. So with that, let me turn it to you, Hugh.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, absolutely, Indra. So if you look over the last three quarters, we've seen operating
profit growth on a core constant currency basis of 7%, 3% and 5.5%. We've seen EPS growth of 10%, 3% and 11%. So
I think that gap has been actually relatively constant over the course of the timeframe. What are the drivers between
operating profit growth and EPS? You really have three things going on. Interest costs, without a doubt, we're getting
some leverage on that. The only thing that I'd want to share on that front is we're operating right now in a zero net
floating debt environment. We do have some floating debt, but that is offset by floating cash held outside the U.S. So I
think from the standpoint of rising interest rates, we're relatively well protected compared to most of our peer
companies in that regard. Obviously, like everyone else, we would have some refinancing over time, but I think we've
adopted a relatively conservative posture on the way that we're managing fixed float within the balance sheet.
Number two, taxes. Taxes are really coming in for the year right as we expected and that's been a bit of a benefit for
this year. And then number three, our share repurchase is obviously lowering the share count and that's driving some of
the gap from operating profit to EPS. We won't talk about 2015 right now, but obviously as a company we have a long
history of share repurchase and I would certainly expect we would continue that going forward.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And in terms of sustainability, Hugh, our long-term guidance has been mid-single digit
operating profit and high single-digit EPS.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: That's correct.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And that's really the envelope in which we're operating.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Absolutely.

Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, good morning, guys. So Frito-Lay organic revenue growth improved a bit
sequentially in the quarter, but the 3% result is still below the 4% to 5% levels we were seeing over the prior
year-and-a-half before Q2's result. Do you think this level is more like a new normal here in your mind, given the
difficult consumer environment? Or do you think you can accelerate that business going forward? And can you discuss
Frito-Lay market share performance in North America? It looks like you're still losing slight share in tracked channels
and your expectations going forward from a market share standpoint?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Dara, I think overall in Q3, food industry sales in retail was challenging. And within that,
Frito-Lay performed well, in fact, was the best performer in that group. And sequentially from the first quarter of the
year to the third quarter, the share loss has narrowed. Now, let me be clear: the share loss is really to premium players
who don't last for long time in the market. People come in and out of the market. And Frito has to be very careful not to
react to players who are not long-term players in the marketplace. So Frito has been playing a very, very responsible
game.
What we've been trying to do at Frito is to say, let's make the core very solid. Deliver on the core and start expanding
the shoulders of the business in a profitable way. And I think Frito in this very difficult environment has done a very
good job balancing pound growth, revenue growth and profit growth. And that's why you've seen relatively steady
performance from Frito in what I would consider as a very challenging overall retail environment for all kinds of food.
I mean, center of the store was particularly challenged, but I'd say overall food industry sales are challenged, but Frito
has been a shining star.
So I think overall, whether this is a new normal or not, I don't know. It really depends on the overall environment. But
within this environment, Frito has been performing quite well and the share losses have been coming down. We don't
like any share losses, I'll be honest with you, but we have to make sure the business behaves very responsibly and that's
what they've been doing.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: And in terms of addressing those premium innovation opportunities, we've been building
more capability. You see products like Stacy's Pretzel Crisps. You see products like Smartfood Selects, all of which are
entering that premium space and to-date we've been quite successful with them. So we'd certainly expect to see that
aspect improving over time.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: The first one is like a curiosity question because currencies obviously moved a ton over the last
couple of months, but you kept your currency outlook on the EPS line, so I'm just trying to figure out if it was
conservative before and now it's more realistic, or how you kept that currency guidance?
And then the second question is just – and maybe it's a tough one to answer, but do you guys have a view on some of
these contemplated consumption taxes in California? They sound pretty significant. Some of them are a couple cents an
ounce. And it looks like there's a decent probability they're going to go through, so how you kind of operate the
business in that kind of environment.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I'll speak to the second point and then Hugh will speak to the first one. I believe just inventory
taxes on certain categories are just wrong. I think we have to understand what the issue is. We're trying to address it
and address it in a holistic way. We will make our case and hope that the voters are sensible enough to look at the right
answer to address whatever issue they're addressing. With that, let me turn it over to Hugh.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yes, Bill. I'm happy to answer the currency question. We take a basket of market currency
rates and we follow the same methodology every quarter. And we've been consistent in taking that approach for quite a
number of years. So I don't think we'll change that approach. You're right; in the last couple of quarters it's come in a
little bit lighter than the original forecast, but it's the best way I know of to do it.
In addition to that, as you all likely know, we do hedge some transactional effects of foreign exchange. We do not
hedge translation. We don't think that's a good use of investors' money, so we don't hedge accounting at all. We just
take the market consensus rates. And then as the currencies flow, we report them to you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schwartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Thanks. Good morning, Indra.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Good morning, Hugh. A question on the – it's also a curiosity question. But with the core
earnings, you're including gains, and they're not large this quarter. But can you just speak to the principle behind
including these gains on asset sales?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Why don't I handle that one, Mark? You're right; in the overall scheme of things, there are
three items. There is a small gain in the Quaker business related to the sale of a small cereal brand. There is a small
gain from a bottling perspective in EMEA. And then there is the write-down of a small brand in Greece from an asset
impairment perspective. If you net all of those three factors, the grand total was a benefit to earnings of $11 million, so
basically less than $0.01 of impact overall. More broadly, we do have a consistent set of principles we apply in terms of
what is core versus non-core. In the overall scheme of things, it really is not a substantive impact to earnings.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: But what's the principle behind having them in there because again it's not large in the
quarter, but it could become something we're all talking about because of the principle being there if it is a large gain at
some point in the future or for that matter a large loss?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yes.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: But, Mark, most importantly, we publicly disclose exactly what the gains are and if there are
any charges against it, so you can model out the impact on earnings from our disclosures.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: And, Mark, to your point, there's obviously in a company the size of PepsiCo with $66
billion in revenue, 275,000 employees, and operating in almost 200 countries, there are lots of things that you would
consider to be perhaps one-time in nature. The approach that we've taken on this is we've said in terms of a test of core
versus non-core, is a transaction one-time, and then is it of a certain size? If we called everything above $1 million
one-time, we would be excluding an enormous number of items. So we've drawn a line in terms of a specific number
that equates to core versus non-core. That number has been the same for years and we apply it consistently in all of
these transactions, to your point are small, but we do disclose them to allow investors to model them any way they
choose.

Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I guess a lot of just volatility around Europe in terms of the macro and political standpoint, so
I wanted to just get a little bit more color from your perspective, what you're seeing in terms of underlying consumer
demand in your various categories in markets like Russia and Eastern Europe. It looks like your market share in
markets like UK despite a tough competitive environment is actually doing pretty well. So maybe just talk about Russia
and Eastern Europe and then separately in the UK in the context of competitive and tough retail environment.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Let me talk overall about Western Europe and then talk about Russia and Ukraine. I'd say when
you have poor weather or when you have some macro factor, we have to worry about how we perform in that
environment. So for example, Western Europe volumes in beverage decelerated a bit in Q3 because the weather was
poor. But otherwise I'd say the overall Western European markets are doing quite well. Yes, we have a retail situation
that's quite interesting in the UK, but our brands are strong and we are powering through that.
When it comes to Russia and Ukraine, again, we sell dairy products, juice, as well as snacks and soft drinks. Dairy and
juice tend to be much more stable products for Russian consumers. So even though the Russian market is going through
its challenges in terms of the devaluation of the ruble and the hryvnia in Ukraine and also inflation in raw materials for
dairy in particular, our top line growth is still mid-single digits. So we're holding on the top line growth.
The real challenge is what's the impact to the bottom line? A lot of the products we sell in Russia are made in Russia.
We source a lot of our raw materials from local suppliers. So that part is okay. But anything that's imported clearly is
impacted by the devaluation of the ruble and then any translation of Russian profit is impacted by the devaluation of the
ruble. So at this point, we're watching and waiting to see how the Russian market evolves, but our growth is still in the
mid-single digits and we're doing okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Good morning, Nik.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Good morning, so a couple of questions from my end. I was just curious if maybe you can
provide some context on PAB in terms of how the up-and-down-the-street channel did versus the larger format? And if
you could provide any perspective on foodservice since you've been investing there so heavily. And then the second
question is, Indra, just curious on your view on execution at the company-owned bottling operations, and if you think
that that is an area of improvement for PepsiCo going forward within the U.S.?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: We'll come to the performance in convenience stores, I'd say overall, we're holding share in
LRB in Q3. And whether it's in CSDs or isotonics, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we feel good about in
Q3 is that we held LRB's share in this highly competitive marketplace. I think since we bought back the bottlers, we've
actually been able to do a few things. One, we've invested in foodservice because we've put routes back into local
foodservice. We're able to go out to national accounts without any discussion of bottlers versus the parent company.
And as a consequence, we've been winning big accounts and we're beginning to actually increase our share in colleges
and universities and local foodservice accounts.
So I think our foodservice performance is improving. Again, as you know with foodservice, you don't see big
improvements in a short timeframe. You've got to build this business very, very steadily so that you balance growth
with profitable growth. And so I think over the next few years, you'll start beginning to see meaningful contributions
from our foodservice business: one, because we're fixing the core beverage foodservice business, which is a critical

driver of foodservice; and then we're able to leverage that beverage foodservice to sell most snacks. So the Better
Together really works with foodservice.
And overall execution, since we've bought back the bottlers, we've invested so much in terms of improving our
manufacturing lines to have more packaging flexibility. We've put more routes back in the marketplace. We've put in
more tools, given more tools to the frontline so that they can actually sell better at the point-of-sale. I think overall our
execution has improved substantially and that's why you're seeing several quarters now where we're holding share in
the LRB category. And we're doing it in a very responsible way because we're also able to get pricing. We're getting
low single-digit pricing in the marketplace in North America.
And we were able to push through all our innovation. I mean, the market is fragmenting quite a bit and you've got to
have a distribution system that's completely aligned with the brand company so that you can get all this innovation into
the marketplace. And by removing any friction that exists in the system, we're actually able to get all of our products to
the marketplace. So overall, we feel pretty good about the progress we're making in North American beverages and
how well North American beverages and Frito-Lay are working together to really service both retail customers and
foodservice customers to help us improve the performance of North American beverages substantially.
And in terms of convenience store performance, it's ahead of overall performance by about 50 basis points.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Steve
Powers with UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Thanks, good morning. I guess two more questions related to PAB, if I could. First, we saw
noticeable operating margin expansion in that division this quarter building on some initial progress made last quarter.
And I guess just want to get your sense for whether or not you feel this is the beginning of a trend that could continue
to gain momentum. And assuming so, what the biggest drivers will be. That's question number one.
Question two related to that is, as you said, Indra, we saw again 1% net realized pricing in the quarter, which is in line
with the year-to-date trend and I guess positive relative to muted commodities. But I was wondering whether you see
further upside to that number over time. Maybe it's that individual categories are actually better than that and we're
seeing some negative category or geographic mix across the division, I'm not sure, but further details there would be
helpful as well. Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I think what the beverage business is doing is focusing on revenue management and
productivity in addition to innovation. Innovation is driving top-line growth nicely and getting good price realization.
And all of our revenue management initiatives backed up by more packaging flexibility is actually helping this
business. And remember, all of our productivity initiatives touch the North American beverage business too. So taken
together the business is beginning to hit its stride. And our net realized pricing in the quarter in North American
beverages was in the low single digits. We actually feel very good about the pricing that we're able to get.
Now, you asked about the sustainability of this. Look, we will continue to do the revenue management work, the
productivity work, the innovation. We'll continue to do everything that's in our control. And we will continue to play a
very responsible game in this marketplace. And then we'll just see how the marketplace evolves. But at this point, we're
cautiously optimistic about the outlook for North American beverages.
Indra K. Nooyi
So let me just close by reiterating that we're pleased with our results to-date. We're confident that our plans are working
and we're on track to deliver our financial targets for 2014. I thank you for your time and questions this morning and
for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Have a wonderful day.
