MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to PepsiCo's First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's
call is being recorded and will be archived at www.pepsico.com.
It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Jamie Caulfield, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Caulfield, you
may begin.
Jamie Caulfield
Thanks, Jackie. With me today are Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO; and Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's CFO.
We'll lead off today's call with a review of our first quarter 2014 performance and outlook and then we'll move on to
Q&A.
In an effort to get to as many analyst questions as possible within the hour, we're going to have a one question limit, so
we should be able to get through the full queue of analysts when we get to the Q&A.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking
statements, including statements regarding 2014 guidance and our long-term targets, based on currently available
information. Forward-looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements. Statements made on this conference call
should be considered together with cautionary statements and other information contained in today's earnings release
and in our most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC.
Unless otherwise indicated, all references to EPS and operating profit growth are on a core basis. In addition,
references to organic revenue results in this call exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, structural changes,

discussing PepsiCo's financial results, you should refer to the Glossary and other attachments to this morning's earnings
release and to the Investor's section of PepsiCo's website under the Events and Presentations tab.
As we discuss today's results, please keep in mind that our first quarter comprises the 12 weeks ended March 22 for our
North American operations and the months of January and February for the vast majority of our operations outside of
North America.
Now it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We are very pleased with our
first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 4% overall, with global snacks up 5% and global beverages up 3%. Core
gross margins improved by 40 basis points and core operating margins improved by 50 basis points. Core constant
currency operating profit grew 7% and core constant currency EPS grew 10%. We achieved our targeted productivity
savings in the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full-year target of $1 billion.
On a rolling four-quarter basis, our core net ROIC improved by 110 basis points and now stands at 16.5%. And we
returned $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, a 47% increase versus last year.
And as we previously announced, we expect to return $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014 in the form of dividends and
share repurchases, which represents a 35% increase over our 2013 cash return to shareholders.
Now we all know that the world continues to be a volatile and uncertain place and we certainly saw indications of this
in the first quarter. The heavy lifting we've done to transform our portfolio and capabilities is yielding results. I believe
our results reflect the power of our portfolios of products and brands and the strength of our geographic footprint.
Additionally, the investments we made to strengthen our brand, innovate more effectively, drive better execution and
operate more efficiently by leveraging our global scale and portfolio complementarity are all beginning to pay off.
As a consequence, we've been consistently meeting or exceeding our financial goals. And more importantly, we have
increased confidence in the future prospects for our business. Today we believe our business is well positioned to
deliver top-tier returns in the current volatile environment as a result of the very deliberate steps we've taken and the
investments we've made over the years.
First, the balance and diversity of our product portfolio, ranging from Fun-for-You to Good-for-You products across
Snacks and Beverages, gives us the ability to manage through issues in any individual business. Together, these
businesses have an attractive growth rate in the mid-single-digits.
Second, investments we made to enhance the equity of our 22 $1 billion brands are all translating to success in the
marketplace. These powerful brands account for more than 70% of our annual retail sales. In fact, our brands hold the
number one and number two position in many of our markets, and several of our brands, like Mountain Dew, Doritos,
Gatorade, Lay's and Quaker Oats, virtually define their categories.
Looking across our largest markets, we have the leading position among top brands, with nine of the top 40 packaged
food and beverage trademarks in the U.S., which is most of any CPG company. We have nine of the top 50 packaged
food and soft drink brands in Russia, which is, again, most of any CPG company. We have seven of the top 50 in
Mexico and six of the top 50 in the UK, and, again, in both countries we are leaders.
The strength of our brands is clear in our ability to achieve consistent net price realization. In 2013, Beverages and
Snacks each achieved four points of net pricing. In the first quarter of 2014, Beverage and Snacks achieved two points
and four points of net pricing respectively.
Third, we've stepped up our focus on differentiated innovation. Our annual R&D investment is up more than 25% since
2011. We have also created unique linkages between consumer and shopper insights and product development using
the signs of our demand spaces framework. As a result, 2013 was one of PepsiCo's best years ever for innovation, with

PepsiCo products accounting for nine of the top 50 new food and beverage introductions across all measured U.S. retail
channels. In the first quarter of 2014, products launched over the past three years made up 8% of our total net revenues.
The good news is that our innovation is becoming more incremental and is contributing to positive price mix.
Fourth, the investments we made to expand our footprint in developing and emerging markets are fueling our growth.
As a group, D&E markets grew organic revenue 9% in the first quarter, following 10% growth for the full year in 2013.
In the first quarter, Russia and Brazil led the way, with double-digit organic revenue growth, followed by India, which
delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth. Our broad array of food and beverage products range from value to
premium-priced products, and is enabling us to earn sales from consumers across the economic spectrum.
Fifth, we are delivering on all our productivity targets and significantly lowering the cost base of the company. By
leveraging our global scale, eliminating duplication and deploying new technologies, we're driving the highest level of
productivity in our company's history. We're on track to achieve our three-year $3 billion productivity program in 2014.
And we are poised to begin executing on our next major productivity program, targeted $5 billion over five years
beginning in 2015, focused on increasing automation, deploying more shared services models, optimizing our
manufacturing footprint, and optimizing our go-to-market systems.
Since 2011, we've increased our core net revenue per employee by 9%, increased our core EBIT per employee by 5%,
reduced net capital spending as a percent of net revenue by 80 basis points, from 4.9% for full year 2011 to 4.1% over
the past four quarters, and improved our average cash conversion cycle by 33% to 24 days in 2013 from 36 days in
2011. And, we continue to look in every area of our business for sensible ways to do even more. And finally, we are
executing better, faster and more efficiently within our operating segments and then further benefiting through
increased coordination across our product and geographic portfolios.
And let me just give you a few recent examples of our complementary portfolio and our execution capabilities, as well.
Our Super Bowl execution demonstrated outstanding delivery of print, outdoor, mobile, digital and in-store
programming. PepsiCo delivered a united effort to leverage our NFL partnership and drove unprecedented national and
local impact, with both consumers and customers. Each business executed the property very effectively, and PepsiCo's
combined activation was one of our most compelling expressions of Better Together, with coordinated advertising,
promotions and merchandising across our Snacks and Beverage portfolios, which helped drive incremental sales and
share gains.
Second, building on the growing consumer appetite for ridged cut chips and the strong performance of Lay's Deep
Ridged chips in the U.S., UK and Spain in 2013, we offer versions of Lay's Deep Ridged potato chips in over 20
markets around the globe in 2014, with additional markets planned for 2015. Our global execution leverages common
product specifications, branding, package graphics and ad copy. At the same time, we've built on our beverage
partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings by introducing Ruffles Deep Ridged Classic Hot Wings flavored potato chips
inspired by Buffalo Wild Wings. So what we are doing is leveraging our global category structure and getting new
products to market faster across more geographies, more cost effectively and in more channels.
Third, during the quarter, we kicked off the 2014 Pepsi soccer campaign, our largest global football marketing effort
to-date. Over 100 markets will be executing and locally adapting the campaign around the world.
Our global superstar football squad brings together an unprecedented wealth of international talent that spans five
continents and includes 19 of the world's greatest players, including the great Lionel Messi. The campaign unites the
worlds of football, music and art, reaching fans with distinctive packaging, point-of-sale, out-of-home communication
and engaging content. This program drives higher consumer advantage and regard, allows us to leverage our global
scale and product complementarity and gives us the flexibility for targeted local execution.
Next, our highly successful Lay's Do Us A Flavor campaign represents a great blend of global brand-building elements.
This campaign now spans more than 15 countries and is an excellent example of how we lift and shift best practices
around the world. Rates for digital and mobile engagement was embedded in every single touch point all the way to the
shelf. This year in the U.S., we've increased consumer engagement by inviting consumers to choose both flavor and
type of chips. As part of this year's contest, a judging panel will narrow down the contest submissions to four finalist

flavors and then these four finalist flavors will be fully developed by Frito-Lay culinary experts and unveiled this
summer. The winning flavor, as determined by fan votes, will be revealed in November, with the grand pride winner
taking home $1 million. Now, this program has driven high levels of consumer engagement and is an extremely
efficient marketing tool, because of the massive earned media benefit that we've done on each of the markets where we
launch it.
And finally, we've accelerated productivity best practices across the organization. For example, as our Global
Enterprise System, or GES, continues to roll out across Frito-Lay North America, we're beginning to apply the same
concepts and tools to our North American Beverage business and in some international markets. And these initiatives
will maximize asset utilization, while reducing distribution centers, leveraging automation, deploying fleet and route
trucks more efficiently and reducing inventory, while improving service and product freshness.
So with all of this as a backdrop, let's take a look at how the businesses performed, starting with our North American
businesses. Frito-Lay North America delivered another quarter of very strong results. Organic revenue grew 4% and
core constant currency operating profit rose 6%. The U.S. Salty Snacks category continues to grow retail sales at a
mid-single-digit rate and Frito-Lay's delivering a good balance between volume growth and price utilization.
Revenue growth in the quarter was led by good performance across our five largest brands – Lay's, Tostitos, Doritos,
Cheetos and Ruffles – and each grew between low and mid-single-digits. We continue to execute product and
packaging innovation, targeted incremental macro snack occasions, including the launches of Rold Gold Pretzel Thins,
Twistos Snack Bites, Lay's Air Pops, Lay's Kettle Cooked Lattice Cut chips in our ready-to-go market packs that offers
a broad assortment of macro snacks.
Quaker Foods North America delivered positive organic top-line in the quarter and gained value share at retail in each
of its core categories: hot cereal; ready-to-eat cereal; and snack bars.
Turning to North American Beverages, we're really encouraged with the continued progress we are making. In the
quarter, we held U.S. Liquid Refreshment Beverage value share and achieved positive net price realization at retail,
ahead of the category and our primary competitor. Notably, PepsiCo has held or gained relative U.S. LRB value share
in measured channels versus our closest competitor in each of the last four quarters. And we continue to manage the
business responsibly, with consistent pricing across carbonated and non-carbonated beverages.
Within the LRB category, we held or gained value share across a number of important subcategories, including CSDs,
sports drinks, and ready-to-drink tea and coffee. And we grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for: regular
colas and Mountain Dew, both within CSDs; and for Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks coffee and Naked Juice, within
our non-carb portfolio. We're investing in R&D to drive sustainable innovation. And we're off to a good start,
beginning with the first quarter launches of Brisk Half & Half, Gatorade Fierce Blue Cherry and Kickstart Black
Cherry and Limeade, to name a few.
In addition, we've continued to expand our package offerings and we're seeing good success, with strong double-digit
growth in mini cans and we've more than doubled the sales of our 12 ounce glass bottles in quarter one. These packages
enable us to realize new price tag revenue benefits, while providing flexibility to maintain price competitiveness. So
that's the North American story.
Our other developed markets in Western Europe also performed well, with organic revenue for these markets up 3.5%
in the first quarter.
Let me now turn to developing and emerging markets. In Mexico, we are managing through the new taxes of served
fruits and beverages that were enacted recently. We've taken pricing in Snacks and our bottler has taken pricing in
Beverages to pass the taxes through to the consumer. In the quarter, the elasticities and volume declines in Mexico
were in line with what we expected. And we'll be dealing with the situation throughout the year and expect it to
continue to depress consumer demands, but results so far are consistent with our plan assumptions.
In Venezuela, we are managing through high inflation, political unrest, supply chain disruptions and continued
uncertainty regarding the applicable exchange rate. So given all these challenges, our businesses in Venezuela

performed well in the quarter, with organic revenue up strong double-digits across both Snacks and Beverages. Brazil
delivered double-digit organic growth, revenue growth, led by organic revenue growth in Snacks.
In Russia, organic revenue rose double-digits, with double-digit growth in Snacks and high single-digit growth in
Beverages. And we saw strong organic growth in a number of other East European markets, including double-digit
organic revenue growth in Poland, high single-digit organic revenue growth in Turkey.
Moving across to our Asia, Middle East, Africa businesses, organic revenue growth was led by Pakistan, with strong
double-digit organic revenue growth, followed by Egypt and the Philippines, which also grew double-digits, and India,
which grew high single-digits. China organic revenue declined low single-digits, in line with our expectations.
Performance was muted, given strong high single-digit comparisons from Q1 of 2013 and some business disruption
related to our bottler's restructuring in Q1 of 2014 to drive increased efficiency through greater innovation. We expect
the business to return to its normal trajectory as we enter Q3.
We remain committed to the developing and emerging markets, as they have a long runway for growth, driven by
increasing demand for our convenient, on-trend, affordable products, supported by a rapidly growing middle class. And
we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.
So let me conclude my comments by saying we're off to a good start in 2014, with the pieces of our portfolio working
together to generate healthy top-line and bottom-line performance. Clearly, there are a number of challenges around the
globe, but the shape and resilience of our portfolio, combined with strong execution and aggressive productivity, will
enable us to navigate successfully through the current environment.
So with this, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston.
Hugh F. Johnston
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing the quarter and our outlook for
2014, which is in line with the full-year guidance issued in mid-February. Overall, the quarter came in largely as
expected, with pricing actions, commodity inflation and productivity all in line with our expectations. For Q1, organic
volume grew 2% in Snacks and was even versus the prior-year quarter in Beverages. Organic revenue grew 4%. On a
reported basis, net revenue was even versus year ago, reflecting three points of unfavorable foreign exchange
translation and nearly a half a point negative impact, primarily from the refranchising of our Vietnam bottling
operation. Commodity inflation was up low single-digits.
Our core gross margins improved about 40 basis points and core operating margins increased 50 basis points. Core
constant currency operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. Our core effective tax rate was 23.7%, approximately 80
basis points below Q1 2013. Our fully diluted share count declined 1.5%, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing share
repurchase program. And core constant currency EPS grew 10%. So between the core constant currency operating
profit growth of 7% and core constant currency EPS growth of 10%, we achieved about three points of leverage, driven
by lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and share repurchases. And we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders
year-to-date in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, which was 47% above year-ago levels
and reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
Turning to guidance, the world does remain a volatile place, as evidenced in places like Mexico, Venezuela and Eastern
Europe. So even with the strength that we saw in the first quarter, our full-year guidance remains unchanged.
Consistent with what we said back in February, for the full year 2014 we expect mid-single-digit organic revenue
growth and core constant currency EPS growth of 7%, and we expect low single-digit commodity inflation and
productivity savings of approximately $1 billion.
Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency, driven by our productivity initiatives, a
core tax rate of approximately 25% and a reduced share count from our share repurchase program.

Foreign exchange is expected to negatively impact net revenue and core earnings per share for the full year 2014 by
approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, based on current market consensus rates. Taking our 2013 core EPS at $4.37
and applying our guidance implies 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.50, consistent with our prior guidance. And as
many of you know, the foreign exchange picture in Venezuela is very dynamic at the moment. Our first quarter results
were translated to U.S. dollars at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Our current Fx forecast, which is based on current
market consensus rates, assumed a blended rate of approximately nine bolivars to the U.S. dollar for the balance of the
year. To help you with the Fx sensitivities on Venezuela, for the full year 2013 Venezuela generated approximately 1%
of our net revenues and 2% of our operating profit.
In addition, as of the end of our international Q1, which includes January and February, we have approximately $380
million of net monetary assets in Venezuela valued at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which would be subject to
revaluation if there's a change in the exchange rate we use. As we did in 2013, we would expect to treat any revaluation
of the net monetary assets as a non-core charge.
As you model out the second quarter, I'd ask you to consider the following. First, our AMEA division will face very
difficult operating profit comparison due to the following: A., a $137 million gain recorded in Q2 2013 related to the
refranchising of the company's bottling operations in Vietnam; and B., 27% year-over-year core constant currency
operating profit growth in Q2 2013 when excluding the above mentioned gain. Second, foreign exchange translation
should have an approximate four-point unfavorable impact on the second quarter revenue and an approximate
five-point unfavorable impact on second quarter EPS based on current market consensus rates. Revenue in the second
quarter will have an estimated 15 basis point of negative impact from structural changes due to the Vietnam
refranchising. Below the net operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to increase in the second quarter
versus last year, primarily reflecting higher debt balances and higher rates. And our tax rate is expected to be higher in
the second quarter of 2014 versus both the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.
Finally, our stepped up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year, but is expected to have a more
pronounced impact in the second half of 2014 and into 2015. From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect
full-year free cash flow, excluding certain items, of more than $7 billion. We'll continue to drive cash flow through
efficient working capital management, and continue tight controls over capital spending. Net capital spending should
approximate $3 billion, which is well within our long-term target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
We expect to return approximately $8.7 billion to shareholders in 2014, a 35% increase over 2013, through a
combination of $3.7 billion in dividends and a $5 billion share repurchase program. And as a reminder, our
previously-announced 15% dividend per share increase will commence with the June payment. This represents the
42nd consecutive year of an annual dividend increase and an approximate 60% payout ratio based on 2013 core EPS.
At yesterday's closing stock price, it represents a 3.1% yield and will bring our ten-year annualized dividend per share
compound annual growth to 11%.
So to summarize, our 2014 outlook is unchanged from our last call. We expect to drive improved full-year margins and
net ROIC. And disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders remain top priorities for the company.
With that, operator, we'll take the first question.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just wanted to talk a little bit further about Russia and maybe just the way we should think
about modeling it going forward. So if you could maybe parse out for us, on the double-digit growth, how much was
pricing and then maybe how the performance was snacks versus dairy? And then finally, just as we're looking forward,
given the exchange rate volatility, the increase in input costs there, just how we should think about modeling
profitability in Russia, kind of over the next couple of quarters.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Bryan, I'm going to provide some overall comments on Russia and then I'll toss it to Hugh to
provide you more detail. Let me just say our business in Russia is a good one. Both in Russia and Ukraine, businesses
are doing well. The climate there has been very friendly to business and we have great relationships with the
government, the local retailers. So the business is a very good business. Clearly, the current geopolitical issues are
impacting more the ruble and the Russian [ph] hryvnia (27:15) as opposed to basic consumer demand because they've
devalued. Input costs have gone up and, therefore, consumer prices have had to go up. The consumer is extremely
resilient in both countries at this point, so we have to watch and wait and see how things evolve, but with those as
overall comments, let me just toss it to Hugh to give you some more color and details.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, sure, happy to, Bryan, good morning. For Russia in the first quarter, we had 10%
revenue growth. Volume did grow across the businesses. You are calling out one of the questions that we wrestle with,
which is the dairy inflation we faced in the business. The good news, from that perspective, is because we have such
strong brands across the dairy category and as a leader there in many of those brands, we do have the ability to take
pricing successfully. And, thus far, the consumer's been quite resilient against that pricing. So I would expect to see
some level of volume growth and then we will continue to take pricing to cover the vast majority of our inflation in the
country. And we expect to see continued profit growth coming out of Russia. And that's true across all of the
businesses, Snacks and Beverages.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So you'd expect...
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Expect what?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to talk a...
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Good morning, Indra. I just want to talk a little bit about the pricing environment in North
American CSDs. You guys are reporting solid pricing. Coke said the pricing for carbonated soft drinks was up. We're
not really seeing that in the market in terms of looking at the syndicated data. So could you talk a little bit about what
you're seeing in the category, whether some of the discounting we've seen has been able to stabilize demand a little bit,
and then how you see the pricing going as we look into the summer selling season? Thank you.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I think at this point, I'd say we have been extremely disciplined in pricing across all parts of the
LRB portfolio, in all channels. Now and then, we see some interesting pricing behavior in one retail channel or in one
category, but as far as PepsiCo is concerned, John, we have, as we've communicated with you, decided to be extremely
responsible and take pricing up both in carbs and non-carbs. And that's what we've been doing in all channels. Going
into the summer selling season, that's going to be our strategy going forward. I think, especially in a category like
CSDs, taking down pricing is not going to drive up demand so much. So I think we have to play the overall LRB
portfolio very, very carefully and balance pricing between CSDs and non-carbs, and figure out a way to grow the whole
pie very, very carefully. That's what we're doing and that's what we hope to see in the marketplace going into the year,
but we can only talk about ourselves.

Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Was hoping to just get a little bit more color on Mexico, you talked about the elasticity being
pretty in line with your expectations. Can you talk about how much volume was down in Beverages and Snacks, any
major differences you're seeing from a consumer reaction perspective across both categories? And then on PAB, the
profit decline that we saw in the first quarter, can you just talk about how much that was Mexico?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So, Judy, I mean, the details on the volume decline in Mexico, things like that, we're not going
to give you that level of detail, but, overall, I'll tell you we have modeled out a certain set of elasticity. And
interestingly, we're coming in exactly as we modeled out. But let's be careful here. It's only about three months into the
year after the taxes have gone into effect and it's gone into effect on multiple, multiple, multiple categories. So the
Mexican consumer is trying to figure out how to rebalance their basket. So I think we've got to let this thing play out
another month or two, because our first quarter was just two months.
So let's wait to see how this plays out in the next three or four months and I think we'll get a much better read as to
what this taxation is going to do in Mexico and also what strategies we can deploy in terms of revenue management to
really address price points to the consumer that would attract the consumer. So actually, as an economy, Mexico
remains robust and we still believe enormously in the Mexican economy. I think we have to give it time to allow this
taxation to play through.

Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hugh, the international profit results were very strong, even against a tough comp and
excluding the gain in better than expected Fx. From a margin perspective, should we view the Q1 strength as an
aberration in a light seasonal quarter or do you think the strong performance can continue in the balance of the year?
And then also, can you give us an update on the potential for emerging markets margins to expand longer-term as you
gain scale and if we should expect an inflection point in emerging markets margins any time soon?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Go ahead, Hugh.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, happy to, Dara, a couple of things on that. You're right. The international margins
expanded probably more than you're going to consistently see across the board in the first quarter. The productivity
programs are kicking into place and, obviously, that's helping us. In addition to that, some of the new pricing that we
put in is helping, as well. But Q1 was probably a bit better than what you would expect over the course of the year. The
balancing act, of course, in developing and emerging markets, as we've talked about before, is one of how rapidly do
you increase margins versus pricing a bit below your commodity inflation in order to increase consumer adoption of
our products and our categories and also, frankly, to build competitive strength for ourself through scale in gaining
market share across the businesses.
I do think that by virtue of the scale gains, we will see natural margin accretion over time to some degree, given the
investments that we've made in brands. We can control how quickly we increase the margins in those businesses, but,
frankly, what we're trying to do is build great competitive fortresses around the rest of the world in places like Brazil, in
places like Russia and in places like India and China, in order to, frankly, generate lots of long-term value for
shareholders. So the strategy we're following is to capture sufficient short-term financial gains in those markets, yet, at
the same time, build great fortresses like we have here in North America for the long haul in both the Snacks and the

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey, a couple of quick ones, just in terms of cash flow in the quarter, it looked like there
was some working capital anomalies and I know you maintained your cash flow guidance for the year, so could you
just explain kind of what happened there? And I just have a really quick follow-up.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, Bill, you're right. This is Hugh. We had some timing on payments and a few timing
items on inventory, as well. Those will correct. In fact, they are already correcting through March. And as we get to the
full year, you'll see the cash flow come in exactly as we expected. As you try to manage cash flow, managing on a
quarterly basis on cash flow is a little bit trickier than earnings on a quarterly basis. You're going to see some more
bumps and it'll be a bit more inconsistent, but I would expect the cash flow to come in as we expected for the year and
working capital will improve strongly during the year.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks. And then just maybe it's too early, but can you just give us some early
reads on the Pepsi NEXT launch in Canada and kind of what you guys are thinking so far?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I think it's hardly a couple weeks since the launch, so let's wait and see. It's too early to call any
results from that, because typically it takes about three months to four months before you can get a first read, so let's
wait and see how it evolves.

Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much. Just wondering, there's a huge disconnect
between the results, top line, that Coke put up in Europe and you, and obviously Russia's a huge part of your Europe
business. But in Western Europe and the UK, in particular, which is big business for you, could you talk about how
your European Beverage business performed and what you're seeing in that market, please?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Caroline, good morning. I just think our European business, again, investments in brands,
investments in stepped-up execution, is all beginning to pay off. And our bottling partners are also performing very
well. And I'd say across the board pretty much in every country in Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe,
whether it's a company-owned bottling operation or a franchise operation, first, our bottlers are healthy, which helps.
And on top of that, they're executing exceedingly well. And I think the portfolio plays in our favor to Pepsi MAX, for
example, is a wonderful, wonderful product and is doing very well in the UK and the Nordic countries. So the choice of
the portfolio works. The fact that we have financially strong bottlers helps. And third, I think businesses like Tropicana
are doing exceedingly well in France and the UK. So we have on-target products, healthy bottlers and great execution,
and together they're all beginning to work in Europe.
So we're feeling good about the shape of the portfolio. And you know, what I'd say is what we can control, we're doing
well. When it comes to geopolitics or macroeconomic turmoil, we try to navigate through it. But what we can control,
we're doing a very good job of it.

Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Indra, I thought maybe we could just talk a little bit about the productivity program. $8
billion, effectively over eight years, is clearly impressive, but a $1 billion per-year run rate is about a 10% lift to
EBITDA, all else equal. Obviously, that's not the expected flow-through, so can you give us just a little bit more sense
of where the productivity is going in terms of reinvestment and how you're measuring return on that investment? And
then also, in terms of where the productivity is being sourced from, it sounded like from some of your comments that
there was a shift going on, transition of focus perhaps from Frito-Lay in North America to Beverages. But is that
correct and perhaps maybe some quantification around the productivity opportunities there?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Hugh, why don't you take it and then I'll add to it?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Okay. Yeah, Steve, I'm happy to get into that. First, in order to understand all these
numbers, it may be helpful to give a bit of context on the overall environment that we're operating within. The cost base
that we're drawing productivity from is what we refer to as operating expense. What's important is what that excludes.
That excludes A&M. That excludes any financing cost below the line and tax and things like that. That also excludes
commodities, so it's really kind of the operating expense of the company, including corporate expenses, okay? So that's
point number one. It's about $28 billion, $29 billion in terms of the overall size of that bucket. So when you're talking
about $1 billion a year of productivity, you're talking about somewhere between 3.5% and 4% productivity out of that
bucket. For a company that's a growth company, that's really quite strong productivity. We benchmark that against
other companies that grow their revenues in mid-single-digits and we do feel quite confident that that's strong
productivity.
Now to your question around where does it go, that question is really a margin question, which is a bit more complex.
But let me share a few thoughts that may help you bottle it and also just give you a little bit of an understanding of how
it works. Number one, based on our mix of countries, of course there's operating expense inflation inside of those
operating costs. The operating expense inflation inside of that bucket is also going to run in the 3% to 4% range,
depending on the particular year. Drivers of that, obviously, are labor increases. That bucket is about half labor cost
and, obviously, that's naturally inflationary. In addition to that, as the business grows, it is somewhat volume-variable.
So you're going to get a bit of growth in those expenses based on volume increases, as well. So that's a bit of an offset
as you think about the margin flow-through.
The second margin flow-through question is around geographic mix. Obviously, we're growing more quickly in
developing and emerging markets. As Dara asked about earlier, margins in those markets are lower. The natural drag
out of those markets is probably about 30 basis points per year. Now that's something that, if we were to take up prices
more aggressively, we could choose to mitigate. But frankly, for shareholder value creation, over a five-year
timeframe, we think that's the wrong decision. So we're willing to live with that 30 basis point margin drag.
And then the third piece is how we manage pricing in individual markets is both an outcome of what our pricing
strategy is vis-à-vis commodities and, in addition to that, what the competitive situation is in that particular market. So
that tends to be a bit of a margin drag, as well. So when you put all of those pieces together, I think what you can
expect from us is, is that margin improvement overall of about 30 basis points or so per year. We ought to be able to do
that on a reasonably consistent basis and combine that with the mid-single-digit revenue growth and the below the line
leverage, I think our long-term guidance of high single-digit is what you'd be thinking about. So, hopefully, that gives
you some sense as to taking the productivity and mapping it all the way through to the guidance. If you'd like to spend
more time on that, obviously, Jamie and the team can spend more time with you on it.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: And the productivity is in Frito-Lay, is in North American Beverages. It's across every part of
the company. And as Hugh said, it's in G&A. It's literally corporate costs, everything. What we don't touch is A&M
and R&D. Those are the two that we've said are protected. We'll focus on ROI on those two investments, but we aren't
going to cut that to make the numbers.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Indra, Hugh.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Two questions, I'm hoping to try to better understand some of the thinking that you and
your board have on TSR and CEO transition. On TSR, the 35% increase that you're announcing, again, so to speak, or
as a repeat of what we heard from the fourth quarter, is a very healthy, nice, good number. Can you give us some sense
about the philosophy driving that? And I think one thing I'm really trying to better understand is, do you put an optimal
leverage target out there? Do you do something to help us think beyond 2014, how we should be thinking about how
much cash shareholders get back from the company, again, from a beyond 2014 perspective, so looking for some color
on TSR? And then, simply any update, on, Indra, how you thinking and the larger board is thinking on the subject of
CEO transition?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Okay. Well, you want to take TSR and I'll talk about CEO transition?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, why don't I talk about that one? That sounds appropriate. Mark, from the perspective
of TSR, I guess, in terms of going beyond 2014, we haven't provided any specific guidance around share repurchase.
We'll do that as we get into next year. You know we've got a long history of share repurchase. We've been repurchasing
our shares since 2001, so there's certainly a reasonable expectation that the share repurchase will continue to be
relatively high. I don't want to get into 2015 guidance on share repo until we get closer to that timeframe.
In terms of TSR though, perhaps from a different perspective, I would think about it from the standpoint of our
long-term guidance is high single-digit EPS. So let's take the midpoint of that over time and call it 8%. That's probably
a reasonable proxy for share price increase, assuming the market holds relatively stable. Add to that the dividend yield.
Right now, that yield is, as I mentioned earlier, 3.1%. It's probably going to wind up hovering around the 3% range
over time. So, I would think of an 11% TSR as probably being a reasonable range to expect out of PepsiCo. We think
with that, that combination of high single-digit EPS and a 3% or so yield, that's probably going to be near the top of the
class in terms of TSR within the CPG space and within the F&B space. So that's the way I would think about it, more
focusing on the TSR rather than the short-term cash return forecast.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: In terms of succession, Mark, we start talking about CEO succession and all C-suite succession
the day after you appoint anybody into their job, because we have a very, very orderly succession process. The board
reviews it every other board meeting. We look at emergency succession, long-term succession. We have very deliberate
talent development models within the company. And PepsiCo is known for that. We have an outstanding group of
leaders within the company who can assume bigger and bigger jobs, but let me assure you, at this point, I'm still in the
chair.

Our final question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning,
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: I just have a quick question on the double-digit increase in your advertising and marketing
expense for Frito-Lay and if we should expect that level of investment to continue. And then you reported flat organic
Beverage volume growth in North America this quarter, which is quite positive. So could you drill down a little further
and maybe give us an idea where some of the strength came from in terms of channels and brands?

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: I'll take the beverage question and then, Hugh, you can take the question on the A&M and
Frito-Lay. As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, Bonnie, I tell you we had a very, very good first quarter in North
American Beverages. And I think we had growth across the board. In all parts of the portfolio, we gained or held value
share in CSDs, sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea, coffee. We grew retail sales in measured channels in the U.S. for:
regular colas and Mountain Dew within CSDs; Gatorade, Lipton Tea, Starbucks coffee, Naked Juice in non-carbs.
This was one of those quarters, in spite of the fact that we had bad weather for some of the days of the first quarter,
which caused some routes not to service accounts, this was a quarter where innovation stuck, our execution was terrific
and we just performed well. But let's also make sure we recognize that now for several quarters, we have held or gained
value share in U.S. LRB and measured channels. So I think all the investments, the focus on execution, brand-building
in North American Beverages is beginning to pay off. We're feeling good about the prospects in this business.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, and, Bonnie, I'll talk about the advertising and marketing spending in Frito-Lay.
Obviously, when we increased A&M across the company a couple of years ago, Frito-Lay certainly got their share of
that increase. Ant it's worked is the great news. We've seen the brand equity scores increase and we've seen our ability
to price successfully increase because the brands are stronger. Regarding go-forward, what we've said is that we do not
expect A&M as a percent of revenue to go down. So that's a line in the sand, as Indra mentioned, regarding where we
sit as a company.
Beyond that, it really comes down to, not a strategic move anymore of, we need to increase A&M for either
competitive reasons or because we think we're under spending, but, frankly, we'll base it on the opportunities that we
see in the demand spaces that we're working within and within the innovation ideas that we have. So you might see it
grow faster than revenue in a year or two because we have some great products that we're putting out there. You might
see it because we have a great combination idea, something we want to advertise between the Beverage business and
the Snack Food business, and we'll always take advantage of those opportunities when we have that kind of an insight.
But there's no strategy to increase A&M faster than revenue at Frito-Lay. I would expect to see them grow basically in
line, ex a big idea.
Indra K. Nooyi
So let me just bring this to a close. Thank you all for your questions. In closing, I think we've taken the necessary steps
to position ourselves for sustainable long-term growth. We're off to a good start in 2014 and we're done a good job
navigating through an uncertain and volatile environment. And I believe the first quarter of 2014 is a good example of
how a well-constructed portfolio, appropriate investment and disciplined execution can drive high-quality, top and
bottom-line results. Our first quarter results give me confidence that our plans are working and that we're on track to
deliver our financial goals in 2014.
So let me thank you for your time this morning and for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment. Have
a great day.
