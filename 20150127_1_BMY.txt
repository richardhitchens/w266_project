MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, my name is Candace, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to
welcome everyone to the Bristol-Myers 2014 fourth quarter results conference call. All lines have been placed on mute
to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Thank you. Mr. John Elicker, you may begin your conference.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Candace, and good morning, everybody. My apologies for any of you who had difficulty dialing in to the call.
There was some confusion around the start date. But this – I think we're ready to go at this point.
We're here to discuss our Q4 earnings, and as well we had issued our 2015 guidance. With me this morning are
Lamberto Andreotti, our CEO; Giovanni Caforio, our Chief Operating Officer; Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial
Officer; and Francis Cuss, our Chief Scientific Officer. Lamberto, Giovanni, and Charlie will have some brief prepared
remarks, and then we'll go to your questions.
First I'll take care of the Safe Harbor language. During the call, we will make statements about the company's future
plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those
indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the
company's SEC filings. These forward-looking statements represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied
upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update

non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available at our website. Lamberto?
Lamberto Andreotti
Well, thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. First, as you all know, we announced last week that effective May 5, I
will be retiring as CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb while remaining on our board of directors and becoming Executive
Chairman, replacing Jim Cornelius. Jim's role in our company has been transformational and outstanding, and I feel
honored to have worked with him for many years and now to take over for him as Chairman. And I'm very pleased that
Giovanni – Giovanni Caforio – will be my successor as CEO. Giovanni is a global business leader with broad industry
and management experience, including a solid background in oncology. He's also a trained physician who brings to his
work an important perspective and subtle insight. Importantly, Giovanni has not only been a key player in developing
our strategy these past several years; he's also been one of the driving forces executing against it. So I feel very good
about leaving our company in his very capable hands.
I am going ask Giovanni and Charlie to walk you through our fourth quarter results. But before I do that, I will speak
for a few minutes about some of the highlights of the past year, because 2014 was without question an important year
for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very pleased and very proud about it.
In 2014, we accelerated our evolution to being a diversified specialty biopharma company, beginning with the
completion of the divestiture of our diabetes business. Under Giovanni's leadership, we refocused our commercial
organization to optimize global brands and key markets. This allowed us to drive strong sales across our portfolio and
across the world. In fact, our commercial organization had a good year, delivering 6% sales growth excluding the
diabetes franchise. These changes position us well for continued success with our portfolio of marketed and pipeline
products.
Under Francis' leadership, our R&D organization also had a good year, most notably with respect to our
immuno-oncology portfolio, gaining approval of Opdivo in the U.S. for melanoma and with the early stoppage of two
Opdivo studies in melanoma lung due to very positive results. This development underscores the strength of our I-O
strategy and our I-O programs and the importance of continuing to apply the same strategies.
Beyond I-O, we made good progress across the rest of our diversified portfolio. Just to mention a few examples, we
obtained an important label expansion for Eliquis. We continued to develop interesting early access in immunoscience
and HIV. We executed several business development transactions to make our I-O portfolio even stronger and to build
the rest of our specialty portfolio in areas like fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. And we committed significant
resources to increase our biologics capacity, announcing strategic investments to expand our Devens, Massachusetts,
facility and built a new plant – a totally new plant – in Ireland. Biologics now comprise about 50% of our R&D
portfolio, and that number will continue to grow.
So, taking it all together, 2014 was a good, important year for us. And it set a strong foundation for our future.
Financially, commercially, clinically – by every indication, Bristol-Myers Squibb is well positioned. We will of course
continue to face challenges, such as the upcoming losses of exclusivity and a very competitive marketplace. But we
have the right products, the right plans, and the right people to find our way through it all. In that, I have no doubt. And
because we are in such good position, I feel that my decision to retire as CEO and to accept the proposal from our
board to become Chairman comes at the right time. And, again, I'm very confident in Giovanni's ability to lead
Bristol-Myers Squibb to build on our success over the past several years and to take our company forward, with the
support of the outstanding management team that I've had the pleasure of putting together and leading.
So, with that, I will turn the floor over to Giovanni to provide our Q4 results. Giovanni?

Giovanni Caforio
Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by thanking Lamberto for his kind words of support
and, more generally, for his exceptional leadership over the last several years. He has led our company at a pivotal
time, navigating us through a challenging but exciting biopharma transformation and leading us to our current position
of strength. I'm looking forward to continuing our work together as we transition into our new roles.
So, as Lamberto discussed, 2014 was a very good year that ended on a very good note. During the fourth quarter, we
delivered 9% sales growth across our diversified portfolio and across our key markets, excluding our diabetes franchise
and the impact of foreign exchange. Let me touch on some of the highlights.
First, Yervoy had a very good quarter, with a 41% increase. In the U.S., this strong performance was driven by
continued penetration in the community setting. Outside the U.S., it was driven largely by its first-line indication and
improved access. Even with our success in 2014, we recognize that the melanoma market dynamics will continue to
evolve following the launch of Opdivo. While this may impact Yervoy's short-term trends, we are very well positioned.
In monotherapy, both our products have demonstrated overall survival, and in combination, they have the potential to
offer long-term survival to the largest number of patients.
Eliquis had its best quarter ever, with $281 million in sales. In the U.S., the expansion of the label was a key reason
why sales grew 20% over the previous quarter. And we continued to make good progress in new-to-brand prescriptions
by cardiologists. Outside the U.S., we also made good progress, particularly in Germany and Japan. Looking forward,
we have every reason to believe that Eliquis' strong performance trends will continue.
Regarding hepatitis C, we had a really good quarter. Generally speaking, our strategy is to focus on difficult-to-treat
patients and the unique medical need of each market. We made important progress in Japan, with our dual regimen, and
in Europe, where Daklinza is approved in combinations including Sovaldi. In the U.S., we are working with the FDA
and expect to be able to resubmit Daklinza based on data from completed and ongoing studies.
And, lastly, we are very excited about the U.S. approval of Opdivo. Our commercial organization was more than ready
to go at the time of approval. Shipments were ready by year's end, and our people have hit the ground running. We are
leveraging Yervoy's established commercial presence, building on our strong relationships with physicians and payers.
In fact, our commercial organization is actively promoting Opdivo, and within the first two weeks, we reached nearly
100% of the top accounts and already have a 70% share of voice within the melanoma market. And while it is early, we
are making good progress with access.
Although we are primarily focused on Opdivo for melanoma in the U.S. and hopefully soon in Europe, following our
063 and 017 announcements, we are also preparing for potential approvals in lung later this year.
Charlie will talk about our 2014 financials and our outlook for 2015, but let me close with a few words about the
coming year. Clearly, 2015, like every year, will have its challenges and its opportunities. That's a given. But I am
confident that we will successfully find our way through it all by continuing to execute against our strategy and by
maintaining our balanced approach of driving results today while setting the stage for tomorrow. That means growth of
our marketed products, strong product launches, and continued investment in our portfolio of the future. And that
means continuing to focus on leadership in immuno-oncology as a priority, but also remembering that we are a
diversified specialty biopharma company, one with multiple products across multiple therapeutic areas.
And with that, I will turn the floor over to Charlie.
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Giovanni. Good morning, everyone. I will discuss a few items from our fourth quarter non-GAAP P&L and
our outlook for 2015. As Giovanni covered some of the highlights on sales, I will make just a few additional comments
regarding revenues during the quarter.

First, Eliquis sales were reduced by approximately $15 million in gross-to-net adjustments for the Medicare coverage
gap. Sustiva benefited from a $30 million annual equity share true-up related to Atripla. And, finally, our net revenues
for Plavix and Avapro/Avalide, which are captured under mature products, benefited from a $36 million reduction in
our returns reserve.
With the dollar strengthening, foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on both the top and bottom line. Compared
to the same quarter last year, the negative impact was 3% on sales and approximately $0.03 on EPS.
Gross margin was 78% during the quarter, up 440 basis points compared to the same period last year, mostly due to
product mix, following the divestiture of our global diabetes business. Marketing, selling, and admin expenses
increased about 9% in the quarter, due in part to increased investment in key brands, including Eliquis, Yervoy,
Opdivo, and our HCV franchise. R&D expenses increased primarily due to timing of spending across our R&D
portfolio. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 10% during the quarter, compared to almost 18% during the same period last
year. Our Q4 rate reflects a full year of the R&D tax credit, which was just extended in December.
Now I'd like to spend a few moments discussing capital allocation. We will continue our balanced approach to using
our capital. We feel good about the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibilities these resources give us to make
important investment decisions. We continue to see business development as a top priority and also remain committed
to the dividend, which was recently increased for the sixth year in a row.
In regard to business development, we believe that innovation must be sourced both internally and externally. We
continue to look for BD opportunities that can help deliver long-term growth within our core areas of interest. We are
committed to fully advancing our leading immuno-oncology portfolio. Our clinical collaboration strategy reflects our
belief that combination therapy will be a key component of I-O in the future and that we are open to exploring external
I-O opportunities. Since the end of Q3, we have announced four additional clinical collaborations including Opdivo.
Overall, we have nine clinical collaborations to study Opdivo in more than a dozen tumor types.
In addition to these I-O collaborations, we also signed several deals that will strengthen our specialty portfolio. We will
continue to develop and diversify our R&D and commercial portfolios, focusing on high-quality opportunities that are
closely aligned with our diversified specialty biopharma strategy.
I will now move to 2015 guidance. We are setting our non-GAAP EPS guidance range at $1.55 to $1.70. This range
assumes current exchange rates and continuation of the R&D tax credit in 2015. As a reminder, there are several factors
to keep in mind which will have an impact on our 2015 revenues. Our rights to Abilify in the U.S. and most remaining
international markets expire in April. Abilify is a high-margin product, as we record our share of revenues without any
meaningful associated costs. We will see a full year's impact on Baraclude's sales in the U.S. due to the loss of
exclusivity last year. As we previously mentioned, we expect a negative impact on EPS of roughly $0.10 in 2015. As I
commented during our October earnings call, revenues from mature products and other non-core assets will decline
significantly this year due to a one-time step down of about $400 million related to expiring agreements. In addition, I
remind you that this is a declining business.
As you all know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies from 2014 average rates and quite a bit
just in January. Based on current FX rates, this will negatively impact our 2015 revenues by approximately $800
million and $0.12 to $0.14 on earnings per share. On the other hand, we expect continued growth in 2015 from the rest
of our portfolio, where we are seeing strong exit trends that we believe will continue. We are also very encouraged by
the accelerated approval of Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma in the U.S. and hope to a receive approvals in other
countries and other tumors in 2015.
We expect our full-year gross margin to be approximately 74% in 2015. Our gross margin continues to be largely
driven by product mix, loss of exclusivity, and the structure of our co-promotion agreement for Eliquis. We expect
these downward pressures to be partially offset by the growth of new products, including Opdivo and our HCV
portfolio. You will see our line-item guidance for A&P, MS&A, and R&D in our press release.
Our operating expense projections reflect our new operating model following the divestiture of our global diabetes
alliance early last year. We remain committed to investing in key opportunities, including our late-stage pipeline and

the launch of Opdivo in the U.S. in advanced melanoma, and potential subsequent launches in other regions and
indications. We also continue to drive growth of our priority brands, including Yervoy, Eliquis, Orencia, and Sprycel.
We will, however, continue to be prudent with our resources on our older brands and leverage our specialty model. Our
operating expenses outside the U.S. will also be affected by prevailing exchange rates. On the R&D side, we expect to
spend less in 2015, primarily due to decreased spending on diabetes clinical trials.
Now we'd be happy to address your questions.
John E. Elicker
Candace, I think we're ready to go to the Q&A. And, everybody, I'd just remind you that in addition to Lamberto,
Giovanni, and Charlie, Francis is here to take any questions you might have. Candace?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tim Anderson with Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Timothy Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A few questions, if I could. Can you just kind of outline for us when
we might see human data on the next round of the various checkpoint modulators that you have? Second question is
just an update on nivolumab and Yervoy trial in lung and when that Phase III would be starting. Do you have the data
from the earlier-stage studies in hand to pick the dose? So anything on that topic would be helpful. And then last
question, just an update on the timing of elotuzumab's second-line trial in multiple myeloma.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Tim. Happy New Year. First of all, let me start. I think – talking about
elotuzumab – let me start from the back. Our Eliquis II study, which is in second-line relapsing multiple myeloma, is
on track for us to see data in the first half of this year. It's obviously premature to discuss regulatory strategy, but
obviously if the data is positive, we will be seeking to submit this around the world.
As far as an update on the Opdivo-Yervoy Phase III study first line in lung, what I will say is we've completed the
design phase of this. We are on track to initiate. We're not providing any further detail on the details, although I will
say to you it's a comprehensive study, it's in a broad lung population, both in terms of histologies and biomarkers, and
we'll be using different doses from the tumors we've so far initiated combination studies. And we believe this
combination does have the potential to provide incremental benefit across the broad lung cancer population.
And as far as the earlier studies in the other four compounds we have in development, what I would say is they are
progressing, those exploratory studies. We will be seeing data this year. We've not decided yet whether we will actually
share that data publicly, because of the intense competitive situation. But, obviously, like we have during last year, if
we see interesting data, we will be moving fast to potentially registrational studies, and of course you'll be able to see
that in clinical trials. Thank you, Tim.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Tim, for the questions. Candace?
Operator
And your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Yeah, thank you very much for taking my question. Like to offer my congratulations to
Lamberto on a fantastic job, and best wishes to Giovanni, his next steps. If I may also ask on the I-O franchise, if you
could just remind us timelines for the 057 trial in the non-squamous population, when your best estimate is for when
you'll have data from the interim analysis. And then I was wondering if you were willing to provide any color about

your filing strategy for nivolumab in the second-line lung cancer study now that you have one positive trial obviously
in the squamous population? And then just a broader question. The PBMs and payers have been very focused on
hepatitis C. And now they seem to be setting their sights on oncology. And I was just wondering if, being the company
launching probably the highest-profile oncology drugs right now, if you had any reaction to that? Thank you so much.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Well, Mark, first of all, thank you for your nice words. I hope I will make one of your
videos with the same comments. And before Francis replies to your first, or first two questions and Charlie and
Giovanni to your third question, let me take the opportunity of saying a few things quickly about immunotherapy.
Because, in the last few weeks, we had – well, the last few weeks have been really very exciting for us at BMS, and
obviously for the patients. And while I'm really glad to see the potential of immunotherapy coming to fruition, first
with Yervoy and now with Opdivo, some of the strategic choices that we made when we fixed our development
program are putting us now in what we believe is a very strong competitive position.
We have always felt that it was important to address the broadest set of patients as possible. We have also always
believed in the importance of demonstrating overall survival, as this is what counts for patients, physicians, and payers.
And, at the same time, we have built – our R&D people have built optionality into our clinical trials. So while the trials
were designed to show survival, overall survival, we have flexibility in evaluating our endpoints, when they can
actually progress. And, finally, we've also always believed the important role for both monotherapy and combination
regimens. I've said all this because I believe that the recent results of our studies are validating our strategy.
And now, Francis, you want to answer the question on [ph] 056 – (25:11) 057, and Opdivo second line?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Good morning. Obviously, I was very pleased when the 017
study, the second-line squamous study, was stopped early. We are reviewing the data in house and with our experts in
lung cancer outside the company. We will be sharing the data with numerous regulatory authorities, and we believe it's
a very important event as – both for patients and for BMS. We've not made yet a decision when and where we will be
presenting that data.
As far as 057 is concerned, as you're aware, this is an event-driven study, which means that the patients – [ph] the
interim study (26:00) will be triggered once we reach the right number of events. It's also a different population to the
squamous population in the sense that there are more therapeutic options for these patients, and they tend to do better
with chemotherapy. So that's running behind – that's why that's running behind the 017 study.
We obviously remain very confident about our trial design and the potential for Opdivo in lung cancer. But, obviously,
like every other study, I'm looking forward to actually seeing the data before we can comment on what we'll do next.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Mark, this is Giovanni. Thank you for your comments. With respect to the PBMs and pricing
and access in general, first of all, let me say that we've been operating in an environment with headwinds from a pricing
and reimbursement perspective for quite some time. We understand that will continue, including the U.S. A good
example for us is Yervoy, where over the last few years, we were able to work with payers around the world very
proactively and effectively. And Yervoy today is really reimbursed in every market around the world according to
label, and access for patients has not been an issue.
So when we think about this issue going forward, obviously the first starting point is to have truly differentiating data
and product profiles. And that's one of the reasons why, for example, as Lamberto mentioned, we are focused on
overall survival as an endpoint for our trials. The second one really is working collaboratively with payers around the
world. We have a very strong history of having done that in the past, and we continue to look at that as a priority for us.
The third one is we price our products based on the value they offer to patients and the healthcare system. And, as
importantly, we have in the U.S. and other parts of the world one of the most comprehensive and most effective
reimbursement and patient support program in oncology in the industry. So we are very focused on pricing and access.
We are investing in this area, and we are going to be proactively addressing every one of the areas mentioned.

And your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you, and I offer my congratulations to Giovanni and Lamberto. Fantastic job. It's been a
pleasure, and I'm sure we'll continue to see each other. But question for you, Francis. I'm wondering if you could share
your observations about Merck's lung strategy, how your lung data and indications might compare to theirs? They seem
to have breakthrough designation in a population that accounts for 70% to 80% of lung compared to what we've seen
with you guys so far. So I'm wondering if you could just comment on that. And, secondly, can you help us to think
about – and maybe, Giovanni, this is for you – help us to think about the launch trajectory of this drug, Opdivo? How
do we think about – clearly what's going to drive sales will be label expansion. And how do we think about the timing
for label expansion? And are you going to the FDA with 017 now? Or are you planning to wait for the 057 to report
out? Thanks very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Jami. Happy New Year to you.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: I'm not going to comment really on Merck's strategy, but I would like to take the opportunity
to comment on ours. And we have a very broad development strategy in lung cancer, as you know. We have 10
ongoing studies. We have an 11th just about to start. That's the first-line combination study. And it's basically all
populations, all histology, all lines of therapy, and both PD-L1 positive and negative. So it's a very comprehensive
study, and I think it's important to note that we have actually made significant progress over the last year. I think I told
you all a year ago it's going to be a big year for data for Opdivo, and we would know a lot more about Opdivo at the
end of the year. And I think we've shown that, particularly the last few weeks, which have been very exciting.
So we completed the rolling submission for the third-line study in the United States. And, just to remind you, we did
make a submission and have it validated in Europe around the middle of the year. As you heard on the call, a couple of
weeks ago we announced that the squamous study had been stopped because Opdivo was superior in terms of overall
survival. And overall survival, we believe, is the gold standard in cancer and a very important attribute, we believe, of
bioagents such as Opdivo. And of course, this marks the first time that any PD-1 has shown overall survival in cancer.
It's not the first time we've shown superiority. We of course showed it earlier last year in melanoma as well. And, as I
just noted before, we're moving forward with the events proceeding in the non-squamous population, and we should, if
our projections are right, get to that by the middle of the year.
We also have a first line study under way. That started about a year ago. It is in PD-L1 positive patients, and it's our
intent to beat chemotherapy, double it in first line as we have already done in melanoma and in second-line squamous.
And just to round it out, I did mention again we will be starting a comprehensive study in first-line with our
combination in this half of the year. So a very broad program. I'm confident by the end of this next 12 months we are
going to have a approval in lung, and that we will have increasing submissions around the world. Thank you very
much.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Jami, this is Giovanni. Thank you. So with respect to launches and expectations for uptake,
let me maybe start by saying we're really excited about the approval we have received at the end of December in
advanced melanoma for Opdivo. And we started working on the launch and executing the launch immediately after the
approval. By year-end, we already had shipments in the market and our teams were actively promoting. And while it
clearly is early, we are very pleased that we have already reached 100% of our most important targets, and we have a
very high 70% market – share of voice in melanoma. That reflects the fact that we have been successfully
commercializing Yervoy over the last few years, and we've gained a lot of experience in immuno-oncology, and in the
U.S. market in particular.
So as we think about the future, obviously we are ready for potential future launches later this year in lung in the U.S.,
but we're also ready for launches in melanoma and lung in Europe as another key market. And we've made a lot of the
investments needed in order to make sure that our teams were properly staffed and ready to go. And, obviously, we will

follow a very similar strategy of educating physicians on Opdivo, immunotherapy, and the strength of our data.
I think it's important to remember that there is a significant percentage of the lung prescribing community which is
different from the melanoma prescribing community, and as a result of that, those physicians are probably at the
beginning of their learning curve with respect to immuno-oncology, and I think it will be important for us to do the
same education we did four years ago when we launched in melanoma.
When you put all of those things together, we're very optimistic about the future, but we obviously realize that there is
significant variability in 2015 because of timing of potential launches, the evolution of the label, and the speed of
uptake in different tumor types.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Jami, for the question. Candace, can we go to the next one, please?

And your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink. Your line is now open.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Oh, thanks very much. Thanks for the questions. And congratulations, Lamberto and
Giovanni, and congratulations to the whole team on the success of 017. As we think about the opportunity for
potentially accelerating uptake of Opdivo, the current indication is quite small. The third-line indication in lung also is
quite small at this point. But as we speak with payers, their feedback is that the incorporation of any of these products
into the NCCN guidelines or perhaps into a compendia listing could be critical to gaining access and allowing
physicians to prescribe more broadly. Can you talk a little bit about how that typically lines up without an FDA label,
and if there is an opportunity in your view – perhaps Giovanni could answer this one – to see that move forward? And
then separately, on a bigger-picture perspective – perhaps both Lamberto and Francis could comment on this a bit – but
the focus on immuno-oncology has been extremely successful. As you seek to build out in other areas, what are the
areas of focus? We've seen GDD, the genetic disorders, as a focus or derived diseases as a focus, and also fibrosis. Is
that really the direction we should see the company focus towards, and what types of business development would you
anticipate going forward? Thanks a lot.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Thanks, Seamus. This is Giovanni. Just to answer your first question on NCCN guidelines
and compendia listing, obviously, we are focused on delivering data from a number of Phase III well-controlled clinical
trials with overall survival as the primary endpoint. And we believe that over time, as the data evolve, it is very likely
that the NCCN and another groups may include that data in their guidelines and recommendations. From our
perspective, obviously, in terms of our promotional efforts, we will focus on the label indication, but as we've seen in
oncology, the strength of the data that emerges is often reflected in guidelines and pathways.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Yeah, and about the differentiation of our specialty portfolio, Seamus – I will let Francis
discuss the different alternatives. But it is clear that our first goal has been that of making our I-O presence strong and
deep and wide. And we'll continue to go in that direction. But, at the same time, we believe that what we are doing in
GDD, in fibrosis, in immunology, and in virology to a certain extent, are all possible new areas in which we can follow
the same strategy, so strong internal R&D, acquisitions of technologies, products, and an inclusion of research groups
into our own pipeline and team, and collaboration with other companies. And we are not at this point choosing one of
the areas, because it's premature to do so. So we are working on taking different directions with the same approach.
That seems to have worked out well for immuno-oncology. Francis?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Good morning, Seamus. So let me say we are very excited about what's going on outside of
I-O, and so for instance, at the end of last year, we moved in HIV attachment inhibitor novel compound into Phase III,
and of course this year we're going to be exploring further the immuno-stimulation in virology that our platform allows
us to do in immunocytes. In addition, our exploratory portfolio in immunocytes is progressing well. That's both
biologics and small molecules.
As you've seen, we've expanded our portfolio in fibrosis with a couple of year-end business development deals – one
with Calibr and one with Galecto – and during 2014, we moved a number of very novel compounds into the clinic. And

I think it's epitomized, really, our approach, this – what we did in GDD, where we brought forward an anti-Tau
antibody acquired from iPierian but also from our internal programs, a myostatin inhibitor in Duchenne muscular
dystrophy. So we're making progress across a number of these areas, and the pipeline really made some good
progressions in 2014. Thanks.

And your next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is now open.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Oh, thank you so much. I joined the call a bit late, so my apologies if these questions have
already been asked. But first, in the last 25 years or so, R&D at Bristol has only been down in two years. Now Bristol
has perhaps its best pipeline ever, and you're guiding for R&D to be down in 2015. I find that a bit surprising. So can
you tell us why that is the case, and is this a trend that we should look for to continue? And then secondly in melanoma,
Opdivo and Keytruda have similar indications, so what are you finding hospital formularies are doing? Are they
stocking both products, or are they stocking one over the other, and what is the mental process they're going through to
make the decision? Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Francis, do you want to comment with the R&D expense? But I can make a comment that
it is clear to me and it's clear to my management team and to my board that we will continue to finance adequately,
more than adequately, everything that makes sense. So our resources devoted to I-O and our resources devoted to [ph]
our AS (42:00) differentiation are there and will be spent in a productive way by Francis and his team.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So just to build on that, we certainly have a very full set of projects going forward into 2015,
and we continue to do a number of productivity initiatives to make sure that our investments, actually, are very, very
efficient.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Yeah, I would just add one other point, Steve, as I mentioned in my comments that we
also have a step down in our diabetes clinical trials, vis-à-vis the alliance that we have, so that's also impacting the
year-over-year spend.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: And this is Giovanni. From the perspective of formula listing and access for Opdivo, these
are clearly very early days, but we are starting from a position where we have established relationship with hospitals
and payers in the U.S. The early signals that we are seeing are quite positive. We have some initial good progress in
access, so we're working on it as a priority, but so far the first signals are positive.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Steve, for the questions. Can we go to the next question please, Candace?

And your next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is now open.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Yeah, three questions, if I could. Firstly, could you just remind me when we'll see the one
plus one data for the arm of Yervoy-Opdivo? Number two, if memory serves me correctly, the recent Nature papers
include a representation from diagnostics of all your competitors. From memory, I think Bristol's contribution was
lacking, and obviously your diagnostic for PD-L1 has not shown the same predictive benefit as others. To what extent
are you iterating that diagnostic? And, assuming there is a new diagnostic, when will it be ready for prime time? And
then in my last question is on bispecifics. Could you tell me when you're first bispecific I-O agent will be entering the
clinic? Many thanks.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Andrew. Let me go through these quickly. So the one and one data from the 012
study continues to mature. It's very informative. We have not made a decision when we might present it. For
competitive reasons, we may not present it this year.

I take issue with you over the fact that our diagnostic is not working. I think if you look at the data in our label and look
at Merck's label, it's very similar. So I think – and then the platform's the same, so I think we're showing exactly what
everyone else is showing. The difference is we've done a comprehensive program, and we're looking much more
comprehensively at both the negative and the positive patients, with the opportunity to get a label in both of those.
And finally, as far as far as bispecific, I only have a very broad preclinical program based in California, headed up by
Nils Lonberg, who's an acknowledged leader in this field. I'm very comfortable with the breadth of that. We will
certainly complement that with additional business developments. But as far as bispecifics, I think we'll take every
opportunity on its own merits. But we're certainly got plenty of monotherapy moving up into the – preclinical into the
clinic. Thanks, Andrew.

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Great. Thank so much. And thanks for taking my questions. So a couple, if I could. One just
on hep C. I think what you've said is that the filing in the U.S. is going to be based on data you already have and also
some ongoing studies. If that's correct, can you just clarify maybe when those studies would be done and when exactly
you think you'll be able to refile in the U.S.? And then my second question, following up on the earlier one on the
expense side, just wondering if you can maybe help break up some of the moving parts here. You mentioned the
diabetes impact this year. Also I'm sure currency having an impact this year. And then some of those might be more
broader, structural changes that might be more ongoing impacts we see in the expense line. So is there any way to just
sort of quantify? The expense numbers are quite a bit below what we were expecting, so how much of it is more of
these one-time type things for this year, and how much might be more of an impact going forward?
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Hey, Vamil. It's Charlie. Maybe I'll start on the expense side. So if you look at just the
exchange impact on expenses, where we guided, for example, A&P decreasing in the mid to high teen range, if you
excluded exchange, that would be a decrease in the mid to low teens range. Similarly with MS&A, that would be a
decrease in the mid to low single-digit range if you exclude FX. And then in R&D, it also had an impact related too of
almost 1% on how we think about R&D. As I mentioned in my comments, we are doing everything to invest in our
opportunities, in our new launches, as well as the critical brands within our key portfolio, but we've also, following the
exit of the diabetes business, we also took the opportunity to reorganize and take expenses out, particularly in our
mature brands. So it's a combination of all those things, and plus the last add was what I had mentioned earlier around
the diabetes expenses having a step down in R&D year-over-year. Francis?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Vamil, good morning. Just to remind you, our approach, our strategy with daclatasvir has
been to focus on difficult-to-treat patients around the world, and that's the same in the United States. We have a
complete response letter. We're talking to the FDA about the answers to that, and I'm not going to go into detail except
to say that no new data will be required to make a submission. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. And, first, I just wanted to add my congratulations to both
Lamberto and Giovanni with the new roles there. A couple quick ones here. Maybe, first, can you elaborate on the
dynamics between Yervoy and the PD-1s in melanoma as we think about 2015? Just a little bit more about how you
think that dynamic plays out. Second, staying on melanoma, any updates on the 069 study and the ability for Bristol to

file off that data? And the final one, just broadening out a little bit on the diagnostics. Do you expect the FDA to
recommend testing for PD-L1 status for non-small cell lung cancer patients? And with the number of different assays
and even definitions of what PD-L1 positive means, how do you see that dynamic playing out in the marketplace as we
think out over the next few years and seeing multiple agents enter the market? Thanks very much.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: So, Chris, good morning, and thank you. This is Giovanni. Let me just start with the
melanoma space. And first of all, we are coming out of a very strong year and a very strong quarter for Yervoy. In the
fourth quarter, we grew 41%, over 30% in the U.S. versus prior year. And that's driven by the fact that we've
established a really strong presence in melanoma, with 60% of our sales coming from the community setting and about
70% of our sales coming from first line. So we have a really strong base there. I would say that we expect the
melanoma market to be evolving rapidly over the next 12 to 24 months. And, obviously, as a result of that, like I
mentioned earlier, we see some uncertainty and volatility in the short term, but we actually feel very good, very well
about our prospects in melanoma, because we have two agents which in monotherapy both have demonstrated survival,
and we have a combination strategy which really has the potential to provide long-term survival to a very significant
percentage of patients. And so some short-term volatility, but from a very strong starting point and with very positive
prospects in the medium and the long term.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Chris, good morning. So let me just comment on the 069 study. I'm very encouraged by the
data that I've seen. We've not yet decided where we will present that data, but it will be this year. I'm not going to talk
about the details of our [indiscernible] (51:07) strategy, but let me just zoom out a little bit and just mention our overall
melanoma strategy. I mean, I'd just remind you, we have accelerated review for monotherapy in Europe. We're in the
process of filing both second line and/or first line around the world, and the combo is a part of that broader strategy;
we're talking to authorities about the potential submissions there. So I'm looking forward to the rest of 2015, because I
think you're going see further submissions, further approvals around the world, and potentially broadening of our label.
So it's very exciting for us in melanoma during 2015.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Chris. I know we're backed up against another call. I think, we, Candace, have time
for two more questions we'll try to squeeze in.
Operator
All right. Your next question comes from John Boris with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions, and I would also like to extend my congratulations to both
Lamberto and Giovanni. First has to do with your I-O franchise. Certainly with you having a clinical development lead,
one advantage you potentially have is survival data, not only in melanoma, but potentially in lung, possibly renal in the
future. Can you help me understand how long you might have that benefit, because you did run well-controlled Phase
III clinical trials, and having survival versus a competitor that doesn't have survival data, how does that play with
oncologists in the marketplace?
Second question has to do with Eliquis, just on new-to-brand share with cardiologists, can you articulate a percentage
there? You mentioned that broadening of the label was important in terms of expanding that, and is that surpassing
Xarelto now?
And then last question just has to do with M&A very quickly. Can you maybe give some additional color, especially
since you're potentially being viewed as not as diversified as you historically have been, when you're looking at deals,
are you looking at smaller- or larger-scale transactions to either diversify the business or to further position the business
in oncology going forward? Thanks.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, John, this is Giovanni. On I-O, we believe that having overall survival is very
meaningful. And in our experience, it's obviously very meaningful to payers. It is important for prescribing physicians,
and it obviously is essential for patients. So we are very focused on that, as Lamberto and Francis mentioned, as a very,
very important part of our strategy.

The second comment on Eliquis. We're very pleased with our performance in the U.S. and other parts of the world.
Specifically in the U.S., we've seen that the expansion of the label to include VTE treatment has accelerated the growth
of our prescribers base and also accelerated our trends in primary care. Our focus remains primarily in cardiology, and
our new-to-brand share in cardiology, including VTE and atrial fibrillation, in the quarter in the U.S. has grown from
41% to 47%, which is a leading position.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: And as far as BD is concerned, I can't say that nothing has changed. From my discussions
with Giovanni and Charlie, it's been evolving all the time. We'll not change – size is not the most important aspect. The
most important aspect is fit with our portfolio, fit our goals, and good science. And we continue to look at all of these
things, and they must make also good financial sense.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, John, for the questions. And Candace, can we go to the last question, please?
Operator
And your last question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and I'll add my congratulations as well for the transformation we've seen with the
company. A question on your gross margin guidance of 74% in 2015. It seems low compared to where you are at 78%
right now. Is it mostly Abilify, and is this a one-time dip in 2015? Because we expect your overall product mix to
basically offset the impact of Eliquis. And a follow-up on the earlier questions: Could you give us a little bit more color
on your revenue expectations for Opdivo and hep C in 2015? Your guidance suggests you have a conservative outlook
there. Thank you.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: Okay, I'll start on gross margin, and maybe Giovanni can touch on the revenue. Abilify,
as I mentioned in my comments, is a high-margin product for us, and we lose almost the entirety of that in April of this
year. Eliquis also, which is a growing product for us, also has a very low margin because of our relationship with
Pfizer, so we have to be below a 50% margin. And as we've said all along, our gross margin percentage is solely a
function of product mix. So, over time, depending upon which products and their margin grow faster vis-à-vis others,
that will have an impact on our margin. So it's hard to say at this point, at this juncture, as we're launching Opdivo,
which has its very decent margin, how our margin will play out over the longer term.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: And from the perspective of revenues, as I said before, first of all we're really very excited
about the potential for growth of the franchise. And we are getting ready for potential multiple launches in the U.S. and
Europe. But, obviously, there is a degree of variability in our forecast because of the timing of launches over the course
of the next 12 months.
Lamberto Andreotti
Okay. So we understand that Pfizer is waiting for you. So we'll let you go.
And I want just to conclude by saying that we had a good fourth quarter and a good overall year. Across the
organization, we delivered strong results, and that enables us to hit the ground running in 2015. I'm very happy and
very proud of what we achieved and very confident in what we'll achieve. Thank you and have a good day.
