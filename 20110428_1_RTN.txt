MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. My name
is Alicia, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will
conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference call is being recorded for
replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor
Relations. Please proceed.
Todd Ernst
Thank you Alicia. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first-quarter conference call. The
results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on
our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version
of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial
Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and

expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.
With that I will turn the call over to Bill.
William H. Swanson
Thank you Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon delivered solid operating results in the quarter. Booking, sales,
margin and cash flow generation all exceeded our expectations. This is especially notable given the headwind from one
of the longest periods under continuing resolution on record, which started last October and ended this month.
During the quarter our team worked closely with the customer in order to minimize any impact from funding delays.
This effort was mandatory to keep our programs on schedule and cost. Further, our focus on cost-efficiencies and
execution resulted in solid operational performance in the quarter. Thus we are able to reaffirm our sales, adjusted EPS
and cash flow guidance for the year.
We continue to focus on international where we see strong demand for our products. For example, our international
bookings were 28% for the quarter, threat levels remain high and our customers continue to turn the Raytheon for
cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions to address the rapidly evolving requirements. In the quarter
international accounted for 25% of total sales and grew by 7%. Our international national pipeline remains robust for
the remainder of the year. The pipeline includes UAE TPY-2 ground radar, Taiwan Patriot and additional international
missile sales including Patriot upgrades to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Our classified business continues to be strong as well with sales increasing by 26% in the quarter. The vast majority of
which was organic. Let me take a minute to talk about some key highlights from the quarter. IDS was awarded $107
million U.S. Air Force designed contract for the Space Fence system. Space Fence is the future of space situational
awareness and we will provide our customers with enhanced capability to track and detect space objects. This program
extends our core radar capabilities into an exciting new application. Whether it's ground-based radars like Space Fence
or Sea Base like our recent down select on air and missile defense radar, AMDR, or airborne like our upgraded F-15,
F-18 and AESA radars.
Raytheon's radar franchise continues to generate opportunities for growth and value creation.
Earlier this month, the Raytheon SM-3 program had its 19th successful intercept. This operational test demonstrated the
key role Raytheon plays in missile defense. During this test the Raytheon built TPY-2 ground based radar
autonomously detected and tracked the target. This track information was data linked to a U.S. Navy destroyer that
launched the Raytheon SM-3 Block 1A missile, which successfully intercepted an intermediate range ballistic missile
target.
This concept of forward based sensor queuing the shooter is called launch-on-remote. This is important because the
concept is a central capability of Phased Adaptive Approach, PAA, for Europe and it demonstrates how the integration
of remotely deployed sensors and shooters greatly expands the battle space and defended area against the broader range
of ballistic missile threats. As part of the secondary objectives of this test, the Raytheon build sensor on the space
tracking surveillance system and the sea-based X-Band radar participated in the test and successfully tracked the target.
Near the end of the first quarter the missile defense agency awarded Raytheon Missile Systems a $312 million contract
for the advanced capabilities for the next iteration of the SM-3 missile, the Block 1-B. The continued evolution of
Raytheon sensors and interceptors brings innovative missile defense solutions to the U.S. forces and our allies. When
you look at Raytheon's capabilities in radars, interceptors and command and control, it becomes evident that we are
involved in all aspects of missile defense. Our capabilities are truly a national asset and we're proud of the key role we
play in defending the U.S. and its allies.

Shifting gears, I want to point out that we remain committed to pursuing a balanced and disciplined approach to capital
deployment. During the quarter, we raised the dividend for the seventh consecutive year, this year by 15%. We also
repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock and completed the acquisition of Applied Signal Technologies; AST brings a
rich set of capabilities to the Raytheon family, particularly in the EW and cyber markets where we expect future
growth. Integration remains on track and we welcome the new team members from AST.
We also strive every day to maximize the value we bring to our customers. This includes being as efficient as possible.
Once again, you can see the results in our margin performance. And as I've said before, our focus in this area is part of
our DNA. To that end, we are pursuing a broad range of initiatives across the enterprise to maximize efficiency,
including optimizing supply chain operations and further leveraging our shared services model. This follows on our
drive over the past few years to improve our focus on operational working capital, which has yield significant cash flow
improvements.
As you can see from the quarterly results, Raytheon continues to deliver solid operating performance. The depth and
breadth of our portfolio, the agility and dedication of our team, and our focus on operational excellence continue to
provide the foundation for our continued performance. These advantages also position us well to convert future
challenges to opportunities. We have a proven strategy, best-in-class capabilities, an outstanding team to meet our
customer's needs.
And now I'll turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks Bill. So I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights and then we'll move on to
questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. Okay, if everyone
would please move to page 3.
As Bill noted, we performed well in the first quarter bookings, sales, marketing, cash flow generation, all exceeded our
expectations. We achieved solid performance in light of the challenging environment posed by the continuing
resolution.
Additionally, as Bill noted, both international bookings and sales were strong. Our adjusted EPS of $1.38 was up 10%
driven by capital deployment actions and operational improvements. Adjusted operating margin was 12.5% up 10 basis
points. Sales were $6.1 billion, which I'll discuss further in just a moment.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $69 million was better than our previous guidance due to the timing
of collections particularly at our technical services business. You may recall that we implemented our Apex SAP
financial system upgrade at TS in the first quarter. The process was virtually seamless and we were able to realize
better than anticipated billings and related collections.
During the quarter the company repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock for $312 million. In addition, our
Board of Directors increased the company's annual dividend rate by 15% to $1.72 per share; we've now increased the
dividend for seven consecutive years. Also as we previously announced in the first quarter of 2011, the company
completed the acquisition of Applied Signal Technology, which is being integrated into our Space and Airborne
Systems business. For the year, we expect solid sales growth and strong operational performance. I'll discuss guidance
in a few minutes.
Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Our total company bookings
for the quarter were $5.1 billion. We continue to see the order book improving in late Q2 and early Q3. From a cadence
standpoint we expect the book-to-bill to expand as we move through the year resulting in a full-year book-to-bill ratio
of 1.06 to 1.08 times.
Notable bookings in the first quarter included $131 million at IDS to provide engineering services support for a Patriot
air and missile defense program for U.S. and international customers and $107 million for the development on the

competitively awarded Space Fence program for the U.S. Air Force. IIS books $347 million for the development of the
Joint Polar Satellite System for NASA. Missile systems booked $375 million for the development and production of
SM-3 for the missile defense agency and $177 million for the production of Excalibur for the U.S. Army and an
international customer.
During the quarter, SAS booked $782 million on an international program. Technical services booked $87 million for
domestic training and $63 million for foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS program. TS also
booked $150 million to provide operational and logistics support to the Polar Mission for the National Science
Foundation.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $33.7 billion compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2010.
If you'd now move to page 5, sales were ahead of our expectations. Looking at sales by business, IDS had first quarter
2011 net sales of $1.2 billion. As we expected the change in IDS sales was primarily due to lower sales on the Zumwalt
program as a result of the revised funding profile, which I spoke about on the last call. This impact is expected to be
approximately $300 to $400 million for the full year.
IIS's first quarter 2011 net sales of $750 million. The increase in net sales was essentially driven by the GPS OCX
program. Missile systems and technical services both had sales in line with the same period last year.
NCS had net sales of $1.1 billion, the change in net sales was primarily due to the planned decline in production of a
U.S. Army sensor program. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 16% driven by
growth in classified business and an international airborne tactical radar program.
Moving ahead to page 6, we are pleased by our overall company margin performance, once again showing
year-over-year improvement from an operational perspective. Our adjusted margin was up 10 basis points at 12.5%.
And if you exclude the AST integration and acquisition related costs, adjusted company margins would have been
12.7%.
So looking at business margins, IDS, Missile Systems, NCS and TS margins were up in the quarter compared with the
same period last year, the result of solid operating performance. Technical services was extremely strong, driven not
only by a continued focus on efficiency improvements but also by a favorable contract modification, a contract
extension and a legal settlement, which are not expected to recur. And at IIS, year-over-year margins were up 30 basis
points over last year's first quarter excluding the UKBA letters of credit adjustment. I'll talk more about this in just a
moment.
At SAS the change in margins was primarily due to $13 million of acquisition and integration related costs for Applied
Signal Technology. This impacted SAS' margins by approximately 100 basis points. Overall the company continues to
perform well.
Let me now take a minute to address the unilateral decision to draw down on the letters of credit by the UK Border
Agency in connection with the filing of their claim as part of the arbitration process. I want to be clear that from our
perspective, our assessment of the situation hasn't changed. While we do not believe the LLC draw was appropriate, the
arbitration panel's decision effectively deferred a final determination until the end of the arbitration and found that the
validity of the draw is now inextricably tied-up with all of the issues in the arbitration. Consequently the accounting
rules require that we write-off the full $80 million.
The fact is the e-border system is operating successfully and delivering actionable intelligence. The system now screens
more than 120 million-passenger journeys per year, representing more than half of the traffic entering and leaving the
country. As of April 15th, the UK Border Agency is now operating the system. With that said, this action shouldn't take
away from the underlying strength of our overall performance in the quarter.
Turning now to page 7, first quarter 2011, adjusted EPS of $1.38 was up 10%. The increase was driven by capital
deployment actions, specifically share repurchases and operational improvements.

On page 8, you'll see that we are reaffirming the financial outlook for 2011 that we provided in January for net sales,
adjusted EPS and cash flow from continuing operations. We have updated the guidance for the full-year 2011 EPS
from continuing operations to reflect the accounting impact of the UKBA LLC adjustment. We expect growth in sales
in the range of $25.5 billion to $26.3 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.50 to $5.65.
Moving to page 9, our outlook by business is unchanged from our previous guidance for the year except for the
margins of IIS for the reasons I just discussed. The key take-away here is that our strong and diverse portfolio is driving
sales growth and solid margin performance.
On page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and
operating cash flow from continuing operations. We saw good performance in the first quarter compared to both Q1
2010, and also the initial outlook for Q1 2011 that we provided back in January. Some of this improvement was driven
by timing.
Okay, now let me summarize the first quarter from an operational perspective, we had solid sales in a challenging
environment, strong margins, EPS and cash flow. Our shareholder focus was again highlighted by increasing the
dividend by 15% and repurchasing $312 million of common stock. Our balance sheet remains strong, we are confident
as we look ahead.
We fully expect our solid results both from a program performance and a financial perspective to continue. We are well
aligned with the priorities of the DOD. This was again proven out by the signing of the FY'11 and the submission of the
FY'12 defense budgets. We fully expect this to be the case longer term. We continue to expand our international
presence and we have a broad range of near and long-term opportunities in the pipeline.
The fact is that we continue to improve margins over time, which in large part reflects our unrelenting focus on
performance and cost efficiencies. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to invest
in value creating opportunities, in addition to capital deployment priorities that together directly enhance and improved
shareholder value.
With that Bill and I will open up the call up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Dave you just talked about the flow of earnings in the quarter and it clearly looks like you
pulled some business forward. Could you get into a little bit more detail, you talked about timing, I think if we go back,
look at your old guidance and the old percentages that you gave, on an operating or continuing ops basis you would
have earned $1.03, you earned $1.22, when I back out the $0.16. And, so if you could talk a little bit about that and
perhaps why when you have, I think, the fewest working day's in the fourth quarter, you get the highest earnings there?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. Okay. So we did see good performance in the first quarter both compared to last
year's first-quarter and compared to our initial outlook. It's important to note that some of this was due to the timing of
improvements that we had expected in the second quarter. That accounts for about $0.05 or $0.06. It was driven, I
would say, principally by SAS volume and otherwise spread across the other businesses. It still early in the year and the
outlook for growth in 2011 that we provided, again reflects our best estimates of the range of results we expect to
deliver.

Now we did speak about this back in January. The timing of new awards this year drives the ramp up in the back half
of the year. Again, this is consistent with where we were a few months ago and I agree that we've started off very
strong, but given the cadence that we expect to see throughout the year we're quite comfortable with the second through
fourth quarters. As far as comps are concerned, I think you always have to look at the starting point relative to what
happened in the last year's second half particularly the third and fourth quarters. So from a comparison standpoint it's
not quite as pronounced as the numbers might otherwise suggest.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. And just from a detail perspective, you got this volume increase at SAS, you've got
Applied Signal there. You talked about classified growth, yet the margins came down almost 200 bibs, 100 of that is
explained by the integration, what else is going on there?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. Well, SAS continues to perform well as it has over the last number of years, you
talked about the 100 basis points essentially that impacted the business through the AST integration. Other than that
there is timing and mix of programs, we still expect healthy margin for the balance of the year. There is nothing
remarkable going on in the first quarter, it's simply just a timing and mix issue.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Troy Lahr from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Hi. Thanks. I wondered if you can a little bit about the continued resolution, and maybe how
much that impacted the first quarter from a sales and your booking standpoint?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, it's Bill. Let me try and do that. First, I would say it's not an exact science because
we have so many programs, but as near as we can look at it. We figured that the CR had an effect of about $500 million
in bookings and probably about $200 million in sales.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Okay. And then lastly from an international bookings standpoint, are your seeing anything get
shifted out to the right or put on long-term hold I would say?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, from our standpoint, the pipeline is rich. I can run through them real quick if you
want.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Sure.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks. Okay. I thought I'd ask. From my standpoint, clearly if we go around the globe
here and we take a look at the Mideast has increased activity for us. On Saudi Config-3 we're working to upgrade the
existing fire units over there. They've got 20. We're currently in final negotiations over there; we should be able to wrap
it up shortly and then go for congressional notification, so from my standpoint probably in the next few months we see
that coming home.
We've got TPY-2 radars in UAE from our standpoint there. A couple of radars, we expect that probably in the fall of
this year, maybe in the $500 million, $600 million range. Further on Patriot, we've got Taiwan and Kuwait. Both of
those are expected in the latter part of the year, as Dave talked about, as we ramp up at the end. We've got Paveway's
that there is demand maybe $500, $600 million that we see in various countries around the world as they use that
particular system.
Our air traffic control business around the world clearly is getting some attention. People want to make sure that we've
got the capability to track all the targets there and we see about $200 million worth of business in that area, missiles is
strong, we expect $400 million to $500 million in sales around the world. Training that continues to be strong
international, maybe $200 million to $300 million there.

And finally sometime this year as we get through elections and everything in Turkey, we expect an announcement in
that area and Turkey Patriots are roughly about $2 billion, to take a little bit of time to walk you through some of the
opportunities we see internationally. That also discounts tens of millions of contracts, various small ones that we've got
in 80 countries around the world. So we have not seen a cancellation, and for us the back-end was really loaded
because that's when we expected these international orders to come in.
<Q - Troy J. Lahr>: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Howard Rubel from Jeffries. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Hi. Two questions. Bill, I'm going to break the ice on one of them because it's the elephant
in the room. Is the guy that signed the UK border contract now in South Pole running the business down there. Could
you elaborate a little bit more on what are the risks you have left? And I know this is big irritant to you but it's kind of
an unfortunate charge?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Because this is really an accounting event and our assessment of the case hasn't changed,
I'll really ask Dave to address that portion; and Dave is with me here in Waltham. So that will at least explain that
Dave's okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So Howard, I think the first part of your question is appropriate, but we can't comment on
the movement of personnel around the world and I'm sure you can appreciate that. So as we sit here today, we don't see
a basis for any additional positive or negative adjustments until the Tribunal's decision which is expected in 2013. I
hope that answers your question.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Then the follow-up is you talked about some very good classified business growth and some
pretty impressive international growth despite not bringing home any of these big contracts that are in the works. Could
you address a little bit the domestic business, which obviously was the core domestic business which is down, is some
of that timing or is it some of it run-off of contracts that it's just the nature of the beast?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Howard, it's Bill, I think a lot of it is timing. There was a lot of consternation, I would say
in the building the – it was hard for our customers to figure out when the CR was going to end, they were trying to fund
at the 80% level, there couldn't be any new starts really during the period. So domestically as an engineer put in our
[ph] seat time (27:53) constant and just delayed things. And so from our standpoint we haven't been troubled by the
loss of anything; in fact the opposite is true, our win rates are plus 70% or better in both programs in dollars. So to
answer your question, it's been more of a delay factor. And we've got one of our programs, an EW, got booked
immediately right after the resolution for about $85 million. So we see some things starting to move and we expect in
the missile area that will continue and then we've got a couple of new homeland security opportunities that should
come to fruition here because we're in negotiations as we speak.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: If that helps.

<Q - Peter Arment>: Yes, good morning, Bill and Dave. On TS, Dave, they have very strong margin performance,
any one-time items in there, or is it all operational?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, there are some items that will not recur. I think when you stand back they obviously
posted the strongest margins certainly in the last 10 years at over 10%. When you peel back the items that won't occur
again at least for the balance of the year and looking into next year. The margins come down to about the mid-high 8%
range. That's part one.
Part two is they'll also be starting up some new awards as we go throughout the year and we'll be booking those new
awards at rates that are expected to be lower than where we would possibly end up over time. So the business is
continuing to perform well. There is a tremendous focus in that area on cost efficiencies and productivity and we are
satisfied with that business overall.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Okay. And then Bill, thank you for the international bookings kind of rundown. Is your target
still that you expect roughly a 30% mix for the year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, we expect international to be about 28% to 30%, sales to be about 23% to 25%.
We see that on track, our bookings for the year at $27 billion plus or minus $500 million is still also on track with the
international mix being what I stated earlier, if that helps.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Yes. No it does help. You mentioned a lot of these countries. It sounds like there is going to be
some contract awards this year, but there was a proposal out in February that, I guess, Germany was going to give some
surplus back to Poland. And I guess the numbers that were thrown out there, that modernization would be upwards of
$1 billion for Poland. Have you seen any movement further from that I guess given maybe some further fallout from
the [ph] EMEA (31:03) decision here domestically?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, we see increased attention to Patriot given the [ph] EMEA's (31:11) decision and
countries realize that Patriot is still the premier system in the world for handling all three kinds of threats. So from our
standpoint if you think about it, Korea actually started with the same kind of assets and we've upgraded those and
Korea is now part of the Patriot family here. And Poland we'd like to see in the same position or any other country. It's
got a great heritage and it's now one of the most modern air defense systems in the world given the upgrades that we
put in for UAE.
<Q - Peter Arment>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, Bill.

you talked about the $80 million letter of credit, there was also a $70 million receivable. Is there anything that would
trigger a write down or change in that as you look forward?

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: When you calculate the cash impact of a letter of credit are you considering that in your cash
from operations or are you counting that separately kind of as financing activity?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, it's in cash from operations and it was impacted in the second quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then just last question is really on some of the international contract awards that
Bill you just mentioned, a lot of those are going to take some time to actually impact sales. So the ramp-up in the
second half in terms of sales are probably not those international Patriot awards. So what's really coming in that would
help accelerate the sales growth in the second half?
<A - William H. Swanson>: It's a combination, what I would say is some of those will have an effect, they won't have
a big effect. Anything to do with Patriot or Paveway or any of those programs have an immediate ramp up. Because
we've already built them before, we have a supply base, you have to realize that we are in constant contact with our
supply chain, so that we want to make sure they are ready, we're ready; are the orders all stacked and ready to go? And
we pride ourselves on getting a quick jump once we start. And that's factored into the contracts, and our customers
know it because some of these systems they want as quick as we can get it to them.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning Robert.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bill, on the UK thing again, in your judgment has this arbitration process and the letter of
crediting had any impact on your relationship with the British customer?
<A - William H. Swanson>: We deal primarily with the Ministry of Defense and I can tell you we are in their top 1, 2,
3 or 4 as far as suppliers and we are proud of our relationship with the Ministry of Defense and it's been a good one, a
long term one and we continue to view them as a great partner.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And then Dave on the share buyback, how do you expect the cadence of the buyback to
progress through the year? Have you started fairly low and expect it to pick up as you go through the year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, it's a fair question but I can't specifically talk about the cadence. We did provide
full-year guidance from a diluted share standpoint, ending the year somewhere between 353 million and 359 million
shares outstanding. That still holds and I'm comfortable with that, but it will be parsed out, obviously. We were a little
over 300 million in the first quarter and we still would expect to be in that range as we close out the year.

<Q - Doug S. Harned>: You are continuing to deliver very, very good margins here. Could you comment on the
contracting environment right now, this has been something obviously we've talked about over the past year or so, but
are you seeing any changes? It seems like you're able to keep pushing this forward, is there more upside here?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, Doug, what I would say is the question is really on margins and not only are they
sustainable, but our customers have repeatedly told us and me, they are willing to pay for performance. In fact, we see
more of our contracts incentivizing us to do much more, and for me that gives us an opportunity to perform even better.
Last year, we had about 57% of our contracts were fixed price, 43% were cost type. And so for us this environment and
the fixed price is not something that bothers us. I think for some companies that have been predominantly cost plus
switching to fixed price probably gives them pause. But what we take on, the fact that we understand our
manufacturing readiness levels, our technical readiness levels and we measure those when we bid, and the fact that
we've got 8,000 programs or 15,000 contracts gets us very comfortable with this process. And we've worked hard for a
number of years, I think you know our mantra is performance here, and that's the best possible position you could be in
at this point in time.
You always worry that there is one program manager that will try and solve the entire defense budget and the nation's
economy on one contract, but our job here is to make sure that we're netted together in the company and we get to that.
And I can say those on the acquisition side from Ash Carter down, their lines and office doors are open and we are able
to go in and talk to them if something doesn't seem reasonable. So there is a lot of swirl but from our standpoint we
have processes here, we know how to hedge -- execute, we've got program managers. And there is always going to be a
one-off and that's where management's job comes in to make sure that both sides understand what needs to be done.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: And when you look forward over the next two to three years, how would you describe your
mix changing in terms of development versus production or in terms of fixed price versus cost plus?
<A - William H. Swanson>: We might see more on the fixed price especially since some of the large international
orders would be that way, which is good for the company and good for our customers. And that wouldn't give me any
kind of pause because people know how we perform internationally. It's a large community but I always say it's one of
the smallest in the international world; everybody knows how you're performing. And I'm happy to say there isn't a
place in the country or the world that I have a concern, where we do business, about visiting and talking about
Raytheon's performance.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Is there a shift on your domestic work toward fixed price as well?
<A - William H. Swanson>: From our standpoint a preponderance of it really is already fixed price, if you look at
some of our missile business, you look at our radars, you look at our communication or network or our training, it's
already that way. The cost plus is really in the development area, some of the classified area and clearly the margins in
those areas reflect cost plus. But we are also seeing now, which I am excited about, some opportunities in cost plus to
be incentivized to even do more. And that's exciting to us because as President Kennedy said about 50 years ago, we do
things because they are hard, not because they're easy. And when they're hard they bring together the talents and the
resources of this company to knock it out of the park.

<A - William H. Swanson>: We knew that, we could see what was going on.
<Q - Joseph F. Campbell>: That tricky Raytheon stuff...
<A - William H. Swanson>: I am just kidding.
<Q - Joseph F. Campbell>: Yeah. Bill, a couple of folks have said in the procurement side in the various military
departments that they have some apprehension about being able to get all the RFPs out and all this stuff obligated by
the end of the government's fiscal year. And I was wondering how you felt about, I mean, now that they've got their
money, they have to basically get a year's worth of work done in a half a year. Where do you see the areas that you are
not worried about, where you think they were well prepared for this and are there other areas that look like they're more
challenged?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I would say the larger programs are probably more challenged because of the
visibility. It's hard on the acquisition teams, mainly with things that happened in the past that the tendency is to be a lot
more cautious. So the bigger programs are getting more visibility, but if you look at our portfolio, I think we only have
two programs over 500 million in sales last year, the predominance of our stuff is smaller programs. We see those
continuing to move. And right now clearly our teams are side-by-side seeing what we can do to work together, since
we've been delayed for a few months here, what can we do to expedite everything? And I think if people remember
kind of what I talked about on the calls last year, was how Raytheon could take cycle time out of our processes. And
we've worked hard over the last four or five months, actually longer than that, so last year to streamline both our
international and our domestic processes. So we could take and shorten our cycle, so if the government increased in any
way, the overall cycle would look the same if you know what I mean.
<Q - Joseph F. Campbell>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - William H. Swanson>: This is something we've actually anticipated and now that the budget's signed for fiscal
year '11 especially in areas of [ph] EWI, SR Cyber (42:53) and Missile Defense. We're off moving hard to get those
moving because that's where the attention is.
<Q - Joseph F. Campbell>: And then on a same, similar, kind of what's going on in the Pentagon line. How do you --
what are your insights into what the Pentagon will do with this -- Obama directed $400 billion over, I mean, will it
show up all out in the back years so we won't care? Or will they actually sort of start all over again and potentially take
a fair chunk up front? And I guess we now know it's going to be Panetta and Gates is out. So inevitably there'll be some
differences between the desks and how they approach this. But any insights that will help us sort of sort out whether
this is potentially a big thing in the 2013 budget or it's probably not?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, since I'm not in charge, this will make it really hard, but let me start off by first
saying...
<Q - Joseph F. Campbell>: Just -- everybody is entitled to have an opinion and you're knowledgeable. So we'll take it
at that.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. I'll start-off by saying it's great to have someone as Secretary of Defense, Gates'
stature is being succeeded by someone with a breadth of experience like Leon Panetta. Panetta brings a wealth of
experiences; the former Chairman of the House Budget Committee, the Director of OMB, Director of the CIA and the
White House Chief of Staff. He has got a broad based experience to tap into and if anybody understands a budget
process, he sure does.
With that in mind given that the President has asked for $400 billion, if I was in charge it would be consistent with -- I
think what Secretary Gates has said that you got to first start-off with your roles and missions. What are we need to do,
what is expected at DOD and how do they go about doing that?
Once you understand it, then you can put a price tag associated with that. And that's the right way to go do it. And if the
roles and missions are agreed to when the price tag is higher then you got to go and cut some things out. And I think it's
going to be an iterative process, it will take longer, it'll be more in the out period than it would be in the inside period,

because clearly as a nation I think it would be hard for the President to ask DOD or the military to do something and
somebody say, well, that's not budgeted or that's not we're expected to do. And Libya is probably a good example of
that. So it is a complicated world, we have a great military, they have responded whenever asked and they do it in a
decisive manner.
So to answer your question specifically, I'd probably say latter rather than sooner because it's complicated. And Gates
did the right thing by looking at the budget, ahead of time and figuring out how to get money out of it early. And he has
made some tough calls. And as someone in this industry, I applaud him because once you understand what the calls are
then you can right size your business, you can double check your strategy, you can look at things and take action; it's
the unknown that keeps you from making the right decisions.

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Access 342. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hey, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Dave, I wanted to pursue a little bit more the fourth quarter revenues, I mean, because the
way it looks is you're projecting anywhere from 5% to 10% revenue growth despite the fact that you got five less days
in the quarter. So maybe you can be a little bit more specific in terms of orders that you expect like Saudi Patriot, how
much revenue is assumed in those fixed to fourth quarter guidance, how much revenue is assumed from quarters yet to
be gotten?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, I think the way I can answer that is similar to what Bill addressed earlier. From a
booking cadence standpoint we've just that with respect to the way we see some of these international programs, as
well as domestic programs being layered in, so say late Q2, early Q3 and then the balance of the year. What's important
here to note is that we will effectively ramp very quickly once these orders are placed. I don't think it's probably
appropriate to start dissecting on an award by award basis.
But at this stage George, we've looked at it pretty closely and we're comfortable with the third and fourth quarter
revenue profile. So that's the comfort we can give you at this point. And frankly we started-off the year stronger than
we expected and we are going to continue to push in that direction.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then just one other. David, if I kind of look at what Bill said about increase in
international and the 26% growth in classified sales, it works out that the domestic sales had to be down around 8%
give or take a little bit and that would be more than just the $100 million decline in Zumwalt. So what other programs
domestically are effectively declining?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, the CR was basically domestic for a couple of hundred million dollars, I think maybe
that's what's lost in the arithmetic there. So between Zumwalt and the CR, that made up $300 million to $350 million of
the decline.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Actually let me get one last quick one for you. You had a very low corporate [ph] in
elimin (49:17) in the first quarter, $37 million but you left the guidance at $260 to $285 for the year. So were there
some benefit in this quarter or what's going to cause some of these subsequent quarters to increase dramatically from
the first quarter level?

Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up first on George's last question and focus on
Turkey in particular, because it seems like it would be, if it is a couple of million dollar booking, it's a big chunk of
your international bookings for the year. And I think last quarter you thought it was an year-end decision and I think the
elections have pushed it out to later this year and given the way those things go, we just want to kind of belt how much
of Turkey is in this year in terms of a revenue exposure?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Almost nothing.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. That we are looking towards the latter end of the year from potential awards
standpoint. So the Turkey Patriot program is not a significant revenue driver this year.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay. Great. And then a follow-up, Bill you commented on the Sea-Based missile defense
success, and I know the DOD is extremely happy with the sensor hand off you helped with in that test. But can you
give us some perspective on the ground-based missile defense performance over the last quarter with the January test
failure and kind of some of the reports that we're pointing towards the EKV as a contributor?
<Q - Myles Walton>: Yeah. There is a component in the EKV that's there that we're going through the -- what they
call an FRB a Failure Review Board. And between MDA the supplier and us and others, we're going through to make
sure we absolutely understand what happened there. And everything else in that particular program is moving forward,
some of the confusion is that people think it's a dead stop. That's really not the case.
When you go through something like this in the missile world, which I've spent most of my career in, you take a look at
what you think the fault trees are you go through that. and as you eliminate the faults, you start to focusing on the one,
two, or in our case we always want to find out what are the three things that could have caused the failure and you work
on all three. But you focus on the primary and here that's exactly what we're doing. We should be wrapping that up
shortly. When we do that we'll put in what we believe is the correct corrective action and then we'll proceed to test it on
the ground trying to introduce the fault and see what we can do. And then you ultimately go to the flight test, which is
the real environment where you see vibration, where you see all kinds of things happen with targets that are planned
and unplanned. So from our standpoint we're going through the processors, not a grave concern of laws of physics or
anything like that. It's what I affectionately call the forensic engineering that you go through to analyze the faults that
might make a neat television show someday, since CSI gets so much attention on something else. That's what it's all
about.
<Q - Myles Walton>: And any negative EAC could be absorbed into the existing guidance range if there were any?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: No problem there.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JP Morgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. My question may not be answerable but...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay, Joe. So that was a good question, thank you.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Yeah, I'll lead off with that one. But on the classified side, 26% growth, it's a big, big number.
I'm just wondering if you can give us any more color on segments with this one driver or five drivers. And you said
most of it, the vast majority is organic, so obviously that wasn't from Applied Signal, but anything else you can give
us?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, let me see what I can do with giving you some color around it. About 11% in
bookings came out of it. Our sales were about 16% for classified, 26% increase as you heard. We expect in the year
bookings to be in the high single digit, low double digit for us in classified, we expect sales to be around 15%, we
expect that to be a 10% to 12% growth year-over-year, that is about as far as I can go.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: You can't give...
<A - William H. Swanson>: It's clear to us it's driven in a couple of our businesses when we look at SAS and IIS and
part of we felt a little bit of a throttling with the CR, but now that that's behind we're seeing the smaller contracts that
we get in that area, including Cyber, doing very well. In fact just to add some color, we had some great tech wins
across the board especially in our core areas of radar C31, EOIR and in the classified as I pointed out some good wins,
especially in Cyber.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: And so you would say Cyber is maybe the dominant driver there?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I wouldn't say dominant, but it's moving the stronger of anything else.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. That was a great answer. I was wrong.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: This is a first. You are now entitled to the bonus round.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Good then, I'll ask you another one. Bill just on the ...
<A - William H. Swanson>: I was joking. Go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Can you give us just -- you already talked a lot about the Pentagon and about the cycle, can
you speak a bit to the State Department and how things are tracking there in terms of notification timing, that sort of
thing?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Oh boy, I shouldn't have allowed you the bonus round. Clearly what I see taking place
there is something a little bit unprecedented, and I give Secretary Gates credit for this because he took it on, is they're
really trying to expedite the export process. And I do see commerce in State and DOD working on this. We are keeping
our figures crossed that they are going to make their time line of this summer.
And basically what will help is that we can take the preponderance such things and move them over into what I call the
fast lane. They don't need a lot of review, we've released them, they're not critical, there are other capabilities in other
countries. And so that can kind of go into the fast lane much like go on a turnpike and you got that card that lets you go
through quick.
But then there will be stuff that has to go through the reviews between DOD and State. And what I believe is that if we
have the fast lane and things go through that, it will take some of the burden off the people that have to do the job every
day, so they can really focus on the complicated and what they should be working on.
And so from my standpoint, I'm encouraged about that, some of the big orders have gotten through State and we'll be
submitting some here shortly, we just 9X for example, is now in congressional notification; that should go through
smoothly. And we kind of expect things to go through, now that there is a budget there; not signing that budget really
made it complicated for every government agency in Washington, in my opinion. Now it's behind us, and let's get on

Your next question comes from the line of Heidi Wood from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Great. Bill, I'm also going to talk on the classified stuff and also trying to tiptoe my way around it.
So you had the good classified wins, can you talk about how much of those wins reflect kind of more the same that was
kind of classic core Raytheon, versus things you defined as stretch wins, where you see yourself, Raytheon, heading
into new businesses and competencies that maybe you didn't have say two or three years ago?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Wow, first all of it's all black, so you make it hard. I would -- and it's a gut feel, there is
no analysis done on this, whatsoever so it's my gut feel of what I know and I probably say a third of what we're doing is
new.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Okay. Good. And then a follow-up, the underlying competitions in IIS, one of the things that you
and I have talked many times about is that you wanted – you had once said that the award rates were too high and you
really wanted your team to be reaching higher and taking more risk and having a lower ratio than trying to compete
against more, can you give us an update on how that's looking now?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Actually IIS is made a nice shift from a lot of their sole source business where the work
came to them. As the way I would describe it, I believe you need a wolf instinct if I could pick one and I see IIS
developing into that kind of business to where they can go out and we see it in small awards that wouldn't hit your radar
screen, but they hit ours. You look at jobs that are $1 million, $2 million, $5 million or $10 million and they are doing
very good about cultivating that, setting the expectations right, working with their customers. You see it in programs
that we have of putting apps on the battlefield, you see it in some of the things we're doing in secure view of being able
to look at passively what's happening on networks. And we also have the ability to look for malware or things that can
cause harm to systems.
They have all of these applications that are working with customers and given the fact that in the ones and zeros world,
everything travels at the speed of a click and the threat works on a daily basis. And they are doing very good at being a
wolf in that environment. And I'm encouraged. Our win rates are still extremely high, which means we've got to
continue to open the aperture but make sure we stay about one swim lane over, so that we understand the risk and we
manage the risk and we keep delivering the kinds of margins that you all expect from us.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: And then Bill just one last one. As we sort of contemplate this new environment we're in, we've
got Ash talking about more large weapons cuts ahead, an environment with very few new program starts. Do you see
Raytheon's opportunity moving at all from funding in weapons more over towards ONM if I were to think back on the
last down cycle and DOD was lacking funds to buy a new kit, there was a focus to changing the need towards refurbing
existing systems. And is that what you're sort of anticipating ahead and what does that mean for Raytheon?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think the way we look at it, I really do believe, we thrive on challenges. I mean,
you can sit here and say, oh woe is me, or you can look at it and say something got cancelled or this happened. There is
always an opportunity, you've just got to be quick and agile enough and have a portfolio of capabilities and a talented
workforce that can adjust. So if something gets cancelled, it means you have to keep running or performing with what
you have otherwise you have mediocrity, and this country has never been mediocre.
And so from my standpoint, we've come up with our radars, our EOIR systems, our command and control or something
else that can keep that platform or system going because the threat's not going away. And so you want to keep it
running until you can put in a new start. So for us, I wouldn't call it O&M work, I really see it much like we can do the
F-15 or F-16s in airborne radars, what we can do on the ground in the EO systems to be able to keep the existing

system current and actually take care of future threats.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Excellent. Thanks, very much.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. [ph] Alicia (1:02:50) we have time for one more question please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, good morning everyone.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Hi.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: I got just a quick question for more of a clarification, you said I think that the book-to-bill
that you expected for the year was 1.06 to 1.08?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Correct. That's right.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay, which means that you are expecting total bookings for the year kind of in the $27
billion plus range, is that right?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, that's right.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Can you just help maybe provide us some comfort on why we're going to see such a
big acceleration into the back half of the year, you don't think, you've seen bookings at $7 plus-billion maybe a handful
of times over the last several years on a quarterly basis. And if I look back over time you haven't had bookings of $27
billion in maybe the last five or six years. Can you maybe just cite anecdotally some process things that may have, that
are going to kind of lead to this acceleration of bookings as we move through the rest of the year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, probably -- this is Bill in my opening question when I talked about international, I
probably ripped through about $4 billion or $5 billion worth of International there very quickly. And so I think that
answers your question. We see that in the back end, we also see that things started off slower this year. So the number I
gave of $27.5 plus or minus $500 million is still the number.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Anything specifically at the DOD outside this CR, that's going to allow for any
acceleration?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, if you look at it, we have missile domestic awards coming in, we have operational
training, we have some more standard missile development work, we've got AMRAM, so there is some domestic
homeland security contracts of what we're working on now that are in negotiation and we have one competitive
program, JAGM, that will go in and probably won't happen on our timeline and we've got that factored in heavily
because we factor all of these programs when we put them in. So from our standpoint that's kind of how we see it.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Right, so those are the program specific things, but anything from a process prospective that
has held things up, that you think is now a kind of loosening up and allowing for this?
<A - William H. Swanson>: The CR really held things up, I mean people can't start a new program if they don't have
the funding, they can't put in options that are in the contract that can't be exercised. So that's why I said earlier, it's not a
science to figure out, there is no science here on figuring out the impact of CR and we've tried to give you an idea at
least there was $0.5 million of bookings that we thought we couldn't take credit for.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay, it's perfect. And then lastly from me, can you provide any type of update on the
self-imposed investigation that you're doing on Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, when we might see that come to its
logical conclusion?

time.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And that's had no impact on our international business.
