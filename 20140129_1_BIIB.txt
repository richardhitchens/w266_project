George A. Scangos
Thanks, Claudine. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us today.
2013 was a very good year for Biogen Idec and for the patients we serve. We continued to grow our base businesses
and our current MS and anti-CD20 franchises. We successfully launched TECFIDERA, our most recent MS therapy.
We announced marketing applications for three potential new products, PLEGRIDY for MS and ALPROLIX and
ELOCTATE for hemophilia and finally we advanced a promising pipeline of potential new medicines.
That solid operational progress was coupled with strong financial results. Revenue for 2013 was $6.9 billion, an
increase of 26% from 2012, and non-GAAP earnings were $8.96 per share, an increase of 37% from 2012.
With TECFIDERA, we strengthened our positions in the MS market, and we believe that we now have leading
therapies in the oral, high efficacy and injectable segments of market. We believe that having this suite of therapies
positions us well to address the diverse needs of MS patients.
The launch of TECFIDERA in the U.S. was a milestone event for us. We believe that TECFIDERA's broad and rapid
uptake is a testament to its clinical profile as well as excellent execution by our organization. We are very pleased that
the launch of TECFIDERA now ranks among the best in the biopharmaceutical industry.
AVONEX and TYSABRI continue to provide a solid business foundation. AVONEX remains a multi-billion dollar
drug 17 years after launch and physicians as well as patients continue to look to AVONEX as a first line MS therapy of
choice.
We believe that TYSABRI is a powerful MS treatment and remains a therapy of choice for patients needing high
efficacy. During the year, we completed an important transaction by acquiring complete ownership of TYSABRI which
strengthened our leadership in MS. This asset acquisition represents a prudent use of cash and provides us with a larger
portion of TYSABRI's financial benefits. In addition, we believe that consolidating TYSABRI ownership provides with
us greater flexibility and control over the positioning of our MS products to enable us to effectively compete in this
market.
It has also been an eventful year for our anti-CD20 franchise. RITUXAN is the standard of care for NHL and CLL and
for years has been an important asset for Biogen Idec. In the fourth quarter, the FDA approved GAZYVA, the first drug
approved under the breakthrough therapy designation for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We
believe the GAZYVA strengthens our anti-CD20 franchise, and will enhance the longevity of what already has been an
incredibly impactful collaboration.
Biogen Idec is a patient-focused organization. This focus drives how we think on all levels, not only for our marketed
products but also for our pipeline, where we are committed to develop new medicines for serious diseases with limited
treatment options.
In 2013, we advanced many of our pipeline candidates towards important data readouts anticipated this year. We also
took steps to strengthen our drug discovery platform. We've hired some leading scientists including Dr. Spyros
Artavanis, our Chief Scientific Officer. We have also advanced our strategy to utilize academic consortia to foster

collaboration and leverage the incredible science being carried out around the world.
In addition, we completed a number of transactions to enhance our pipeline, including agreements with Adimab,
Amicus Therapeutics, ISIS Pharmaceuticals and Galapagos. More recently we announced a collaboration with
Sangamo BioSciences on an innovative gene-editing technology with the potential to treat sickle cell disease and
beta-thalassemia.
Additionally in the fourth quarter, we expanded our agreement with Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture with Samsung
to develop and market biosimilar therapeutics. We believe that this partnership leverages our manufacturing
capabilities and positions us to compete effectively in biosimilar therapeutics while maintaining our focus on our
innovative pipeline.
So in summary, 2013 was a very good year for Biogen Idec with a lot of significant achievements and I will now turn
the call over to Tony.
Stuart Anthony Kingsley
Thanks, George.
In 2013 we grew our global MS market share, executed our franchise strategy across our three core MS products. In the
fourth quarter, TECFIDERA's U.S. launch continued to enjoy broad adoption and rapid uptake. According to our data,
through December, over 6,000 physicians, representing approximately 85% of total MS prescription volume, have
prescribed TECFIDERA. Additionally, our data showed that over 30% of new TECFIDERA patients in Q4 were not on
prior therapies, an increase from prior quarters.
We believe both these figures reflect physician and patient confidence in TECFIDERA's clinical profile, and real world
experience. We have also continued to improve patient access to TECFIDERA. As of January, almost all insurance
plans in the U.S. provide coverage for TECFIDERA, with approximately 75% of patients having access without
requiring a step edit.
Nine months into launch, we believe TECFIDERA is in a very good position, but we understand that sustained effort is
required to extend this initial success in the US.
In the EU, we received a positive opinion on New Active Substance designation from the CHMP in November.
TECFIDERA was then referred to the European Commission which grants marketing authorization for medicines in
the European Union. If approved, it's our intent to quickly launch in Germany, followed by staggered launches in other
EU countries over the next six to 18 months coincident with obtaining product reimbursement. Outside of Europe,
reimbursement of TECFIDERA in Australia was approved in December. And we expect public reimbursement
approval in Canada in the first half this year.
AVONEX performed well in 2013, gaining share globally within the injectible segment. In the US where TECFIDERA
caused a significant contraction in the injectable segment of the market, AVONEX continued to hold up well. The
injectable segment of the market represented approximately $11 billion of global revenue in 2013, and while we expect
this segment will decline over time, we believe it remains a significant opportunity in the medium term. We also
believe convenience continues to be a key differentiator for the injectable segment and that we are well positioned with
AVONEX PEN and potentially PLEGRIDY, should it be approved.
Moving on to TYSABRI, in the U.S. new prescription volume remains solid, and TYSABRI discontinuation rates
continued to improve in Q4. We are encouraged with TYSABRI's recent improvement in the U.S. In Europe, we
continue to see pressure from oral competition. We remain focused on emphasizing TYSABRI's efficacy messaging,
while continuing to provide the market with additional education on risk stratification. We believe this builds
confidence in earlier treatment of patients with aggressive disease. We also continue to feel that the MS market will
migrate to increased efficacy over time and that TYSABRI will benefit from this trend. We need to continue to execute
well to ensure broad understanding of TYSABRI's profile.

Turning to hemophilia, we are continuing to prepare for our expected 2014 U.S. launches of ALPROLIX and
ELOCTATE. We believe over time that these products have the potential to transform hemophilia care by reducing
infusion frequency, the largest unmet need in this market. Hemophilia is a new market for us and one with
well-established competitors. It is also historically a slow moving market with physicians and patients who are
reluctant to switch therapies without real world experience and logistical hurdles such as infrequent physician visits that
extend the timeline for starting a new therapy. So driving adoption will require hard work, but we believe in the product
profiles and our ability to execute.
I will now turn the call over to Doug to discuss R&D.
Douglas E. Williams
Thanks, Tony. I will begin by highlighting the major events from 2013 and then discuss multiple clinical trial readouts
anticipated in the upcoming year.
Let's start with TECFIDERA. During 2013, significant new data were generated that deepened our understanding of
this important therapy. We have further elucidated TECFIDERA's mechanism of action and demonstrated that the
biological effects of DMF compared to other fumarate molecules are distinctly different. Also, data generated from the
ongoing ENDORSE clinical study continued to support the long-term efficacy and safety of TECFIDERA.
During the year, TYSABRI was submitted for marketing approval in Japan, and we're anticipating a decision in the
first half of 2014. Beyond relapsing forms of MS, we continue to evaluate TYSABRI's potential efficacy in other
indications. Enrollment was completed in the Phase III ASCEND study in patients with secondary progressive MS, and
data remain on track for 2015. We also initiated a Phase II proof of concept study in acute ischemic stroke. The study
will utilize an imaging endpoint to assess infarct size and determine if TYSABRI, given immediately post-stroke, can
lessen lymphocyte mediated tissue damage to the brain.
For the PLEGRIDY program, during the year we obtained positive Phase III data from year one of the two-year
ADVANCE study in relapsing remitting MS patients. Patients in the study were dosed with PLEGRIDY, administered
either once every two weeks or once every four weeks. PLEGRIDY has been filed for approval with the FDA and
EMA and remains on track for anticipated FDA approval decision in mid-2014 and an EMA decision in the second half
of 2014 as well.
During the year, we generated new clinical data which further supports the potential of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX
as effective hemophilia therapies with reduced dosing frequency and which we believe will lead to better outcomes for
patients. Both ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX were filed for approval with the FDA, and we're anticipating approvals for
ALPROLIX in the second quarter of 2014 and for ELOCTATE in mid-2014. So 2013 was a busy and productive year.
I will now discuss some of the upcoming R&D events. In mid-2014, we expect Phase III data for daclizumab in
relapsing remitting MS. Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting CD25, a sub unit of the IL-2
receptor. Results from the Phase IIb SELECT study have demonstrated a robust impact on relapse rate and promising
effects on slowing disability progression. The ongoing Phase III DECIDE study is an 1,800 subject trial that compares
monthly subcutaneously administered daclizumab to interferon beta treatment. Primary end point of the study is the
reduction in annualized relapse rate.
Turning to our mid-stage pipeline, we expect to have six proof of concept or proof of biology readouts during the year,
including data on anti-LINGO in acute optic neuritis, BIIB037 in Alzheimer's disease, Neublastin in neuropathic pain,
STX-100 in IPF, as well as for a few of our partnered programs, SMNRX in SMA, and anti-CD40 ligand in lupus.
Anti-LINGO is a monoclonal antibody that in preclinical studies promotes remyelination and axonal protection. There
are two Phase II proof of concept trials underway, one in acute optic neuritis and the other in MS.
In the acute optic neuritis study, we're testing if anti-LINGO treatment is able to improve conduction of the optic nerve.
Data generated in the optic neuritis study will provide important proof of biology data in an acute demyelination

setting. It may be helpful for future development efforts in MS.
The ongoing second anti-LINGO study in patients with relapsing, remitting MS and relapsing SPMS measures several
clinical, imaging and biomarker endpoints to help define the potential Phase III clinical end points. Data from the Phase
II MS study is expected in the second half of 2015.
BIIB037 is a human anti-beta amyloid monoclonal antibody for Alzheimer's disease. The ongoing Phase Ib study
incorporates imaging at the start to confirm that subjects have quantifiable beta amyloid. The study will utilize serial
imaging to measure the ability of BIIB037 to deplete plaque beta amyloid levels in the CNS. The trial also incorporates
FDG PET imaging to assess restoration of brain synaptic activity as well as exploratory measures of cognition.
Neublastin is a novel biologic therapy for neuropathic pain, another disease with significant unmet medical need where
current therapies are inadequate. Neublastin interacts with the GFR ALPHA 3 receptor on pain sensing neurons, and
has been shown to promote nerve regeneration in preclinical models of nerve crush. We believe this may allow
Neublastin to promote rapid pain relief and also to be disease modifying by promoting nerve repair. In the ongoing
Phase II study, we'll assess clinical measures of pain in sciatica patients with peripheral nerve injury.
STX-100 is our antibody under development for the treatment of IPF, a progressive and almost uniformly fatal disease.
STX-100 targets the avb6 [alpha-5 beta-6] integrin, which is selectively upregulated in several fibrotic diseases and is
essential for activating the TGF-b signaling process in these tissues. We are conducting an innovative Phase IIa dose
ranging study that uses biomarkers to confirm target engagement and dose responsiveness. Using quantitative assays
developed in preclinical studies we'll measure the ability of STX-100 to inhibit downstream TGF-b signaling, a
pathway known to drive the fibrotic process.
We are also expecting important data from some of our partnered programs. ISIS SMNRX is an antisense molecule in
development for spinal muscular atrophy. There are two ongoing Phase II studies, one in infants with Type I SMA, and
the other in children with Type II/III SMA. ISIS is moving these studies forward and expects to have data in the first
quarter of this year. Data from these studies is expected to provide a clearer understanding of dosing parameters and of
the preliminary clinical activity of SMNRX and will inform the design of the next stage of the clinical program.
During the second half of 2014, we also expect Phase Ib data from our partner UCB for anti-CD40 ligand in general
SLE. CD40 mediated signaling is involved in the regulation of both B and T cell responses, which are aberrant in lupus
patients. I look forward to discussing the results of these studies with you during the year.
I will now pass the call on to Paul.
Paul J. Clancy
Thanks, Doug.
Our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.92 in the fourth quarter and $7.81 for the full year. The differences
between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are outlined in the earnings presentation. Our non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $2.34, and $8.96 for the full year. Total revenue for Q4 grew 39% to
approximately $2 billion and grew 26% for the full year to $6.9 billion.
Fourth quarter AVONEX worldwide revenue was $751 million. For the full year worldwide AVONEX revenue grew
3% and surpassed $3 billion. In the US, Q4 AVONEX revenue increased 2% to $475 million. For the full year, U.S.
AVONEX revenue increased 6% to $1.9 billion. Outside the U.S., Q4 AVONEX revenue was $277 million, a decrease
of 3% compared to the prior year. And for the full year, international AVONEX revenue decreased 1% to $1.1 billion.
Foreign exchange weakened AVONEX international revenue for the full year by approximately $9 million compared to
a $25 million gain in the prior year.
TYSABRI worldwide revenue net of hedging was $427 million in Q4. These results were comprised of $251 million in
the U.S., and $176 million internationally. For the full year, worldwide TYSABRI revenue to Biogen Idec was $1.5

billion, net of hedging. We recorded U.S. revenue of $814 million and $712 million internationally. The final approval
of the settlement with AIFA is still pending, as a result fourth quarter TYSABRI revenue was unfavorably impacted by
$14 million of deferred revenue and $54 million for the full year.
Global Q4 TECFIDERA revenue was $398 million in Q4, and $876 million for the full year. U.S. TECFIDERA
revenue includes incremental inventory build of approximately $42 million in Q4. Turning to our anti-CD20 franchise,
which now includes GAZYVA, U.S. profit share was $253 million for Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full year.
Royalties and profit share on sales of rituximab outside the U.S. was $17 million in Q4 and $39 million for the full
year. The result was $269 million of net revenue from unconsolidated joint business for Q4 and $1.1 billion for the full
year.
Now turning to the expense lines on the non-GAAP P&L, Q4 non-GAAP cost of goods sold were $259 million, or 13%
of revenue. For the full year, non-GAAP COGS were $858 million or 12% of revenue. The increase year-over-year was
driven by TYSABRI contingent payments and third party royalties.
Q4 non-GAAP R&D expense was $421 million, or 21% of revenue, an increase of 22% over last year, in part driven by
our recently announced agreement with Samsung Bioepis where we recorded a $36 million R&D charge. For the full
year, non-GAAP R&D expense was $1.4 billion or 21% of revenue.
Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $495 million, or 25% of revenue, an increase of 32% over prior year. For the full
year, non-GAAP SG&A expense was $1.7 billion, or 24% of revenue, an increase of 32% over 2012. These increases
were primarily due to the investments on TECFIDERA and the anticipated hemophilia launches.
Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was 28.8% driven by a larger percentage of our profits coming from within the U.S. due to
the strong U.S. launch of TECFIDERA. We expect our tax rate to remain at this level through 2014 due to U.S. profits
but believe this rate will decline in 2015 and 2016.
Our weighted average diluted shares were 238 million, and we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in
cash and marketable securities of which approximately 85% is within the U.S.
This brings us to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which were $8.96 for the full year, an increase of 37%.
Now, I will turn to the full year 2014 guidance. We expect total revenue growth between 22% and 25%. Let me
characterize how we are thinking about our products. Our plan assumes TECFIDERA will represent the largest
contributor to our revenue growth. In the U.S., we anticipate the rate of patient switches and TECFIDERA new
prescriptions to moderate. In the EU, our business plan assumes TECFIDERA is approved in Q1 and as Tony
described, we expect a gradual country rollout over the next six to 18 months and we anticipate Germany will make up
the majority of TECFIDERA revenue outside the U.S. in 2014.
We believe TYSABRI is now largely through the abnormally high discontinuations in the U.S. experienced during the
initial months of TEC [TECFIDERA] launch. In Italy, we continue to pursue a resolution with the settlement of AIFA
however our 2014 guidance does not include the impact of this settlement as the timing of the final approval remains
uncertain.
Moving to AVONEX and PLEGRIDY; our plan assumes a mid-year launch of PLEGRIDY in the U.S. and a second
half launch in Europe with Germany being the primary contributor. We believe we are well positioned with AVONEX
and PLEGRIDY and anticipate gaining share within the declining injectable segment.
Based upon current approval timelines and our anticipation of a gradual uptake for ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE, we
expect revenue from our hemophilia product launches in 2014 to be quite modest.
We expect R&D expense between 20% and 22% of sales. We expect this spending will move to greater investment in
mid and early stage development programs.
Additionally this guidance includes strategic investments as we have earmarked over $200 million for potential
business development opportunities in 2014. Our focus remains on building out our early stage pipeline.

SG&A expense is expected to be between 22% and 23% of total revenue. We expect to continue to see upward
pressure on SG&A dollars in 2014 driven by investments in TECFIDERA in the EU and from the anticipated
hemophilia launches.
As a result, we anticipate non-GAAP EPS results between $11 and $11.20 and GAAP EPS to be between $9.74 and
$9.94.
I will turn the call over to George for his closing comments.
George A. Scangos
Thanks, Paul.
In 2013, the company had strong financial results coupled with excellent operational progress, which positions us well
for the future. As I think about 2014, we appear to be at an inflection point, going from two major marketed products in
2012 to three in 2013, and now to potentially up to six.
This type of growth would be a challenge for most organizations and we are no different. It's essential that we
successfully complete the registration processes and effectively launch each of our products while we continue to focus
on the needs of tomorrow. So with many accomplishments behind us and with patients as a focal point of our work, we
will continue to focus on execution.
As leaders in MS, we are committed to identify and develop medicines for the great unmet needs that still remain.
Today's treatments help to slow the progression rate, but for approximately one quarter of patients, secondary
progressive MS remains an issue with no approved medicines on the market.
We are committed to advance TYSABRI and SPMS to potentially offer a new option for this important group of
patients. We're also developing anti-LINGO with a hope to halt, or reverse MS damage. If anti-LINGO does work, it
will represent the first therapy to actually repair CNS pathology which potentially opens up a new way of
understanding how to deal with diseases of the brain.
The potential approval and upcoming launches of ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE for hemophilia patients will mark an
important new chapter for Biogen Idec. ALPROLIX and ELOCTATE represent true innovation for patients and a
significant long-term opportunity for the company. Hemophilia is an area where there's been minimal innovation for
many years. This gives us an opportunity to change the prophylactic treatment paradigm from short acting to long
lasting therapies. We believe that this may lead to a lower burden of disease, improved compliance and better
outcomes.
Finally we need to ensure that we continue to drive innovation by bringing the best science to the company. Our R&D
strategy concentrates on neurology, immunology, nonmalignant hematology and adjacent diseases where patients have
core therapeutic options today. We prioritize indications in which we have a good understanding of disease etiology
and make prudent decisions in advancing compounds in the clinic. We also need to continue to seek business
development opportunities that will strengthen our research capacities and complement our novel pipeline.
In closing, as always, I would like to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication. I'm very proud
of the many accomplishments that we achieved together last year. As an organization, we've advanced the business to
make a meaningful difference in patients' lives. So thanks to all of you for joining us this morning and we'll now open
up the call for questions.

[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Good morning and thank you for taking my two part question. First part probably for George;
you've recently talked more about business development and obviously flagged it too in your provisioning, $200
million provision for 2014, can you give us more color on the type and the characteristics of deals you envisage?
And part two, probably for Tony, interested in your view on three times a week COPAXONE and potentially generic
COPAXONE later this year impact on the MS market.
<A - George A. Scangos>: Thanks, Ravi. Good catch, actually. For the past two years we have done a number of
business development transactions, but we had no earmarked business development budget. We were able to fund those
out of the R&D budget or other ways we managed to find the money to do that.
This year we've earmarked $200 million for business development activities. I think that reflects our belief that these
are very important to the future of our company. We've improved the science in the company. I think we have
improved the throughput of our internal R&D group. But that won't supply all the compounds that we need to go
forward. So part of that $200 million will go to bolster our pipeline. And we're looking primarily for Phase I, Phase II
compounds, maybe late preclinical.
Part of it will go to increase our technology platform. Last year we did deals with Adimab and one of the deals we did
with Isis really were to give us a better platform to increase the quality and the speed of our internal R&D, and we will
continue to do some deals in that nature as well. So I think we will look for both pipeline additions in the three areas
that I mentioned, as well as technologies that increase the efficiency of our own R&D.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Thanks, Ravi. So three times a week COP in the plan is expected. I think two things
happen. The first is it will create competitive noise in the marketplace, which we are prepared to deal with. The second
thing is it's going to put something like 85,000 patients in play for switch. We think we have good alternatives for those
patients so, you know, we're going to have a strong presence in offices competing for that.
Generic COP also in the plan, also expected. You know, first order impact we think will be on branded COPAXONE
itself. Second order impact is it will add to the tool kit that the payers have to put some pressure on the category. We
have said that there's more pressure on gross than net. That's a little bit – that has been a piece of that story that we have
been telling and the guidance we have been giving on that.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another very good quarter. Sort of another big
picture R&D question, maybe for George, that the guidance is calling for 25% or so year-on-year growth in that line. I
think when you joined the company a few years ago you suggested you were going to bring down R&D to maybe 20%
of sales long term. I guess the question is what convinces you you are going to get a good return on the incremental
R&D spend? Obviously you can afford it but is it a good investment or not, and are you still targeting more like a 20%
of revenue long term target?
<A - George A. Scangos>: Yeah, well, somewhere in that range is the honest answer to that question. We don't target a
particular percentage of revenues to R&D. Look, I think most important thing for me, Eric, in our R&D budget is that
we don't waste money, that we don't spend money on projects that are just dragging on, that haven't met their goals, that
are not well thought through and they are not critically executed and are not competitive. And so when I first game and
when Doug came, we eliminated a lot of projects that we thought met those criteria.
We are going forward now with a pipeline where we believe meets – that we believe meets the criteria that we have
there. They are well thought out and there's good basis for taking them forward. It doesn't mean they are all going to
work, of course, but they are all good bets. And so that's the way we think about R&D.

As we – you know, our revenues are – we anticipate that they will grow. And the percentage we spend on R&D next
year may not be the same as we spend the year after as our revenues continue to grow. R&D may not increase at the
same rate and so it may come down over time. But we believe we have to make some investments now to generate the
pipeline and the value that will continue to give us growth a few years out. And we are very cognizant of not wasting

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question. I know Doug is there, I don't know if Al is
there, but I wanted to maybe ask my question on anti-LINGO. I think this is an area that people are pretty focused on
from a stock perspective. And maybe just take a couple of minutes and walk us through what you know from the
preclinical data. And then in humans do you know that this drug crosses the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quantities
that you would exert the effect that you need? And related to that, the trial that you are doing, I think if I'm reading the
clinical trials correctly, in optic neuritis has just one dose. So can you help us understand how we can have confidence
that you know that you have already nailed the dose?
And then when you all see the data later this year, should we – do you think that there's a requirement for statistical
significance or is this trial just way too small to hold it up to that kind of a standard and how would you move forward?
So that's a lot of questions, but basically, just walk us through the anti-LINGO proposition, what we know, what we
should be expecting from the trial and specifically the blood-brain barrier and brain concentrations and dose. Thanks.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Mark, this is Doug. You have both Al and me here on the call. So we'll tag-team the
answer.
Let me address the one that you just came back to, which is, does the drug actually cross the blood- brain barrier, and
the answer to that is, yes. We know that from the Phase I study both the SAD and MAD study. We actually looked at
CSF levels of the antibody in patients who received the anti-LINGO antibody. And what we found was detectable
levels of the antibody that roughly matched the levels that we knew were efficacious in the mouse models of
remyelination.
That was a key observation in those studies. We wanted to make sure that across the dose range we were testing, in
both single dose and multiple dose format, that we could, in fact, get to a level of drug in the CSF that was consistent
with efficacious doses in the animal model. So we can check that box off.
The question about optic neuritis and why did we only choose one dose, we chose the highest dose. Remember, that we
are viewing this as a proof of biology study. So we wanted to run a placebo controlled study looking at the highest dose
of drug versus placebo and really simply asking the question of whether or not we could facilitate remyelination and
thereby measure that quantitatively with the endpoints in the study.
And I will let Al talk to you a little bit about some of the sort of basic biology observations that have driven our
enthusiasm for the program from the beginning.
<A - Al Sandrock>: So in terms of the preclinical experiment, there were two types, the in vitro experiments and the
animal experiments. And let me just briefly say that in vitro we added anti-LINGO and we decreased LINGO
expression by other methods, and we can get oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate much better when you
have less LINGO present and when you throw in neurons into the same cultures, you do co-cultures we actually see
myelin formation and many of our colleagues externally have been doing that type of experiment for years and had
never seen myelin quite as well formed in vitro before blocking LINGO.
In the animal experiment, there were two types there. One is the knockout experiment and the over expression
experiments. If you knock out LINGO from a mouse you see early myelination in the spinal cord which is functioning,
so they've improved nerve conduction in the spinal cord when, in the LINGO knockout animals, where you have early

myelination.
In the other animal studies what we did was induce demyelination by several methods: one by using a detergent, focally
injected or by feeding the animals cuprizone or by inducing EAE, so an autoimmune attack against myelin. In each of
these three animal models of demyelination, we saw rapid reconstitution of myelin and we know it was remyelination
because when we did electron microscopy, we saw very thin, but the kind of myelin – the myelin that we expect to see
in remyelination, so it's thinner than normal, and also we had improvement in function in the EAE animals, so that they
moved better.
And I think as Doug pointed out, we were very careful in each of those experiments to understand the concentration of
anti-LINGO that was necessary to produce these in vivo effects. So – and so we took that information into the human
studies. Moreover, what we did was we used larger animals where we could test out some of the novel imaging
methods such as magnetization transfer ratio and diffusion tensor imaging to verify that we can actually look at
remyelination using these imaging methods and we are applying those same methods that we used in the animal models
in the humans.
So it's all novel. So, we're in new territory here and, as George pointed out, not everything is going to work but we are
very excited.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: I think you had one other question about the possibility of seeing a real treatment effect in
the relapsing remitting study that's ongoing, the second of our Phase II studies and that's a very robust study in the
sense that it's four different doses of anti-LINGO versus placebo. We are looking at broad array of potential endpoints,
some of which we would hope would represent the primary endpoint for a Phase III study but candidly, as Al said, this
is new territory.
So we are learning which of these endpoints is going to actually be the most sensitive measure of a remyelinating event
and then carrying that forward into the design of the Phase III study. It's a very innovative, very broad clinical program,
but it is also a very proper straightforward, Phase IIb dose ranging study that's very robustly designed to look at a
variety of potential treatment effects.

Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I actually just wanted to follow up on the one on
anti-LINGO. Al, you mentioned the larger studies – or studies in larger animals to look at imaging. I was just
wondering if that employed systemic delivery or local delivery of anti-LINGO and if you looked at the concentration in
those animals and was wondering how that compared to the mouse models you mentioned, given you used local
delivery there. Thanks.
<A - Al Sandrock>: Well, we actually did both local and systemic and in many of the later experiments it was almost
all systemic. So – and they were nonhuman primate models, where we injected lysolecithin, what was local was the
lysolecithin injection, which was done directly into the corpus callosum, which is a heavily myelinated fiber tract, but
we gave the anti-LINGO systemically and looked by MTR.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges with Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Maybe I'll continue in the same vein. Doug and Al, can you give us the same
explanation of your confidence in the SPMS study for TYSABRI, certainly a big incremental market but conventional
wisdom there has been it's more of a gradual degenerative process, rather than an inflammatory one. So what's the basis
biologically for committing to that?

And secondly, related to that, do you have any other shots on goal in SPMS in the rest of your portfolio? Are there any
of these other early drugs that you might contemplate in that disease? Thanks.
<A - Al Sandrock>: So SPMS, there are two sort of largely, two prevailing theories. One is that it's purely a
neurodegenerative process, whether it's a primary process or whether it's secondary to demyelination, people argue
about that.
The other theory, though, is that there's ongoing inflammation but it's a different type of inflammation. It's
inflammation that's behind the blood brain barrier, that there are these germinal-- ectopic germinal centers that form the
lymphoid follicles that form in the submeningeal space. These have been associated with areas of cortical
demyelination and so whereas the inflammation that's due to peripheral white blood cells entering the brain may be
less, there is this lymphoid follicle idea.
Now the thing about TYSABRI is that it disrupts the formation of these lymphoid follicles. And we think that, not only
from the animal experiments, but in humans we see a decrease in the chemokine signature that's been associated with
these lymphoid follicles. And so that's why, from a biological point of view, we think that TYSABRI SPMS has a
decent chance.
Now, the other reason why we are optimistic, cautiously, is that – is that, you know, we're using a more sensitive
endpoint in the clinic that is a composite measure of disability progression and we have gotten agreement with FDA
under SPA and also we've gotten good agreement with European regulators on the use of this novel endpoint. So, for
both of those reasons we are cautiously optimistic about TYSABRI SPMS.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And Geoff, this is Doug. As far as other shots on goal as you describe it, obviously the
anti-LINGO program is also geared towards the possibility of working in secondary progressive, but primary
progressive as well. There's a possibility for that drug across the spectrum of MS subtypes. There's also some
discussion about the possibility of taking TECFIDERA in that direction.
You could, again, based on what Al described about the possibility of there being an immune component that is
involved in some patients with SPMS, obviously there is a mechanism that makes sense there with TECFIDERA in
terms of down modulating immune responses, but also the possibility of improving neuronal protection with the
antioxidant effects of that molecule. So that's a sensible thing for us to consider. Stay tuned for more information on
that as we consider that one.
And then from the standpoint of where are we focusing our basic science resources and our neurology discovery
program, it's primary and secondary progressive disease. That's really the focus for new target discovery and validation.
Really to try to understand the pathways that are involved better. That's where the real opportunity and need is from our
perspective, over the long term, and we're, you know, really focusing the basic science resources in our neurology
discovery group in that direction.

commercial a little bit and TECFIDERA, and it's sort of a two-part question. One, for Paul, inventory was – it sounds
like it's $134 million for the year, about five weeks. Historically for products that are launching, kind of four to five
weeks is typical as they grow. I'm trying to get a sense, is that – should we even think of it as sort of real inventory, or
is that going to be just the normal churn that you are going to see in a growth product and it will get slowly over time to
two week kind of range?
And then secondly, just on the commercial, the new patient and the returning quitters of 30%. I don't know if you can
split it better. What is new versus returning and that's been kind of consistent. Do you think – it sounds like you are
thinking it is going to go down and why is that?

<A - Paul J. Clancy>: Yeah, let me start with the inventory question, Yaron. Great question. The five weeks represents
the combined inventory in wholesalers as well as the SBPs, the specialty pharmacies. So given the way we launched in
the United States, we actually have that visibility all the way through.
When we talk about just – and just to note, when we talk about AVONEX, the visibility we have really is just
wholesalers. And the combination of the – when we talk about AVONEX, we try to – in the United States, we try to
look at around two weeks, which is what we also look at in wholesalers specifically, which is what we look at for
TECFIDERA and then SBPs make up the balance of that to get to five.
And I think that we think in the United States, that that represents the cumulative amount right now, represents about
what we will have for a run rate. As we move through 2014, it really will depend on kind of the sales trajectory of TEC
in the U.S., whether or not there's a little bit more upward pressure, but I think it's really just more indicative of the
launch here.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Yeah, Yaron, it's Tony. On the 30% new to therapy, frankly, it's difficult to break
that down to measure what the mix of, you know, genuinely naive versus potentially returning quitters. There are
constantly some returning quitters into the market and some people who go out of the market, so it is a portion that's
difficult to break down. I think what we have said launch to date or prior quarters that we thought that number was
around 25%. So it's actually up a little bit in the recent quarter. Not clear that that should go down. You know, we think
it's an encouraging statement, it's an encouraging statement about the market acceptance of the product, that it's
becoming a – it's capturing a meaningful share of new patient starts. That speaks to the confidence that the market has
in the product profile.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey, thanks, good morning. A question maybe for Al or Doug on SMNRX. I know there's
some data soon. We have seen previous childhood data, but there's also infantile data coming. I just wanted to
understand what you can actually glean from infant data and whether you are looking at anything else besides mortality
in the short study, gene copies, maybe measurements of SMN protein. Is there anything that you can glean out of that
can help give us some confidence, obviously, rather than going into Phase III a little bit blind?
<A - Al Sandrock>: Yeah, in the infantile study, we are looking at things like weight gain. Are the kids-are the babies
gaining weight on a trajectory. Normally they start to lose weight because they get muscle atrophy, but the main thing
is to look at survival and ventilator dependence. Those are the two key events that we are looking at.

<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one again on LINGO. You've talked
about before about optic neuritis as disease with new lesions and relapsed remitting with having new and old lesions. I
was just curious in the relapsed remitting MS study, will you be able to see if LINGO by imaging has an impact on new
and old lesions and how are you doing that? And how does this affect – ultimately if these trials are successful, does it
matter, how does this affect the market opportunity?
<A - Al Sandrock>: Well, yes, we can look at old and new lesions in the relapsing remitting study. We anticipate that
the patients who come into that study will have lesions that have been there potentially for years, and they are
recognized as T2 hyperintense lesions. And so we often talk about burden of disease and we look at T2 hyperintense
lesions.

So we can look at those lesions that are no longer enhancing. They are so old that there's no inflammation or
blood-brain barrier breakdown and yet we can see – look into those lesions and see whether they changed their imaging
characteristics that would be consistent with remyelination.
I think if that were to occur, if old lesions start to remyelinate, then you can treat people who are in the late stages of
SPMS, even when they have no new lesions forming. And that's what happens in SPMS, is that the number of new
lesions that form start to get very, very infrequent. Nevertheless, they continue to progress in terms of disability. So it
would indicate that you could go pretty broadly, all the way from the very earliest events in MS to the late stages of
secondary progressive MS, and as Doug pointed out, potentially even primary progressive MS.

Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah, I was hoping you could talk about discontinuation rates on U.S. TECFIDERA. Paul,
I didn't quite catch what you said was assumed in your guidance for 2014.
And then, apologies, but another LINGO question. You guys had said two weeks ago that you felt that if there was
positive proof of principle data for optic neuritis that that could help you accelerate your MS Phase III plans. I was just
trying to understand the gap between when you have data in the second half of 2014 in optic neuritis and when you get
your MS data in the back half of 2015, what kind of things would you be doing that would accelerate plans? Thank
you.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: Rachel, it's Tony. On discontinuation rates, look, we don't think it's settled out yet
because we're still in a pretty dynamic portion of the trajectory. But we've said it appears that TECFIDERA is headed
towards what is sort of a normal discontinuation rate for therapies in the market. No evidence that suggests it's going to
be dramatically better, no evidence that suggests it's going to be dramatically worse. For existing products, including
the orals, we think those numbers tend to run in the low 20% range.
<A - Paul J. Clancy>: And, Rachel, that's consistent with what's essentially embedded in the guidance.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: And, Rachel, this is Doug. With respect to a positive readout from the optic neuritis study
and the impact that could have on the timeline for the relapsing remitting study, essentially there's a lot of study start-up
activities, there's a lot of planning activities that go on with respect to designing the protocol. A lot of that can get
front-loaded and we would likely spend some additional money at risk based on a positive outcome from the optic
neuritis study, anticipating a positive outcome in the relapsing remitting study.
So, yeah, it's hard to give you specifics on exactly what those steps would be, but there's a lot of legwork that goes into
planning for a study which we could move up and likely would if we had a robust readout in the optic neuritis study.

<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much. Again, apologies, but back to LINGO very briefly. When you think
about remyelination, how do you come to grips with the notion that remyelination is actually occurring contiguously?
And you're going to say, well, we do get functionality in some of the non-primate models, but the part b of the question
is, that may be true but aren't these animals still youthful and growing, and therefore the translation into an adult MS
patient or young adult MS patient might actually be substantially different than a young and growing animal? I'm just
curious if there's more data behind that. Thanks very much.
<A - Al Sandrock>: Yeah, so there is some spontaneous remyelination, if you will, going on in MS patients, it's just
incomplete. And some of the data suggest that there are groups of patients that do it better than others. Certainly
younger people do seem to remyelinate better than others, but there may be inherent differences among people in terms

of their ability to remyelinate. And so we would like to boost what we think is a natural phenomenon that's not very
complete, and certainly not in all patients.
And then in terms of the growing animals, I mean, it's true, in mice, they are growing, but in the nonhuman primates,
they were older animals. And so we think that the data are still suggestive that we could have efficacy in the adult MS
patients we are treating.

Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I had a few for Tony. When you
think about the rollout of TECFIDERA in Germany, are there any subtleties in the MS market versus the U.S. in terms
of the distribution of naive patients or quitters? And then many of the initial TECFIDERA patients in the U.S. were on
TYSABRI and for quite a while. So, I'm curious what you are seeing today from TYSABRI switches to TECFIDERA.
Thanks.
<A - Stuart Anthony Kingsley>: So, a good question. Not dramatic differences I don't think in the German market.
Among European markets, like the U.S., it does tend to have a pretty broad, sort of more community-based set of
physicians, as opposed to being just center-based. We will put promotional effort against it that makes sense for that
kind of market, so hard to articulate any big differences from a market and patient characteristic standpoint.
In terms of TYSABRI switches, we did see, as we said, you know, a bolus of switches at or around the launch of
TECFIDERA and the months following that and then the majority of those were going to TECFIDERA. The
discontinuation rate on TYSABRI in the U.S. has moderated since that time. We are still seeing a meaningful portion of
those go to TECFIDERA and so we are keeping them within the franchise, which is obviously net positive.

Your next question comes from the line of the Matt Roden with UBS your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question and very nice quarter. I actually wanted
to ask about STX-100. I was wondering if you could talk about the endpoints you are looking at in the Phase II trial,
what you need to see in the trial as a basis for a go/no-go decision and then finally the clinical regulatory path if it is a
go? Can you move straight into Phase III here or is that too aggressive of an assumption?
And then related, strategically, does this drug fit into your portfolio and if it's successful, is it a new vertical or is there
some other plan for the product? Thanks.
<A - Douglas E. Williams>: Okay, I will try to get all of those, if I can. This is Doug. So with respect to the endpoint
of the Phase IIa study that will read out this year, it's really a biomarker-driven study and it's based off of some
nonhuman primate work that was done with the molecule, to allow us to look directly at the TGF-b signaling pathway.
Remember, that that's how this drug works. It basically blocks an activator of the TGF-b pathway that specifically is
upregulated on tissues undergoing fibrosis, like the lung in IPF patients.
So we are administering increasing doses of the antibody, eight weekly doses and then we will be harvesting bronchial
alveolar lavage cells directly from the lung of these patients and assessing the TGF-b signaling pathway, looking at the
immediate downstream signaling event when TGF-b binds to the receptor, that's the phospho-Smad endpoint. That's a
very quantitative way of looking at looking at that signaling pathway.
There's also a collection of genes that are upregulated, again downstream of TGF-b binding to its receptor. We
validated those endpoints in the primate preclinical studies, and so what we're looking for in this study is an inhibition

of the TGF-b signaling pathway in a dose dependent fashion, taking cells directly from patients with IPF, directly from
the tissue of interest. We think that that will give us really good insights into the appropriate dose to take forward into
the next clinical study, which we haven't yet defined whether that will be a Phase III study or whether that will be a
Phase II/III type study. Again, we are still working through that. But with respect to, you know, right to Phase III, it's
really going to be a function of how robust that data is.
As far as strategic, you know, we have identified fibrosis as one of the areas of expansion for the organization. It is sort
of a logical extension beyond the chronic inflammation space that we are already in with some of our programs. And
fibrosis is a consequence of long standing inflammation in many different diseases. So we see it as a natural adjacency
to the immunology portfolio and it's a specialty market, which fits very well with the type of drug candidates that we're
going to be developing in the various markets that we are in. So we see it as really a perfect fit with the expansion plans
for the organization in terms of our R&D portfolio and eventually our sales programs.
