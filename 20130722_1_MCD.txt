Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via the phone, webcast, and podcast. And before I
turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release
and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at our website,
www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call,

And now I'd like to turn it over to Don.
Donald Thompson
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by briefly framing our performance using three
lenses: the past, the present, and the future. First, the past, because it provides perspective and guides our present and
future – throughout McDonald's history, we've effectively grown both the top and the bottom lines to varying degrees
across a variety of economic and competitive cycles.
We have an iconic brand, an outstanding system of owner/operators, suppliers, and employees, and superb real estate
locations in nearly every market around the world. This provides a solid foundation from which we operate.
Second, the present; in the second quarter, we grew revenues, operating income, and earnings per share despite the
ongoing impact of the challenging environment. This is truly a testament to the fortitude and resilience of our system,
our sustainable competitive advantages, and the collective focus on execution at our restaurants.
And third, the future; we expect the dynamics of this cycle to persist in the near term; namely, flat to declining
informal-eating-out markets, increasingly less ability to take price, cost pressures throughout our P&L, and heightened
competitive activity.
Our second quarter results tell a story consistent with these lenses. Global comparable sales were up 1%, operating
income was up 3% in constant currencies, and earnings per share was $1.38, a 6% increase in constant currencies.
Now, as we begin the third quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be relatively flat in July. Based on our
recent sales trends, our results for the rest of the year are expected to remain challenged.
We remain committed to the Plan to Win in our three global growth priorities: to optimize our menu, modernize the
customer experience, and to broaden accessibility to Brand McDonald's around the world. This customer-centric plan
enables us to deliver an appealing experience by offering great-tasting, affordable food and beverages, and clean and
modern restaurants.
At the same time, we're diligently implementing thoughtful adjustments to our proven strategies and solutions when
and where needed. This flexibility has enabled us to maintain or grow market share in most of our major markets
around the world.
Let's review our results in every geographic business unit, starting with the United States, where comparable sales for
the quarter were up 1% and operating income was flat. We continue to appeal to our customers with an increased
emphasis on new news across our menu and an ongoing focus on everyday affordable value.
The Dollar Menu remains a foundational component of our strategy to consistently deliver value across the menu,
rather than implementing aggressive short-term discounting tactics. At the same time, our focus on enhancing core
classics and offering additional premium products continues to provide customers with even more variety and choices
across day parts and price points. This quarter, we introduced new items across all four key growth categories –
chicken, beef, breakfast, and beverages.
Premium McWraps launched in April. The Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie and the Egg White Delight debuted in
May. And last month, we added fresh new taste to our Quarter Pounder burgers with three new flavorful recipes: Bacon
Habanero Ranch, Lettuce Tomato Deluxe, and Bacon & Cheese.

From a comparable sales standpoint, these new menu additions individually met or exceeded targeted performance
levels. However, a softer IEO environment and comparisons against prior-year promotional chicken and beverage
activity offset the sales driven by the new menu news. And, while June comparable sales were slightly negative in the
U.S., we continue to outpace the competitive set.
In June, I met with our leadership franchisees while they were in Oak Brook for one of their regularly-scheduled
meetings. While the challenges of operating a small business today are many, it is clear that we are aligned and focused
on what's most important, and that's the customer. It's that commitment to remaining customer-centric, along with the
assertive plans and vision we have in place, that enables all three legs of the McDonald's system to grow sales and
profitability for the long term.
Let's shift to Europe, where comparable sales were down 10 basis points for the quarter and operating income was up
5% in constant currencies. The UK and Russia continued to deliver positive results, while weak performance in
Germany and France persist. The UK's business remained solid. Second quarter results and continued market share
growth were driven by a balanced focus across value, core and new products, and promotional offers.
The UK launched blended-ice beverages in June, just in time to satisfy customers' cravings for something cool and
refreshing during the summer months. The lineup includes two delicious fruit smoothies – strawberry and banana, and
mango and pineapple – and a line of frappés, including caramel and iced mocha. Inspired by the U.S., these new
products expand the overall beverage lineup and further validate blended ice as a proven system solution that can be
deployed across markets worldwide.
Russia also delivered positive performance for the quarter, on top of last year's strong results. In addition to a focus on
the Big Mac, two seasonal premium offerings, the Royal Cheeseburger and the Big Tasty with bacon, contributed to
Russia's performance and demonstrated the strong ongoing appeal of our brand in this growth market. We expect the
lower inflationary environment in Russia to continue dampening our pricing power, pressuring near-term sales
momentum compared to last year.
Moving over to France, comparable sales and guest count performance remain negative, as the recession continues to
pressure the informal-eating-out industry. However, we are growing market share by balancing value and premium
products across the menu. For example, France recently added two new recipes to the popular Casse Croute entrée and
drink combo that contributed to market share growth during the lunch day part. This value offer was complemented by
a strong focus on two premium beef burgers, Le M and Le 280.
In Germany, negative comparable sales and traffic trends persist. Our traffic has declined at a faster rate than the IEO
industry, which also continues to contract. It's critical that our initiatives resonate with consumers in this environment
and in this marketplace, so to reestablish our momentum, we're leveraging recent consumer insights and continuing to
adjust our plans.
Let's shift to Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, or APMEA. Comparable sales were down 30 basis points for the
quarter, and operating income increased 3% in constant currencies. Although market share improved in China,
Australia, and Japan, comparable sales were negative for our Big 3 markets. Positive performance in other markets like
South Africa, Singapore, and South Korea partially mitigated the overall segment's decline.
Markets across APMEA are taking a holistic approach to stimulating demand. Across day parts, they're offering
limited-time and innovative products alongside established price value platforms. In Australia, we continue to grow
market share by balancing our focus on the core with the new product introductions and promotional activities. Strong
performance in 2012, including the launch of our Loose Change menu, along with external pressures in 2013 from
lower levels of consumer spending and heightened competitive activity, have contributed to weaker performance.
In Japan, consumers remain extremely price-sensitive. Comparable sales have been positive the last two months, and
we continue to grow share by leveraging limited-time offerings, like the Chicken TeriTama and sharing options such as
the Mega Potato, to keep customers coming back to our restaurants and to build our average check.

And in China, comparable sales were down 6.1% for the second quarter, reflecting the negative impact from avian
influenza, which continues to dissipate. We remain focused on leveraging promotional activities to showcase the
diversity of our menu beyond chicken, and strengthening our connection with customers through our ongoing brand
trust campaign that focuses on the quality and the safety of our food.
We remain confident in our ability to drive future performance in China. Going forward, comprehensive plans for our
key growth areas, particularly beverages, the family business, and the late night day part, remain our top priorities.
Around the world and across our system, we are focused on ensuring our strategies and tactics resonate with customers.
That's the key, the key to our performance, today and for the long term. As I mentioned earlier, our market teams
continue to strategically and thoughtfully adjust their plans in response to local consumer dynamics and growth
opportunities.
At the same time, we remain committed to prudently investing our capital and resources in those initiatives that will
further differentiate us from the competition for the long term. We're broadening accessibility by adding new
restaurants, we're modernizing our existing restaurants with reimages and remodels, and we continue to deploy
technology and convenience initiatives.
As our predominantly franchise business model continues to generate significant levels of cash, our priorities regarding
the use of cash have not changed. After investing in our business, we are committed to returning all free cash flow to
shareholders over the long term; first, through dividends, and then through share repurchases. For the second quarter,
we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.
In closing, I want to reiterate my confidence in our business and in the growth opportunities that exist. We are
diligently focused on executing the proven strategies within our Plan to Win. We have a resilient business model, an
aligned and talented system, and an experienced management team. We're leveraging these strengths and making
deliberate, continued progress toward winning this battle for market share and fortifying our position as our customers'
favorite place and way to eat and drink.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Pete.
Peter J. Bensen
Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. McDonald's continued to grow revenues and net income in second quarter within the
challenging global environment. The system remains focused on executing our strategies to become even more relevant
to the 69 million customers we serve every day. We continue to adjust our tactics where prudent, and are committed to
optimizing those factors within our control.
Our financial results for the second quarter reflect these efforts to strengthen near-term performance while continuing
to build our business for the long term. For the six months ended June, system-wide sales increased 3% in constant
currencies due to expansion. Combined operating margin declined 30 basis points to 30.3% over that same period,
primarily due to lower restaurant margin percentages.
We are primarily a franchisor, with 81% of our global restaurants operated by local businessmen and women.
Consolidated franchise margins contribute approximately 70% of our restaurant profits. This stable predictable income
stream benefits from comparable sales growth and is more insulated from inflationary and other cost pressures.
For the quarter, each area of the world contributed to franchise margin dollars, growing 4% in constant currencies to
more than $1.9 billion. The margin percent declined 40 basis points, to 82.8%, as positive comparable sales were more
than offset by higher occupancy expenses. Global company-operated margin dollars declined 1% in constant
currencies, to $842 million, for the quarter.
The margin percent decreased 50 basis points, to 17.7%, as higher labor, commodity, and other costs more than offset
slightly positive comparable sales. The margin pressures for the quarter were most acute in the U.S. and APMEA,
while Europe grew its McOpCo margin. In the U.S., second-quarter company-operated margins declined 110 basis

points, to 18.7%, due to higher labor, occupancy, and other operating costs.
The McDonald's system is effectively managing commodity expenses, with costs up about 1% in second quarter. The
full-year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 1.5% to 2.5%. The U.S. has been deliberate
regarding pricing, seeking to remain below the food-away-from-home inflation index of 2.2%.
Another relevant data point is food-at-home index, which is up only 0.9%, somewhat limiting our pricing power. At the
end of June, our U.S. price increase was 1.5%, which is about 120 basis points less than one year ago. As we move
through the second half of the year, we will consider future price increases, balancing our desire to build traffic and
market share amidst the reality of higher input costs.
In addition to pricing, we're employing more suggestive selling strategies at the order point to encourage trials of new
products and add-on purchases. As Don mentioned, it's a market share battle, so we're employing a variety of strategies
and tactics to grow traffic and increase relevance to our consumers.
Turning now to Europe, company-operated margins were probably the biggest positive of the quarter, as they increased
10 basis points to 19.4%. Europe's McOpCo margins benefited from the significant contribution from the UK and
Russia, our two strongest-performing markets in the region, who contribute nearly half of the segment's
company-operated margin dollars. In addition, France and other markets realized labor productivity gains as part of
their overall efforts to control costs and enhance efficiencies within the restaurants.
Commodities increased about 2% for the quarter, and for the full year, Europe's projected increase is now slightly
lower, at 2% to 3%. Europe is a collection of 39 markets, though our price increases vary by market, with Russia at the
higher end due to its inflation, albeit a little less than a year ago, and all other markets averaging about 1.5%
year-over-year.
Similar to the U.S., we have less pricing power in 2013 versus a year ago. In addition, given the economic
environment, in nearly all of our markets we are balancing a stronger emphasis on value, with compelling premium
products, to effectively manage average check and margins. We have a strong underlying business in Europe, and we
believe we are making the right strategic decisions and value investments to protect and grow the brand over the long
term.
In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 100 basis points, to
14.3%, due to new restaurant openings, mainly in China, along with higher labor costs throughout the segment. To a
lesser extent, avian influenza impacted our sales and margins in second quarter, but our team worked hard to manage
expenses and other controllables to mitigate some of the negative impact.
G&A discipline remains an area of focus. We seek to grow sales and revenues faster than our G&A spend. Year-to-date
June, G&A as a percent of revenues was 8.8%, versus 9% a year ago, which included our biennial Worldwide
Convention. For the full year, as part of our ongoing efforts, we have reduced our G&A spend, and now expect it to be
relatively flat versus the prior year, due in part to lower incentive compensation and efficiencies we have identified.
The growth in revenues and operating income within our franchise business model translates into significant generation
of cash. As Don reiterated, our first priority for this cash remains reinvesting in our business to drive future growth and
returns.
In light of the current environment, we have trimmed our 2013 capital expenditure forecast by $100 million, to about
$3.1 billion. Although we will open about 50 fewer sites, we believe this is prudent, given the short-term pressures.
More importantly, it will not undermine our long-term growth potential, and the quality and returns of our new
restaurants remain very solid.
The remainder of our capital is being invested in existing restaurants, in part through reimaging more than 1,600
locations. We are making steady progress in our efforts to modernize our brand, with about 50% of our exteriors and
about 60% of our interiors, on a global basis, reflecting the current contemporary look.

In the U.S. this year, we will touch about 10% of our traditional freestanding portfolio through a combination of
reimaging, rebuilds, and new restaurants. This will put us close to the 50% mark. Within the next year, a U.S. customer,
more often than not, will experience our brand in a more modern and relevant manner than before. We are excited
about the potential that this brings to our largest market.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted second quarter results by $0.02, more
than originally forecasted, as several currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. At current
exchange rates, we expect a negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02 on third quarter EPS, with a full-year negative impact of
$0.07 to $0.09. As usual, though, please take this as directional guidance only, because rates will continue to change as
we progress throughout the second half of the year.
Despite flat to declining informal-eating-out markets around the world, McDonald's grew revenue, operating income,
and earnings per share in second quarter. Our results underscore the solid platform from which we are operating:
unique franchise business model that harnesses the entrepreneurial spirit of local businessmen and women who operate
approximately 28,000 of our nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world; the powerful alignment of our system around
the strategies and key growth priorities that have allowed us to maintain or grow our industry-leading market share in
most of our major markets; and a strong financial foundation that allows us to invest for the future while making
prudent decisions to deliver near-term performance.
We remain confident in our brand and the competitive advantages of our system, which we believe will continue to
drive positive results over the long term.
Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.
Q&A
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Thanks, Pete. I'm going to open the call now for analyst and investor questions [Operator
Instructions] Our first question is from Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. I'd like to ask a question, maybe a multiple-part question, on U.S. sales. So you
commented on the U.S. second quarter performance being better than the QSR sector as a whole. Could you quantify
what you think the QSR sector did for the quarter, and was that also true in the month of June for U.S. performance
versus IEO? And maybe in conjunction with that, just talk about pulling Monopoly forward, kicking it off this week,
just the rationale behind that decision.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Joe, this is Don. Thanks so much for the question. And I'll try to address some of the
points you made, and then you can – if there's anything we miss, you'll let us know. But if we look overall in the U.S.,
it looks like – and I'll speak from an informal-eating-out perspective – it appears that we gained about 10 basis points in
the informal-eating-out category relative to traffic. So we know that the things that we have put in place are definitely
having some impact. And it also speaks to some of the things that took place relative to our focus on new products.
And so, again, looking at the U.S., we know that, this year, we were lapping some of the implementations of some of
the beverage strategies from last year, which launched a little bit earlier, Cherry Berry Chiller. We also know there was
a frappé launch earlier in the year. We also had 20-piece Nuggets that were launched last year. The great thing for us is
that the products that we've implemented in the chicken, breakfast, beverages, and beef category – being Egg White
Delights, Blueberry Pomegranate, the wraps, the Quarter Pounders – those things have performed well and met or
exceeded the targeted sales.
But again, some of the offsets that Pete and I mentioned are some of the reasons that sales are softer, aside from the fact
that the informal-eating-out category is projected to be down about 50 basis points. And so we know that, we've put
things in place to address that in the U.S., and we have outperformed the competition. We do know that we've
outperformed them on a year-to-date basis, from a comparable sales performance, by a little bit over 1%.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche.

<Q - Jason T. West>: Yeah, thanks. I guess just one point that you guys didn't touch on there was around the
Monopoly pull-forward, if you could touch on that. And then just bigger-picture, the comments in the press release and
your prepared remarks about a challenging environment over the rest of the year, I don't think you guys normally talk
about the forward outlook quite this much. So just wondering what your thoughts – kind of what's changed since the
April call, and would we be considering challenges, meaning kind of flat comps, continuing over the next several
months? Is that the kind of message that you're trying to send? Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Thanks, Jason. As you know, we don't give – we're not giving out guidance. That's not our
practice. We do expect the remainder of 2013 to remain challenged based on existing top- and bottom-line pressures.
We know we're seeing ongoing global economic headwinds. We're seeing flat or declining IEO markets and ongoing
competition chasing fewer guest counts as a result of lessened discretionary spending. We also know that this is a more
price-sensitive timeframe, based on these economies, and we still have ongoing P&L pressures, including higher labor
and commodity costs, and we have less ability to take that price.
So, relative to those things, that's kind of the, – if you would, the framework around the comments that we've made. We
continue to believe that long-term, the average annual financial targets that we put in place are achievable and
appropriate. We do know, however, in the near term, that we're going to face some tough economies around the world,
and the informal-eating-out industry is softer around the world. And matter of fact, 7 out of 11 out of our top markets,
we're seeing contraction from an IEO perspective.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: And, Jason, regarding Monopoly, that was a decision last fall when the U.S. was looking at
their calendar and looking at the product launch lineup, thinking about how do we follow up the introduction of these
great new products with a way to continue the momentum. And we know that Monopoly is always a great transaction
driver, and these new products are prominently featured in the Monopoly promotion, so following those product
launches up with Monopoly seemed like a very prudent thing to do.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks very much. Following up on the U.S., Don, when you say the IEO market in the U.S.,
what definition do you use for that? It seems to me I recall that you use a broader definition than just a quick-service
hamburger market. And if that's the case, could any of the weakness be described by – or explained by some of the
more near-in competitors doing better? And secondly, can you just – what is the dynamic in the U.S.? Is the low-end
customer still there, but the high-end maybe moved off, and maybe they're not taking you up on some of the higher-end
offers? What's the dynamic underneath the weakness in comps?
<A - Donald Thompson>: All right, thanks for the question, John. First of all, the definition we use is really more of a
protocol. It's CREST. CREST is the information that we use relative to our informal-eating-out data, and they are a
fairly broad database, to your point. So we look at the overall informal-eating-out industry. That is what helps us,
whether it be identifying opportunities or looking at who may or may not be doing as well in the industry at that point
in time. So it really is a good barometer of the overall marketplace.
The QSR segment is a little bit – it's a little bit more – I don't want to call it myopic, but it's a much smaller view of the
overall marketplace. So as we've looked at that, that's how we know that the overall marketplace was going to drop by
about 50 basis points. Now, the interesting thing about IEO is that QSR makes up the vast majority of IEO, and so
when you hear us talk about IEO, we are talking in a large part also about the QSR industry.
As we look forward, and if you look at who's winning, who's not winning in the marketplace, we do know that we've
gained market share. We know there are a couple of other players that have gained market share. And what we do is we
continue to look at our performance relative to the categories of growth which I mentioned earlier, which were chicken,
beverages, breakfast. And then we also look at the premium beef category, which is why you saw us implement the
Quarter Pounder line with the three different recipes, which is why you've seen us leverage our beverage strategy,
which we still have some opportunities to leverage that to an even greater extent. And so we're going to continue to do
that.

But when you look across our product implementations this year, they have hit each of the growth categories, and so
we feel fairly good those products have met or exceeded the expectations we had. As I mentioned, we did see some
offset based upon last year's promotional activity, particularly around 20-piece Nuggets, and then some of our beverage
strategies.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Okay, our next question is from Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Keith R. Siegner>: Thanks. If I could just ask another U.S. question, more broadly thinking about the IEO
market, it seems like a lot of the disappointment, say, versus our expectations, at least, on this side have come from IEO
market disappointment. If you think through the fact that you've got food-at-home now running significantly below
total food-away-from-home, even though you're running below food-away-from-home in terms of pricing, I guess what
I'm asking is, is the setup that the food away-from-food industry might be pricing a little too aggressively in a
low-inflation environment? How do you think about the relative share trends across IEO versus food at home? Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Keith, I'm going to let Pete talk a little bit about what's taking place and relative to our
own pricing. What I would tell you, and I mentioned it in my comments: one thing we do see in the broader industry is
we're seeing a lot of discounting, price discounting, rather than consistent value platforms, which we have around the
globe and we've put in place. And we're going to maintain that consistency because it's important to consumers. We
know that. But we have seen a lot of, I'd say, sporadic price discounting across the marketplace. But relative to what
we've done and how we've seen pricing, I'll ask Pete to make some comments.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, Keith. One of the things I mentioned, we're up about a point-and-a-half in pricing in the
U.S. on a trailing-12-month basis. That's 120 basis points below where we were a year ago, so that is clearly one of the
factors that is contributing to comps maybe being not as strong as some would think. When we look at the dynamics, so
food-away-from-home is up 2.5%; food-at-home up only 0.9% – that's on a trailing-12-month basis through June, so
comparable to our 1.5% price increase. But for the full year, both food-away-from-home and food-at-home are
currently projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% each.
So it will be interesting. We will definitely be looking at those as we move throughout the year in making decisions
about what we're going to do with price for the remainder of the year. But as you point out, to the extent that
food-at-home continues to be at a significantly lower growth rate, the grocery store is a competitor, and that does
impact the industry's ability to pass on price.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Okay, our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian John Bittner>: Thank you. A bright spot in the quarter was the profit growth in Europe. You had a slightly
negative comp, and you were able to somewhat increase the McOpCo margins there. So can you explain how that's
possible, how did that happen, and is that sustainable if we have continued weak, flattish-type comps over in Europe
going forward?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Brian, this is Don. I'm going to ask Tim to make comments about Europe and
productivity – I know he's made quite a few visits to the marketplace there – relative to what we're doing in McOpCo
and how we're focused on our margins there, and the profitability and productivity aspects of the business. Tim?
<A - Timothy J. Fenton>: Yeah. Brian, first of all, as Pete mentioned, the UK and Russia have been two of our
best-performing countries in Europe, which represent almost 50% of our company-operated margins. But, along with
that, the team has really done a great job of fine-tuning their P&L efficiencies, particularly in labor scheduling and food
cost controls. So they've done a very good job on scheduling efficiencies and just working those through the P&L, so
we're very happy with the progress they've made.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, our next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.
<Q - Matthew DiFrisco>: Thank you. I guess if – just looking at the guidance in the end of the 8-K there, you talk
about G&A. It looks like it's a little bit of a change from previous; where you were 2% to 3% constant-currency
growth, now you're flat. I was wondering what came out of that. Is it simply just a lower outlook brings about lower
compensation, or is there some of the technology spend that you did last year that you had thought was going to

continue at the same pace? Have you been able to save money, or are you deferring that to 2014? Thanks.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Matt, it's really a combination of factors. Obviously, the technology spend, we think, is an
important long-term differentiator for us, and a lot of that is in the restaurants, so we're appropriately pacing that.
There's other areas that we looked at for efficiencies in terms of spending. And then, finally, as you mentioned, lower
performance will yield lower incentive comp, and so there's a lower outlook for that as well. So it's a combination of all
of those.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.
<Q - Jeff Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you. Just two quick follow-ups; first, as we look at the European
business, seems like economists are getting a little bit more bullish on the European economy, seems like people are
calling for bottoming in the middle of 2013 and recovery starting late in 2013. So, being that you get to service all those
markets across Europe, I'm just wondering, on the trends you see within the data, how would you size up the pace, or
do you feel confident in the likelihood of recovery? Seems like France and Germany would need to improve before,
perhaps, the UK and/or Russia slows. I'm just wondering how you'd size it up based on the data you're seeing.
And the follow-up is just the quality of comments you guys gave for the remainder of the year being challenged. I'm
just wondering, because you said fairly – a couple of times I know you mentioned that you still grew revenues,
operating income, and earnings in the second quarter and in the first quarter as well. I'm just wondering if that's a
reasonable assumption for the back half of the year, or would that dynamic change? Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Jeff, just a little bit, maybe, on the European economy, and then as we talk about
challenges for the rest of the year. First of all, European economy, I can give you a perspective. All of us travel quite a
bit to our markets. I don't know – the economists may be a bit ahead of themselves. That's my personal perspective, but
it's based upon the fact that if you look at GDP growth, even quarter one versus a year ago, or even as you roll into
quarter two, France is still in a recession, two quarters now that we've seen negative GDP growth. We've got Germany,
which is negative in GDP growth. Spain is still suffering. From an unemployment perspective, you've got much higher
unemployment than the norm across Europe.
Youth unemployment is something that is somewhat alarming, whether it be in France at 26%, Spain at 57%. You've
got markets – I was recently in Portugal and Ireland. You've got markets – some markets may have bottomed out. I
would tell you some of the larger markets are still having some challenges. So we're looking forward to the bottom-out,
so to speak, and then a resurgence. At times, you'll see a resurgence in some of the markets. Europe, for us, means 39
different areas and countries that we're working in. But it's still a challenged environment.
The wonderful thing for us – and I call it a wonderful thing because, if we weren't focused on having implemented the
value platforms when we did about a year ago, we would have lost more traffic. At this stage of the game, we are
continuing to gain market share across the majority of European countries, and that is the position we wanted to be in.
Solidify market share, solidify customer visits; those things then, we know, lead to – with visits you can get sales; with
sales you can get profitability. But you have to have the sales coming in the front door. And so for us, right now,
Europe is still a bit challenged.
As we look across the rest of the year, the notion – when we made the comment about challenged, it is similar to the
second quarter. So, as we see third and fourth quarters, we see them similar to the second quarter, where we still see the
ability for us to continue to move the business forward. However, they are challenging environments. And you know
we don't give guidance, but we're just really being as transparent as we've always been relative to what we see in the
marketplaces.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. My question is on the CapEx guidance revision, and I just wonder,
philosophically, why the need to trim the CapEx for this year. And you mentioned that you wanted to be conservative
with that, even though the returns on those investments look good. So I'm just wondering what is going on, on that line
and what you might be seeing that's giving you pause there.

<A - Peter J. Bensen>: David, it's really only about 50 openings that we trimmed from the guidance. So, to your point,
new restaurant openings are our highest-returning investments, and the new openings over the last 12 months are no
exception to that. They've generally been performing well. With the exception, probably, of China, where – with the
chicken issues in China and the slower economic growth there, that is the biggest of all of the markets contributing to
the 50-store decline. So they took a hard look at their inventory. Some of the sites they're pushing off to the future to
open. And if you think about our opening cycle, there's 12 to 24 months from the time we identify a site until we go to
ground-break, so that's a lot of time for the market dynamics to shift around a little bit. So we're just fine-tuning around
the edges some of the inventory, and not making any dramatic changes to our outlook for our new restaurant openings
or our overall CapEx spend.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham.
<Q - Mitch J. Speiser>: Great. Thanks very much. And concerning the U.S., the company-operated margin decline of
110 bps, could you perhaps try and parse that out between cost pressures and promotional activity?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, Mitch. Being down 120 basis points in pricing is probably the single biggest contributor
to the margin weakness there. But we had pressure across a lot of the lines in the P&L. So, without that extra pricing,
wage rates, a little lower efficiency – we threw a lot of new products at the restaurants this quarter, so our efficiency per
crew hour was down a little bit. We had additional depreciation from reimages that continue. And we had the increased
additional advertising and promotional costs from the new products. So we had, on the cost side, these incremental
pressures that were not overcome by a stronger comp.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from Michael Kelter from Goldman.
<Q - Michael J. Kelter>: Yeah, I guess, with all respect around the economy being tough, ultimately, between the
focus on value messaging and the new products that you say are all hitting targets, realistically, it's just not moving the
needle for you in this environment. So I guess my question is what do you need to do to adjust? Essentially, other than
the economy getting better, what are you going to do differently to get more people in the doors in the next 6 to 12
months?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Michael. This is Don. First point, and I want to reiterate it: we're winning in the
marketplace. When we look at market share across our major markets, we are gaining market share. And that's an
important factor here. So if you ask what do we need to do to adjust, I think we need to continue to adjust. We've been
adjusting now for about the last couple of years relative to making sure we had solid value platforms. We've ensured
that we have a good mix of value and premium based products so we can glean as much margin as possible.
What we don't have, and Pete just mentioned it, is we don't have as much pricing power. And as long as inflationary
rates are lower, and as long as GDP growth and consumer discretionary spending is softer, we're not going to move
forward and take a lot of price, because we know that it would mean guest count erosion longer-term. So we'll be
mindful of the price increases that we take. We'll continue to make sure that our value platforms are installed and
strong. We'll make sure that we have a very solid menu pipeline, which has helped us to, as you see in the U.S., to
outperform the competition en masse. And so when we look at what we're doing now, we think those are the right
things to do.
Pete mentioned growing the business and developing new sites. Our new sites are performing relatively well, and so
we're going to continue to invest capital there. The returns on reimaged sites, when you have less comparable sales, that
gets a little bit tighter. We'll continue to monitor that, to Pete's point, as we always do from a financially responsible
perspective. But good pipeline, good value, good marketing campaigns, those things will continue. As I mentioned,
we'll continue to invest in technology, and we think we do still have some room to grow relative to some of the things
we can offer our consumers from an engagement perspective there. And we'll continue to make sure we have good
marketing spend, good awareness relative to our advertising.
So we're going to continue doing those things and implement those solidly. We'll continue focusing on the growth
strategies we've talked about. There is room to grow in beverages and in chicken and in breakfast, and we're moving
breakfast around the globe. So all of these pieces are the things that, for us, we still have a lot of work to do at

McDonald's, and we'll continue to focus on those areas.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Don, thanks, I just wanted to get a better read on your view of the U.S. consumer. Looks like,
obviously, both quick serves and casual dining consumers in the U.S. are pulling back on spending pretty dramatically
in June and July, so from what you've seen with your own customers, what are some of the key economic drivers of the
more conservative behavior? What I mean is, just more specifically the last couple of months, it seems like a line's been
drawn in the sand, consumers have definitely stayed away from pretty much all forms of restaurants, or at least cut
down on their occasions, and again, just curious what your view is on what's going on.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Jeff. Great question, and the way you positioned it is accurate as we've seen it. We have
not drawn a direct correlation as of yet to sequestration or other, I'll say, tactical executions that have occurred in the
U.S. What we do know is that there was a pullback to some extent, and it does seem to be impacting the
informal-eating-out industry a little bit more so than broader retail. So, again, what we have to do is make sure that we
institute and continue to have solid value, and we have to do that by balancing and also with some innovative new
news. This is going to be absolutely critical for us as we move forward. We have to continue to invest in the business
appropriately, but make sure we're mindful of the returns.
I don't foresee this changing in the next couple of months, which is why we spoke of the rest of the year being
challenging. And what we see in the United States is not unlike what we see in some of the other markets that are out
there. Having said that, we feel pretty solid about the fact that we can continue to gain market share, and that's our
focus. And if we can do that, we'll gain additional guest counts, we'll gain additional sales, and we'll gain additional
profitability.
The pricing piece that Pete mentioned, again, is going to be tougher through the rest of the year in terms of taking price,
so we'll be monitoring that and measuring that relative to our margins. But again, the marketplace itself is a little bit – it
is a little bit tighter than we've seen. But one thing we've never done at McDonald's, we don't cry or whine over market
conditions, because all of us are in these same market conditions. So we just have to stay focused on what we do best,
which is move the business in the ways we've discussed today.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Andy Barish, Jefferies.
<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Hey, guys, one quick follow-up and then one new area. Just in terms of the Monopoly shift,
does that open up the October window for a new product platform potentially here? And then just on the new front, on
franchise margins, they continue to slip a little bit. Is that purely a function of getting comp back into solidly positive
territory to see a turn, or should we expect some of the higher D&A and occupancy to continue to weigh, at least
near-term, on franchise margins?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Andy, I'm going to let Tim make a comment relative to Monopoly. I think you make a
pretty solid point about whether or not it opens up another opportunity. Clearly, we couldn't speak to specifics, but he
just finished one of the reviews with the U.S. business, so can give you a couple of headlines as to some of the things
they discussed. Relative to franchise margins, we'll have Pete make a comment on that after Tim.
<A - Timothy J. Fenton>: Okay. Well, Andy, I can't say specifically on what products we have coming in, but we
have a pretty robust fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter, coming down the pike. And as far as Monopoly, we moved
it in, as everyone has stated already, and really take advantage of the foot traffic that we do have in our third quarter.
So, products coming; can't get specific on it.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: And, Andy, you point out the franchise margins. Compared to McOpCo margins, they're even
more sensitive to the comp because the base of cost is more fixed. So the depreciation and the rent are really – we
really need a stronger comp to start to get that percentage to move upwards.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Andy, too – and I know we've talked about this and we've tried to relay it on the call – the
new products that we've implemented have resonated with consumers. And I want to make sure that everyone
understands that IEO is relatively flat and declining in many of the markets around the world. So we're not going to

change that menu pipeline execution strategy. It is absolutely working. However, we are facing some headwinds. And
so we'll continue to execute that, continue to make our target to outperform in the marketplace as a whole. But I think
you are quite clairvoyant to the fact that there may be something that does come up in the latter part of the year relative
to new products.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, next question is from Bryan Elliott, Raymond James.
<Q - Bryan C. Elliott>: Thank you. I'd like to talk about competitive environment outside of the U.S. So, the
informal-eating-out market, particularly in Europe, has been soft for some time. Are you seeing evidence yet of some
shrinkage in supply? And also, thinking about China, which has been through a meaningful short-term contraction, if
there's been any shakeout of competition, particularly thinking of maybe of local type, non-deep-pocket type
competition, if you're seeing any benefit potentially down the road from some of that?
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Bryan. Outside of the U.S., some of the competitive sets are different. I'll ask Tim; he
can speak a little bit to some of the things that he's seen out there. But keep this in mind, the U.S. is – there are a couple
of markets that are similar to the U.S., not quite to the U.S. level, relative to the competitive density of competitors as
we know them. In many of these cases, you have more, as we would define them, smaller chains, mom-and-pop type
organizations. So we do see consolidation in some of those smaller ones when you get into recessionary periods or
macroeconomic conditions like these. But relative to whether or not we've seen larger chains that are consolidating,
that's not something that I have seen. But, Tim, I don't know what else we've seen out there in your travels.
<A - Timothy J. Fenton>: Yeah, Bryan, a lot of couponing and vouchering going on, but we're seeing a rise in the
nontraditional competitors that we've faced in the past, particularly cafes, convenience stores, bakeries, and
supermarkets coming up with ready-to-eat meals. So that's been a resurgence for them, particularly in Europe. On
China, the overall chicken market is kind of taking a step backwards as it pertains to the IEO. It's starting to dissipate
now and coming back, but particularly I would say in Western QSR has probably taken the biggest decline.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, our next question is from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Hi. Thank you. It seemed in the last release, in the April release and on that conference call,
you were a little bit more protective about profitability in the U.S. And I wonder if there is a change, if I'm right in
sensing that, there was a change relative to how we're thinking about the business now. And, of course, I ask that in the
context of the franchisees, which I think make more money per store level than – in fact, I know make more money per
store level than any other major franchisee group – if they've really signed on to, I think, what you're asking them, is
less pricing, continue with the Dollar Menu, focus on driving traffic even if it doesn't necessarily come to an extent of
increasing their near-term store level cash flow.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, John. Thanks for the question. I would tell you the franchisees have done, I think, a
stellar job in this environment, and if you think about it from their perspective, several things. One is they've definitely
been aligned relative to the things that we have asked of them: focusing on the customer, ensuring that we continue to
invest in the business, whether it be reimages or whether it be with new products and the new product introductions.
We have really accelerated some of those introductions in getting those to the marketplace because it's very important
to have new news and exciting news as well as to execute value.
They have been very, very aligned on the value campaign and platform. Having said that, they've given a lot of
feedback relative to what does the Dollar Menu look like today and how we need to maintain that, and what things we
might need to look at in terms of any modifications at any point in time. So I think the franchisees have done a really,
really solid job. They've continued to invest in the business, and we, along with them, in the business, they are one of
the greatest assets that this overall McDonald's family has.
I'd also add, along with that, our suppliers, because they're in an interesting commodity and legislative environment as
well as the franchisees and small business owners, and they also have supported our system relative to how we want to
be able to manage through these macroeconomic issues around the world. And so I can't say anything but be
complimentary about what our franchises have done relative to their cash flow investments, their focus on the business,
their focus on the customers, their focus on their employees, and their focus on a broader alignment around the

McDonald's system.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from R. J. Hottovy from Morningstar.
<Q - R. J. Hottovy>: Thanks and good morning. Wanted to keep it in the U.S. for a minute; you talked about the new
product innovations meeting or exceeding expectations. I was hoping to get some color on the Dollar Menu, just in
particular your thoughts about the recent Dollar Menu performance and how that compares to your expectations,
especially with so much promotional activity in the environment. Thanks.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, R. J. The Dollar Menu itself still represents about 13% to 14% of sales, which is still in
that same range it's been in. What has benefited us has been the fact that it is a consistent execution, and it still has
tremendous alignment across the franchisees and the McOpCo restaurants that we have. So it is the value platform of
choice. Now, we've done a couple of things to try to add some new news to that, which also help us to be a little bit
more margin-accretive, things like the Grilled Onion Cheddar Sandwich, Hot 'n Spicy McChicken, limited-time offer
selections that we've placed into the Dollar Menu. Even having done those, we still remain at 13% to 14% of sales
based upon the Dollar Menu. So it is a solid platform for us.
The last thing I'll mention is, early on, we talked about the fact that there are – Tim mentioned we see a lot of
discounting in the broader marketplace. We know that one of the most important things that customers look for is
consistency in terms of the value platform. They want to know that they can depend on McDonald's to continue to
deliver value every day, all day. And the platform for us is more than about short-term discounts. It's about establishing
customer loyalty versus being aggressive for one or two months. We need long-term loyalty. We want a strong
customer base, we want to make sure we drive visit frequency, and we want to support the introduction also of
higher-margin products, so build the base so that when we implement new products, those products have more
awareness relative to our consumer base.
So we've established these branded affordability platforms around the world now, and they are performing to the levels
that we would like. We have a couple of markets, R. J., that we still need to do a little bit of work, and Tim is focused
on some of those markets. But, by and large, we're in a pretty solid place relative to value platforms around the world.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: The next question is Peter Saleh from Telsey Advisory Group.
<Q - Peter M. Saleh>: Great. Thank you. I know it's still early, but maybe you could give us a little bit of a preview on
your outlook for commodities for 2014. We've seen grain prices coming down. And I remember last summer we had
grain prices really shooting up because of the drought, and your team, in the U.S., at least, was able to do a pretty good
job in terms of your exposure for this year. So any thoughts on 2014 would be pretty helpful.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Yeah, Peter. It's premature for us to give any numerical guidance, but you can imagine, as you
point out, that our team is constantly looking at how do we best deliver that stable, predictable price to the restaurants.
While we're not trying to be market-timers, we obviously do look at the markets to see when conditions might be better
to layer on some coverage. And you can imagine that we are working with our suppliers, and our supplies are putting
hedges on, going into next year, to provide us some of that stability. Probably at the analyst meeting in November is
when we'll start to give some numerical texture around 2014.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: And our next question is Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thanks. You've talked about new news, and I'm wondering if it's fair to kind of assess
that as evolutions of current platforms. And I'm asking because it seemed like you've brought a lot of customization of
these platforms to the menu, and I'm wondering how you feel about that being a key driver of sales and profits versus
your peer group.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hi, Nicole. I think you'll see both. You'll see some areas that are customization, if you
would, and I assume you're talking about things like the Quarter Pounder line. But you'll also see some new platforms
like you've seen with McWraps. You'll see us also do limited-time offers, so relative to beverages, whether there'd be
other products that we would implement. And I think Tim gave some insight as to other things that we might see, say,
in the U.S., but this is consistent also, Tim, around the world.

<A - Timothy J. Fenton>: Yeah, and in the U.S., Egg White Delight, being able to put that on different muffins and
different carriers. But as we move into the platform deployment of Made for You, you're seeing more customization.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right, then we have time for one last question, Paul Westra from Stifel.
<Q - Paul L. Westra>: Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the Value Menu efforts
in France, particularly maybe Australia a bit. I know you rolled out the Petit Prix menu there, and given the softness
economically, I was curious to get as much color as we can about the mix, the value effort there, and maybe the
percentage of add-on sales within that menu that helps pay for it. Is that progressing as planned? And I guess a related
question to the Loose menu effort in Australia, I'm just somewhat surprised about the overall comp going negative.
With the great success of the Loose menu, it seems it would have prepared you well for this year's economic softness,
and curious maybe about market share changes in Australia as well.
<A - Donald Thompson>: Hey, Paul, I can speak to the end of that with Australian market share changes, and then I'll
ask Tim to talk about the other part of your question, which was France and France's value piece. Relative to Australia,
Australia is another one of those markets that, at this point in time, we see – from their perspective, you're seeing some
softer – clearly, a softer economy. Youth unemployment in Australia is about 25.5%. So they are facing some things.
Unemployment for them has risen. Having said that, Australia's also one of the markets that we have had some solid
share gains in and continue to have share gains in Australia. So the broader marketplace we've seen some tough
economy, but we've also seen some share gain and we've seen our business moving forward there. And again, I think
the franchisees and the folks, the company employees and suppliers have done a good job there.
So, Tim, anything on France?
<A - Timothy J. Fenton>: Yeah, Paul in France, you remember us talking about Casse Croute, which is a baguette
sandwich and a drink for under €5, has done extremely well for us, particularly in the lunch day part. France is gaining
market share in a declining IEO environment. The thing that we're working on to address is looking at some erosion at
the dinnertime, and the folks have done a really good job of putting some products in test to address that. But it's a
tough environment there. They're gaining share at the expense of the rest of the IEO players.
Kathy H. Martin
All right, thanks, everyone. We've got some final remarks from Don.
Donald Thompson
First of all, thank you all again for being on today's call and participating. And as we wrap up the call, I want to make
sure that you all understand that, while we recognize that this is a challenging environment, we've been through
challenging environments before as McDonald's. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages of our
system truly are a strength, and they're a reflection of our ability to build on and learn from the past. Having been
through cycles before, these are different when you see them in the broad nature of these around the globe, but we're
being purposeful and we're being agile, very flexible in our local markets about how we address some of the challenges
that are there.
We are going to be and continue to be strategic relative to the way that we plan and evolve based upon customers'
spending habits, their discretionary opportunities, and the fact that we want to be their favorite place and way to eat. So
we look to evolving without customers, evolving in these marketplaces, and leveraging our history to make sure we
mitigate through these challenges.
Thanks so much for all of your support and your questions, and have a great day.
