MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings release
conference call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director
of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook;
and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after that we will open the call to questions from analysts.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking
statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and
expense, taxes and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.
For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2014 and the Form 8-K filed
with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking
statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.
And I'd also just like to remind you that as we indicated in our last quarterly call, we are now including the results of

We've also updated our product summary reporting and we are now reflecting five categories of results: iPhone, iPad,
Mac, Services and Other Products. We prepared schedules showing reclassifications of historical operating segment
and product results for each of the last 12 quarters to conform to these new groupings and they are available now on our
website at apple.com/investor.
So I would now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Timothy D. Cook
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
Today, we are reporting an historic quarter and I'm incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to the amazing
results you are about to hear. Interest in Apple products is at an all-time high with over half a billion customer visits to
our physical and online stores during the quarter.
Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations with sales of over 74 million units driven by
the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average, we sold
over 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day, every day of the quarter.
The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones
were available in 130 countries around the world making this our fastest and most successful rollout ever. Additionally,
the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million while the
rest of the PC market continued to decline. App store revenues were up a remarkable 41%.
Demand was strong around the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products accounted for over half of all mobile
device activations globally from the 19th to the 25th of December. It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On
November 22, we shipped our one billionth iOS device. It was a Space Gray 64 GB iPhone 6 Plus, which we've saved
here at Apple. 1 billion devices is an almost unfathomable milestone and we are all incredibly proud to be a part of it.
Apple's mission is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich the lives of others. Through the success of iOS we
have provided hundreds of millions of people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our
customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new ideas for business, and express their
creativity in ways that no one could have imagined when we sold the first iPhone less than eight years ago. It's amazing
to watch and it reminds us that people and great ideas are the reason we make the things we make.
Our strong overall performance in the December quarter resulted in total company revenue of $74.6 billion and
earnings of $18 billion. Both of these numbers are all-time records for us with revenues up 30% and earnings up 38%
over last year. And due to our very large capital return activities, earnings per share were up even more at 48% to
$3.06, also an all-time quarterly record. Our results would have been even stronger absent fierce foreign exchange
volatility.
We've also made great progress on a number of very exciting new initiatives to further strengthen our ecosystem.
We've been blown away by the reaction to Swift, our new programming language. Inventing a new programming
language is something very few companies can do and we believe it will have a profound effect on our ecosystem.
Swift became available in September as part of the Xcode tools and in the first month those tools were downloaded
over 11 million times. A recent report from RedMonk showed that Swift has had unprecedented growth and is quickly
climbing the list of the most popular programming languages.
We've seen many of our developers choosing Swift as they build significant new projects and we are seeing fantastic
work with Swift going on in education. Very recently, Stanford University release their Developing iOS 8 Apps with
Swift course, which was posted to iTunes University, making this amazing resource available to everyone in the world.
There's also been incredible interest in HealthKit with over 600 developers now integrating it into their apps.
Consumers can now choose to securely share their health and wellness metrics with these apps and this has led to some

great new and innovative experiences in fitness and wellness, food and nutrition, and healthcare.
For example, with apps such as American Well, users can securely share data such as blood pressure, weight or activity
directly with physicians and leading hospitals such as Duke Medicine, Stanford Children's, and Penn Medicine are
integrating data from HealthKit into their electronic medical records so that physicians can reach out to patients
proactively when they see a problem that needs attention.
With HealthKit and the iOS Health app we believe we're just at the beginning of amazing new health and wellness
solutions for our customers. Our extensions of iOS in the home with HomeKit and in the car with CarPlay are also
continuing to progress and this year we are looking forward to amazing HomeKit enabled products from several
companies and CarPlay enabled vehicles from over 30 automotive brands.
Also, as you know, we introduced two new categories in the fall and we're making great progress on both of them.
Apple Pay is off to a very strong start and the feedback that we are getting from both individuals and institutions is
extremely positive. Today, about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring Apple Pay to their customers and
in just three months after launch, Apple Pay makes up more than two out of three dollars spent on purchases using
contactless payment across the three major U.S. card networks.
In merchants who already accept Apple Pay, the rates are even higher. Panera Bread tells us Apple Pay represents
nearly 80% of their mobile payment transactions and since the launch of Apple Pay, Whole Foods Market has seen
mobile payments increase by more than 400%.
You can use Apple Pay up and down Main Street to pick up a prescription at Walgreens or Duane Reed, get office or
school supplies at Office Depot and Staples, and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast-to-coast
including Bi-Lo, Harveys, Save-Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie, among others.
More merchants are excited to bring Apple Pay to their customers and adoption is strong. Just today, USA
Technologies announced they made Apple Pay available at about 200,000 places where every day payments happen
including vending machines in businesses, airports, and schools; commercial laundry machines in colleges,
universities, and laundromats; and parking meters and payment kiosks in lots across the country.
Point of sale suppliers tell us they are seeing unprecedented demand from merchants and all of our partners and
customers simply love this new service. With all of this momentum in the early days, we are more convinced than ever
that 2015 will be the year of Apple Pay.
Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule and we expect to begin shipping in April. Developers are hard at
work on apps, notifications, and information summaries that we call Glances, all designed specifically for the Watch's
user interface. The creativity and software innovation going on around Apple Watch is incredibly exciting and we can't
wait for our customers to experience them when Apple Watch becomes available.
We're also making great progress in our partnership with IBM and our collaboration is winning over new customers. In
December, we delivered the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services,
telecommunications, governments, and airlines making iPhone and iPad even more productive for enterprises by
providing app-to-cloud services with IBM's big data and analytics capabilities. Another 12 apps will be released this
quarter including three new industries: healthcare, energy and utilities, and industrial products. This will bring us to a
total of 22 apps and we're on track to have over 100 by the end of 2015.
In just over a month, more than a dozen enterprise customers have signed on as foundation clients to transform their
companies with iPhone, iPad and IBM MobileFirst solutions including Miami-Dade County, the seventh largest county
in the United States by population, and American Eagle Outfitters, which operates more than 1,000 retail stores and
ships to over 80 countries worldwide.
And the list of new customers is expanding rapidly. IBM is engaged with more than 130 additional companies looking
to empower their employees with MobileFirst for iOS Solutions and the list keeps growing. We couldn't be more
pleased with this partnership.

In addition to all these initiatives, we have a robust product and services pipeline that we are very excited about and we
look forward to sharing more about them with you throughout the year.
In addition to the contributions we make to humanity through our products, we made great progress on important
projects during the quarter including Connect-Ed and Product Red. With Connect-Ed, we're focused on making a
difference for students and communities who need it the most. We recently chose 114 schools across 29 states to
receive an Apple Connect-Ed grant. Despite their economic challenges, all of these schools share a vision of what their
students' lives would be like with Apple technology and we're proud to help them bring that to life.
And in December, we undertook our largest ever initiative to help Product Red achieve the goal of an AIDS free
generation. To commemorate World AIDS Day, we worked with some of our developer partners to create and donate
the proceeds from 25 special apps and we also contributed a portion of sales at our retail and online stores on two of the
year's busiest shopping days. As a result, Apple's donations set a new record.
Delivering the results we are reporting today reflects months and years of focus and determination from teams across
Apple as well as our amazing developers and business partners. I'd like to thank all of them for their commitment and
performance and I'd also like to thank our incredible customers for their ongoing loyalty and enthusiasm.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our December quarter results in more detail.
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.
In the December quarter, we generated all-time record revenue of $74.6 billion, an increase of $17 billion or 30%
year-over-year. We achieved this exceptional performance despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from many
currencies. Our growth was broad-based across the world with revenue from developed countries up 20% and revenue
from emerging countries up 58%. The performance of our greater China segment was particularly impressive with
revenue up 70%.
Sales were well ahead of our expectations in a number of areas. The unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus
combined with our tremendously successful production ramp allowed us to build and ship several million more iPhones
than we had expected when we provided guidance back in October. And also Mac revenue and Services revenue
reached all-time highs.
Gross margin was 39.9%, above our guidance range, and operating margin was $24.2 billion, representing 32.5% of
revenue and our highest operating margin percentage in 10 quarters. Net income was $18 billion, surpassing our
previous all-time record by almost $5 billion. This translated to diluted earnings per share of $3.06, a 48%
year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was exceptional at $33.7 billion, also a new all-time record.
For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.5 million iPhones, an increase of 23.4 million over last year
representing 46% growth. iPhone sales grew strongly in both developed and emerging markets. Among many great
results around the world, unit sales were up 44% in the U.S. and up 97% in the BRIC countries. Sales doubled
year-over-year in China, our second-largest iPhone market, as well is in Brazil and in Singapore.
Thanks to the popularity of iPhone 6 Plus and the increased value customers saw in our highest storage capacity
offerings, iPhone ASPs were $687, an increase of $50 over the year-ago quarter. This led to iPhone revenue growth of
57% year-over-year with quarterly sales exceeding $50 billion for the first time ever.
We had a 200,000 unit decline in iPhone channel inventory during December quarter this year compared to an increase
of about 1 million iPhones during the year-ago period and we were not able to reach supply demand balance until this
month. This left us below our target range of five to seven weeks of channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
We're now working with about 375 carriers representing 72% of the world's mobile phone subscriber base and we have
over 210,000 points-of-sale for iPhone across the globe. Our customers love their iPhones. A December ChangeWave

survey measured a 97% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone.
A study published by Chitika Insights last month indicated that iPhone accounts for 53% of North American
smartphone web traffic, almost twice the level of the next closest brand. And in the corporate market, ChangeWave
found that among IT buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter this year, 77% intend to purchase
iPhones.
Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 700,000 units over last year, a
14% growth rate. Thanks to the popularity of our stunning new iMac with Retina 5K display, Mac ASPs increased by
$58 sequentially, driving all-time record revenue for Mac of $6.9 billion. We achieved double-digit year-over-year unit
growth in both desktops and portables.
These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC market, which IDC estimates declined by 3%
in the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel
inventory slightly below our four to five-week target range.
Turning to iPad, we sold 21.4 million units compared to 26 million in the December quarter last year. Given the
introduction of new iPads in October we increased iPad channel inventory by 1.1 million units during the quarter
compared to an increase of about 2.1 million in the December quarter last year. This left us within our five to
seven-week target range of channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
Customer experience and usage data for iPad continued to be excellent. In a November survey ChangeWave measured
a 98% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air and also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90
days, 60% plan to purchase an iPad. And among businesses planning to purchase tablets the intent was even stronger at
78%.
Chitika Insights most recent report indicated that iPad users in North America generate over 70% of tablet-based web
traffic, more than six times the web traffic of the next closest competitor. And Custora's latest e-commerce report
indicates that iPad accounts for 82% of all U.S. e-commerce transactions from tablets.
All of these results are consistent with usage data from the holiday shopping season. IBM's Digital Analytics
benchmark service found that iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and almost four times the
e-commerce sales on Android devices during November and December.
The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Combining all of our services revenue grew to $4.8 billion in the December
quarter, a new all-time high, and an increase of 9% year-over-year. This record performance was driven primarily by
the tremendous momentum of the App Store with revenue growing 41% in the December quarter. Our iOS developers
have earned over $25 billion from the App Store to date and we are thrilled with their success. Total sales of media and
software from iTunes were $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Our direct channel performance was also outstanding. We welcomed more visitors than ever before and generated
record revenue in both our physical and online stores. We opened 10 new retail stores during the quarter bringing us to
a total of 447, 182 of which are outside the United States. We've opened two new stores this month in greater China
and we're on track to have 40 stores in greater China by mid-2016.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $178 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a
sequential increase of $22.7 billion. We completed our first international debt offering issuing $2.8 billion euro
denominated notes at very attractive interest rates and greatly diversifying our debt investor base.
We spent $5 billion to repurchase 46 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in
dividends and equivalents and utilized over $500 million to net shares settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired
an additional 8 million shares in connection with our accelerated share repurchase programs.
We have now taken action on almost $103 billion of our $130 billion capital return program including $73 billion in
share repurchases with four quarters remaining to its completion. In the last 12 months alone we have returned over $57
billion to our investors. We review our capital program on an ongoing basis. We continue to solicit feedback from a

broad base of investors and we're on track to announce an update to the program in April when we report our second
quarter results.
Now as we move ahead into the March quarter I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52
billion and $55 billion compared to $45.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. And this represents a very significant revenue
increase despite growing foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most
currencies.
We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion.
And we expect OI&E to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. Also today our Board has
declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on February 12, 2015, to shareholders of record as of February
9, 2015.
With that, let's open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
And we ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question, one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question,
please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First we'll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much, and nice iPhone numbers. Can you talk a bit, Luca, about currency:
how you're thinking about it, what it did this quarter, what it does to gross margin, what it's going to do during the year,
because that's clearly a big topic of conversation?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, Sharon, I'll do that. I'll talk about Q1. I'll talk about what we're looking for in Q2 and
possibly even further, right?
Obviously what we've seen during Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies. I would say during the course
of the quarter, the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian ruble but also from euro, Australian dollar,
Canadian dollar. Our revenue growth during Q1 would have been four percentage points higher on a constant currency
basis.
On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies. As
we look forward and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in
Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons. The first one is the fact that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate
against foreign currencies during the last few weeks. And the other one is the fact that our existing hedges expire, they
get replaced by new contracts at current levels, and therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging
program diminishes over time.
What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in constant
currency would be five points higher than what we are guiding to if it wasn't for the FX movements. In terms of gross
margins, and you know that we look at gross margins on a sequential basis, the gross margin percentage after the offset
that we're getting from the hedging program will be impacted by over 100 basis points.
Now, having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into the guidance that we provided to you. So
that's where we are right now. Of course as you look further out, we do not provide guidance past the March quarter,
but it goes without saying that at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reasons

I explained earlier, that our hedges continues to expire they get replaced by new hedging contacts at current levels and
so on, and that is the impact that we will see during the course of the year.
It goes without saying a strong U.S. dollar has a negative impact on our international business. Having said all that, we
have provided what we believe is very strong guidance for the March quarter. We remain very, very confident about
the portfolio of products and services that we have in the market today and we remain very, very confident in the
pipeline of products and services that we have.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And as a follow up to that can you talk a little bit about pricing power? Basically as
you think about currency and euro movements and that, and then the contracts you have with the carriers, can you talk
about maybe the opportunity to raise prices? Because I know it's something that a lot of companies are balancing right
now.
<A - Luca Maestri>: I think, as you know, we prefer to adjust local pricing at the time of new product launches. That
would be obviously our preference. That's what we do in normal times. When currencies move as much as they have in
places like Russia, for example, sometimes we need to take mid-cycle action to realign pricing. So we will see what
happens. As you know currency markets tend to be very volatile, so we just want to understand a bit better what is
happening.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From UBS we'll hear from Steven Milunovich.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you, I wonder if you could address the mix of the iPhone 6 line? Specifically,
how did the 6 Plus do? I don't know if you can give us a sense of relative to total units? Maybe geographic skew? And
also availability, are you caught up on the 6 Plus?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Steve, it's Tim. We don't report out the precise mix, but what I can tell you is that iPhone 6
was the most popular iPhone last quarter, but obviously to sell 74.5 million, they were really all popular. And all did
well. There's clearly a geographic preference difference where some geos would skew much higher on their preference
to the iPhone 6 Plus than other geos. So it is something that is not consistent around the world. But both did incredibly
well, and we're really proud of them along with the iPhone 5S and C as well, which continues to be in the lineup.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. And then can you update us in terms of the sell through relative to the reported
numbers for the phone and the pad? And your previous plans to increase by roughly a week of channel inventory?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased
from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units. And that left us outside of our target range on the low, outside the
low end of the range, to be specific. We, just recently we became in supply-demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in
January. We were not able to reach a balanced state during our fiscal Q1.
On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter. That
compares to the previous year where we increased it 2.1 million. Obviously that inventory was required because of all
the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe, during
the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel inventory on iPad.
In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we're outside of it, we wouldn't expect to see a
large step function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of an all at once type of
thing. But we don't guide to channel inventory specifically, as you know.

From Morgan Stanley we'll go to Katy Huberty.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Yes. Thank you. So not to dilute the fantastic performance in December but can you talk a
little bit about how you think about the sustainability of this very strong iPhone demand into 2015, particularly given
that most carriers had access to that product during the quarter? And then I have a follow up on margins.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, sure, Katy. It's Tim. You can see from the March guidance that we've given that we're
incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward. We believe that it's the best smartphone in the world. Our customers are
telling us that and the market is telling us that. We're doing well in virtually every corner of the world and so we're very
bullish that it does have legs.
I would point out that only a small fraction of the install base has upgraded and so there's a lot more people within the
install base. But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in
any prior launch and also that the current iPhone lineup experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last
three launches in any of the three previous years. And we didn't look back to the other years so I don't know about
those.
And so we see that we're appealing to new customers, both new to smartphone and new to iPhone and people
switching. We're very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products we're
shipping. And so we're very, very bullish.
The emerging markets, which has been a source of great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning in
Brazil and mainland China, more than doubling year-over-year, which is a 3x to 4x what those markets were doing
according to IDC. And so we entered the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Good. And, Luca, as you know, you typically enjoy component cost downs and yield
improvements as you move through a product cycle. Is there anything other than currency that keeps you from
potentially walking the gross margin higher over the course of the year? Thank you.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Hi, Katy. You're right, I mean on both fronts. We certainly expect more favorable costs in the
March quarter than we've seen in the December quarter. It goes with our product cycle. The foreign exchange
headwinds, as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of more than 100 basis
points. If you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in
margins.
The other element that is there and you know it's very seasonal. It's always there. It's the loss of leverage that we got
from Q1 into Q2. When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and
30%, so you obviously have that loss of leverage but without a doubt the biggest headwind that we've got right now is
foreign exchange. Having said all that, guiding 38.5% to 39.5% we feel slightly very good about where we are right
now in the cycle.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?

We'll go to Benjamin Reitzes, Barclays.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it and, Tim, obviously a lot of good questions about the great
iPhone number but I wanted to ask about the Apple Watch shipping in April, a month or two later than I think you said
originally. Obviously probably not that big a deal but what's going on with that product in a little more detail in terms
of the timing and your excitement for it and maybe a little more color on other apps that could be available at launch?

And any expectations you have for it would be great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Well, my expectations are very high on it. I'm using it every day and love it and I can't live
without it. So I see that we are making great progress on the development of it. The number of developers that are
writing apps for it are impressive and we are seeing some incredible innovation coming out there.
And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015 and we sort of look at the year and think of early as the
first four months, mid is the next four months and late is the final four months. So to us it's sort of within the range and
it's basically when we thought. We're going to – but most importantly, we're going to be thrilled to start shipping it
because we got a lot of customers that are wanting to get one.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Okay, great. Thanks, Tim. And then just a follow up, in terms of China, how do you feel
the momentum there is in terms of sustainability and versus some of the local competition and as you navigate that
market specifically going forward? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The local competition was obviously there this quarter and it has been there for many
quarters before and so the local competition isn't new. I think we did really well there. I'm very proud of how we're
doing. I was there right after the launch in October. And the excitement around the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were absolutely
phenomenal and you can see that in the results with mainland China being up 100% year-on-year despite not having a
full quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October. You can tell that we're a big believer in China,
we're looking at our investment, we're growing the number of stores. We will hit 20 soon and we are doubling that by
mid-2016 as Angela said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well.
We're also growing the channel there, our online store has expanded to over 350 cities now. In fact, our online revenues
in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five years. So it's an incredible market. I think people love
Apple products and we are going to do our best to serve the market.
<Q - Benjamin A. Reitzes>: Thanks.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue guidance.
Luca, as you mentioned the range is down 26% to 30% sequentially. I think if you look back over the last three or four
Q1 to Q2s, revenues declined more in the 15% to 20% range. As you noted, your iPhone channel inventory is below
your target range as well, so if anything that might be going up. So I'm wondering if you could just discuss a little bit
what factors are contributing to this deeper than normal decline this quarter particularly given your ongoing enthusiasm
for the phone?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question. I mean it is, first of all, it is 20% year-over-year growth that
we're guiding at the top end of the range. So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth.
As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think it's important to point out. I mentioned the
foreign exchange headwinds. They are there. We need to deal with them. But they obviously are a negative to revenue.
Those are headwinds that we've had this year and were not there a year ago. So that's one factor. We also said the
manufacturing ramp that we've had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we've ever had. And so
that's also a factor that impacts the sequential compare.
And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat
this year. One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent
channel sale for China Mobile that of course is not going to repeat this year. And we also had a very, very strong
quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities and

a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1.
And again, that is not going to repeat. So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential
decline that we see this year. Again, I want to point out to the 20% year-over-year growth.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. Thank you. Luca, just to confirm sequentially my math is saying it's about a
two point incremental revenue headwind. Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - Luca Maestri>: From FX?
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, currency, FX sequentially.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Correct.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. Tim, I was wondering if I could direct my follow-up to you which is the iPad.
You've spoken on prior calls about your enthusiasm for the product on a go forward basis. Over the last year, it's down
double digits from a unit perspective, and ASP has also been declining. So I was wondering if you could comment on
whether your bullishness about the iPad persists, and is it really – do you believe it's a replacement cycle that we will
ultimately see that will start to drive growth? Or is there really innovation in product that is both necessary and
forthcoming that's going to drive that growth?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as I've indicated before.
When you measure in these 90-day clips as we do, in the short run I don't think you're going to see a miraculous change
or an improvement in the year-over-year, but here's what I see when I look at it and the reason I'm so optimistic. I see
that the first-time buyer rates are very high. So by very high, I mean that if you look at some of the developed markets
like the U.S., Japan, the U.K., you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. If you look
in China, it's over 70%. And so when you have that kind of first-time buyer rates, you don't have a saturated market.
When I look at the customer sat on iPad, it's literally off the charts, in some cases 100%, which is unheard of in surveys
to get these kind a customer sat ratings. When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest competitor. The
usage is defined, as measured in web browsing is like 71% of total tablets as I think Luca covered earlier. Also the
commerce taking place across the iPads is enormous. Essentially over 80% of the commerce on tablets are taking place
on iPad. And so when I back up and look at all of these, and I believe that over the long arc of time that the iPad is a
great business. I also have visibility obviously of what's in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that.
That said, I'm not projecting, to be clear with everyone, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the
next. I'm thinking over the long run. In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true that
the upgrade cycle is longer. It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. We haven't been in the
business long enough to say that with certainty, but that's what we think. There's probably some level of cannibalization
that's going on with the Mac on one side and the phone on the other. So you probably have a little bit of that that is
shaking out. How much, it's very hard to tell in the early going, particularly since we just shipped the new phones a few
months ago. So I think there are some things like that that are going on.
On the other side, I think the partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on in the enterprise is profound. I
think we're really going to change the way people work. I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how
fast the partnership is getting up and running. So I think that can move the dial there. I'm not predicting the 90-day clips
and so forth, but over the long arc of time, I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product, and also coupled
with the product innovation we've got, I think there's a very, very bright future for it.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yep.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?

We will go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Good afternoon, and congratulations. A couple questions for Tim. First, any updates
on Apple TV or your broader vision of the living room?
And second, a high-level question about Apple Pay. You've outlined some of the successes at point-of-sale. Can you
talk a little bit about if in-app is important or how important that is? And potentially how the product could evolve over
time? Could you see this becoming more consumer-to-consumer? More just kind of a broader payments platform?
Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Gene, on Apple TV, we had a solid quarter with the existing product. We've sold over 25
million Apple TVs now. You know, at the sake of repeating myself, it's something that we continue to look at and work
on and find a way that we can make an even greater contribution that what we're doing.
On Apple Pay, both the contactless payment and the in-app are both important. I think they're both huge opportunities.
I think they will play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and will
likely – the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth.
In terms of how it evolves, I think we are in the first inning on it. We haven't completed the first inning yet. There is
tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it. We are obviously – we're just in the U.S. right now, so
there's tons of countries to go to, and there's not a day that goes by that I don't get notes from many businesses outside
the U.S. wanting Apple Pay and banks and merchants. And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S.
But I have to tell you that given that we launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked, at
how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season, because generally most
people sort of lock down and don't do very much. But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants, and I give
them a lot of credit for that.
I think we are just on the front end, and I think that this is the year of Apple Pay. Some of the things you mentioned and
others are all things that we are looking at and in many cases working on in terms of where it can take us.
<Q - Eugene Charles Munster>: Great. Thank you.

From JPMorgan will go to Rod Hall.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start off, Tim, you talked about the small
number of the user base who have upgraded to iPhone 6 or 6 plus. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color
on that? Maybe even go as far as quantifying how many of the base you think you have upgraded? And also talk a little
bit about the pattern of upgrades. Are they all tending to be older iPhones? Or is there a good spread? Can you give us
any further color on that? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's a small fraction. It's a number that's in the mid-teens or barely in the teens. And so when I
look at that, I'd say that there's an enormous amount left. And given there are a fair amount of Android units out there,
there's also an enormous amount of Android customers that could switch. And I'd also remind you that there's a lot of
people that have not yet bought a smartphone. And I know it doesn't feel like that when you're sitting in the United
States but from a worldwide point of view there's still lots of them. And so I see all three of those groups there and I'm
very excited about all of them and serving all of them.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then my follow up I'd like to direct at Luca. Luca, I wonder could
you talk a little bit about the duration of the hedge contracts and the renewal pattern that we should expect to see this

year? Just kind of remind us what your typical renewal pattern is and will you be accelerating that this year given all
the currency movements?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes, Rod. Typically we have a pretty active hedging program. So we're in the market almost
every day. But we tend to hedge 3 month to 12 months out. There are cases where maybe we tend to go a bit longer if
we feel that we have a strong conviction about certain currencies. Otherwise, again the typical period is 3 months to 12
months. And as hedges roll off, we replace them with new hedges. We take into account the exposures that we have
around the world, take into account our most recent forecast and we hedge accordingly. We feel very good about our
hedging position and the decisions that we've made, particularly during the summer when we felt that maybe we
needed to hedge a bit more than we had done historically.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's probably worth pointing out, too, that there's some markets where we can't economically
hedge.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah, there are some exposures where the cost of hedging is prohibitive or the financial
instruments are not there to hedge. And in those cases of course that's where you get the full impact of the volatility.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Rod. Can we have the next question, please?

From RBC Capital Markets we'll go to Amit Daryanani.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks, I guess. I just have two questions. One maybe just on the gross margin side. I want to
understand, the 100 basis points of headwind that you're talking about in the March quarter, is that part of, there's still
some protection on the hedges? Or is that a raw number with no hedges in place?
<A - Luca Maestri>: No, that's correct. I think it's a good clarification. I was talking about the net impact after the
hedges. The impact without hedges would be higher. And again this is sequentially, right? Because on a year-over-year
basis actually the impact is larger given the fact that currencies have moved even the last twelve months. The 100 basis
points that I quoted includes the mitigating impact of the hedging program.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it. And I guess just when you think about the iPad and you talked about the IBM
partnership where you're seeing some traction, could you just talk about what sort of penetration do you guys think
iPads have on the enterprise side right now? And how do you see that improve over the next few quarters as you rollout
more of the MobileFirst modules with IBM?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We think that – well, we know that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an example, we are in
essentially all of the Fortune 500 companies. But the issue is, so this issue not that and it's not a market share number
because our market share is extremely high. The issue is that enterprises generally speaking are only deploying iPads to
a small percentage of their workforce.
And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work. In order to do that,
you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like word
processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools, et cetera. And so that's one of the things that working with IBM
provides us is both that and the knowledge of the verticals, which they bring a significant amount of knowledge on all
the verticals that I mentioned earlier.
So where can we take that to? I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous.
We are not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point, but we don't do a lot of big partnerships, as you
probably know. So when we do one, it is significant, and it's because we really believe in it. And we really believe in
this one and what can it can do for customers.

From Deutsche Bank will hear from Sherri Scribner.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Thank you. Luca I was hoping you would give us some detail on your expectations for
operating expenses going forward? I know you've been investing pretty significantly in new products, but wanted to see
how we should think about those trending over the next couple quarters? Thanks.
<A - Luca Maestri>: Sherri, as you know, we provide guidance just for the upcoming quarter. And from what you've
seen from our guidance for the March quarter, we're guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year-over-year basis that is
similar to what we've experienced during the course of the December quarter. We obviously feel good about the
business during the December quarter, our revenue exceeded in terms of growth, our growth in operating expenses.
There's going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. Our expense-to-revenue ratio during the December
quarter was 7.4%. It was the lowest that we've had in two years. It's among the lowest ratios that we've ever had. But
obviously we're investing in the business, and we will never underinvest in the business.
The majority of the increase will continue to come from R&D, given the fact that we've expanded our product
portfolio. And we make investments all the time ahead of the revenue that would be generated in the future. We also
expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We're expanding distribution all over the world. We've taken
our brand to more places, and we continue to open new retail stores around the world. So the idea for us is to continue
to invest in the business, making the right trade-offs, and the results from the December quarter give us very good
confidence for the future.

We will go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on your previous comments on the iPhone and the customer
composition for the quarter. Considering the iPhone 6 Plus brought you into an entirely new segment of the smartphone
market, can you give us a bit more color on the customer composition for this device specifically? You mentioned the
differences in geographic adoption, but how about on the Android switcher comments you made earlier? And first-time
adopters relative to the traditional iPhone 6 and your other iPhone models in the past? And I guess related to that, what
do you think this tells you about your ASP and unit opportunity for growth in 2015?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, at this point in the – just shortly after the quarter we don't have all of our research in
from all of the people that bought last quarter yet, but in the aggregate, as I mentioned before, we saw more new
customers to iPhone than we've ever seen before. And we had a higher rate of Android switchers than we had in the
three previous launches, and it's not that we had more in the fourth. And I don't know what those numbers are. It wasn't
something we're looking at. So between the switchers and the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an
iPhone, and our upgrades, which we're very happy with, but represent a small fraction of our install base, we feel really
great about what's in front of us.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: That makes sense. And then a follow-up on your Apple Pay commentary, when we look at the
opportunity outside of the U.S., are there unique hurdles we should consider as we think about the timing of the rollouts
in Europe and Asia? Or is it really just about pulling the partnerships together?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Each is a different implementation. So in some ways like, there's a different set of carriers in
every country. There's a different set of banks in a lot of the countries. Some of the processes with the merchants are
