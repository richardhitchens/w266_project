MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
My name is Marvin, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013
Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President
of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Thanks, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our conference call to review our
operating performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2013. We accomplished a lot during 2013 on many fronts,
including operational and strategic, and we're looking forward to delivering in 2014, a year which will be characterized
by significant clinical data flow.
Leading the call today will be our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway, who will provide a strategic report on our
performance in 2013 and outlook for 2014. We also have our Interim CFO Michael Kelly, who will review our Q4 and

full year results and provide financial guidance for 2014. Tony Hooper, our Head of Global Commercial Operations
will then discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. And finally, Sean
Harper, our Head of R&D will then outline the expected flow of data for many of our pipeline products. After Sean's
comments we should have ample time for Q&A.
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you
separately by e-mail. Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that
through the course of our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and
actual results may vary materially.
So with that, I would like turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Okay, thank you, Arvind. I think confident is the best way to describe how we feel about our long-term growth
prospects as we head into 2014. Our confidence is bolstered by our performance in 2013 on all fronts, financial,
operational and strategic. Financially in the fourth quarter, as you can see from our results, revenues were up 13% and
our earnings per share were up 30%. For the full year, revenues were up 8% and earnings per share up 17%, reflecting
strong execution and continued momentum in our business.
Geographically, we grew across all our markets. We were strong in the US, and once again this year, I believe we're
one of the few companies growing revenues in Europe, and that reflects the strength of our current products and recent
launches as well.
In terms of individual products, the highlights for 2013 include Prolia and XGEVA contributing $1.8 billion of sales;
Sensipar exceeding $1 billion for the first time; and after 15 years on the market, Enbrel remaining the leading
anti-TNF therapy; and of course, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN continuing to grow with the benefit of their established
safety and efficacy track record.
While delivering strong operating performance in 2013, we invested in the growth of our business, and that's reflected
in our advanced pipeline. We have ten molecules that are in late stages of development and set to deliver pivotal data
by 2016. We also have a portfolio of six biosimilar molecules that we expect to begin launching in 2017. 2014 in
particular will be a data-rich year for us and Sean will provide details on when we expect information to become
available during the year.
Just this past week and earlier this afternoon, we reported top line results from the third and fourth of our five pivotal
studies for evolocumab. We're excited about the results that we're generating and think they're forming the basis of a
strong package for global registration.
In addition to making investments in our own R&D programs, we acquired Onyx and ivabradine rights in the U.S. We
look forward to advancing Kyprolis in the rapidly growing multiple myeloma market. As you know, we believe
Kyprolis has an important role to play as a backbone of therapy in multiple myeloma and ivabradine looks to have an
interesting prospect in heart failure.
On international expansion, we made significant progress in 2013 in Japan, China and the key emerging markets. In
Japan, our partnership with Astellas is off to a strong start, developing five innovative molecules in a business which
Amgen can gain control of as early as 2020. In China, we have filed Vectibix and have in place a partnership with Beta
Pharma to help launch the molecule. We expect to be able to launch Kyprolis in China shortly after Vectibix.
In emerging markets, through the reacquisition of our Neulasta and NEUPOGEN rights from Roche, we're now present
in more than 75 countries, enabling us to exceed our international expansion goal two years earlier than originally
planned. Expanding our business into new regions is an important element of our growth strategy for the long term.
So let me conclude my comments with a few key messages. 2014 is a year in which we expect to generate a lot of data.
And while this data will inform our long-term growth prospects, we expect solid performance from our base business

during the course of the year. With full ownership of Enbrel now in the U.S. and Canada, we expect to grow its
operating income contribution by some $800 million in 2014. As Michael Kelly will detail in a moment, we expect
solid growth in revenues and adjusted earnings per share during 2014, which will enable us to continue growing our
dividend consistent with our capital allocation strategy.
Finally, I'd like to thank all of my Amgen colleagues, many of whom may be listening in to the call, for their
contributions to delivering for our shareholders and patients last year. I know I can count on my Amgen colleagues as
we work to create even more value in 2014.
Now let me welcome Michael Kelly to the call and ask him to walk you through our financial performance for the
quarter. Michael?
Michael Anthony Kelly
Thanks, Bob. Turning to the fourth quarter on page four of the slide deck, you can see revenues grew by 13% driven by
strength across our product portfolio both in the U.S. and internationally. This also reflects incremental revenues
following our acquisition of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, both from Kyprolis as well as from Nexavar and Stivarga.
Operating income grew by 24% as operating costs grew well below revenues. Within operating expenses, our cost of
sales margin improved by 0.8 points to 16%, driven by lower royalties. Research and development cost increased
year-over-year, with roughly half of the increase due to the acquisition of Onyx and its Kyprolis clinical program. The
remainder was driven by our late-stage clinical trials, particularly for evolocumab.
SG&A expenses decreased by 3% due to the end of the Enbrel profit share in the quarter. Specifically on October 31,
our profit sharing arrangement with Pfizer ended and was replaced with a royalty on Enbrel sales, which we will
continue to report in the SG&A line going forward. The two month benefit of this change reduced expenses by about
$130 million versus the year-ago quarter and will contribute about $800 million next year. That benefit was partially
offset by the addition of the Onyx SG&A expenses.
Net income increased 28%. Similar to last quarter, the tax rate was lower compared to 2012 due to the federal R&D tax
credit and the change in the geographic mix of expenses and revenues. Finally, adjusted earnings per share were 30%
higher, helped by a lower average share count compared to 2012.
In summary, for the full year on page five, revenues grew 8% to $18.7 billion and adjusted EPS grew 17% to $7.60 per
share. We exit 2013 with good momentum as we move into 2014.
Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on page six, we generated $5.6 billion in free cash flow in 2013 and
increased our quarterly dividend per share by 31%, with payments totaling $1.4 billion. As you are aware, we
announced another 30% increase to the dividend starting with our first quarter 2014 payment. We remain committed to
our capital allocation strategy and continuing to increase the dividend over time. At the end of the year, we held $22.8
billion in cash, short term and restricted investments and $32.1 billion in debt. The roughly $5 billion increase in debt
from the end of the third quarter reflects borrowings to complete our Onyx acquisition funding.
Finally in 2013, share repurchases amounted to $800 million at an average price of $85 per share, all in the first quarter.
You will notice that our average share count increased sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters as we did not
repurchase shares and saw some dilution from stock-based compensation. Let me remind you that we don't expect any
significant repurchase activity in 2014 and 2015 and thus expect to see similar effects on share count going forward.
Now let me turn to guidance for 2014 on page seven. We expect total revenues in the range of $19.2 to $19.6 billion
and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.90 to $8.20. This includes the $800 million operating income benefit
from our full ownership of Enbrel in the US and Canada. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to range between 15% and
16%, which assumes that the R&D tax credit legislation will be passed in 2014 and retroactively applied to all of 2014.
And lastly, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $800 million, a slight increase from the last few
years, reflecting investments in Onyx Pharmaceuticals and our global manufacturing operations. Let me now turn to

Tony. Thank you.
Anthony C. Hooper
Thank you, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. You'll find the summary about global sales performance on slide
number eight. We delivered strong fourth quarter performance, with product sales including Kyprolis growing at about
11%.
In the US, our business grew 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. US wholesale inventory levels ended at the high
end of our normal range. Outside the US, our business grew 9% in the fourth quarter or 10% excluding the impact of
foreign exchange.
I'd like to review our fourth quarter product performance beginning with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN. Year-over-year
global sales in Neulasta increased by 10% in the fourth quarter. This was mainly driven by price, with unit demand
remaining stable. NEUPOGEN sales were flat year-over-year while quarter-over-quarter sales declined 34% due to the
$155 million order from the US government in the third quarter. We've seen minimal impact from recently launched
competition, as Neulasta and NEUPOGEN shares remained stable in both the US and Europe during the fourth quarter.
We continue however to take all competition seriously.
Now to Enbrel. Fourth quarter sales grew 3% year-over-year largely due to price. Our investment in direct-to-consumer
advertising with Phil Mickelson continues to drive brand awareness, which is important as physicians continue to honor
over 90% of Enbrel patient requests. We remain the value share leader in both rheumatology and the dermatology
segments and we're confident in Enbrel's potential growth.
Moving on to Aranesp. Aranesp sales were down 4% year-on-year. We continue to see price pressure in Europe, and
second, slowdown in the US. EPOGEN sales increased 10% year-over-year. This was mainly driven by an increase in
unit demand given the withdrawal of Omontys in early 2013. Hemoglobin levels have remained relatively stable
throughout 2013 based on our most recent data. We will continue to monitor end user dose utilization as the new 2014
bundle payments go into effect.
Now I'll turn to Sensipar. As Bob mentioned, global Sensipar sales exceeded $1 billion in 2013 for the first time ever.
For the fourth quarter, sales increased 20% year-over-year due to segment growth and increased penetration in Europe.
Nplate and Vectibix sales in aggregate were higher by 16% year-over-year mainly due to increases in unit demand. Our
European Vectibix label for the treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer now includes the new NRAS and first line
data. We're excited about the growth potential for Vectibix in Europe and its benefits for patients. For Nplate, we
continue to see segment growth in both the US and European markets.
Moving now to denosumab. As Bob noted, the d-mab franchise contributed sales of $1.8 billion in 2013. In the fourth
quarter, Prolia sales grew 53% year-over-year, driven by increased segment share in both the US and Europe. We've
now launched in all major European countries. In the US, our direct-to-consumer campaign has been very successful.
Prolia is now the most requested brand by new postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. We're launching a new campaign
with Blythe Danner in the next few weeks to continue raising patient awareness.
I'm pleased to note that XGEVA also reached the $1 billion milestone in 2013. This is our seventh product to exceed $1
billion in annual sales. For the fourth quarter, XGEVA global sales grew 33% year-over-year. Outside the US, XGEVA
grew 124% year-over-year. Our commercial focus remains on reminding physicians and patients of the superior clinical
profile of XGEVA. This is an important differentiator in the face of generic zoledronic acid competition. We grew
market share in the US by 3 percentage points and saw successful launches and growth in Europe. XGEVA is now
available in all major markets.
Let me know turn to our newest product, Kyprolis. Kyprolis achieved quarter-over-quarter growth in the fourth quarter
as the Onyx acquisition closed. The underlying demand growth was consistent with second and third quarters. Based on
our data, Kyprolis continues to be the therapy of choice in the relapsed refractory multiple myeloma setting in the US.

We expect the next major inflection point for Kyprolis will be upon inclusion of second line data in our label.
In summary, we'll build on the progress we made in 2013 as we execute on growth opportunities for 2014 and beyond.
Let me now pass you to Sean.
Sean E. Harper
Good afternoon. We have an exciting year ahead with data flow from our pipeline that's already begun with our new
press release just recently on top line results from our third and fourth Phase III studies of evolocumab, which were
very encouraging for patients with dyslipidemia and high risk for cardiovascular events. We anticipate the results of our
last pivotal Phase III advocacy study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in the near future.
We believe these studies will support a global filing plan in 2014, based on the reduction of LDL cholesterol. Of
course, the precise timing will depend on our ongoing discussions with various regulatory agencies. In the US for
example, timing for evolocumab is dependent on having achieved appropriate progress in our ongoing outcome study.
Turning to our oncology programs, we were encouraged by the feedback on Kyprolis from clinicians at the ASH
meeting last month and are looking forward to new Kyprolis data in the first half of this year, including a review by an
independent data monitoring committee of an interim analysis of the ASPIRE study in relapsed multiple myeloma
patients. I would note that ASPIRE compares a regimen containing Kyprolis on top of Rev/dex to Rev/dex alone and
may be an instrumental study in expanding Kyprolis' label to earlier lines of therapy. We are also expecting the final
analysis of the FOCUS study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma during the first half of the year.
Our two immuno-oncology programs continue to advance as well. In 2013, we reported that our Phase III T-VEC study
in metastatic melanoma met its durable response rate primary endpoint with favorable interim trends in overall
survival. We continue to expect the final overall survival data in the first half of this year. We believe there's also an
opportunity for T-VEC to prime the immune system with the so-called checkpoint inhibitors, and we are currently
investigating T-VEC in combination with ipilimumab in a Phase Ib study, and are planning to study T-VEC soon with
other immune-based therapies, such as PD-1 antagonism.
We also expect Blinatumumab confirmatory Phase II results in relapsed refractory adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia
in the first half of 2014, and we've also initiated a Phase III study in this indication.
For Trebananib, our peptibody directed against the angiopoietin axis, we continue to estimate the final overall survival
analysis from the ongoing pivotal study in recurrent ovarian cancer to occur in the second half the 2014. Recall that this
study met its PFS primary endpoint in 2013.
Velcalcetide, or AMG 416, is our novel IV calcium pneumatic being investigating for the treatment of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Phase III data are expected in the second
half of this year.
Our psoriasis program for brodalumab consists of three Phase III studies, one placebo controlled and two head-to-head
studies comparing to ustekinumab or STELARA. I'm pleased to report we expect to see the data from the first of these
studies in the first half, with the other two reading out during the course of the year.
On January 1, our romosozumab Phase II data in postmenopausal osteoporosis was published in The New England
Journal and described in the accompanying editorial as quote "a potential breakthrough in osteoporosis therapeutics."
We have reassessed the sample size for our placebo controlled two-year fractures trial on the basis of a slightly lower
than anticipated event rate and accordingly increased the sample size [indiscernible] (20:13). The study actually
completed enrollment in Q4. Recall that this is a two-year fracture study and consequently, we expect the study will
read out in the first half of 2016.
We have also initiated a Phase III head-to-head study of romosozumab against teriparatide, exploring bone mineral
density, advanced imaging and biomarker endpoints in postmenopausal women previously treated with
bisphosphonates. We remain very excited about the potential for romosozumab.

As you may recall, we have developed the only monoclonal antibody antagonist of the CGRP receptor that's in the
clinic, AMG 334, which has demonstrated a potent ability to pharmacodynamically block this access in Phase I.
Accordingly, we've initiated a Phase II dose ranging study in patients with episodic migraines and are planning to soon
initiate a study in chronic migraine.
Our biosimilars unit continues to make good progress, and I am pleased to report that enrollment has commenced in our
biosimilar Avastin pivotal study. To remind you, we now have three pivotal biosimilar studies underway, Avastin,
Herceptin and Humira.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment personally to thank my colleagues, both in R&D and many other parts of the
company for helping to make possible a very promising 2014. With lots of momentum building toward delivering a
wave of innovative therapeutics for patients in need. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
All right. Thank you, Sean. Let's open it up now for questions. And Marvin, why don't you remind our callers of the
procedures and we'll start with the first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thanks for taking the question. So just starting off with the pipeline, AMG 416, maybe
you could talk a little bit about how you see its place in the market versus where Sensipar is now and what kind of data
would make doctors think it's superior? And then I guess another part of that question is it's IV, so it might be in the
bundle. How do you think about the market opportunity, given that? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Great, thank you, Robyn.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So from a market perspective, let me just talk quickly. Obviously, Sensipar has been very
successful in terms of both growing the segment and increasing penetration in that one at the moment. One of the issues
we have, of course, is constant patient compliance, and we find a large number of patients aren't staying on their drug
for the entire 12-month period. The IV form of course, which would be co-administered during dialysis, would make
life much easier, and then if we think both in terms of outcomes and in terms of maintaining patient on drug, it'll be a
unique opportunity to add to the bundle.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Thanks for taking my question. Hey, I was just wondering, Sean, I think you said you're
going to file on 145 in 2014? Can I just confirm that's the first time you said that or maybe I just haven't done my
homework? And second of all, there's been – we've heard from other folks that the FDA has asked PCSK9 sponsors to
have roughly 25% of their events accrued in the outcomes trials at the time of filing. Can you give us any color if you
received that kind of feedback or if you would encourage me not to believe those people that are saying those things.
Thank you very much.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Okay. Well first of all, yes, I think this is the first time that we've been clear that we would be
receiving all the pivotal data sets in a timeframe where we would be pursuing global filing plans in 2014. And that is
our intent. As I mentioned, with each jurisdiction, we'll have discussions with regulators about the precise timing and

requirements for filing. It's clear that the FDA are interested in understanding that these outcome studies are
progressing and that there's an ability to have some sense of when the final results would become available from an
outcomes study. But really these are ongoing discussions. We have initial consultations with regulators when we're just
in a concept phase, and later when we actually have data, we have much more in-depth interactions and discussions.
So, I don't generally discuss the details of these fluid interactions that go on over the course of time with regulators. But
it is clear that the agency is wanting to have an understanding of the trajectory of the outcomes trials before they would
proceed with approving this class of product, based on just LDL alone. They did make that choice.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: All right.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks for taking my question. It's on the revenue guidance for 2014. Looks like you're not
only forecasting a deceleration in growth but also a slower rate for sales than you are exiting Q4 in. And I assume some
of the inventory effects that Tony mentioned might have to do with that. But maybe you could just broadly outline how
you're thinking about the current portfolio and its growth prospects in 2014, which if any franchises might be
declining?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure. Go ahead, Tony, why don't you address Eric's specific comments and then I'll add a
thought.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay. So on inventory, the inventory we saw happen in the U.S., when I say ending at the
slight up end of the range is about a day. So it's about $50 million in terms of wholesale inventory. We think there
might have been another $50 million at the end user but not a large amount of money. The product mix as we go
forward into 2014 starts to change slightly, of course, as we get for the first time the full competition on the Filgrastim
portfolio. We have potential competition from Mircera against EPOGEN and our growth brands are now coming off a
much higher base. So that's why you've possibly seen some slowdown but still strong positive growth
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And Eric, the other thing I'd add is while we provided revenue and earnings per share
growth, we obviously also addressed the strong operating income growth that we're expecting driven by the improved
contribution from Enbrel. So you ought to expect that we're focused on driving strong operating income growth this
year and, with that, strong cash flow growth.
All right, Marvin, let's go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi and thanks for taking the question. Was just wondering with respect to the PCSK9, if you
can give us any latest thoughts on your delivery device and if a bridging trial is going to be required for the new
device? And then I realize you're not going to comment directly on pricing for this class, but maybe can you walk us
through any of the potential factors that are going to guide your decision on pricing? Thanks a lot.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Okay, this is Sean. I think we remain clear in our position that we don't want to really get into
the details around these devices and the regulatory strategy behind them. We're confident in having every two week and
monthly presentations for the product and I'd prefer not to get into more detail than that. Tony, you may want to
comment on the second half of the.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So just in terms of price, I mean everything is really around the fact that there continues to
be a huge unmet medical need with patients with cardiovascular risk, even when they're on statins. We expect, or we

see more than 30% of patients don't reach goal and therefore remain at high risk, be it the heart attack or death in fact.
So we will price this drug tier around that unmet need in the marketplace, understanding that this is a biologic, yes.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking my question, too. This is also a little bit of a financial
question, but if you looked historically, I guess it's a follow-up to Eric's question. I'm trying to get a sense here how
conservative is your guidance, or rather how much competitive headwinds are you expecting on the revenue line? And
what do you – help us understand maybe if you can a little bit of the OpEx too. Because I think the guidance is below
consensus and it's a little surprising.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yaron, as I said, we expect to drive strong operating income growth this year and that
includes our expectations as we've talked about for some time that we'll drive operating income contribution by an
incremental $800 million for Enbrel. And we ended the quarter with momentum, as you saw in our results. Tony
outlined a couple of the areas where there's some uncertainty heading into the year, but fundamentally across the
products and geographies, we feel very good about the performance that we ended the year with, and therefore the
momentum that we're carrying over into first quarter. So we expect strong results, as I said, during the course of 2014
as we continue to invest in the long-term drivers of growth here which are the pipeline and international expansion and
biosimilars and the things that I talked about in my remarks. But I think we touched on the elements of Eric's
comments. Tony do, you want to add anything to comment about?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: No, I mean we continue to drive the growth brand. We're building market share. It's a bit
early in the year to be saying we know exactly where we'll land and we are competing at every stage and we look
forward to actually building this business and growing it.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yaron, I think the tax rate and shares, in terms of the bottom line, I think the tax rate and
shares were probably above where we were as well, if you look at those consensus numbers. So tax rate, clearly in 2013
was low for reasons that won't be repeated in 2014 and I think we were pretty clear during the course of the year with
each of our quarters as to what was going on there. And on the share count, again I think Michael tried to provide some
clear guidance for you on that front as well as we head into 2014.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Hey Yaron, I would just note that our guidance that we have given is actually bracketed by the
consensus expectations because the consensus is $19.5 billion, $19.5 billion for revenues and for earnings per share, it's
$8.16.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Yes hey, a question actually on AMG 334. I think that's the first time you sort of mentioned
that, at least speaking about it on the call. I'm sure you're aware that Lilly made an announcement I think just a couple
weeks ago on theirs. Maybe you could speak to whether or not we actually get data on that drug this year and how that
would be different than Lilly's drug?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: So, it's hard to be sure when we'll see the data, but it is possible the data from the first study,
which is in episodic migraine, might be available by the end of the calendar year. The difference in the drugs is
fundamental. The other agents are agents that, in monoclonal antibodies that are directed at epitopes on CGRP itself.
Our strategy is to block the receptor, which is then independent of CGRP concentration and timing of release. So in the
synapse, that can be very important. So our first principles, thinking about this, biology as well as the preclinical data
that we've generated have suggested that it's a much more effective approach, potentially to have a receptor antagonist
than a ligand sequestering antibody. So that there's a differentiated feature there.

Next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura.
<Q - Mayur I. Somaiya>: Nomura. A quick question on Kyprolis. I just was hoping to get your thoughts on the
competitive landscape, as we are expecting I guess Phase III data from at least one competitor, Bristol and AVI, their
drug alemtuzumab. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on how we should think about your data set and also the
emerging data set for that molecule. And then just into the future a little bit, HDAC6 inhibitors and how, or if there are
any plans to run combination studies with Kyprolis.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So this is Tony. Let me start some of that discussion and perhaps Sean can add. When we
look at the multiple myeloma market, it's clear that in spite of the tremendous advances over the last decade or so, they
continue to be a huge unmet medical need. Average life expectancy has moved now to only six years and we truly
believe that physicians will be looking more and more for drugs that deliver efficacy or combinations of drugs that
deliver efficacy and extend life. As a company, we continue to believe that the proteasome inhibitors will continue to
be a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy. And based on our own scientific evaluation, our clinical evaluation, and
talking to experienced KOLs around the world, we continue to believe that Kyprolis has the potential to be the best in
class in this particular category. So we look forward to advancing our Phase III data, expanding our label and giving
physicians an opportunity to use this drug in earlier lines of patients as we go forward.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Little to add. I agree, I think the issue of the combinations with things like the antibody
therapies or HDAC inhibitors will play out over time, but it's hard to imagine a situation in which the proteasome
inhibition backbone is displaced in any near term sense.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay, Marvin, let's take the next question

Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thank you very much for taking the question. Sean, you've now seen four of the five
pivotal trials or at least the near-term pivotal trials for 145 and you've disclosed more or less that the LDL reduction is
consistent with Phase II. Could you give us a sense of what you're seeing qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of
CV events? I realize there's not probably statistical significance to the studies individually or even in aggregate, but is
the trend in the right direction? Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, it's an interesting question, we as you know, many of these studies are 12-week efficacy
studies and we do have longer safety experiences over time. But it would require many more patient years of exposure
than we have currently to expect to have the numbers of events that would allow, even if we were for example cutting
risk in half, you still couldn't expect to have any measure of real power for that. So we don't have a formal analysis
looking at that yet. When all the data are put together in total for filing, of course we will analyze them at that level.
But I don't expect to see a lot of benefit when we're talking about such small numbers of events. This is of course, why
the very large long-term outcomes trials are required, as you know.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And fundamentally Geoff, as you can glean from our remarks on the call, we're excited
about the data we've seen. We're excited about the role that this medicine could play for patients that are at risk of
cardiovascular disease. So we continue to deliver on this program and that's what we intend to do.

<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thank you. Just another question on 145 if you'll bear with me. Kind of curious, one of the
earlier questions in the queue, I think Sean's answer to it, I think I heard you say, Sean, that with respect to the need for
the outcomes data and the percent of events, et cetera. I understand not wanting to give a lot of answers here, but I think
I heard you say, Sean, that essentially FDA is looking for something relative to the – with info on the trajectory of
events. Can you expand on that? What do they mean by that? Is that something new? Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: No, that's the term I'm using to try to just convey the fact that I think what occurs in many
cases, and we all know this from the data that's been published on this issue, is that it can be very difficult to anticipate
with accuracy when a sponsor is going to actually complete a post-marketing commitment such as an outcomes trial.
And I think the agency is keen to understand the time that would elapse between an initial approval, based on a
surrogate, even a robust surrogate like LDL, and when the outcomes data will become available. So that's why I was
using this term trajectory, meaning can you predict with some reasonable idea when you're going to actually see the
data, is it going to take three years, five years, ten years. That's meaningful from a regulatory perspective.

Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much and sticking to 145. Just briefly, Sean, would that, would again the
comment around the FDA, would that necessitate looking not only at FOURIER but also one of the other long-term
outcome trials as well? In other words, do both of them collectively, do they get pulled and would that then therefore
need to be disclosed?
And I'm sorry, just one very small housekeeping, and it's really related to Tony. In Q3, you commented about some of
the geographies like Brazil and Turkey being negative, claiming that there would be tenders in Q4? Was that the case
for Q4? Thanks very much.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, let's start there with your geographic question, Tony.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So listen, if you look at Q4, Tony, there was actually about a 155% increase between
quarter three and quarter four as the tenders vote back in. And these come mainly out of the Middle East and Russia. So
yes, a dramatic growth in that last quarter for the year. Sean?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, I'm not sure I completely understood the first part of the question. I think that from an
outcomes data perspective, reduction of the cardiovascular events like heart attack, stroke, sudden death, cardiovascular
death, the only meaningful study that we will have to address that question is the FOURIER outcomes trial. It's
properly designed and powered to read that sort of thing out.
Certainly there are combined analyses that are done across all of the studies that are performed in any of these
development programs to look for generally adverse effects, including if you saw events traveling the wrong direction,
that would obviously be a concern. So, those analyses are always done more from the perspective of assuring safety
than trying to look for an efficacy signal.

<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Got a couple of P&L questions. You
guys have made a significant progress on the pipeline with a lot of readouts this year. Just want to get your perspective
on what this means to pre-commercial spend on the SG&A line and R&D as well? And then, the other revenue line has
grown incrementally higher the past couple quarters. Just wanted to get a sense for the constituents and the
sustainability of that looking forward? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes, Geoff, we provided the guidance for 2014 at the top line, and EPS, we weren't
planning to get into detail of expense line item by line item. But based on my comments about operating income
growth, you can expect that we expect to see operating income leverage this year, again driven by the $800 million
contribution from Enbrel. And with respect to other income, Michael, do you want to add any insights for Geoff on
that?
<A - Michael Anthony Kelly>: I'd just say on a historical run rate basis, other revenue has been $300 million or $400
million a year. With the addition of Onyx, it'll just about double, not quite, but just about double.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Bob, you talked about the notable international expansion
you've had over the last couple of years. Can you take us through further expansion plans from a geographical
perspective, your preference of organic versus M&A to do that? And linked to that whole commercial organization
platform, for biosimilars, will you commercialize those globally through the Amgen commercial branded platform or a
separate entity? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, okay thanks, Ravi. Yes, you're right to point out that international expansion has
been an important objective for us. We see that as a source of long-term growth for Amgen. And we've talked in
particular about our desire to expand in Japan, China and selected emerging markets, and so far we've been successful
we feel in doing that through a combination of partnerships and acquisitions. Obviously in Japan, China, and Russia,
we use partnerships to help advance our interest and we've used acquisitions in Brazil, Turkey and now with the
reacquisition of NEUPOGEN and Neulasta rights in a number of other key emerging markets as well.
So I think we feel we have a strong platform now from which to profitably expand in these international markets. So,
we have a presence from which we can organically launch our molecules in nearly all of the international markets that
are of interest and we think important for the kind of medicines we're advancing. We'll look to supplement our position
with ongoing acquisitions, Ravi, but I think there aren't many and so we're right now executing against our organic
plans.
And with respect to biosimilars, again our first launches for biosimilars begin in 2017. So there's still quite some time
before we have to commit to specific answers to your question. But we think that our biosimilar portfolio will be an
attractive source of growth for Amgen, particularly internationally. So, where we look at international markets, it's
likely that it'll be through the Amgen organization. And in the more developed markets, we still have time before we
disclose exactly how we want to do that.

cardiovascular events would cause a stoppage on safety? Just trying to get a sense for how to interpret what you've said
earlier about the DMC findings. And then just related, if there are updates on the ENDEAVOR and CLARION trials
ongoing? Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, so I don't have on the top of my head on the last ASPIRE DSMB review. These typically
will occur in these kind of trials on kind of a quarterly basis often. But I don't know off the top of my head when the
most recent one was. And there are no specific stopping rules in these regarding cardiovascular events. They're a
overall assessment that the risk/benefit of the product continues to look appropriate to a very seasoned DSMB who
understand the [indiscernible] (45:50) and so on. There really aren't any updates to give on ENDEAVOR and
CLARION. They're in open enrollment phases and there's not too much to say about those right now.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks. Let's go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun K. Yang>: Thank you. Question on AMG 145. So, Phase II trials were conducted in various patient
populations, and according to clinicaltrials.gov, outcomes data is not coming out until 2018. So without outcomes data,
are those patient population approval indications? And if not, what would be the reasonable indication that you could
go after with that prior to outcomes data?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: So the first thing I'd point out is that the kind of date that gets put on dot-gov is a very crude
sort of an estimate of when one would expect an event-driven trial to complete and it's often done by kind of just a
straight line kind of living room modeling, which is rarely actually accurate in terms of what happens. The best you can
do when you start out from the very beginning estimating that. So I wouldn't pin too much on that exact date, when it's
that far out into the future. It may take longer, it may take less, considerably less time.
The issue of the approvability of the various subgroups, we do study populations in our clinical trials sometimes for
purposes of being able for example to understand in a very clean background way, very, on a really clean background,
safety for example. And not all of the populations that we've studied – I think we've studied a very broad range of
populations – may end up as specific language and indications for a product like this. In fact, if you look at the statin
class, you won't find that.
You won't find that and I think the way I always think about this is that this product is going to be appropriate for
individuals who have high cardiovascular risk, despite having availed themselves of all available existing therapies,
particularly statins, and still have a substantial modifiable risk factor in the form of LDL that's not let's say below 70,
where it generally, you feel that you had it under pretty good control. I think that's the population that we're seeking to
serve. And but it is, you won't usually find very specific indication statements for each individual population in the
labels of these sort of products.

Next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Partners.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thank you very much. AMG 785 or romosozumab, I think the Phase III that was published in
Internal Medicine has a retreatment component. When do we see data from the retreatment? But when would there be
retreatment data? And also, I think you're testing a couple of different formulations. Can you give us some color on
that?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: So, we often do in Phase II a wide range of things with the therapeutics, where we can begin to
get some understanding of issues like withdrawal, retreatment and so on. And so, we do have some features like that in
the long-term extensions of these Phase II studies. They don't necessarily predict claims that we would be seeking by

do ornate studies that require fracture endpoints beyond just what we're already doing with two large fracture studies
that we're performing with the product. The product has got no particularly unusual formulation issues associated with
it. It's an injectable monoclonal antibody and we're doing the usual things with that, with respect to both formulation
and device formats.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks a lot. I have a follow-on question to the biosimilar topic regarding the 2017 launch. I'm
wondering if you could share with us some of your assumptions behind that timeframe to get there? For example,
which of the three biosimilars are you contemplating or all three of them? And is there the potential to accelerate that
timeframe and is it contingent at all upon FDA guidance to industry? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, so maybe we'll take a couple different cuts at this. Just again to remind you, we have
six programs underway, three of which are in pivotal trials. Our plan is to try to be first, or certainly among the first few
for these, as their, as patents expire around the globe, we seek to be ready to launch a biosimilar product. So that's true
in 2017, and I don't think we're going to get into specific details at this stage about which products we're launching and
which jurisdictions when, but generally our strategy is to seek to be first and among the first few for these molecules.
And so far, the progress in advancing them through pivotal trials is proceeding in line with our expectation and the
remaining three we expect to move forward during the course of the year as well. Sean, do you want to talk about
guidelines from FDA on an advance commitment?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: I think that it's fair to point out that this is uncharted territory and new area and there may be
issues that we don't anticipate. However at this point, we wouldn't engage in enrolling pivotal trials for registration of
these products if we didn't have a pretty good sense that there's a roadmap. And so, obviously there's the usual
dynamics, which always takes longer than we can all imagine to do these things, like enroll trials and get the data and
file and get it reviewed and get the product to market. But in some ways, a lot of that is based on fairly standard
approaches to looking at those kind of them.

Our next question, our last question, comes from the line of Gene Mack with Brean Capital.
<Q - Gene C. Mack>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate getting me in there. I wonder if there's any
update you can give for us on oprozomib, where the compound stands at this point and what next steps might be in
2014 in terms of development. Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: So, oprozomib is, as you know, the oral proteasome inhibitor which is in development at
Onyx. And it is sort of at a Phase IIa kind of a stage of development, where it's still in relatively small numbers of
patients. And we are understanding the various things you do at that stage in terms of how well tolerated as a
monotherapy, formulations that we play around with, combinations with some of the things that we know that it would
have to be combined with. So a lot of work that is, aside from the fact that it's an oral versus an intravenous agent, it's
relatively straightforward from the perspective of comparing it to the work that was done by Onyx with Kyprolis.
