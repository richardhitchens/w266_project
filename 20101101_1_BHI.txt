MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome
everyone to the Baker Hughes Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will
now turn the conference over to Mr. Gary Flaharty, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Gary R. Flaharty, Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Baker Hughes Third Quarter 2010
Earnings Conference Call. Here with me this morning are Chad Deaton, Baker Hughes' Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman; Martin Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Peter Ragauss, Baker Hughes' Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Following management's comments this morning we'll open the lines for your
questions.
A reconciliation of operating profits and non-GAAP measures to GAAP results for historic periods can be found on our
Web site at www.bakerhughes.com in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. In addition this
morning we're also including a slide presentation with our webcast. The slides are available on the Investor Relations
homepage at bakerhughes.com.
Finally I caution you that any company outlooks discussed this morning are subject to various risk factors. We'll try to
highlight the risk factors as we make these forward-looking statements. However the format of the call prevents a more
thorough discussion of these risk factors. For a complete and full discussion of these risk factors please refer to our
annual report 10-K, 10-Q and in particular the forward-looking disclosure in this morning's news release. With that I'll
conclude our discussion of the administrative details and turn the call over to Peter Ragauss. Peter?

Peter A. Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Gary. Good morning. This morning we reported net income on a GAAP basis of $255 million or $0.59 per
share. Earnings per share were up $0.41 compared to a year ago and up $0.36 from last quarter. Revenue was $4.1
billion, up 83% or almost 1.9 billion compared to a year ago and up 21% or $700 million sequentially. And EBITDA
per share was $1.64, which was up $0.71 or 76% compared to a year ago and up $0.26 or 19% from last quarter.
And there are a couple of adjustments that should be made to compare our results to our previous guidance. First our
tax rate before acquisition-related costs was 32.5%. Let me just point something out, that we had $12 million in tax
benefits from acquisition-related costs in addition to a $12 million pre-tax charge, so the net result was about 0 on the
acquisition cost on a per-share basis.
The overall decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the actions we took in the third quarter to repatriate certain
foreign earnings, ultimately resulting in a reduction of current and future U.S. taxes. The regular tax rate in the middle
of our 37 to 38% guidance -- he favorable impact of the lower actual tax rate was approximately $0.04 per share.
Second, we've revised our estimate for the amortization associated with the BJ Services acquisition. This calculation
will not be final until the end of the year, however our best estimate is that the incremental amortization charge will
now be $120 million per year, approximately $30 million per quarter. As a result the amortization expense associated
with the step-up was $9 million lower than our guidance for the third quarter, approximately $0.01 per share. So from
the GAAP EPS of $0.59, subtract $0.04 for the impact of the lower tax rate, subtract $0.01 for the impact of lower
quarterly amortization charges. That brings you to $0.54.
So helping your understanding of the moving pieces, I'll bridge Q3 '09 EPS to Q3 '10 EPS. GAAP EPS for Q2 '09 was
$0.18 per share. Add $0.03 for lower corporate costs, subtract $0.02 for higher net interest costs, subtract $0.05 for the
impact of the higher share count, offset partially by the effect of the lower effective tax rate, subtract $0.03 for the
impact of the incremental amortization costs, and last to get to EPS this quarter at $0.48 from operations including the
acquisition of BJ Services to arrive at $0.59 per share.
Bridging the sequential quarters, GAAP EPS for Q2 2010 was $0.23 per share. Add back second quarter
acquisition-related costs of $56 million before tax, $51 million after tax, or $0.13 per share. The impact of the lower tax
rate offset partially by the higher average share count added about $0.04 per share. Subtract $0.01 per share for higher
net interest expense. Last, to get to EPS this quarter, add about $0.20 per share from operations, including the impact of
having BJ Services on board for the entire quarter, to arrive at a $0.59 per share.
In table 3 of our earnings release, we provide financial information on a pro-forma combined basis with revenue and
profit before tax of BJ Services included into the prior period's results to allow meaningful comparisons between
quarters. Because of the reduction in amortization, this morning we also provided a revision for the pro forma
supplemental information for Q1 2008 through Q3 2010 by quarter. This schedule's available on our Web site.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer
explicitly to table 3.
Revenue in North America was $2 billion, up 71% compared to a year ago and up 16% sequentially. North America
operating profits were $340 million, up $356 million year-over-year and up 52% sequentially. International revenue
was 1.8 billion, up 6% compared to a year ago and up 1% compared to the previous quarter. International operating
profit margin was 5%, compared to 11% a year ago and 7% last quarter. Our Industrial and Other segment revenue was
278 million, up 10% compared to last year and up 13% compared to last quarter. Operating profit was $36 million, up
to 29% compared to a year ago and up 80% sequentially.
Turning to the balance sheet, quarter-end our total debt was $3.8 billion. During the quarter we sold $1.5 billion of
5.125% senior notes, due 2040. We used a portion of the net proceeds to pay back approximately $500 million of our
outstanding commercial paper, and we intend to repay $250 million of BJ Services's outstanding 5.75% bonds in June
2011. The company will use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

Our capital expenditures in the third quarter were $466 million, which is in line with our earlier guidance for 2010
annual capital expenditures. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash and short-term investments. We also
had $1.7 billion available under our committed credit facilities. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. Our net debt was $2
billion and our net debt-to-capital ratio was 11%.
Last I want to share a few thoughts and guidance for Q4. Net interest expense in Q4 should be about $52 million, which
includes a full quarter of the $1.5 billion in notes. Corporate spending should be within a 50 to $55 million range.
Taxes should be between 36 and 37%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be between 305 and $350 million.
We expect capital expenditures in Q4 to be between 550 and $600 million, which will put total 2010 CapEx around
$1.7 billion. We do not expect a major pickup in activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the fourth quarter and stand by our
earlier estimate of $0.08 to $0.11 per share impact below normal operating conditions.
I'll now turn the call over to Martin who will highlight our geographic results. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Peter. Let me start with North America. Revenue increased 71% year over year and 16% sequentially,
matching the 71% and 19% increases in the North American rig count, a solid achievement given the negative impact
of the Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling moratorium on activity, revenue and profit.
The overall service and technology intensity of North American land drilling continues to increase. In the United
States, horizontal drilling, primarily in the unconventional oil and gas plays, has more than doubled year over year and
increased 13% sequential. The unconventional reservoirs are demanding our best technology to deliver longer
horizontals, complex completions, increasing frac horsepower and more frac stages. This demand for advanced
technology is in turn driving the business and supporting both higher revenue per rig and associated higher prices.
Operating margins increased 1,800 basis points year over year and 400 basis points sequentially to 17%. Incremental
margins were in excess of 40% both year-over-year and sequentially despite the lower activity in the Gulf this quarter.
Before I turn to our international segments, I need to address the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The impact of
the moratorium and the pause in drilling permit approval was about as we guided in our last conference call at $0.09.
While we are encouraged that the deepwater moratorium was lifted a few weeks ago, we do not expect a significant
increase in drilling in the fourth quarter.
In the longer term, Baker Hughes is very well positioned for the return of activity in the Gulf. With our 2 new
pressure-pumping vessels, the Blue Dolphin and the Blue Tarpon, we were able to offer best-in-class pressure-pumping
capabilities, exceeding the delivery capability of the nearest competitor by over 50%. Our current tank control vessel
utilization has been high, supporting frac, gravel pack and stimulation activities on the shelf and in fact, our backlog is
at an all-time record high.
Turning to Latin America, revenue increased 8% year over year, led by the Andean and Brazil geomarkets. Revenue
increased 2% sequentially, led by the Brazil geomarket. Both year over year and sequential growth rates exceeded
market growth rates this quarter. The only geomarket to report revenue declines year over year or sequentially was the
Venezuela/Mexico geomarket.
Profit margins were flat sequentially. Latin America continues to be a series of contrasting stories. Performance is
strong in Brazil and in the Andean geomarkets driven by national oil companies who are striving to increase their
production. The southern cone and Venezuela/Mexico geomarkets continue to be the most challenging.
We're continuing to react to our customer's budget cuts in Mexico by redeploying equipment to more attractive markets
and where required reducing our staffing levels. We finished drilling operations on the final Alma Marine well and
expect to run the completion assembly in the next few weeks.
In Brazil we continue to build on our strong relationship with Petrobras and are expanding our business with other
foreign and Brazilian operators. Technology continues to be key to performance in Brazil both offshore and

increasingly on land.
In the third quarter we successfully deployed a 12.25 inch Chimera drill bit for the first time in a Northeast Brazil land
application. This hybrid bit combines the most attractive features of both roller cone and fixed cutter bits in a single
product. We've made over 90 runs and have drilled a total of more than 100,000 feet worldwide with this bit. The
Chimera bit has been run in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, Oman, Saudi Arabia and now on land in Brazil. In this
particular application, the bit was able to drill 20% further and 90% faster than standard Tricone bits.
The Andean geomarket continues to be one of our best performing geomarkets on any continent. All of our product
lines are well represented. In the quarter we won a $137 million 8-year contract extension from Repsol for the
exclusive supply and maintenance of the ESP systems and were awarded a 2-year contract by an independent for a full
service well construction solution that includes drilling and evaluation systems, fluids and for many pumping services.
Turning to the Eastern Hemisphere, first in the Europe, Africa, Russia Caspian segment. Revenue increased 6%
compared to a year ago led by directional drilling and artificial lift. Growth was led by the Russia Caspian and UK
geomarkets offset partially by lower revenue from Africa. Sequentially revenues were down 1% as revenue declines in
Africa and Norway offset increases in other geomarkets. Improvement in profits in the UK and continental Europe
geomarkets were offset by lower profit in Norway, Russia Caspian and in Africa.
The weakness in the Norway market was temporary, driven by a more extensive than anticipated summer rig
maintenance program. Activity has returned to normal levels in October and should remain relatively solid through the
winter. UK and continental Europe activity has been strong and is expected to stay strong this winter.
In Norway we secured a multi-million dollar integrated project for the Borgland Dolphin Consortium to provide service
integration and planning including directional drilling, measurement well drilling, logging well drilling, mud logging,
fluids, waterline logging, and quarrying services. The contract covers an initial 3-year period for a full exploration
program on the Norwegian continental shelf encompassing 15 wells.
Activity in Africa remains weak. North Africa's soft as activity has not improved in either Libya nor Algeria. In the
North Africa geomarket we've been awarded a tender for directional drilling, logging well drilling, quarrying liner
hanger spits, and cementing by Occidental to build 22 on-shore exploration wells on 6 separate concessions in Libya.
The 2-year program starts in the first quarter of 2011. In the Sub-Saharan African geomarket, our local joint venture
there won a 10-year off-shore production chemicals contract with a super-major in Angola.
Now turning to the Middle East, Asia-Pacific segment, revenue was up 6% compared to a year ago led by sales of
chemicals, artificial lift, and completion systems in Southeast Asia and Egypt geomarkets. Sequential growth was 5%
led by increased sales of directional drilling and oil fill chemicals. Revenues were up significantly in the Southeast Asia
geomarket. With relatively modest growth in the market, the preponderance of long-term contracts and ample
equipment, pricing has not improved yet. Improvements in profitability in the near future will be dependent on market
growth and share gains that help us absorb fixed overhead, and the success of our ability to improve operational
efficiency.
In Saudi Arabia, the customer is focused on increasing gas production from tight reservoirs. We're introducing
technology developed for the North American tight gas plays into the kingdom. We recently installed frac point
multi-zone completion equipment in 5 wells with tight gas reservoirs. This solution allows the client to selectively
stimulate individual sections in long horizontal wells to optimize the production and recovery rate. We also are
providing technical expertise on formation evaluation and geomechanics. And in Iraq, the South Oil Company has run
its first waterline job using Baker Hughes's equipment under the 3-year technical services agreement signed last
quarter.
In the Southeast Asia geomarket, we secured a major contract in the Philippines. We will be providing cementing,
directional drilling, and drilling fluid services on 5 rigs as part of a 2-year contract with a 50-well work scope. Our
robust product and services offering for the HPHT industry in conjunction with the established presence of BJ Services
in the Philippines were critical factors in the award.

In the Indonesia geomarket, we completed a 2 multi-zone, single-trip completion system or MST gravel pack in a
single well, isolating 2 differentially pressured zones. This completion builds on the success of BJ's MST, which has
had over 35 successful runs to date with documented savings of 70% of rig time from approximately 20 days to 3.5
days.
Looking at our international operations in total, I'm pleased with our revenue performance. Revenue grew 6% year over
year and 1% sequentially exceeding that of the market. This is a positive sign that our new geographic organization is
making a difference and we're pleased with our geomarket management teams as they are demonstrating a more
holistic view of the market and developing closer relationships with our customers, communicating clear market driven
priorities to our products and technology organization. They're executing in delivering quality products and services to
our customers and they've maintained high levels of HSE performance.
International margins did not improve sequentially as we indicated in our last conference call. While I remain
disappointed, we've not been idle this quarter. Let me briefly review the actions we've taken. We believe that our
organizational change resulted in some redundancies and inefficiencies in our overhead. We aggressively addressed
this issue in the third quarter and we incurred about $15 million in severance costs.
The benefits of our cost cutting should become visible next quarter and have full impact in 2011. We indicated that we
could make our organization more efficient and reduce additional overhead costs in the longer term. We began that
process this quarter and eliminated 4 geomarkets and the redundant management. By combining Venezuela and
Mexico, Sub-Sahara Africa along with Angola, North Africa coupled to Libya and combining Russia and Caspian
geomarkets.
Third, we revalidated our supply chain cost savings. The goal is $300 million over 3 years and feel we're on track.
We're committed to cost synergies with BJ Services of 75 million in year 1 and an additional 75 million in year 2.
These savings are in progress and will occur as projected. Revenue synergies will also contribute to improving our
profitability.
Finally and most importantly, we've put this organization together to gain share and promote long term profitable
growth. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, revenues have either tracked or exceeded the market. My focus
now is to deliver acceptable margins.
Before I turn this over to Chad, let me cover our Industrial segment. This segment is composed of principally of our
industrial chemicals, process and pipeline technology businesses. Revenue increased 10% year on year and was up 13%
sequentially in the seasonally strong third quarter. The segment posted a 13% profit margin in the quarter compared to
an 11% margin a year ago and 8% last quarter.
This quarter Baker Hughes formed an alliance with a global cargo inspection and certification company to provide
cargo treatment additive services to the petroleum industries. The alliance offers a fast and effective spectrum of
services for fuel and bulk cargos that meet trade specifications using our partners' testing and inspection infrastructure
and Baker Hughes' P-to-R or prepared to respond fuel additives. With that I'll turn the call back over to Chad.
Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
All right. Thank you, Martin. As Martin and Peter both highlighted, our results this quarter were dominated by our
performance in North America. With oil prices holding in the 75 to $80 range, we experienced strong growth in
oil-directed drilling in both unconventional and conventional areas, and we do expect that this trend is going to
continue into 2011.
Drilling for natural gas has stabilized with a high percentage of the rigs drilling in the unconventional plays, and
increasingly on the wetter side of these plays. Together the demand for drilling in unconventional reservoirs, whether
it's for oil or for natural gas, is driving strong demand for directional drilling, complex completions and pressure
pumping. Currently we believe the increase in drilling for either oil or wet gas will offset any drilling weakness in dry
gas.

It is important to note that pressure pumping is a key technology for developing both types of these reservoirs, and
while we have owned BJ Services since April, we've really had full access to BJ in only the last month of the third
quarter. With the restrictions of the whole separate order now removed, we can finally act on the opportunities we have
to leverage our newly acquired pressured pumping capabilities in North America.
Since the order was lifted, the U.S. sales teams have been working together to pull through products and services when
possible. Now, in some cases people and equipment are already committed, but as they roll off of a contract, we can
then leverage our pressure-pumping resources.
A good example of what our combined company is now able to deliver to our customers is a case in Canada for a large
independent. Our AutoTrack rotary steerable system and drill bits were used to drill a horizontal well in the Horn River
unconventional gas play. The well was completed with a 10-stage frac point, open-hole fracturing system with a Baker
Hughes integrated Insight fiber optic monitoring system. BJ supplied all the cementing and all the hydraulic pressuring
services. And in West Texas, the strength of the BJ Service relationship with an independent resulted in them being
able to pull through our wireline and perforating services on up to 2 frac jobs per week for a Permian Basin customer.
Another recent award was on the West Coast when a Baker Hughes and a BJ Services team bid together and were
awarded a 30-well perforating and pressure-pumping contract by a super major. And a final example in the Northeast,
BJ leveraged their relationship with an independent to pull through other Baker Hughes products and services. The pull
through value will total nearly 10 million a year in new incremental revenue.
Now all this being said, the frac market is tight. Backlogs for pressure pumping remain strong and vary between
regions from anywhere from 90 to 180 days. We are investing in incremental frac capacity to service both the growing
intensity and the growing volume of the North American frac market.
Part of our long-term strategic plan called for filling some gaps that we had in our portfolio in order to make us more
competitive. Of course one of those gaps was pressure pumping, which I just addressed. The other was to build out our
reservoir capability. Over the last couple of years, we've acquired several reservoir engineering companies beginning
with Gaffney, Cline, GMI, and most recently Meyer & Associates. This has resulted in our achieving the critical mass
needed to be recognized by our customers as a serious player in reservoir consultancy.
Beginning in Q4 and continuing on into 2011, we're going to work to improve our customers' economics by using the
full spectrum of our products and services from geological and geomechanical analysis, to drilling, perforating,
hydraulic fracturing, and completing conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells. We can now engage with our
customers from exploration and appraisal through development, production, and ultimately rejuvenation of mature
fields. These recent acquisitions result in our being well positioned not only in North America, but other markets
worldwide.
Looking outside North America to the rest of the world, the international market continues to grow albeit slowly, and
with $75 plus oil price and an expanding global economy, it should continue to grow in 2011 and in time, support
higher pricing. For now, real pricing improvement is elusive, and while the rig count is above its previous highs in
Asia-Pacific and Africa, it lags in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. In fact if you look at the change in the
rig count for the individual countries since September 2008, you'll find that land rigs in India, Syria and Kuwait have
increased by more than 40, and unfortunately these rigs simply aren't driving the same premium as the rigs in Australia,
Oman, or Saudi Arabia that they replaced.
In closing, our new organization today is going through a period of adaptation. On the positive side, we are much closer
to our client, and as we've mentioned before our customers, they like this new organization and that's not a bad thing
when you're a service company. As a result, we are winning work. Revenue growth versus our peers, as Martin
mentioned, has remained strong over the last several quarters. On the other hand we have to work – we have some
work to do on the international margin front. Martin outlined our plans for improving our margin performance
internationally.

This is the number one priority for the entire management team at Baker Hughes. We need to fine-tune the operation,
consolidate areas of redundancy, realize the benefits for the new supply chain organization, determine the optimum
geomarket structure, and continue to grow the top line. These steps are all being addressed, and it will result in
improved margins beginning this quarter, Q4, and carrying into 2011.
Okay, Gary, why don't we open it up for some questions.
Gary R. Flaharty, Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, Chad. At this point I'll ask Dennis to open the line for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and a related follow up question. So
Dennis, could we have the first question please.
Q&A
Operator
Yes, sir. The first question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Chad, talking about international margins here for a second and recognizing that you're probably
not through your planning process for next year, but just sort of a conceptual journey, if you will. We're kind of
hovering right now at about 5% margin, thereabouts, for international, and we were at close to 18% and change first
half of last year. So recognizing the benefits from supply chain, BJ synergies and expected volume gains, what do you
think is a reasonable aspiration at this stage for exit rate margins sometime next year?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think you should – I think we're looking for
somewhere in the mid-15% range, somewhere in that ballpark, Bill.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Okay. Got it.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think you could break this down by region.
Europe has not changed much really if you looked at the margins down a little bit. Africa has been where our challenge
has been.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And that's being, you know that's offsetting
everything in Europe to affect all of IRC. And then the other area clearly is Latin America, is where we've got another
focus. Martin mentioned about some consolidation we're doing in that area to bring some of the costs down in that area.
We're happy with the way we see the Far East going. We've seen some nice gains there, both on the revenue side and
some improvement on the bottom line side there. And the Middle East we think will come back next year. So that's our
target right now.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Okay. And then in a similar vein with regard to North America, margins are sort of clicking along
nicely as they are for most in the industry. So walk us through if you will kind of on a go-forward basis the interplay
between probably a slowing rate of E&P capital spending growth, oil and liquids rich continues to grow, offset by gas,
so which probably distills into a reasonably steady rig count from this point forward, maybe up a bit. You've got
increased capacity coming. So when you think about '11 margins, would -- on average would we do well to kind of stay
even with exit rate 2010 or do you think it's going to be a bit better than that?

<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it would be a bit better than that, Bill,
because we started obviously pressure pumping; saw a lot of price improvement over these last several months,
whereas our legacy Baker Hughes businesses started to really see it towards the end of the third quarter, I guess. We
started to see some tightness enough that we could start raising some prices elsewhere. So we'll see a little benefit of
that in Q4 and therefore for a year-on-year type basis we should see improved margins on the North America and
course hopefully we're looking at what's going on in the Gulf of Mexico.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Right.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And we can see some rational thinking back there
again and get back to doing some drilling and other things, then that will be a huge swing for us because we're big in
the Gulf and we've wanted to hold ourselves strong there with our people because we believe this thing will end, and
when it does we want to be ready for it.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: From a sort of incremental capacity standpoint with all of the frac horsepower that's coming, do
you expect that to be sort of a headwind in the second half of next year or earlier?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think it will be the second half. There's no
doubt it's probably coming.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And we've been very -- fairly aggressive in terms of
building out horsepower because there for a period of time BJ hadn't done a lot during the negotiations and the whole
separate period, etcetera. But beginning earlier this year we did start building horsepower. Glad we did because we've
been needing it. But we're going through the budgeting process now. We'll be taking a looking at it. We will adjust
based on what we see, but there are a lot of wells behind pipe that still need frac, 2,000 to 2,500.
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And you start looking at anywhere from 15, what --
pick a number -- 15, 25 zones per well. That's a lot of frac jobs and a lot of consumption of equipment. So...
<Q - Bill Herbert>: Indeed. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: You bet.

For our next question, comes from the line of Joe Hill with the Tudor, Pickering.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Good morning.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Chad, I think Martin touched on some of the improvements you guys have seen in the Industrial
business. Can you give us a bit of an outlook there? You've kind of given us what to look for in international, but
maybe you can talk a little bit more about what's going on in that particular business and what's driving the sizeable
improvements we saw.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think one thing that Martin said, and it's
true: Q3 is usually a very strong quarter for us in that business. So I don't think we're going to see any huge dropoff. A
lot of that business does tie back to refinery work. So it depends on the margin with our refining operators, what they
do and when their downtime is.
I think one important thing on the Industrial side -- there was not – we didn't shake that particular area up much when
we reorganized like what we did on the international side with the new geomarkets, et cetera. So that pretty much was a

management team that has continued to run through this entire last 12 to 18 months period. So I think they're showing a
lot of stability and they had a very good quarter, and that's a business that kind of tends to swing based on downtimes in
refineries and et cetera.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay. So in terms of our expectation for next year, should we assume that we can hold on to some of
this margin improvement we've seen, or should we assume that the turnaround restoring the refining is going to be
fairly seasonal?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think you could say that you could hold on to it.
Traditionally, this business has been fairly stable, flat. We've talked about it in the past on our chemicals side, both
upstream as well as downstream. When there's tremendous swings in rig count one way or the other, this is kind of our
annuity. They were pretty steady. So I think you could plan on that through next year.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, yes. This is Peter. I would say
that's right for next year. We did have a particularly strong Q3, which was some seasonality and then Q4 could be off a
bit from Q3 because the other part of the business is a pipeline inspection business and that has to slow down usually in
Q4, which is the business we inherited from BJ. So we wouldn't expect Q4 to be a repeat of Q3, but next year it ought
to be within a seasonality range, ought to be a decent business.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay. Thank you. And then finally just more of a product-specific question. You guys have talked
about the MST completion tool and there's a few of those systems out there. I was just wondering, one, how many of
these systems are available for use at any given time? And would you anticipate that usage of the tool could get large
enough to actually impact availability of rig time?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're not going to disclose how many we
have ready to go around the world, Joe. I think the one thing about, I think, unless I am wrong -- Martin you can
comment on this -- but I think we by far have the most in the ground running than anybody. So it's pretty well proven,
and I don't know, Martin you have any comments on it?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, as Chad mentions, from our data, it
seems to be a high leverage to how many we've run relative to the market, Joe. The features on this tool are pretty
unique to Baker Hughes. It's completely unlimited lengths of either the zone you want to cover or the number of zones
you can run. It's got a full ID opening to handle production tubing. There's some very important proprietary-type
technology on the seal elements used. So the pickup on this has been pretty rapid. As far as its materiality going
forward, I don't know at this stage but we don't see it slowing down, that's for sure.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Okay. And Martin, would you like to see one of these on every rig you guys touch?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Given the pricing on them, absolutely. It would
help the margins right away.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that's the key. We got to value this right. If
we're going from 20 days to 3.5, we need to share in the value split there.
<Q - Joe Hill>: Sure. Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.

<A - Peter A. Ragauss, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Morning, Jim.
<Q - James Crandell>: Chad, would you expect to, in North America with your pressure pumping business, would
you expect to adopt a broad-based strategy of trying to package your pressure pumping together with your
drilling-related product lines?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I think it depends on the customer, Jim. As
you know, customers come in all shapes and sizes. Some are ready to bundle the entire package for very long-term
contracts. We talked last quarter about Hess up in the Bakken with a five-year contract where we're doing 80% of the
drilling bits, et cetera, and I think we have about a third of the pressure pumping. So there are customers there that are
looking for that, and then we have others that continue to want to do a call-out-type basis.
We are tying more and more when we can with tied to the pressure pumping because it's in such demand right now. But
as I said in the comments, some of this equipment has to come off a particular contract or working with a customer
before we can then put it together with other services and get it out and promote it. But as long as this market's the way
it is right now, yes, we will be looking to package more into a bundle.
<Q - James Crandell>: And do you think the whole nature of the North American business is changing in this respect
to where in the future particularly with the popularity of horizontal drilling in the shales that more and more of the
business will be packaged? And people that have a broad product line, such as yourselves, will have a key advantage in
servicing the market?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I hope so, that's why we've been buying all these
companies from the reservoir side to the pressure pumping. But yes, I think it will. I think we're applying more
technology to the U.S. today than we have in the past, and as a result of that, something just like we were talking about
the MST tool and other things, this is becoming more of a full-scope relationship especially with the independents and
the smaller groups looking at the reservoir, looking at the mechanics, rock mechanics, geomechanics, optimizing the
drilling performance, coming up with a best completion technology. I think it's becoming more and more of a technical
package.
<Q - James Crandell>: Okay, and just a follow up to that, Chad, in the U.S. pressure pumping market, would you be
willing to lock in today's prices for term contracts of a year or more for some of your equipment?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It depends on, again, pricing's all over the map,
Jim, but we would take some long term contracts. In fact there are take-or-pay contracts out there right now that we're
participating in. Some of those as I know are a couple of our competitors are. But I think we just, you'd have to look at
each one individually and see what else is on the contract, what's pulled through, et cetera.
<Q - James Crandell>: And your frac fleets that are coming on in North America in 2011, are those contracted
currently?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. No, they're not contracted, but they are – we're
committed. Let's just say we've got a backlog of 180 days, so. But they're not contracted at a set price. Some of those
we're holding almost for the spec market, you could call it.

<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to make sure that I heard some of the earlier commentary

<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. That's as a whole.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then in terms of the Latin American margin sitting at 2, 3% for the last few quarters,
where do you think Latin America can get to as you get into 2011 on an average basis or in any given quarter?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Kurt, this is Martin. Our expectations are a
double-digit exit next year in Latin America.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay and that's based on business you currently have in hand or bidding plus the synergies that
you referenced?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: All of that, plus stabilization in some of the
weak markets in term of the spending and the pricing and the overhead cost structures.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then you talked about pricing improvement across a number of different legacy
product lines for Baker Hughes starting to flow through in late third quarter. In terms of highest magnitude to least
magnitude, can you give us some general idea of what product lines we're seeing the best pricing from a legacy
standpoint and then what, those that are seeing least?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yes. Kurt, this is Martin again. Again, we're
speaking in North America, because we haven't seen pricing traction internationally. But certainly it's the typical ones
we're seeing the drilling systems, the lead of course is pressure pumping, followed by the drilling systems. We do have
some price improvement occurring on the production side of the business, which would be lead by ESPs, and then your
product lines which, let's just say have even more capacity out there or slightly lower barriers to entry, which would be
your case pull wireline and your drilling fluids. I'd say it's minimal.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: And then just on Chad's comment about a headwind potentially in the second half of next year
from the pressure pumping capacity, what magnitude of pressure pumping capacity do you think is coming into the
market from an industry standpoint? And then when you talk about headwinds, are you talking about pricing pressures
or pricing plateauing? How do you plan in how you're thinking about that at this point in time?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well we see a somewhere, depending on who you
talk to 6 to 6.5 million horsepower out there today going to 8 to 8.5 million by end of next year. Those are street
numbers but it's not taking into consideration attrition. And right now, we're burning through, the industry's burning
through probably 15% a year. So there's over 1 million net horsepower being added here in the next few quarters.
Now, again right now, there's a big backlog. I don't know how strong it will be faced in the second half. We're just
going to watch it going into the first half and that'll determine if we're going to continue to add equipment through next
year. I think there's just a lot of variables out there right now. We're watching it and I think probably if it slows down a
little bit, you'll see some consolidation in the business like we've seen in the past.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: That's great, thanks.

<Q - Scott Gruber>: Yes. Good morning gentlemen.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi Scott.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: It's clear that you've been more cautious on bidding for the IPM projects in Iraq given aggressive
pricing by peers. Yet at the same time one of your pillars of your geomarket reorganization is capture greater
international market share. So just hoping to gain some color on the markets or the regions if you don't want to get too
specific, where you do aim to capture market share over the next 12, 24 months and the strategy to do so given the
imperative to improve margins as well?

<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: Hey, Scott. This is Martin. Let me start with
the one you bring up, Iraq. If we thought that the market was kind of better defined in terms of what the scope was
going to be, what the risk profile was going to be. But I think as you've heard from a couple of our peers, the bidding
activity there is very high. And there's a lot of work to be done and this is both from the national oil company as well as
the foreign participants.
So we've been on side – well let me put it this way, we've participated in every IPM bid, to use that term. We've
obviously submitted prices, but we've been on the sidelines in terms of getting on the field when the pricing
environment is so unattractive. Again, given the fact that if you see what happened in Mexico, if you see what's
happened in some of these other high profile IPM bids, the opportunity to make a profit is very limited. So I think the
industry, our side of the industry needs to rethink the way it approaches it.
That aside, you're right, the reason that we reorganized into the geomarket organization was to grow the top line at
faster rates than what we were experiencing before, and as I said in my comments that's happening. But the best way to
further grow those margins is to continue to grow that top line. We're taking the actions that we can most near-term
control in terms of the costs, getting those down and particularly in the overhead functions where we experienced some
redundancy.
Now in terms of trying to get other business, it's as I said in the comments, there's an incredible response by the
customer community, which I think is being rewarded with already the work we're getting. We see the BJ organization
stimulating even further working together, and I can tell you that whether it's Vietnam, whether it's Australia, whether
it's the big award we just got in the Philippines, whether it's bringing BJ more solidly into our business in Norway,
we're seeing a lot of nice projects come our way.
But the final point I'll make here, Scott, is that unlike North America, which is a transactional market, we reorganized
18 months ago officially. We had all of our people in place probably about a year ago, and the international market is
not transactional. There's contracts there that are years in the making, and by that I mean it takes months for the tender
to come out, it takes months for the tender to be awarded, it takes months sometimes to mobilize, and it can take
months for the customer to actually start spending. So you put that on top of contracts that already run 3 to 5 years, it's
not surprising that it takes a while to rebuild the revenue. So, but in terms of the mechanics, the way we're executing
out there, I'm very happy with the job the guys are doing in terms of building their share.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: Now would Russia be in the top 3 or 4 countries or regions just given its size in terms of markets
you identify where you have upside opportunity that you target?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: In Russia, absolutely. Primarily in the drilling
systems sides, and on the pressure pumping we're pretty much not represented yet. But we're looking for some
opportunities there in terms of how best to address and are the world's second largest pressure pumping market.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: Now do you think you need rigs or a rig partner to more effectively compete on the drilling
technology side in Russia?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: It's always been part of our strategy there in
terms of our assessment that yes, that's a big component. But you know Scott, the rig need kind of comes and goes and
depending on what's going on in the marketplace, sometimes you're short rigs, and sometimes you can find around any
corner. So we look at that, and if we think that it's the right way to go, then there's some opportunities out there for us
to buckle up for somebody.
<Q - Scott Gruber>: Great. Those are all my questions. I'll turn it back. Thank you.

<Q - J. David Anderson>: Good morning. If I'm not mistaken compared to your peers you have a much larger portion
of the international business comes from the offshore markets. Just wondering if you've yet to see any of the impact in
offshore services from Macondo? In other words are you spending more times on the rigs already with new procedures
and safety steps or something like that or is it really going to take a little bit longer to work into the system?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. I don't think that Macondo outside of the Gulf
of Mexico has had a huge effect on the offshore deepwater market. Now several clients, several governments for
probably a period of a month or 2 did take a look and assess their performance, safety performance, that type of thing,
David. But it hasn't really set us back anywhere. We are seeing a lot more requests for, from clients asking about our
training programs, our certification of employees, a little bit more regarding on some of the technology or whatever we
may be running. But I think for the most part Brazil, Norway, other places, there was a little bit of effect with
Macondo, but not much.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: And when we look at Eastern Hemisphere for next year and taking a look how the margin
guidance that you gave is kind of mid teens, some of your competitors are suggesting that Eastern Hemisphere margins
will take a lot longer to kind of build up. You seem to be of feeling that these are going to move up pretty quickly.
What are 2 or the 3 components in there that get you to your numbers? My understanding is a lot of these contracts
were priced out 2 or 3 years ago, so that's going to take a little while to work into the system. Can you talk about it
from a contract standpoint, from internally what Baker Hughes is doing and also from the offshore side, how those 3
components work into your margin progression?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think you've got to remember we fell a lot
further than the competition so that will allow us to rebound back up a little bit. This isn't totally just a cost structure
problem. It's also a tendering issue. Yes, we put our team together 18 months ago and sent them out there and one of
the reasons why was to gain our revenue growth back, which we've done. Now you have to question, are some of those
contracts a little aggressive? Yes, probably and some of them as they wind off, we will replace them with better margin
contracts.
That plus the fact that as Martin went through, we've made some consolidation and tweaking, if you call it that, for the
geomarket structure. This is normal. We did it years ago when I was with another company. And I know one of our
right competitors did the same thing when they reorganized and had to do it a couple of times to get it right. So I think
you'll start seeing it in Q4. We have taken some cost out of the system and moving down the path of being able to do
that. You've got something you want to say? Martin's got something to say.
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: I guess the only thing I'd add on there is,
David, is the supply chain impacts as well as the BJ synergies. And on those BJ synergies not just the costs, but also the
revenue opportunities jointly, and again the Philippines is a tremendous example of that. So you put them all together,
we're comfortable with the guidance that Chad mentioned in terms of international.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay. But it sounds like a big chunk of that is going to happen internally, if I just heard you
correctly?
<A - Martin S. Craighead, President and Chief Operating Officer>: That's correct.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think a lot of it will happen internally.

<Q - Geoff Kieburtz>: I guess just a couple ones left over here. Pressure pumping capacity, you mentioned that you've
ramped up your expansion of the pressure pumping fleet, but you'll modulate that depending on market conditions.
What's your lead time now? How far ahead do you have to make decisions in terms, order date to actually putting
equipment in the field?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well it's just mainly, Geoff, the big components.
It's the power end, the fluid end and the engine. The chassis, the tractor, those type things, you can get those 3, 4
months out. The bigger lead items you're kind of looking for more like 6 months.
<Q - Geoff Kieburtz>: Okay.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We, like I mentioned, BJ had backed off
considerably on the building of equipment during the negotiations and other things, rightfully so. So we had to kind of
rebuild that supply chain link, beginning earlier this year. But we're looked at as a major player in this area, and so the
major suppliers in those points know that Baker Hughes is going to be in this business a long time, so they're jumping
through hoops to make sure that we get our equipment. So I'd say you've got to be looking at around 6 month.
Now if we start to see some things softening or whatever as we go into 2011, doesn't mean that we still won't continue
to build out some fluid ends, power ends, engines. Those things can go on the shelf and replace existing equipment or
problems as we go through this equipment. So we have some flexibility there.
<Q - Geoff Kieburtz>: Okay. And the other question was simply do you expect to take any charges in Mexico?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We've taken everything that – we take it as we go
through it. So if we have the ramp up costs, like in Iraq or others, those hit the quarter that we're involved in that
quarter. So no, we don't have anything looking at it.

Your next question is from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citi.
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to return to the international for a minute. A couple of
years ago the margins were hit a bit by the startup costs in some key international markets, and now here more recently
it seems to be reorganization-type of costs, geomarket framework and so forth. But, and I take that your guidance here
is that the 15% level could be achieved principally without help from the market. But if the market does rebound more
strongly than expected, how are you positioned relative internationally, relative to the infrastructure kind of that you
put in place a few years ago to capture that opportunity or was part of that startup process left somewhat unfinished?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No. And I guess I was confused when you say
startup because I usually think of actually gearing up to handle a contract where we're putting equipment in there.
There's that startup cost, but there's also just the infrastructure buildout costs, the facilities, et cetera, which we know
are going to be there for the next 30 years.
One thing, Robin, I want to clarify, that 15% exit rate that we talked about isn't going to come just all internally. We are
expecting that we will see some improvement in the international activity. We said it would be modest and growing,
but we do expect some of that to benefit the margins side as well, and of course we also feel from the steps that we're
taking on the cost side and organization side that that will contribute quite a bit itself.
I think we're pretty well positioned if 2011 is a surprise, and the second half it comes on strong, we have spent a lot of
money over these last 5 years both in the solid facility infrastructure side, bricks and mortars you might say, but also on
the human capital side. We have a much stronger international management team based in these key markets, again
much closer to the customer, which I think is one of the reasons why we're seeing some success on the revenue side

now. So we'll be able to respond. We're in a much, much stronger position today than we were a few years ago to
handle international growth, and that's why we did all this, that's what we're counting on.
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: All right. Okay. Just -- my follow-up is on the Gulf of Mexico. It seems to be hitting your
P&L a little harder than some others. To the extent that this return of drilling drags out and we don't get back to
pre-Macondo levels of drilling anytime in the next year or perhaps after, what kind of redeployment or perhaps
downsizing for the Gulf of Mexico is in your plan? And what are you waiting to see before you kind of trigger that?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Who's the elections. We have about 350 people that
right now out of the Gulf group that are based in temporary assignments around the world. We wanted to get -- these
are like some of our major competitors. These are people that have 20 years of experience and can go anywhere in the
world to drill or run a bit or whatever. We don't want to lose those people. So we will watch this. We're talking a lot to
our customers right now, the majors as well as the large independents, trying to get a feel for when they think they'll get
back to work. Right now we've got quite a bit of activity lined up if they can go back and drill. We think we're in a
pretty darn good position to do well in the Gulf once the activity returns.
Now, that being said, if by the end of this quarter, if we don't see some return or some positive signs, then obviously
we're going to have to take the next step in terms of our cost structure in the Gulf and do something about it. But, as
Martin said, when from the vessel side you look at it, the vessel business is doing fairly well even in the downturn
cause of reworks and some laterals and things like that on the shelf, and it's got a – that's back, all we've seen in that
area. So we think there's enough optimism or enough belief right now that it's going to strengthen a little bit starting in
Q1 that we're going to hold on a little longer before we have to do anything.
<Q - Robin Shoemaker>: Thanks. All right. Thank you.
<A - Gary R. Flaharty, Investor Relations>: All right. Thanks, Rob. And Dennis, at this point can we take one final
question, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Today's final question will come from the line of Marshall Adkins of Raymond James.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Morning, guys.
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: I just want to clarify the mid-teens margins for international. You guys have done a great job
explaining how you're going to get there and whatnot, but that's an exit rate for next year? It's not an average; is that
right?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: That's correct.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Okay. Just want to make sure because we start plugging in an average of mid-teens and your
numbers go up big.
Coming back to the pressure pumping side, you did talk about the industry horsepower. Can you help me understand
how much horsepower you've added this year? And I know it's early in the budgeting -- how much you think you're
going to add next year and kind of what percent of your CapEx that is going to be?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't want to tell you how much we've
added because I'd rather let Spirit or somebody else trying to guess and put those numbers out there. I will tell you we
are adding a frac fleet every six weeks and have been for the last little while and for the next little while. So that gives
you some upside in terms of what we have coming.
Now, that being said, there's a few factors on why we're adding this much horsepower. One, as I mentioned earlier, the
attrition rate is very high for the industry, about twice of what it used to run years ago. And the second area is, again,

we can look at some equipment -- every service company ages their equipment, looks at the life of the equipment and
so on, and there's some 10, 11, 12-year-old equipment out there in the BJ ranks that we want to be able to replace in
time, anyway. So we're adding this horsepower now, and if we do see a little slowdown, then we will get rid of some
excess, some of the older stuff. I don't know if that answers your question, Marshall.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: It helps get there. How about percent of CapEx? Is that -- can you help us with that?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Percent of horsepower CapEx versus our total
CapEx?
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Yes. You can't -- gave us guidance on total CapEx, but how much of that is BJ chewing up?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. You've got our numbers from the beginning of
the year. We talked about somewhere around 1 billion to 1.1 billion of Baker Hughes legacy CapEx, and Peter said
we're going to be around 1.7 billion for the year, so....
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: That helps us get there. Last part of this. 15% attrition rate for the industry. Are you guys in
line with that 15%?
<A - Chad C. Deaton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I mean we go by some of the things we hear
from our customers. Customers tell us that our equipment and one of our other competitors, major competitor's
equipment seems to be holding up a little better in areas like the Haynesville and others and I think that's helped us pick
up share there. But I think we're at the leading edge of not tearing up as much equipment as some of the people out
there.
<Q - Marshall Adkins>: Okay. Thanks, Chad.
Gary R. Flaharty, Investor Relations
