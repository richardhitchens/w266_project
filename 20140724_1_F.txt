information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our Annual, Quarterly and Current Reports to the SEC.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit's CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Steve. Consistent with prior quarters, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, automotive cash, debt and liquidity and then we'll wrap
things up with a summary of the quarter.
Let's turn to Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide one. Ford Credit remains key to Ford's global growth strategy,
providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid
profits and distributions. Ford Credit had another solid quarter, with pre-tax profit of $434 million and net income of
$264 million.
Managed receivables were $111 billion at the end of the quarter, up about $8 billion from year-end 2013, and up $15
billion from a year ago. We made great progress on funding milestones that support our growth, and Neil will talk more
about this in a few minutes.
The second quarter loss-to-receivables ratio was 12 basis points, down 2 basis points from a year ago, while charge-offs
were $33 million, largely unchanged from a year ago. At June 30, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $353
million, or 32 basis points of managed receivables.
Managed leverage was 8.6 to 1 at June 30, 2014, compared with 8.5 to 1 at December 31. At the end of the second
quarter, our equity was $11.2 billion.
On slide two, Ford Credit's lower pre-tax profit this quarter compared to a year ago is more than explained by a higher
level of insurance losses from storm damage to dealer inventory, included in other. Volume was higher, reflecting
increases in nearly all products. Leasing in North America in both consumer and non-consumer finance receivables in
all geographic segments.
The higher volume, though, was largely offset by unfavorable residual performance related to expectations of lower
auction values in the North America lease portfolio and all of the other factors. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit
was lower compared with first quarter, more than explained by the insurance losses just mentioned.
For the full year, Ford Credit now expects pre-tax profit to be higher than 2013, improved from about equal to or
higher. Ford Credit also now expects year-end managed receivables of $112 billion to $115 billion, up from prior
guidance of about $110 billion. Ford Credit continues to expect managed leverage in the range of 8:1 to 9:1 and
distributions to its parent of about $250 million.
Slide three shows our quarterly trend of charge-offs, loss receivables ratio and credit loss reserve. Year-over-year
charge-offs were largely unchanged. Quarter-over-quarter charge-offs were down $19 million, consistent with normal
seasonality. The loss receivables ratio was 2 basis points lower than the same period a year ago and 8 basis points lower
than the prior quarter. The loss receivables ratio of 12 basis points is well below the 10-year average of 54 basis points.
The credit loss reserve was $353 million, down $23 million from a year ago reflecting the continuation of low losses.
Slide four shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. retail and lease business, which comprises 71% of our
worldwide consumer portfolio. We remain consistent in our origination practices. Over 60-day delinquencies were 12
basis points, about consistent with the prior year. Repossessions in the second quarter were 6,000 units or 98 basis
points of average accounts outstanding, down 8 basis points from a year ago and down 14 basis points from first
quarter. This is our lowest repossession ratio on record.
Severity was $7,300 in the second quarter, down $300 from the same period a year ago, and down $400 from the prior
quarter. These improvements primarily reflect higher auction values. Second quarter charge-offs and LTR were
consistent with the prior year and down significantly from the first quarter, consistent with normal seasonality.

Slide five shows the U.S. Ford and Lincoln lease residual performance. Lease return volumes in the second quarter
were 23,000 units higher than the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting higher lease placements in 2011 and
2012 compared with prior years. The second quarter lease return rate was 75%, up 7 percentage points compared with
the same period last year, primarily reflecting a higher percent of vehicles with a lease end purchase price above market
value.
In the second quarter, our auction values for 24-month contracts increased by about $100, while 36-month auction
values increased by about $1,000 compared to the same period last year, consistent with industry trends. The difference
in 24-month and 36-month auction value increases primarily reflect differences in vehicle content, although 24-month
and 36-month auction values increased from the first quarter, consistent with industry trends as well.
Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $19.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, up about $1.6
billion from year-end, and up $3.7 billion from a year ago.
Now, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide six, we are on track to achieve our 2014 funding plan. Year-to-date, we have issued $17
billion of public term funding. In the second quarter, we completed over $8 billion of funding in the public term
markets, consisting of about $4 billion of unsecured debt in the U.S. and Europe, and about $4 billion of public
asset-backed debt in the U.S., Canada, Europe and China.
Additionally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we achieved a number of very significant funding milestones in the second
quarter. We were the first wholly foreign-owned auto finance company to issue a public asset-backed transaction in the
Chinese ABS market, a key pillar to our growth strategy in China.
In the U.S., we launched our inaugural retail revolving ABS transaction, what we call FordREV. Our first issuance was
for $1 billion, with a five-year maturity. We launched a medium-term note program, and with the ratings from the three
of the major U.S. rating agencies, we returned to the Tier 3 unsecured commercial paper market. And, finally, we also
extended and grew our FCE revolving credit facility.
Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets,
channels and investors. We remain focused on maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet.
Slide seven shows the trends in funding for our managed receivables. At the end of the second quarter, managed
receivables were $111 billion, and we ended the quarter with about $9 billion in cash. Securitized funding was 40% of
managed receivables. We project year-end managed receivables of $112 billion to $115 billion and securitized funding,
as a percent of managed receivables, in the range of 36% to 40%. This percentage will continue to decline going
forward.
Slide eight shows our projected 2014 public funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term funding programs.
As I mentioned earlier, we have completed $17 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada, Europe and China.
We project full year public term funding in the range of $24 billion to $29 billion, consisting of $10 billion to $13
billion of unsecured debt and $14 billion to $16 billion of public securitizations. Our funding ranges are up slightly
from previous guidance given the increase in our projected year-end receivables.
Turning to slide nine, our liquidity remains strong at $27 billion, up more than $4 billion from the prior quarter,
reflecting increased liquidity sources and reduced utilization. Ford Credit sources of liquidity include cash, committed
asset-backed lines, unsecured credit lines and the corporate revolver allocation. The FCAR program officially ended in
April.
As of June 30, we had $46.5 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, up $1.8 billion from prior quarter. Our
liquidity includes $2 billion of the corporate-revolving credit facility allocated to Ford Credit and the FCE syndicated

credit facility, which was increased to £760 million and extended to October of 2017. We are focused on maintaining
liquidity levels to meet our business and funding requirements through economic cycles.
Slide 10 shows the automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.4 billion, $300 million lower than the first quarter.
Ford ended the quarter with net cash of $10.4 billion and automotive liquidity of $36.7 billion. Ford completed in the
quarter its corporate credit facility amendment and maturity extension. The facility is now $12.2 billion, of which $2
billion has been allocated to Ford Credit.
Now, let's turn to the summary of the first quarter on slide 11. Overall, the company delivered a strong quarter. It
achieved its 20th consecutive profitable quarter and its best quarterly pre-tax profits since second quarter of 2011.
Among the automotive business units, North America achieved record quarterly performance for pre-tax profit, Asia
Pacific achieved its second quarter record and Europe earned its first quarterly profit since the market dramatically
declined three years ago. The company ended the quarter with Automotive net cash of $10.4 billion and continued
strong liquidity at $36.7 billion.
Ford Credit is delivering profitable, sustainable growth. We had another solid quarter with pre-tax profit of $434
million and net income of $264 million. Ford Credit's receivables increased 16% from a year ago, reaching $111 billion
as we support Ford's global growth plans.
Our consistent purchase policy and world-class servicing continues to result in strong portfolio performance at Ford
Credit. Our diversified funding plan is on track as we completed $17 billion of public term funding year-to-date, and
we had a strong liquidity of almost $27 billion at the end of the quarter.
Ford Credit continues to deliver on the core elements of its Ford support strategy, outstanding products and services, a
strong and growing balance sheet and consistent profitability.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to begin the Q&A session.
Steve Dahle
Thank you, Neil. With that, we will start the question-and-answer session. Sarah, may we please have the first caller?
Q&A
Operator
Great. Yep. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Karson from Bank of America.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Hey, guys. Great. Can you hear me?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yep.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great. Well, great quarter. Congratulations on that. I just had a couple of questions based sort
of the balance sheet. I know Ford's got a really good target for total automotive debt at around $10 billion by
mid-decade. Are you guys still on track with that, I guess, if we assume that you take out the convert?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yes.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Perfect. On the cash flow side, I was just kind of comparing the full year plan with an update
from the quarter. And it's a small change, but it looks like cash flow went from being substantially lower to lower. Am I
right into thinking that? And if so, do we know what is driving that improvement and can you give us some magnitude
of it, if at all?

<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah, Doug, it's Stuart. So you're correct, we've improved our guidance from, as you said,
substantially lower to lower. That's really based on the strong first half performance. I think you can see, we're about
$3.8 billion to date of offloading-related cash flow.
We've really – in addition to, obviously, the profit side of the business, we've had a great focus on working capital and
continuing to drive efficiencies in that area of our business across the globe. And we've been making good progress,
and our outlook is somewhat stronger than it was when we went into the year.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: That's helpful. And then kind of some bookkeeping; it looks like your global
loss-to-receivables is down to 0.12%, which I think is the lowest I've seen it. Is there any kind of strategy for maybe
providing loans to customers that have a little bit higher risk and trying to expand some profitability, because that's a
pretty low metric?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Hey, Doug. It's Mike. Remember, our strategy is to be consistent in our origination
practices. And we've continued to do that. So we look at this from a couple of different perspectives. First is what
percent of our portfolio is high risk? And that, from our perspective, has been very stable in the 5% to 6% range.
The other side of that coin is what percent of Ford buyers who have a FICO less than 620 is Ford Credit Financing?
And again, I've said this oftentimes, we are getting three out of four customers who finance a Ford vehicle who have a
FICO score less than 620, and that's been pretty stable as well. So, as we look at it, we are getting our share of the risk
for the people who are walking through the door, and it's our origination and servicing practices that are delivering
these types of levels. It's not our lowest. We were down to 8 basis points a couple of years ago, but obviously these
levels are well below our long-term average and customers are just paying.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: That's very helpful. I think there's quite a few kind of comments on the F-Series on the
previous call, and I tried to understand them. I just had a kind of follow-up question. I know the new F-series is coming
out, and it's going to be a game-changer potentially. Have you seen a little bit of weakness in the existing F-series sale
cadence, maybe there are people waiting for the new vehicle or is it tough year-over-year comps? Just to kind of get my
head around that.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: No, Doug. This is Stuart here again. We're seeing continued strong demand for F-Series.
You will have noticed our share in North America was down year-on-year in the second quarter, and a part of the
explanation that Bob shared was that some of that was F-Series. But that's really around our management of our
production and our sales as we go into this period where we'll shut down the first of our F-Series plants in the second
half of this year and then our Kansas City plant next year. So we expect to have constraints on the supply side, and so
we're managing share and pricing and stocks in there as a group. So, as a result, we've seen strong net pricing on
F-Series, but our share is somewhat lower, but it's not through a lack of demand.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great. That's it for me. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
All right. Great. Our next question comes from Brian Jacoby from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a broad question around subprime. And New
York Times had a pretty big article over the weekend about how – almost comparing it to how subprime auto lending
could equate to similar – to the downturn what happened in 2008 with mortgages, which seems kind of overdone. But
just trying to get my arms around what you guys are thinking as to how that – whether that could actually be a risk for
industry volumes at some point down the road. And obviously, a lot of the financing in that arena is more, I guess,
non-captives and some entities that are obviously smaller. But I'm just trying to get an idea of what you guys are
viewing, whether there truly is sort of an air pocket there a little bit in the subprime market, and then perhaps maybe it's
overextended?

Page 6 of 7
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, Doug, it is true that subprime is up. I mean, I think last year, it was about 14% of the
industry. This year, I think it's running in 18-plus percent. It actually mitigated a little bit in the second quarter. But we
are seeing a lot more of that happen. You're also right in that it seems to be happening in the non-captive space. As I
said, we're still capturing three out of four of the subprime customers who buy a Ford vehicle.
Is it a worry for the industry? Again, if we're doing three out of four, we're kind of managing those customers as best as
we think we can and we're going to work with them to get them back into new Ford cars and truck as we always have.
All we can comment on is our own performance and we think our risk appetite is the right risk appetite. And you can
obviously see from the results on slide four that our delinquencies and repos are performing extraordinarily well.
Is there a risk with interest rates popping up? Absolutely, but certainly, I don't think so for – to a much lesser extent, to
somebody like Ford Credit.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Got you. Okay. And then one other follow-up there is just around the financing market in
China, which obviously is in its infancy. It's very small, but it sounds like some buyers in China are opening up to
financing smaller – a portion of the car at least now. And just kind of wanted to get your thoughts again there. I know
in the past, you've commented on it, but I'm just curious as to how you see the financing opportunity in China and how
that's playing out.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah. As you know, we have a wholly-owned subsidiary in China and we are working very
closely with the motor company to really support what we see is phenomenal growth on the auto side.
What's been said about the financing industry in China is about 20% of customers finance the car and so the other 80%
are showing up with a bag of cash. For the 20% who are financing, they show up with a half of bag of cash.
So, overall, the industry is in its infancy but we are working to expand our funding and continue to support Ford as best
we can. The ABS deal, we think is a watershed for expanding that market. And we're going to expand there with the
same discipline that we have all around the world.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. Thanks. That's it for me. Good quarter.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Thank you.
<A - Steve Dahle>: Thanks, Brian.
Operator
All right. Great. Well, it looks like there are no further questions in queue. So I'll turn it back over to Steven for closing
remarks.
