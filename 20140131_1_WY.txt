Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Our vision here at Weyerhaeuser is to grow a truly great company for
our shareholders, customers and employees. 2013 was a very good year, as we made initial progress toward achieving
this goal by doubling net earnings, excluding special items from $316 million or $0.58 per diluted share in 2012 to

$654 million or $1.14 per diluted share in 2013, increasing our dividend by nearly 30%, announcing an agreement to
combine our real estate operation with TRI Pointe Homes and a tax efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction and
acquiring approximately 645,000 acres of some of the finest timberland in the country, through the purchase of
Longview Timber.
As a result of our actions in 2013 and our relentless focus on operational excellence going forward, we're
well-positioned to fully capitalize on improving markets and drive value for our shareholders in 2014 and beyond.
Speaking of improving markets, let me just comment on economic conditions that affect our company before I discuss
our fourth quarter performance.
First, the housing market. The housing market continued to improve in 2013, with total starts rising to 923,000, an 18%
gain from 2012. The housing recovery showed resilience as construction activity increased in the fourth quarter, having
adjusted to higher interest rates and market uncertainty caused by fiscal inciting, which impacted the second and third
quarters.
Housing fundamentals remain positive with low inventories and affordability still well above historic norms. In
addition, prices for existing homes have increased 14% on a year-ago basis and the additional homeowner wealth is a
bullish to the economy. The economy has been adding jobs, and as people find employment, they're forming
households and adding to the demand for housing. These trends are expected to continue in 2014, and we're planning
for over 1.1 million starts, including 780,000 single family.
I'll comment briefly on global economic conditions, since approximately one-third of our revenues come from exported
products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. As the euro zone continues to manage
its debt crisis and emerges from recession, the currency is stabilized and strengthened. A stronger euro should improve
the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fiber business, as well as our Asian log exports.
In Japan, fiscal and monitory reforms have stimulated the economy and increased housing starts, which has improved
demand for our products. In China, our export activity picked up in 2013, and while many forecast of overall economic
growth in China had been lowered, the government continues with its objective of moving people from rural to urban
settings. This is the driver of construction activity and the source of China's growing demand for imported wood.
Now, I will comment on our fourth quarter performance. For the fourth quarter 2013, we reported net earnings of $43
million or $0.07 per diluted share on net sale of $2.3 billion. We have several special items in the quarter, the largest of
which was the previously announced non-cash impairment of a community excluded from the combination of WRECO
and TRI Pointe Homes.
Charges for special items were partially offset, by some unrelated tax adjustments which Patty will discuss in more
detail. Excluding these special items, we reported solid fourth quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.27 per diluted
share, compared with net earnings of $143 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012.
Let me now turn to our business segment, starting with Timberlands, charts four to six. Timberlands contribute a $134
million to earnings in the quarter, up 14% compared with the third quarter 2013, as construction market in China drove
increased demand for western logs. Our Western fee harvest volumes were up by 17% due to the stronger demand and
a full quarter of harvest from the Longview land. I'm pleased to report that the Longview integration continues to go
smoothly, and that we are on track to achieve or exceed our EBITDA and synergy goals.
Turning to market condition, selling prices for Western logs were generally high in the quarter, while our sales
realizations were flat, due in part to a higher percentage of logs exported to China, compared with higher value logs to
Japan.
Southern log price realizations were up modestly. As expected, road and silviculture costs were higher in the quarter
and the contributions from the sale of non-strategic Timberlands declined by $3 million in the quarter.
Wood Products, charts seven and eight. Wood Products contributed $58 million before special items to earnings in the
quarter, down from $79 million in the third quarter, but above the $38 million of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Special items for the fourth quarter included non-cash impairment charges of $10 million related to the permanent

closure of previously curtailed engineered wood products operation.
Sales volume declined across all product lines in the quarter due to seasonality and unusually severe winter weather.
OSB prices were lower in the quarter, while lumber and engineered wood sales price realizations were higher.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $88 million, compared with a $110 million in the third quarter. In lumber,
EBITDA was down $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, as lower volumes due to
seasonally weaker demand, extreme weather conditions, and higher log cost more than offset the benefit from higher
prices.
In OSB, EBITDA declined by $15 million compared with the previous quarter due to 4% lower prices and 11% less
volume due to seasonality as well as extreme winter weather and capital related downtime. Engineered wood products
generated EBITDA before special items of $11 million in the quarter, down from the prior quarter due to a seasonal
decline in sales volumes and again some weather-related production and transportation issues. And finally, EBITDA in
distribution improved by $5 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, primarily due to increased
product margin.
As we discussed in our December 17th investor presentation, we're committed to improving the EBITDA in both
engineered wood products and distribution by $30 million to $40 million in 2014, compared with 2013.
Cellulose Fibers, charts 9 and 10. Cellulose Fibers contributed $65 million of earnings in the quarter, up $18 million
from third quarter 2013, and up $4 million compared with fourth quarter 2012. The improvement compared with third
quarter 2013 was attributable to higher pulp price realizations, lower maintenance expenses and improved productivity
due to fewer maintenance outage days. These were partially offset by higher fiber cost and lower realization from
liquid packaging board.
Fourth quarter liquid packaging board sales included a smaller proportion of higher value products. We expect a return
to our typical mix in the first quarter.
Real Estate, chart 11 to 13. Retail reported strong results as Real Estate contributed $71 million to earnings before
special items in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter includes special charges of $349 million, primarily
associated with the previously announced impairment.
The improvement compared with prior quarter was attributable to a 40% increase in single-family closings, and 11%
increase in average prices in single family gross margins of 23%.
I will now turn it over to Patty to specifically address our first quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thank you, Doyle. Good morning, everybody and Happy New Year. Notwithstanding the harsh weather that much of
the country has been experiencing, 2014 appears to be off to a good start with a steadily improving economy and
housing starts for 2014 forecasted to increase by approximately 20% over 2013. The outlook for the first quarter is on
chart 15. And I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.
Export log volumes to both Japan and China are expected to increase during the quarter. The pricing momentum that
we saw in the fourth quarter is carrying over to the first quarter. A higher percentage of Japan volume relative to the
fourth quarter, as well as an increased percentage of Douglas-fir log to China are anticipated to contribute to strong
price realization.
The robust export markets are also putting upward pressure on domestic log price. Western fee harvest is expected to
increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter in order to take advantage of the stronger markets. By contrast, the
pricing dynamic in the South continues to be less robust. Log prices are expected to increase only slightly, while fee
harvest volumes are expected to decrease by approximately 5%, slightly lower road maintenance and silviculture
spending in the West will be offset by slightly higher cost in the South. We expect that the effect of the strong

operating earnings for the segment in the first quarter will be largely offset by decreased earnings from non-strategic
land sales.
In the fourth quarter, we had earnings from non-strategic land sales of approximately $20 million and we anticipate the
first quarter sales will be minimal. As a result, we expect overall first quarter earnings in the Timberlands segment will
be comparable to slightly higher relative to the fourth quarter results. The outlook for fee harvest volume for the full
year of 2014 is expected to increase by approximately 10% to 12%, mostly as a result of the Longview Timber
acquisition in July of last year.
In Wood Products, with the seasonally softer fourth quarter behind us and an improving housing market outlook, we
expect Wood Products sales volumes to increase across all product lines in the first quarter. Channel inventories remain
at low levels. Lumber sales prices have continued to increase thus far in the quarter and we expect stronger realizations
in the first quarter relative to the fourth. By contrast, OSB pricing has been softer thus far and we expect overall
realizations for the full quarter will be slightly weaker compared to the fourth quarter.
Engineered wood products demand is anticipated to decrease; although, realizations will be slightly lower due to
product mix. Log costs are expected to increase, especially in the West, consistent with our Timberlands outlook.
Increased operating rates should lead to lower unit manufacturing costs. However, the wildcard is the severe weather
conditions that we've experienced in January, especially in the South. Operating postures and rates are being adversely
affected by the extreme cold and great recovery decreases due to frozen logs. Transportation availability is also limited
by treacherous road conditions. We do expect these harsh weather conditions to begin to moderate as we move through
the quarter and anticipate that the stronger market conditions will result in higher earnings in the Wood Products
segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
Moving to Cellulose Fibers, the year ended with global softwood pulp inventories at approximately 24 days, which is
below the normal range of 28 to 32 days. Wholesale volumes are anticipated to decline slightly as a result of the timing
of shipments. Higher liquid packaging sales realizations and volumes are expected to offset the effect of the pulp sales
decrease. The maintenance spending will be somewhat higher and labor costs are also expected to increase slightly. We
anticipate higher fiber cost in the West. Overall earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment is expected to be lower in the
first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.
In Real Estate, the first quarter of the year is historically a seasonally weaker quarter for home closings compared to the
fourth. This year is no exception. We expect to close approximately 600 homes in the first quarter, down from 1072 in
the fourth quarter.
However, this is a 30% increase over the 463 closings in the first quarter of last year. Margins are anticipated to be
around 20% to 21%, which is lower than the fourth quarter, but comparable to the first quarter a year ago. We have
13% more homes in backlog as of December 31, compared to a year ago, at prices 29% higher than a year ago. The
number of actively selling communities at the end of 2013 is 35% greater than the prior year. We expect that selling
costs in the first quarter will decrease relative to the fourth quarter as a result of fewer home closings.
Consistent with the normal seasonal pattern, we expect that first quarter earnings from our single-family home building
business will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter, but better than the breakeven results of a year ago.
Our previously announced combination of our Real Estate business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track to close in the
second quarter of this year. We continue to be excited by the value creation of this powerful combination. The requisite
registration statement was filed at beginning of this month and we have received clearance under our
Hart-Scott-Rodino filing. We continue to work through the remaining steps to close the transaction.
Now, I'd like to touch briefly on unallocated items, which are shown on chart 14. Excluding special items, unallocated
expense in the fourth quarter increased by $49 million compared to the third. Almost half of that difference relates to a
smaller favorable impact from the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, as a result of changes in
inventory levels. Amounts in the Other category for the fourth quarter include charges for environmental and litigation
reserves and other miscellaneous items, with no single item greater than $5 million.

Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial highlights. We ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $835
million. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $114 million, bringing our total spending for the full year to $293
million. For 2014, we expect that capital spending will be approximately $390 million, consistent with the guidance we
shared during our Investor Meeting in December.
During the fourth quarter, we completed the financing for the Longview Timber acquisition, and we also repaid all
third party WRECO debt. As of year-end, we had approximately $4.9 billion in total debt, with no maturities until
2017. During 2013, we replaced our revolving line of credit, with a new agreement with $1 billion of capacity, and the
agreement does not expire until June 2018. There are no borrowings outstanding under the line.
As Doyle mentioned, we had significant positive tax adjustments in the quarter, which we have called out as special
items in our earnings material. These adjustments followed the completion of examination by taxing authorities
covering multiple years in both the U.S. and Canada. The largest of these relates to the exclusion from income of our
alternative fuel mixture credit claimed in 2009.
Looking forward to 2014, we expect our tax rate for our taxable REIT subsidiary earning to be approximately 33% to
35%, and of course we accrue no taxes on REIT income as we plan to distribute all taxable income of the REIT to our
shareholders.
Now I want to wrap up with an update on our pension and postretirement plans. During the fourth quarter, we made the
decision to close defined benefit pension plans to employees hired after 2013. We replaced both plans with defined
contribution plan. We also made plan amendments to certain of our other postemployment benefit plan. Factoring in
these changes, as well as the strong investment earnings and increased discount rate, the funded status of our plans as of
December 31, 2013, improved by approximately $1.45 billion compared to the funded status as of December 2012.
Cash paid for all plans in 2013 totaled $137 million. We expect total spending in 2014 to approximate $110 million.
Consistent with last year, we do not expect to contribute any cash to our U.S. qualified plan, which is fully funded.
Our primary contributions will be to our Canadian plan for approximately $55 million with the remainder going to pay
benefits under our supplemental retirement plan and our other postemployment benefit plans, neither of which are
separately funded.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. As I said earlier, 2013 was a very good year for Weyerhaeuser as we double our earnings before
special items, significantly increased our dividends and positioned ourselves for the future through significant
transaction.
But we still have a lot of work runway in front of us. As we look ahead, we're excited about 2014 and are relentlessly
focused on growing shareholder value by driving our performance through operational excellence and capitalizing on
improving markets to increase our cash flow and grow our dividend.
So with that, operator, we will open it up for questions.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Alex. Good. Thank you.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Just a couple of questions for you. First, on the cost savings and the distribution on EWP
business, where we're targeting $30 million to $40 million for 2014. How should we think about how that flows
through the model through the course of the year. Do you start to see that as early as the first quarter?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: We'll start to see some improvement in the first quarter, Alex, but it's not going to, and it will
be all throughout the year. So you can't take the $30 million and $40 million divided by four and it's going to be even, it
actually will build throughout the year as we gain tractions on the initiatives that we outlined in our December 17th
presentation.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: That's helpful, though, and just looking at the price performance of, or was it be relative to
lumber. Lumber's been so much more robust over the last six months, typically they historically move together. Can
you just talk about the supply demand dynamics that you're seeing in OSB, relative to lumber that maybe driving some
of that delta?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. And in terms of, it will start with lumber and in terms of lumber, the supply and demand
dynamics are favorable, what we've seen of course is improvement in demand as housing starts have continue to grow.
And on the supply side of the equation, Alex, while there have been some restarts and everybody is ramping up
production. Supply and demand are in pretty good balance.
On the other hand, in OSB as you're very well aware while we have seen improvement on the demand side, there have
been some significant restarts and new facilities that have come online and that's what has led in our opinion to the
volatility in OSB pricing over the past few quarters. And I think that will continue until we see supply and demand
getting more in balance.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: That makes sense. And just one housekeeping question, the EWP facility thus primarily closed,
how much capacity was that?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I don't know that exact figure off the top of my head. We'll tell you, Alex what that is and will
get back to you with that. That is the last facility that we had and that had been curtailed, and now all of our facilities
are now either running or have been permanently closed at this point.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Alex, facility was in Colbert, Georgia. As Doyle said, it was closed for some number of
years, but it was about 3 million cubic feet and it was a Parallam facility.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Very helpful. Thank you very much. I'll turn it over.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. Couple of questions, if I could. First on the lumber pricing, I noticed random
lengths is up about $35 looking at the composite, obviously you're in lots of different geographies et cetera. But why
Europe prices only up $9. Was that really just geography in mixing or do you sometimes lock in pricing early in the
quarter or maybe that can affect things as well.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Hi, Mark, we thought you might ask this question. So here is what's going on. There's very
little blocking in prices. Actually what happened as we dug into this is, as you know random lengths takes into account
a variety of grades and widths, but it's mostly 2x4s and 2x10s, and that's normally pretty reflective of what's happening
in the overall market.
This quarter mid-width, which is 2x6, 2x8, which are not included – are not generally included in random lengths, but
are 40% of our volume at southern yellow pine were down 9%. So this is a quarter where random lengths because of
the mix and everything went – was significantly different than what our actual experience was.

Now if you look at it overall and we went back to compared to year-over-year, we're right on top of random lengths.
Just this happens to be one quarter whether two are out of sync.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. So I just want to also on the pension, so does that mean you
ended the year at about $100 million to $200 million underfunded. Am I doing the right math there, Patty?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, as you add all of our plans together, so that's a combination of our pension plans as
well as our postemployment benefit plan, that will total about just under $500 million underfunded. If you look at just
the pension plans themselves, it's really the Canadian plans that are underfunded, so you're about right on that number,
but the total underfunded as we think about all of those and as I mentioned, we don't fund the supplemental plan or the
postemployment plan.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Great.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, just pension alone, you're pretty much right, but altogether it will be just under $500
million.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you. And then lastly, has there been any further thought on, I believe you got like
$730 million of cash from the TRI Pointe transaction as well as the shares going to shareholders. Has there been any
further thought on the use for that money?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, as you know and as we shared with the group in December, as we think about our
financial priorities going forward including the $700 million – first and foremost, we were focused on returning cash to
shareholders. That will be primarily through a growing dividend going forward, but also through share repurchase
where appropriate.
Second is going to be investing on our business, again through high return projects to improve our cost structure and
our margin. And we'll also look for opportunities to grow our business, but we'll be very disciplined in doing that
through acquisitions that create value. And then finally, maintaining the appropriate capital structure just for the
growing dividend, and we shared some of those metrics with you in December.
So, I give you that background just to say – we're -we understand the amount of cash we're getting. We understand the
cash on the balance sheet. And we will as we move forward through the TRI Pointe transaction, we'll be making
decisions with what to do with the proceeds from that and exactly whether we're going to do a spin or split in all that.
So what you could anticipate is we won't make a decision on, we're probably won't make a decision on the dividend
until we have completed the TRI Pointe transaction and then we'll be back to you at that point of time.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. Thank you, Doyle, very helpful.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Hi, everyone, good morning. How are you doing?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks for all the details. Some housekeeping and I apologize if you've already answered,
I've been doing a couple of calls at once here. First of all Patty, did you say what the amount of pension expense will be
in the P&L this year. I did catch the funding, but I'm not sure, I caught the expense and then the other housekeeping
item, did you mention what was in the rather large tax adjustment in the fourth quarter what drove that?

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. Yeah, George, you guys has had a busy week. So let me in terms of answering the
pension and postretirement expense, maybe the way to think about that would be to look at chart 18 that's in the
material. I did not give you the expense number in my prepared remarks, but as you look at that chart, if you looked at
what we had for expense in 2013, in total, it's about $100 million.
In 2014, the total expense will be just about flat. So we really won't have any expense to speak out. Now, as you think
about the business segment, so we do charge the segments their normal service cost. So, overall service cost in the
business segment was I think around $60 million in 2013, that will come down to around $40 million because the
service cost comes down as the discount rate increases, and the discount rate did increase year-over-year. That $40
million offset then will be in the allocated segment, as income in the unallocated segment, because we want to make
sure from a business perspective that we are charging the normal service cost into the business segment. So, hopefully
that's helpful there.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks for that.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: On the tax, yes, I did speak to that. We had a number of years under examination, both in
the U.S. and Canada that we completed in the fourth quarter. You might recall, in the third quarter filing in the 10-Q,
we said that it was reasonably possible that we would be releasing up to $160 million of FIN 48 or unrecognized tax
benefits as a result of those examinations. And that that would be primarily related to the alternative fuel mixture
credits. Remember those go back to 2009. We had included the credit in income and we had provided a FIN 48 reserve
for those that now has been resolved and so that's the reason primarily the biggest part of the tax reserves that we
released in the quarter.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Last question, I'll turn it over. Totally different topic, in 2012, in the past the
company has had a number of what I'd call incubation-like businesses within Cellulose Fibers. You know, years back,
there was talk about carbon replacement products being generated by Weyerhaeuser, obviously, you've had the jet fuel
venture, how do you see those playing out over time within Cellulose Fibers, do you see them as still viable in an
environment where you are pursuing operational excellence, obviously, are there areas perhaps where there's been
investment spending that – maybe that needs to come down at some point. Thanks.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thanks for the question, George and I'll tell you, at Weyerhaeuser, to your point, innovation
has been a core value and will continue to be a core value going forward. With that said, what we – as we go through
the process, we're going through on operational excellence, George. We're going to become very focused where we're
innovating where it adds value to the bottom line. So, we want to make sure that the monies that we spend, the effort
that we spend on R&D and innovation, ultimately results in a benefit to our bottom line. So, as we move forward that's
part of the process we're in, is making sure we have direct alignment again between the funds that are being spent, the
effort that's being spent on innovation, and how we ultimately drive value for our customers and for our shareholders.

Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Just to start, can you just maybe take a step back and give some broader color on what
you're seeing in the wood product market, particularly on two things. One, comparing it to last year, where there was
clearly a lot of panic and tension. And also, just if you've seen any sort of response given – and any change in your
business, just given the decline in the Canadian currency over the last month or so?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I'll take your first question and I'm going to ask Patty to address the Canadian currency
situation, but you cut out or maybe we cut out a little bit when you said comparing it to last year where we saw
something and I didn't hear...
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Yeah, last year there was just a lot of panic and tension. I mean, a lot of the supply hadn't
come back, yet; that you had the jump in housing start towards the end of the year and I'm just wondering, have you
seen your customers maybe more cautious relative to last year given what happened with the price movements or given
the fact that we did see another late year ramp-up in housing activity? Do they feel well prepared for the housing
season that's coming up?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. So, let me talk specifics and then I'll step back. If you look in terms of specifics, Gail,
currently versus the fourth quarter lumber prices have continued to improve and are up probably $25 versus the fourth
quarter average. OSB, as I mentioned a little bit earlier in response to a question, we've seen continued pressure there
and those prices are down somewhere probably in the $10 range.
Specifically, regarding customers, I would tell you to your exact point, I think inventories are very lien. Customers are
cautiously optimistic. They do remember kind of what happened last year, but I would tell you as we talk to our
customers they are confident that we're going to continue to see growth in housing starts. And in fact, some of our
customers' biggest concern at this point is will we have the supply to provide them with what they're going to need to
service their customers going forward. So, that's kind of how I would characterize where we are versus where we were
a year ago.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And, Gail, to your question about the Canadian currency, as you noted, the Canadian
dollar has depreciated here of late, and typically the effect of that is that it makes it easier for Canadian lumber to come
into the United States. We really haven't seen a lot of impact as a result of that. That would be primarily the [ph] FPS
(35:31) that comes across, both from interior BC, as well as Eastern Canada. And as we've talked about in the past,
from a supply perspective, the interior of British Columbia is dealing with the Canadian pine beetle and Eastern Canada
is dealing with reductions in the allowable cut. The other piece that is a positive dynamic at that is that today the export
markets for lumber are much more robust than they were a few years ago when we saw a much weaker Canadian
dollar.
So, it is something that we do track very closely, but so far we haven't seen a big impact from that. And, we also do
have some Canadian production as well. So, we are benefited to the extent that it will come to support.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And, just a couple more. Your cancellation rate seems to have moved up a bit in
WRECO. I'm just wondering if there is anything out of the usual there.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, Gail. Good question. We really haven't seen anything that we would say would be a
trend. It did move up in the fourth quarter, but we haven't seen anything that we would say is really a trend
year-over-year. The cancellation rate is in line.
I think, as we look forward to the first quarter, it's really difficult to tell based on what's going on in the markets,
because of weather – really severe weather. You know well better than we do here in the West, because sitting here in
Seattle – which we often complain about the rain. Well, there are no complaints about our weather this year, compared
to what the rest of the country is experiencing. And, that does hit for us in our Winchester subsidiary in the Washington
DC, Virginia, Maryland area; as well as even in Houston, which we wouldn't think would be suffering cold weather,
but even the South is being hit. But, in talking with our real estate folks, there isn't anything that we see that we would
say is a trend. Mortgage interest rates are going up a little bit, but it's not a huge significant thing at this point; but we'll
stay tuned to that.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just a couple of quick modeling questions. I might have missed it, but can you
give us any sort of guidance from what you'd expect the average price in WRECO to do in the quarter? Also, any
guidance on the change in pulp downtime costs, and then just one quick last one after that?

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. The average price will increase relative to the fourth quarter. As you look at our
backlog, the average price in the backlog is higher than what it has been in at the end of other quarters. So, we'll enjoy
that going into the first quarter. Margins will come down a little bit compared to the fourth quarter, really based on mix.
To your question about maintenance spending, we'll have a little bit more maintenance spending, really more in the
major maintenance area. The actual downtime won't be real significant. I would expect that, overall, the increase in
maintenance spending would be maybe $4 million to $5 million additional than from what we had in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And then just quickly, I thought, you mentioned your outlook for OSB, your
guidance for Wood Products, you're assuming just a slight decline in OSB pricing. I just want to verify that I heard that.
Does that imply that you're expecting pretty healthy recovery through balance of the quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, we said that it would be weaker relative to the fourth quarter realization. So it is one
of those things that sitting here in January, it has weakened. We would hope that, that would not be the case as we,
weakening further as we go through the rest of the quarter and start to see the spring building season but that's
something that we'll have to, to track. I think January is a difficult month usually to forecast for the quarter because it's
a weaker quarter, or weaker month for the quarter. And as you know, again, we are being challenged more this quarter
because of the weather impact. So we'll just have to see what happens as we go forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLT (sic) [CLSA].
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Hi, Mark.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: I wonder if you can help us think about the magnitude of the profit difference between
China and Japan, and how that's going to change especially as you sell more Doug-fir for to China which sounds like a
good thing? And second question, can you remind us how different Longview's end markets are versus the rest of your
Pacific Northwest business?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, in terms of Longview, pick that one first, they do have a high percentage of
premium logs as compared to our Western market. So a good percentage of that will go to the Japan market as well as
they also have, though, on a specie mix a little more whitewood and that's what you saw in the fourth quarter pricing to
China. The mix was more heavily than our typical mix to whitewood versus Douglas-fir.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: As I mentioned in my remarks, we will be changing that mix, so that mix will change a
little bit in the fourth quarter to send more Doug-fir to China. Now Japan will always compete for the highest value
Doug-fir for log because of the fact that they do build housing in the traditional post and beam construction for
example. They build housing out of wood as opposed to China being more of a construction activity use of the wood.
But that historical gap between China and Japan has closed a little bit based upon the strength of the construction
activity taking place in China.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: And do you think that's going to keep narrowing, Patty?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, it's always difficult to tell because you've got the activity taking place and you know
it is the additional supply dynamics as well. But we, as we sit here today, for the first quarter certainly continue to see
very robust demand coming out of China. So, I don't see anything that will change it in the near term and I think just
both of those economies in the longer term, but our demand from Japan has been very stable as well. So, we like the
fact that we've got two very robust markets now that we are – have the ability to ship wood into.

Your next question is from Ketan Mamtora with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ketan Mamtora>: Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones, can you remind us what you have in the form of tax
yields at this point, whether NOLs or alternative fuel credits or anything of that kind?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: We do have some cellulosic biofuel credits that we have to apply against our cash taxes. In
terms of cash taxes, for example in 2014, we don't expect to pay any additional cash taxes. I don't have the actual
amount of the cellulosic biofuel credits. You'll get a more detailed review of what we have in taxes obviously when we
file the 10-K, which will be here in the next couple of weeks.
<Q - Ketan Mamtora>: Right, but you do not expect any significant cash taxes in 2014?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Correct.
<Q - Ketan Mamtora>: Got you, thanks. And then on EWP, I saw the prices were up quite nicely year-over-year, can
you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in that business in terms of just overall pick up? And then if you can
tell us what the operating rates were and all the Wood Products rates in Q4?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure. Let me start with the operating rates and then we'll go back to the – what we saw in
pricing. But in terms of operating rates in lumber, in the fourth quarter operating rates were roughly 85%. A portion of
that fall from the third quarter had to do with weather-related items. In OSB, the operating rates were approximately
89%. And in ELP, we've ramped up production there. If you factor out all the closed facilities and the started up
facilities, we're nearing – we're at much higher rates than we've been over the past few quarters in EWP.
In terms of pricing, we've been encouraged by what we've seen in EWP from the standpoint – that EWP normally does
like lumber and OSB. As housing has continue to improve over the past year or so, we've started to see gain traction in
EWP pricing. And while that will be lumpy going forward, we would expect that trend to continue going forward.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. In EWP pricing in terms of how we priced the product, we aren't seeing significant
change in the first quarter. It really is a function – the lower price realizations is really a function of mix in terms of the
actual sale of the products that are going in. That business does have a very wide product mix ranging from TJIs to
solid section to TimberStrand and Parallam. So, it's really a mix of moving that. Demand continues to be very good.
<Q - Ketan Mamtora>: Got you. Thanks and that's very helpful. And then just one last one, you've mentioned a
couple of times about weather. I was wondering if it is possible at this time to quantify what that impact could be in
Q1?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: No. It's difficult to do for Q1, because we're right in the middle of it. I am kind of just give
you a sense as every leader of every business that we had, came to me yesterday and gave me an update on exactly the
impact from weather. So whether it would be in our Timberland, whether it would be on our Wood Products operation,
Cellulose Fiber, all of those are experiencing some impact from weather. Just for lumber for example, we've already
lost 20 days in our lumber operation due to either the impact from frozen logs or impact from roads being closed or
whatever something freezing in one of our sawmills.
So, difficult to give any impact at this point. We did do that exercise for fourth quarter and I can tell you in our wood
products operations, which is where the impact was in the fourth quarter, that number was probably somewhere
between $3 million to $5 million in the fourth quarter and we'll be continuing to monitor the weather impact in the first
quarter. As Patty said, we are hopeful that is we move forward to the quarter that the weather improves and we can
make up some of the impacts that we've experienced over the last couple of weeks.
<Q - Ketan Mamtora>: Got it.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Chip.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Hey. Doyle, I know you haven't bit out there that long, but have they converted you into a
Seahawks' fan yet?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Absolutely, Chip. I'm fan number one. And [indiscernible] (47:49) is clearing the route for us.
So, we're excited about the Super Bowl and look at forward to the Seahawks prevailing.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Well, I think we're going to see 50 degrees at least some point Sunday. So, that's a relief. Hey,
first question is on looking at the land sales. You mentioned in the first quarter when you gave the guidance on the
Timberland, it was excluding the land sales. And I know there's two components, what you sell and what you transfer.
And I notice, I know the fourth quarter tends to be a big number and their first quarter is low. In 2013, that swing was
about $25 million. Should we kind of see that kind of a swing as well where it might go from $30 million in the fourth
of last year to something in the single-digits in this quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: I think the way to think about it, Chip, is we had $20 million in the fourth of 2013 and we
really wouldn't see much at all in the first quarter of 2014. So that's about a $20 million swing quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. And then could you give us some help on the interest expense you think you see for
the year and I know that you might have to qualify it given the WRECO situation, but I know it popped up in the fourth
quarter and as we expected, but what – should we annualize that number X what we think happens to WRECO or what
would you have us do?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, Chip, remember that in the fourth quarter, we had a loss on the early extinguishment
of debt, that was a Longview Timber debt and we put that loss in interest expense. So, be sure that as you look at on the
fourth quarter interest expense, you back out the $25 million early extinguishment that we called out for you as a
special item. Past that I think, you've got the debt, the interest rates I think are all and there's no change really there as
well. So, I think that, that will give you a pretty good guidance in terms of what to put in for the full-year of 2014, and
we don't have any maturities now coming due in 2014.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you, so $350 million to $355 million. And then on the – you mentioned real quickly on the
tax situation at least for the Black Liquor part, I would imagine that's all non-cash, is that right?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, we do have in terms of some refunds coming back in 2014. So, it wasn't cash in
2013, but in 2014 as a result of closing out some of those examinations, we do expect to get some refunds back, that's
one of the reasons why we have no cash taxes due in 2014 on a net basis.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay. And then the last thing is, you mentioned in the guidance on the Cellulose segment, a
little more maintenance, and I know that there a lot of moving parts as you go to a longer cycle for the mills, what, can
you give us some ideas to how that will unfold throughout the year, will therefore the example be very high or very

low-maintenance quarters that you can identify at this point?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. It will be lumpy, because it will depend on what we do in terms of the mills,
probably the biggest lumpiness will occur in our liquid packaging operation, because we do have some capital projects
to tie in later this year. I don't recall whether that's third quarter, but I think it is. So you will see some lumpiness
through the year. On a year-over-year basis other than that extended outage at Longview for that capital, it will be
pretty steady. There will be difference in terms of the mill, so where we take the maintenance. But the total amount will
be up a little bit because of the liquid packaging extended maintenance outage. Other than that, not much difference.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, in 2013 we had one mill that didn't have an outage. So, our New Bern mill didn't have
an outage. In 2014, we've got two mills that won't take an outage. And then, that will continue as we go through a full
cycle of implementation.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Yeah, thanks very much; a question and a comment. Just, on the question, have you – besides
EWP and distributions' hard cost savings targets by the end of the year, have you been able to put a more definitive
timeline on the $260 million that you identified on that in the New York – your New York Analyst Day in Lumber,
OSB, and Cellulose Fibers?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: And as I mentioned in December, we have set those targets. We will be working forward on
those, you'll start to see those – some of those bottom-line improvements as early as the first quarter of this year. And
then, we will give you updates on a periodic basis, probably on an annual basis, as to exactly where we are. So again,
we don't know if some of its capital intensive some of its not. We don't know the exact timing, but I can tell you we're
focused everyday on executing against those specific initiatives and those operational excellence targets that we set
forth. The other part of it that is near-term, just like EWP and distribution, is the SG&A cost savings, which we
indicated we would be at a run rate of $75 million lower by the end of this year and we're confident that we will in fact
achieve that.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Is there different modeling? Is there a range that you can give us for what you expect in 2014?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Well, I mean, I think the range would be the things that you've outlined, specific numbers on
EWP. There's specific numbers on distribution. There's specific numbers on SG&A. And then, again, you can – it's not
going to all be back end loaded in numbers. As we've said, it's going to be a 2 year, 3 year, 4 year process. There will
be some lumpiness, but there will be benefits that show up as early as the first quarter, and clearly by the end of 2014
we'll see some benefit. And again, the ultimate measures we said on December 17 is going to be our relative
performance versus the competition, and I'm confident you're going to see that improve going forward.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Paul, the other thing that I would just caution a little bit on modeling is remembering that
the cost target that we've given you – for example, in lumber our cost targets of lowering our cost net of logs. As you
know very well, the biggest percentage of cost in lumber is the log cost. So, log cost is continuing to escalate, which is
a good thing for us in terms of our Timberland business. But net-net to the lumber cost, if you were just looking at the
P&L, the cost net of logs on a per thousand board feet number should be lower, but the absolute number of cost will
fluctuate based upon log cost.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay, that's helpful. And just a clarification, Patty, you mentioned the Canadian pine beetle,
and I just wanted to point out that as far as I know the beetles don't have Canadian citizenship or [indiscernible]

And your last question will come from the line of Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.
<Q - Josh L. Zaret>: Doyle, in Timberland, in what you call international operations, which I assume is Uruguay,
you've shown dramatic revenue growth over the last several years to 2012, and then it fell 15% in 2013. So, a couple of
questions related to that. One, what caused the downdraft in revenue and, I guess, earnings? And two, are there plans –
if I'm right, it's Uruguay. Can you tell us where the state of the forest and the converting operations are in their plans to
double that revenue in the next whatever years? Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: So, I'll try to answer your – the second part of your question, and then ask Patty to deal with
the first. Uruguay, as you indicated, is the primary component of our international operation. We are focused on
continuing to grow trees there. As you may recall Josh, we just planted those trees not that many years ago. So, we're
not in the full harvest mode at this point in time. So, as time passes, we'll be able to generate additional revenue and
earnings off of those – off of that 300,000 – approximately 300,000 acres of land in Uruguay going forward.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And sure, Josh, the revenue in the international segment has fluctuated. It is only Uruguay
as we sit here today. It has included some China. It has included some other smaller pieces. So – and the other thing is
it from time-to-time has included some land sales in Uruguay as well. But as we sit here today, it is purely focused on
the Uruguayan operations and the end product that we produce there is lumber appearance or panel – appearance panel
that we – come out of there. The other thing that has been in international operations is we had a small joint venture in
Brazil, which also has now been curtailed since a year ago. So going forward, I think – and especially as panel markets
start to pick up, we will see some of that reverse.
<Q - Josh L. Zaret>: Okay. So, it's been consistent growth till last year. So, you believe that will be back on track. So,
could it have been land sales that caused that down or...?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It's likely the land sales. I don't have the detail of that in front of me. We would be happy
to take it offline and walk through it with you. There have been some land sales in Uruguay in the past. So, there's
some lumpiness that comes into that as well.
