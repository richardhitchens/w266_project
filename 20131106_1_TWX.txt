MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. third quarter 2013 conference call. My name is Richard, and I will be your operator
for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner.
Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's third quarter earnings conference call.
This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the third quarter and the other reaffirming our
2013 business outlook. Before we begin, there are two items I need to cover.
First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP
financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and
trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors.
Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that's
available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly

Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike. And thanks for listening in this morning.
We had another great quarter and are on track for another very successful year. In the third quarter, we grew adjusted
operating income 8%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 20% and we returned over $1.3 billion to our stockholders
through buybacks and our dividend. It was a very strong quarter from a financial perspective, and just as important, we
continue to perform at the top of our game operational and to lay the foundation for continued growth.
For example, at Turner we are seeing a significant payoff from the investments we've been making to bolster and
refresh our program. That was evident in advertising revenue, which was up double-digits again this quarter and it was
evident in ratings where TBS was the number two cable network in prime across adults 18-34 and 18-49 in the quarter.
The ongoing strength of The Big Bang Theory is a big part of that success, both in drawing audiences and as a
launching pad for original programming.
TBS recently renewed three of its originals, Sullivan & Son, Men at Work and Deal with It, for additional seasons. In
the fourth quarter, TBS is continuing to build out its lineup of original series with the launch of three new shows,
including a show called Ground Floor, that's a comedy from Warner.
TBS investment in Major League Baseball is also paying dividends. The National League Championship Series grew
primetime viewers by 14% over 2011, which is the last time it aired on TBS.
TNT has also continued to benefit from its investments in programming, finishing the quarter as the number two
network on cable among adults 25-54 in total dat. Its growing slate of hit originals included 4 of the top 10 scripted
shows on cable this quarter, Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies and Perception. Over the next month, TNT
will bring back Major Crimes and Boston's Finest and it will premier two new shows, Marshal Law: Texas, which is an
unscripted show from Jerry Bruckheimer, as well as the highly anticipated mini-series, Mob City from Frank Darabont.
Last week, the NBA also kicked off its regular season on TNT. That marks its 30th year with Turner. The season
opener between the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls was the second highest rated opening night in TNT history, and
Thursday night's doubleheader grew viewership by 14% over last season's first Thursday night telecast.
We are also continuing to make gains at CNN. This quarter, CNN grew total day ratings in its key demo by 15% while
its two principal competitors showed year-over-year declines. It finished ahead of MSNBC in both total viewers and
adults 25-54 for the second straight quarter. There is still lots of work to be done but CNN is showing real progress,
particularly in revamped programming blocks like the morning show where New Day drew viewership up almost 30%
over the year ago quarter.
Adult Swim is having a great year as well. It just finished the most watched quarter in its history, growing over 20%
with adults 18-34 in total day. It was the number one ad-supported cable network in total day among 18-34 year olds
for the 22nd straight time. And for the first time, it was also number one in primetime among adults 18-34.
Across the board, the Turner networks continue to deliver great value to our customers, our advertisers and our
distributors. That was evident in our recent affiliate renewal with another top distributor. During this affiliate renewal
cycle, we've now signed renewals with four of the top ten U.S. distributors, reinforcing our confidence in Turner's
ability to accelerate its domestic subscription revenue growth starting next year.
Turning to HBO, we are also benefiting from our investments in great programming. You don't have to take my word
for it, the rest of the industry is saying it for us. HBO won 27 primetime Emmy awards this year. That's the most of any
network for the 12th straight year. That included 11 awards for Behind the Candelabra and 5 for Boardwalk Empire,

making them the two biggest winners this year. And the distinctiveness and excellence of HBO's programming is
apparent in its subscriber trends, which have been very high, both here in the U.S. and around the world.
Outside the U.S., HBO is on track for another year of double-digit growth in subscribers and on that front, we recently
acquired the interesting HBO Asia and in HBO South Asia that we did not previously own. By wholly owning these
ventures we think HBO will be able to better capitalize on the growth opportunities in the region.
Let me turn to Warner Brothers, which is hitting on all cylinders. In television, Warners is once again supplying more
shows to the broadcast networks than any other studio. That includes the top two series on television, The Big Bang
Theory and The Voice, which are both seeing ratings growth over the last season. Beyond the broadcast networks, we
continue to see very strong demand from cable networks, SVOD services, and international territories for both originals
and off-net syndication.
Looking across cable and broadcast, Warner Brothers TV is producing 63 shows this season, that is up from 55 last
season. And that includes the highest number of returning series in more than 30 years. In syndication, Warners
benefited from the domestic cable sale of The Middle this quarter and added to its pipeline with the sale of Person of
Interest, which will premiere on cable in 2015.
At the film studio, Warners released two sleeper hits in the third quarter, The Conjuring and We're the Millers, which
have grossed over $300 million and $260 million respectively at the global box office.
Warners followed that up with the release of Gravity, which is a phenomenon both in terms of critical acclaim and
commercial success. As most of you know, Gravity set an October record for an opening weekend domestically and it
is on track to gross over $0.5 billion at the global box office. Thanks to those titles and other global hits like Man of
Steel and The Great Gatsby, Warner Brothers is number one at the domestic box office so far this year. And, of course,
the second installment in The Hobbit franchise will storm into theaters next month.
In September, Warner Brothers also took a major step in securing its franchise pipeline with the announcement of an
expanded creative relationship with J.K. Rowling. As the centerpiece of that relationship, she will write a series of
original films that revisit the magical world she created in the Harry Potter novels. Like the many millions of fans of
her great work, we are excited to see what new adventures Jo has in store for us.
Before I finish, let me take a minute to update you on the timing of the Time Inc. spin. Joe Ripp and his team have been
in place for a couple of months now and they're making great progress in preparing Time Inc. to become an
independently publicly traded company. We anticipate making the initial filing of our Form 10 in the next few weeks.
That should put us in a position to complete the spinoff during the second quarter of next year.
As many of you know, the separation of Time Inc. will be the culmination of the process we started over five years ago
to refocus Time Warner on being a pure play content company with an emphasis on video and television in particular. I
think you can see the positive impact that focus is having on our results.
At the same time, we know that capital allocation should be as important to stockholder returns as operational
excellence. So far this year, we have returned almost $4 billion to stockholders through share repurchases and
dividends and we remain committed to maintaining an efficient capital structure and to providing direct returns to our
stockholders going forward as well.
In closing, I'm really pleased with our results so far this year. We still have a lot of work to do, but I'm more confident
than ever in our strategic position and our ability to maintain attractive growth and returns for many years to come.
With that, I will turn it over to John for his final earnings call as our Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. John's
leadership has been a key ingredient to the success of Time Warner in recent years and I am confident that will
continue to be the case in his new role as CEO of Turner. John.

Thanks, Jeff, and good morning.
I will begin by referring to the first slide, which is now available on our website. Starting with our consolidated results,
we had another really great quarter. Off of flat revenues, adjusted income rose 8%, making this our most profitable
third quarter ever. That was mainly due to solid double-digit growth at the network segment and companywide adjusted
operating income margins expanded almost 180 basis points year-over-year, and that is the eighth time in the last nine
quarters that margins have expanded year-over-year. We have been able to do that by staying very, very focused on
cost and continued cost discipline has been critical to our ability to invest aggressively while also increasing margins
and it remains a significant focus for the company.
Adjusted EPS grew 20% in the quarter, and that marks the 13th out of the last 16 quarters that adjusted EPS has grown
double digits. And once again, we were able to grow adjusted EPS faster than adjusted operating income, and that was
helped by a lower effective tax rate as well as our ongoing share repurchase program.
The acceleration in our share repurchases this quarter is evidence of our continued commitment into providing returns
to stockholders. Year-to-date, we've returned almost $4 billion and that includes $3 billion in buybacks and $811
million in dividends. That's almost 25% more than we've returned during the same period in 2012, and it includes $1.2
billion in share repurchases since we last reported earnings.
Our year-to-date operating results have also been really, really good with adjusted operating income up 12% and
adjusted EPS up 25%, and that's despite an almost 300 basis point drag on growth in adjusted operating income from
Time Inc., and the inclusion of foreign exchange movements, as well as incremental equity losses associated with the
company's nearly 50% investment in CME.
Given the strength in these year-to-date results, let me just touch on our outlook for a moment, which calls for
mid-teens growth in adjusted EPS for the full year 2013, which we reaffirmed this morning. Just doing the math, that
implies a fourth quarter adjusted EPS to be about flat relative to last year, which is obviously a significant deceleration
from the first nine months of this year. And that's due largely to decisions that we've made about our programming
schedule, as well as related marketing spend at the network segment. I'll discuss that more in detail in a few minutes.
Our outlook for the fourth quarter also reflects very difficult comparisons at Warner Brothers, continued pressure at
Time Inc., and higher expected equity losses related to CME. And for the year, we now assume about a $0.10 negative
impact to adjusted EPS as a result of our equity accounting at CME, and that's an obvious disappointment.
But putting this all in perspective, we fully expect 2013 to mark the fifth consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS
growth, and it's going to be another record year for the company. So we feel really good about the underlying trends in
virtually all of our businesses. And with the momentum we saw in the third quarter, we've got even more confidence
about our ability to drive further growth in years to come.
So let me now turn to our Divisional Segment highlights, and let me begin with the Network Segment. Adjusted
operating income here in the third quarter was up a very strong 12%, and has been up double digits through the first
nine months of the year. Advertising revenues once again grew double digits, and that was largely due as a result of
very positive trends at both domestic entertainment as well as our international networks. Domestic advertising was up
high single digits in the quarter, and that included double-digit growth at the entertainment networks, which included
kids and young adults, and that was somewhat offset by a slight decline at domestic news.
International advertising increased high teens, despite a several hundred basis point drag from foreign exchange and
that reflected very healthy growth across all regions with particular strength in Latin America. And while it's somewhat
difficult to measure, we believe both domestic and international advertising trends were helped on a year-over-year
basis this year by the absence of the Olympics in the third quarter.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, scatter pricing at the entertainment networks is up double-digits over the upfront,
and we anticipate high-single-digit advertising growth at domestic entertainment, including Kids. Domestic news is
likely to be down double-digits year-over-year; however, and that's because of the comparison against the U.S.
Presidential election last year as well as ongoing softness in the news advertising marketplace in general.

Similarly, we are seeing a sequential deceleration in international advertising growth in the fourth quarter, and that is
owing partially to difficult comparisons against last year's fourth quarter, specifically in Latin America and Europe. So,
in total, we would expect advertising growth at Turner to be somewhere in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter,
when you take into consideration the ups and downs that I just went through.
Moving on, subscription revenue growth of 4% in Q3 was consistent with the mid-single-digit growth in the first half
of the year, and was perfectly in line with our expectations. A stronger U.S. dollar continues to weigh on growth here in
the quarter, and we expect that that is going to continue to be the case in the fourth quarter as well. However, we
continue to see healthy underlying subscriber dynamics in international territories, particularly in Latin America. And,
as Jeff just mentioned, Turner recently secured an affiliate renewal with an additional top 10 U.S. distributor. We've
also seen some encouraging subscriber trends at HBO, so we remain confident that we're going to see a real
acceleration in subscriber revenues beginning in 2014.
Adjusted operating income at the networks was up 12% in the quarter with margins increasing 220 basis points
year-over-year, and that's the sixth quarter in a row of margin expansion at this segment. In addition to network
segment revenue growth, margin expansion was helped by an extremely modest increase in expenses of less than 2% in
the quarter, and that was largely a result of the timing of programming spend, which was down versus last year's third
quarter.
Looking at the fourth quarter for a moment, we anticipate a pretty big year-over-year ramp in our original programming
investment and related marketing spend, and that's a result of more than an 80% increase in original episodes at Turner
as well as an increase in spending on both original series and original films at HBO.
We're also investing at CNN, and that is part of a strategic decision to broaden the programming beyond merely
breaking news and politics. Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown and Morgan Spurlock's Inside Man are two early efforts
in this area, and they are among two of CNN's highest-rated shows this year. Their success suggests that there are
meaningful opportunities for CNN beyond merely breaking news and politics. Programming investments such as these
will likely put some pressure on CNN's margins in the near-term, but they will also open up a new pool of advertisers
to CNN, and they could position the network for a return to attractive growth over time.
For the fourth quarter, there were just a couple of other items to keep in mind here at the Network segment. First, we
anticipate a drop in content revenue as a result of continued soft demand for catalog product and fewer home video
releases at HBO.
In addition, we recently acquired the remaining interest in HBO Asia and HBO South Asia, so we now own 100% of
each and will start consolidating for accounting purposes their operating results in the fourth quarter. This is part of an
ongoing effort to accelerate HBO's international growth and it leaves HBO Latin America group as the only significant
international HBO joint venture that we do not consolidate. The consolidation of HBO's properties in Asia will benefit
subscription revenue growth, but it's actually going to be a slight drag on operating profit in the fourth quarter, mostly
as a result of seasonality.
Together with HBO Nordic, which we started consolidating earlier this year for accounting purposes, we expect the
negative impact on adjusted operating income to be around $15 million for the fourth quarter and obviously these
ventures are still in investment phases, and we fully anticipate that they are going to pay off and become really
attractive investments for us over time.
Taking that all into account, we anticipate the Networks adjusted operating income will be approximately flat in the
fourth quarter of 2013, and that's obviously not a typical quarter for us from a year-over-year growth rate perspective,
which is why we wanted to share a little bit more detail with you.
Still with one quarter left to go, we remain absolutely on track for another year of margin expansion and some pretty
strong growth in adjusted operating income at the Networks Group. And with the investments we're making in these
businesses we are positioning ourselves to grow at very attractive levels for the foreseeable future.

Turning now to film and TV production at Warners, we knew coming into this year that we had very tough
comparisons in the second half of the year in both the third and fourth quarter. And in line with our expectations,
revenue was down 7% and adjusted operating income was down 8% in Q3. Year to date Warners is having a terrific
year and its adjusted operating income is still up double digits. Despite the declines in the quarter, we are very, very
pleased with Warners operating performance, and, as Jeff noted, some highlights, We're The Millers and The Conjuring
were both extremely successful releases at the box office.
On the TV side, the third quarter benefited from the domestic cable sale of The Middle, and we continue to see very
good demand for our product globally. This is evident in the number of new shows we have on broadcast this season
and the strong pricing we're getting when we are selling those shows in international territories.
Across theatrical and TV, Warner Home Entertainment revenue decline 9% in the quarter and that was principally due
to the timing of SVOD availability of The CW which shifted from Q3 to Q4 this year as a result of the later start of its
season.
In addition, we have seen some softness in home entertainment sales of our television products as of late, including
catalog. For the industry, however, home entertainment sales fell just slightly in the quarter, and they actually remain
up for the year and electronic sell-through grew more than 50% in the quarter and year to date for the industry, and we
think that's an extremely positive sign for the future of the home entertainment business, and we're focused on
improving the consumer experience in order to further accelerate the shift to digital ownership.
Looking ahead, Warners has very difficult comparisons against last year's fourth quarter, which happened to be an
all-time record quarter for Warner Brothers. Year-over-year growth may be tough but we expect profits to significantly
exceed the third quarter of this year, and we are off to a great start with the success of Gravity and we will also benefit
from the next Hobbit film. We will benefit from the recognition of The CW SVOD revenue and the games release of
Batman: Arkham Origins. So it should still be our biggest quarter of the year and among the largest ever for Warners in
terms of adjusted operating income. That's going to put Warners firmly on track to grow profits this year and
potentially have its best year ever. So we are quite pleased with that.
Moving over to Time Inc. Advertising revenue is down 2% in the quarter. Domestic print advertising increased, but
that was due largely to a shift of an issue of both People and Sports Illustrated into the third quarter from the fourth
quarter. Without this shift, domestic print ad revenue would've been up marginally in the quarter, but overall
advertising would have declined by over 3% and that is due to softness and non-magazine, as well as international
advertising. Subscription revenues also benefited by more than 200 basis points as a result of the additional issues in
the third quarter. Despite that, subscription revenue was down 4% in the quarter, and that was principally due to
continued softness in newsstand sales.
Looking ahead, we expect both advertising and subscription revenues to be negatively affected in the fourth quarter by
the shift of the issues that I just mentioned into the third quarter. In addition, the improvement in trends in domestic
print advertising that we experienced in the third quarter does not seem to be continuing yet in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted operating income was down 8% in Q3 as ongoing cost control efforts were not enough to offset the revenue
declines. Given the continued revenue pressure that we expect, we think adjusted operating income is going to be down
in the fourth quarter at Time Inc.
Let me move on and talk for a minute about free cash flow. 2013 is going to shape up to be an absolutely terrific year in
terms of free cash flow generation. Year-to-date, we've generated almost $2.9 billion of free cash. That is up almost
50% versus the same period in 2012 and is almost as much as we generated in all of last year. That is mostly due to the
strong growth in adjusted operating income as well as an expected improvement in working capital.
Capital expenditures and cash taxes are also lower year-to-date. The biggest drivers of the change in working capital
have been lower payments for certain licensed programs, the timing of sports programming payments, and higher
reimbursements from prior film co-financings. The decline in cash taxes was primarily a result of tax law extenders that
were passed by Congress in January of this year and that's been a positive for us all year. So with our solid performance
year-to-date, and with just a few months to go, we are fully on track for a really, really strong year in 2013 as it relates

to free cash flow.
Let me move on and talk for a minute about the balance sheet and net debt. We ended the third quarter with a little bit
more than $17.5 billion in net debt, that's up about $570 million from the end of last year. And that's mainly due to the
roughly almost $3.5 billion of capital returned to shareholders in the first nine months of the year through dividends
and share repurchases, and that includes an acceleration in our share repurchases in the quarter to almost $1.1 billion.
Consistent with recent years, the amount of capital returned significantly exceeds the free cash flow we generated
year-to-date.
On a transaction front, I do want to highlight that Warner Brothers entered into a multi-year agreement to co-finance as
many as 75 movies with RatPac-Dune Entertainment. Along with its existing co-financing arrangement with Village
Roadshow, we think this provides Warner's with very attractive flexibility to manage the risk of its film slate while
optimizing its return on investment. So we feel really good about that and we are pleased with that development.
Leverage remains steady at about 2.3 times, that's a little bit below our target of 2.5 times and that is despite the
acceleration in our share repurchase program that occurred during the quarter. That was a result of the continued strong
free cash flow generation that I just mentioned a few minutes ago.
So that concludes my remarks. With that, let me turn it back over to Mike and we will start the Q&A portion of the call.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, John. Richard, can we please start the Q&A. As a reminder to the analysts, if you could, please limit yourself
to one to two questions to allow us to get to more people. Richard?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question online comes from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks, good morning. Question for either or both of you on John's move down to
Turner, the businesses is obviously performing very well, but I'd love to hear more about what you think the big
opportunities are beyond what we all know about on the affiliate fee side. What are you thinking about changes in
programming, efficiencies on the cost side, some of the momentum in CNN, the international opportunities, what are
the things that, John, you and your team are going to be focused on as you head down to that business?
And then, on CME, just any comments on your plans there and what the carrying value of that asset is now? There's
been a lot of focus on that this week in the news. Thanks.
<A - John K. Martin>: Hey, Ben, it's John. Listen, it's a little early to start talking about my new role at Turner since it
does not begin until January first, so please be sensitive and appreciate that. But look, I am really excited. This is a
great opportunity for me to work with great people and great brands. And look, I think we here believe that as the
television ecosystem evolves, the big brands are going to continuing to get stronger and that's going to come as weaker
and less developed brands are going to be more and more difficulty in surviving and succeeding.
So we are playing from an advantaged hand and we are going to be operating two of the most profitable networks in the
world with TBS and TNT. They've got huge programming budgets. We want to attract the very best projects we can.
We want to delight the viewers; we want to maintain our position right at the very top of the cable networks universe.
We see opportunities, frankly, in lots of places. We see them in general entertainment, I think Adult Swim is a huge
opportunity, I think truTV, under the new leadership of Chris Linn who came over from Viacom's MTV, you are going
to see a completely refreshed lineup of programming sometime in 2014. It's going to be much better.

I think with CNN, there is opportunities, just to go back to what I even said in my prepared remarks, I think CNN and
with the experimentation that Jeff and the leadership team did there with some shows like Anthony Bourdain, Morgan
Spurlock, some of the movies that they've put on that have attracted younger audiences, bigger audiences, that
complemented with the unparalleled news breaking capabilities is demonstration that it's reinforcing the value to the
affiliates and consumers. And increasingly we want to reinforce the value to the advertisers, so I'm really excited on
working with a world-class team and, obviously, the world-class team up here, and we see bright days ahead.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: You asked about CME.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yes.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: And CME has disclosed being a public company. We are in discussion about a capital
transaction, including a potential loan to CME. We have confidence in the new management. We think CME has very
interesting long-term opportunities, but we're only going to engage in a transaction there if it is fair for our
shareholders. And certainly it has to be fair to theirs. So, while there is no guarantee we will come to an agreement, we
have been and remain very interested in what CME might do and, yes, it's had some difficult performance recently, but
we think that the market is a very interesting opportunity because of the markets they are in.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you both.

Our next question online comes from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Jeff and one for John. Jeff, let me just ask you about HBO
and the Comcast test you guys are running, over the many years you guys have always said HBO's real opportunity is
the 70 million people who don't pay for HBO, and you also said that people who watch HBO like to watch a lot of TV.
So, given those two data points, how are you thinking about the test that Comcast is running? And I have one for John.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: You are asking about this new kind of smaller bundle of internet service with HBO video, is
that's what you're asking?
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Right, exactly.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah. Well, it's a new offer. It's fairly targeted. It's a pretty limited video offering, not in the
sense of HBO, which is a fantastic video and broadband offering. So it won't probably be attractive for most people, but
it might be, as I think you are asking, something that appeals to a segment.
We've always thought that it makes sense, and we've done this for 30 years at HBO, to try to work with distributors to
make packages that make HBO available to every group of basic or wireline connected subscribers. So that is an
interesting thing for HBO. It could be an effective way to reach the 8 million or 10 million homes with broadband that
don't have multichannel TV.
The only thing we'd add is, great, we're interested, we're supportive. I think what we've all got to see is whether there is
an interest – because there's another, as you mentioned, 60 million or 70 million basic TV subs, many of whom would
like to have HBO, and there may be ways to get – there are places where the penetration of HBO would naturally be
much higher in the basic video households. And so HBO is working hard with some key distributors on that.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: And is that opportunity gated by your affiliate deals, like, do you have to work
through new HBO affiliate deals to give you more flexibility?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: No, no, no gating at all. Affiliates can all create all kinds of – whatever packages that they
really think would be attractive to subscribers, whether the subs have basic cable and want a better premium offer or
whether they are not video subs and they are broadband subs, and they want a video offer that has HBO.

<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay, thanks, Jeff. And let me ask, John, SVOD, you flagged The CW timing.
When you look at the year-over-year change in SVOD for you guys, do you expect it to be up for the year, and if so,
what kind of percentage growth do you see in SVOD this year?
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Michael. Look, year-to-date we booked about $200 million of SVOD revenue, and
last year, we had about $350 million. We already expect, because of The CW pushing out into Q4, we already know
there's a good chunk of money coming in that will be recognized and booked in Q4 as well. That, plus deals that we see
in the pipeline, probably mean we will be comparable year-over-year, with a little bit of luck, maybe a little bit of
upside, but probably not a hell of a lot.
But we continue to be encouraged by the breath of SVOD providers that we're doing business with. If you just think
about the amounts booked to date, two-thirds of that are coming from outside of the U.S. It is disproportionately TV,
and Netflix only represents half of our overall booked revenues. So there is a lot of players that are increasingly
interested in the SVOD window, and we continue to see it as a real opportunity.
So we are confident. It's going to continue to be a significant revenue stream for us again this year, it may even grow,
as I just mentioned. But I do want to just mention and keep in perspective that it's still a very, very small percentage of
our overall revenue, and even Warner's revenue. Warners is a massive scale studio. It's only around 10% of our TV
syndication revenue last year, and it's just 3% of our total film and TV revenue. So it might be more important for some
of the other players in this space if we make great shows and we sell them to lots of different players in lots of different
windows, and we'll continue to look at how to optimize the control of these assets so that we can maximize their value
going forward.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay, thanks, John.

Our next question online comes from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. A couple of questions. Jeff, you talked about the increasing focus on
originals at Turner again, and I just had a question on the movie side so we could gauge that trend line. In the third
quarter, TNT viewership was down a bit. I think – it seemed to us that it was from the movie category, not the
originals; those performed well. So first, is that right? And second, is the decline in movies due to a secular trend, was
that due to mix of movies, was it more library or just new movie avails not as strong? I just want to make sure we're
gauging that trend correctly.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: All right, let's do movies first. There's not a secular trend really in movies. That bounces around
depending on which movies that you have on in a given quarter. If you are asking about TNT, it gets into what avails of
our series are on. We've had very strong performance in our original series on TNT. I think four out of the top five go
on in the third quarter of our series on all cable were on TNT. So was your question about other parts of the
programming or is it -
<A - John K. Martin>: Was it a cost question, Doug, or a strategy question?
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Well, it's actually -
<A - John K. Martin>: Because we said the cost of movies is just going down, and it's going to continue to go down
as we move more money and reallocate it over to originals. Movies will still be an important part of the programming
schedule, as Jeff said, because we got a lot of hours to fill, 24 by 7, and they tend to be a little bit more economic, and
some movies can still generate large audiences. But as we've said, we've made a strategic decision to back away from
some of the real top theater movies and to go to more that you can play with repeat performances on more of an
evergreen basis.
But directionally, if you think of the three buckets of programming between sports, originals and acquired, sports
obviously of huge importance, we remain committed. We've got long-term deals with almost all of our sports partners.

Originals are going to be going up, they're going to maintain a larger percent of the schedule, and then on the acquired
side, emphasizing more the TV series and somewhat deemphasizing movies.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Got it. And then, Jeff and John, you both mentioned increasing confidence in strong
Turner affiliate fee growth next year. Is that still specifically at the high single digit level for domestic Turner that you
expressed previously?
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, for next year, we would anticipate it being close to double digits next year, domestic
affiliate fees at Turner, yeah. Same thing, no change.

Our next question online comes from miss Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you. I had a couple of HBO questions. I guess to start, you mentioned the Emmy
wins, which were phenomenal. How do you benefit from that? Do you think it affects subscriber growth or is it in
home video ultimately?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Jessica, it's a little indirect, but really important, if you look at it over time. So if you have
recognition, not just in the Emmys but also in press reviews, it allows you to take break-through programming that is
not the kind of broad-reach in every case traditional ad-supported programming, and allow viewers to find it. And so
you build these hits with subscribers that make it efficient from a marketing point of view.
It then does a very important thing, which it attracts huge writer, director, and actor talent that work in films to work in
television. And what you've seen with HBO starting it more than 10 years ago is a very vibrant creative kind of
highway between the film business and the television network business. That has enlivened HBO and a lot of its
competition. And what it does, it just brings – because HBO gets first pick got a lot of these things, it brings a
tremendous range and quality of projects that makes premium TV always more relevant, more powerful, and then to
your question, that means it supports subscriber bases here and around the world. It supports content sales increasingly
now in video and broadband, and so the whole thing just picks up momentum, and that's essentially how it works.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Okay. And then just maybe moving overseas, which has obviously been a focus of growth
for you guys. Can you talk a little bit about how much more investment you think you need to either grow the business
or buyout some partners, and also maybe you could talk a little bit about where you see the upside in various regions.
For example, I think you just launched in India. So any more color outside the U.S.?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah. Well, the main investments are behind us, because we bought, as we said the rest of the
HBO networks in Europe, Asia and South America. We have one partner who we've had all along in Latin America
and we are happy with that arrangement. So we don't need a lot of investment on the HBO side. We are not behind
things, we're just essentially expanding our programming, expanding our activities.
We have launched in a few countries, as we referenced in the formal remarks, in Scandinavia and the Netherlands. We
are launching add-on services in India. We think that's a good market. But these things by and large don't take a lot of
investment. They are basic line extensions. That's on the HBO side.
On the Turner side, our strongest position is in Latin America. I think everyone knows we made a pretty good
acquisition, two of them actually. The Claxson networks in Argentina, which are essentially Pan Latin America basic
networks across many genres, and the Chilevision free to air network in Chile. We can build on the Turner side in some
countries with investments in terms of acquiring networks that may be there. But that is not something where it is a
clear – put it this way, most of our investment essentially is in the operations, programming and expansion of what we
have, not acquisition of other companies.

<A - John K. Martin>: And I think, Jessica, if your question also was in my remarks where I said that through the
acquisition of Asia and South Asia, it would put somewhat of a drag on near-term earnings. If that's what the
investment that you're referring to, that is true for fourth quarter, that coupled with Nordic means that the impact
overall to Time Warner this year on an adjusted operating income basis is probably about $25 million, $30 million
bucks lost. I would expect that to improve beginning next year. In other words, Asia and South Asia we would expect
to cross-over breakeven and actually contribute to earnings next year. And Nordic will probably be in and around
comparable to this year. So it should get better beginning next year?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Remember, we've been saying and we still are, we're going to hit $1 billion in adjusted network
operating income in the next couple of years. And we're still on track for that. That's a tremendous growth ramp for us.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thank you.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thank you, operator. I mean thanks, Jessica. Can we go to the next question, operator.
Operator
Yes, our next question in line comes from Mr. Richard Greenfield from BTIG Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich S. Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on Michael's Nathanson's
question. While you don't expect many people to take a broadband tier with broadcast as well as HBO, if it actually did
take off you have a lot of basic cable networks, and then obviously that wouldn't be great for your basic cable net
distribution. Just wondering, from a technical standpoint, how big can Comcast – forget about Comcast. How big could
any MVPD make a tier like what Comcast has just done before that tier would have to get all of your basic channels?
Essentially, at what point does the penetration have to hit before all your big networks, like TBS and TNT have to be
part of what the consumer offering is?
And then just a second – a quick question on CW. How important is The CW long-term to your company? We've got
the Tribune, which is the number one CW station group has evolved into more of an entertainment company. I'm just
curious how important wedded you are to that CW 50% stake?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: All right, so, Rich, thanks. We're not going to talk about our provisions and our contracts on our
package requirements. But I know you're asking basically that. It's really something that we don't have to be concerned
about on this near move. Let's just go to the likely facts.
If there's viability and consumer attractiveness, which is the premise of your question, for people are trying to get
basically a more focused, a more valuable, and maybe a less expensive basic cable package, our channels are going to
be in there by consumer demand in order to make it happen.
I mean, we have – of all the network groups in the United States, we have the highest proportion of networks among
the top 40. We also have the highest proportion of our affiliate fees from our biggest networks. About 85% of our fees
come from our top four. They are all basically wide reach, widely-demanded networks, and so if you are going to have,
to your question, any kind of really substantial take up of, let's call it a, "Best of Cable," type of a package, our
networks will be in there. If there was some – if we were wrong about it, our contracts would handle that issue. So, I'm
not going to go more specific than that on it.
If you go to The CW, it's been basically something where if you put the economics together of our show production
and the network, it's a pretty valuable generator of asset value and income, even current income. So it's a good platform
for the company, and it's been a significant part of our talent relations to create a working relationship with some of the
younger talent that makes a lot of the cutting edge programming that goes not just to The CW, but it goes from Warner
series production into the five broadcast nets, and increasingly into the cable networks, who are buying more, and as
you know, we not only supply TNT, TBS, truTV, we also have some critical shows at a lot of the other cable networks.
So it's all, to our mind it's been a very successful venture.
<Q - Rich S. Greenfield>: Thank you. That was really helpful.

Operator
Yes, our next question online comes from Alexia Quadrani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you. Just a question on your leverage already being a bit below your target and
expectations for continued very strong free cash flow. What are your priorities, and what do you think about your
balance sheet next year and your use of cash going forward? Could we see even a further acceleration of buyback?
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah. So, thanks, Alexia, for the question. You know, our approach towards our capital
structure and capital allocation more broadly has been pretty consistent now for the past six years since Jeff's been the
CEO and, it's a balanced approach.
After fully investing in all of our organic investment projects we look at three additional ways to provide value. The
first is – and this is in order of priority. The first is M&A, where we try to look for things in a disciplined way to
advantage our existing competitive positions and grow value. And there, over the last five or six years, we've only
spent about $3 billion in M&A, mostly in international cable. And that is not by design, that's just based on the
attractiveness of the projects. So, you should probably think that there has been somewhat of a limited number of
attractive targets that have presented themselves, but that may not necessarily hold into the future.
The second is the dividend, which we've raised each of the last four years double-digits on an annual basis. And the
third is the buyback program, which we've been using very opportunistically, and frankly, we are quite pleased with the
results and the allocation of capital there. And at a long-term target leverage ratio of 2.5 times, we think that today that
optimizes the capital structure and minimizes the weighted average cost of capital and appropriately, balances our
access to the capital markets at attractive pricing at the same time retaining strategic flexibility.
We will always continue to evaluate that, in terms of the right level, but we think 2.5 times now still is right. And, yes, I
mean, given the strong free cash flow generation that the company has had, it obviously increases our options for use of
capital and use of cash.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: And just to follow-up on the comment that I think you made earlier about expecting some
deceleration in international advertising growth in the fourth quarter, is that simply a comp issue that you highlighted or
are you also seeing anything else there?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Look, international is up high-teens in the third quarter. If you did not have a foreign exchange
headwind it would be up above 20%. And that included double-digit increases in both entertainment and news,
particularly strong in Latin America. But, we just don't see that kind of year-over-year trend continuing into the fourth
quarter.
Some of it is the result of that was pretty high ad growth in the third quarter benefiting from our Olympic comps in the
third quarter. The secular dynamics are positive, particularly in emerging markets. And so, we feel very good about
them on a long-term trajectory. They just aren't going to be as high as that in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question please.

Our next question in line comes from Mr. John Janedis from UBS. Please go ahead.

do to re-accelerate domestic growth away from the renewal cycle you've spoken to?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: I am not sure what you're talking about in terms of moderation. HBO is having a great year in
domestic subscribers, and a very huge year overseas as well. If you're asking about the mix, sometimes our sub growth,
depending on the affiliate, is weighted towards either Cinemax subs or basically incentive subscribers that are over and
above the penetration targets we have in our deals.
What happens with those is they end up creating a sub base, it becomes a very strong platform for HBO's partnership
with the distributor as they work out wholesale rates, and penetration and marketing plans into the next year. So, HBO
is having – actually, I think it's the strongest year in domestic subs in many years this year.
<Q - John Janedis>: All right, so no change in trend?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Well, the trend in domestic sub growth is up, so the change is an increase.

Our next question online comes from Mr. Michael Morris from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two topics. First, just back on the investment in HBO
internationally. Can you help us with just the size of that business? Can you share the revenue that's generated by the
Asian assets that you acquired? And also, if you look at that relative to the size of the Latin American business that you
don't currently consolidate, how much bigger is Latin America than Asia? And how do you think about – where are you
in the potential of being able to have a similar transaction for Latin America? And then, I have one follow-up on
CETV. Thanks.
<A - John K. Martin>: Mike, it's John. I don't have the break out of the international HBO investments in front of me.
We can do that offline. I mean, overall, regardless of the accounting, HBO is about $1 billion of revenue.
Internationally, Latin America is the single largest asset, whether that's 30 or 40%, I just don't know off the top of my
head. It's been growing the fastest, though.
And as far as the ability to buy out the partner, I think we own 89% of HBO Latin America today. And the reason why
we don't consolidate has to do more with certain governance rights as compared to ownership. So, I think in terms of
the operational management, day-to-day control, the HBO management team has been exercising that now for some
time, and it's one of the reasons why the asset has been performing so well.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: Okay, thanks. And then, just on CETV, it seems that you're expecting about a $0.05 drag in
the fourth quarter, I believe, just based on what you've done year-to-date there. Is that accurate? And then, is that based
on expectations just for the financial performance of that business going forward or is there something – what I am
trying to figure out is, as I look forward, whether that includes any sort of incremental loss or cost, or whether that's
sort of indicative of the run rate of what you're seeing at that business? Thanks.
<A - John K. Martin>: I'm not sure what your question means, Mike. I mean, we do straight equity accounting on
CETV, and we recognize 49.9% of their net operations.
So, year-to-date through the nine months, it's been about an $0.08 drag this year versus a $0.04 drag last year. Looking
at the fourth quarter, based on their public guidance, it'd be about another $0.02. So we're anticipating about a total
$0.10 drag this year versus $0.04 last year. So that will dimension it.
<Q - Mike C. Morris>: Okay. So, $0.02 in the fourth quarter, and it's all simply just operating results from the
company. There's nothing else?

Operator
Okay. Our last question online comes from Vasily Karasyov from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Thank you. Good morning. My question is on CNN, John. I think a year or two ago, the
conventional wisdom was that no matter what the ratings are doing, the network is still a steady contributor to adjusted
operating income. But, given that you're mentioning incremental investment in programming there, my question is:
one, is the network operating income down year-on-year so far in 2013? And then, how should we on the outside be
judging the progress at CNN outside of ratings, perhaps?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Are you talking about CNN?
<Q - Vasily D. Karasyov>: Yeah, CNN.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Okay. The ratings are up.
<A - John K. Martin>: Do you want me to do the financials and then you can comment on the strategy?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah.
<A - John K. Martin>: So look, financially, we don't break out network-by-network, our financials. I will tell you,
directionally, CNN's operating income this year is down. And that is because of proactive decisions that have been
made by Jeff Zucker and the new team there to try to invest in the programming in many day parts, and you are seeing
the benefits of that show up often in the ratings. Those are active decisions made by management as opposed to having
it done to them. And going forward, we're going to continue to evaluate what the right level of investment is for CNN.
The expectation is going to be on a multiyear basis, this thing is going to go back to growth, absolutely.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah, it's not a trend.
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, it's not a sustainable trend.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: So, let me add, it's still early, but the moves that we've had, and you can see them on air, and
you can see them in the ratings, is that the new leadership and a lot of the new programming lineup moves are off to a
great start. The morning show, some of the primetime shows, they're up considerably. If you look at the breaking news
events this year, it's been very evident that CNN has been the leader, both in ratings and quality.
And at the same time, as John said and he just said it again, we are broadening the purview of coverage to keep viewers
tuning in during slower new cycles to cover some areas of cultural and civic events that are of interest to people of all
ages. That's the kind of thing you see with some of our new morning show segments, with some of Anthony Bourdain's
shows, and some other shows we've put on. We've also added some news analysis with the Crossfire rebirth. and we're
going to be investing more, both in talent and shows to get that done.
So, we just think that this is a good time to capitalize, really, on the positions CNN has. Nobody is saying enough – and
we should make sure we're not guilty of this. We are not, any of us, focusing enough on digital. Digital is a huge part of
the future of news. CNN is the world leader in digital. If we were talking about any other programming genre, everyone
would be all over the digital story. News, they should be even more focused on that. That's another key focus for CNN.
It's a major area of strength for the company, both here against its domestic rivals where it leads pretty strongly in
online news, and globally. And so, that is part of the reason why we're investing.
