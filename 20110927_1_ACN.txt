MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Accenture's fourth quarter fiscal 2011 earnings
call. [Operator Instructions] I'd also like to remind you that today's conference is being recorded.
I'll now turn the conference over to K.C. McClure, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
[0C2H3K-E K.C. McClure]
Thank you, Kathy, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2011 earnings
announcement. As Kathy just mentioned, I'm K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today
are Pierre Nanterme, our Chief Executive Officer; and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth
quarter and the full year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our marketing position and progress against our
growth strategy. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2012. And then we
will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking. And you should keep in mind that
these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include,
but are not limited to, general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed
under the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com.
As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
[009LZH-E Pierre Nanterme]
Thank you, K.C, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. It's a pleasure to be here today to present the excellent results for
Q4 and the full fiscal year. I'm extremely pleased to report that we met or exceeded our business outlook for all of our
key metrics, from revenues and bookings to profitability and cash flow.
Here are a few highlights. We delivered record new bookings of $8.4 billion for the quarter and $28.8 billion for the
year. Revenues for the quarter increased 14% in local currency to $6.7 billion, with all five operating groups delivering
double-digit growth. Full-year revenues increased 15% in local currency to $25.5 billion, a new record. Earnings per
share for the quarter were $0.91, a 38% increase over Q4 last year.
For the full year, earnings per share were a record $3.40, up 28% over fiscal year 2010. We expanded operating margin
for both the quarter and the full year. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion for the quarter and $3 billion for the
full year, exceeding the top end of our annual range by more than $300 million.
We continue to have a rock-solid balance sheet, with a cash balance of $5.7 billion. We continue to return cash to
shareholders, with more than $2.8 billion in share repurchases and dividend payments during the year. And we just
announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share, which is a 50% increase over our prior dividend.
Clearly, we are executing and delivering extremely well across all dimensions of our business.
Now Pam will review the numbers in greater detail; Pam, over to you.
[004YT1-E Pamela Craig]
Thank you, Pierre. Thank you all for joining today.
I am pleased to tell you more about Accenture's fiscal year 2011 fourth quarter and full-year financial results. As Pierre
just said, we delivered records across the board, including very strong year-over-year revenue growth across the
dimensions of our business overall in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year.
In addition to the strong earnings results, which reflected the highest annual EPS we've ever achieved, we also met or
beat all of the elements in our original fiscal year 2011 annual business outlook a year ago, including records for new
bookings, free cash flow, and operating margin. As we look ahead into fiscal 2012, we are pleased with our progress in
building market share, and how we are positioned to drive our business forward.
Unless I state otherwise, all figures are GAAP except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are
calculations.
New bookings for the fourth quarter were a record $8.4 billion, and reflect a positive 9% foreign exchange impact,
compared with new bookings in the fourth quarter last year. Consulting bookings were a record $4.2 billion and
represented a book-to-bill of 1.1. And outsourcing bookings were $4.3 billion, the highest in over seven years.
New bookings for the full fiscal year were also a record at $28.8 billion, above the upper end we signaled in June of the
$25 billion to $28 billion range that we had all year. These bookings reflect a foreign exchange impact that turned out
to be 400 basis points better than we had originally assumed a year ago, positive 3%, compared with new bookings for
fiscal 2010. Consulting bookings for fiscal 2011 were $15.4 billion and outsourcing bookings were $13.4 billion.
Now let me give you some detail on these record high bookings in the fourth quarter. In Management Consulting,
bookings reflect client demand for our services to optimize their top line growth and drive operational efficiency.

Demand continues for improving sales and marketing effectiveness to support our clients' growth strategies. We see
strong activity for projects that deliver cost takeout, both near term and structural. And we are helping our clients
design and implement global operating models as they endeavor to expand their global footprints.
In Technology Consulting, clients continue to value our independence and track record in seeking strategic help to
plan, transform, and streamline global IT operations and to leverage and exploit new technology waves, including the
cloud. System integration bookings continued to reflect strong demand for ERP in response to business trends for
globalization, regulation, and operational efficiency. We are supporting clients in their global expansion and complex
integration programs and to extend their ERP systems to achieve better data management and analytics. We are also
seeing an uptick in demand in new technologies for digital and social, for growing needs in integrated mobile
platforms, and for software as a service.
Turning to Outsourcing, in technology outsourcing demand remains strong as our clients continue to focus on reducing
the costs of their legacy systems and on consolidating the number of IT vendors they use. Through our continuously
improving Global Delivery Network, we are better and better equipped to respond to clients' needs for both complex
and cost-effective delivery. As many of our clients, we are expanding our relationships into more longer-term
committed relationships for maintenance, development, and enhancements.
BPO bookings in Q4 were very strong and the highest in 12 quarters as we have growing demand for both horizontal
offerings in finance and accounting and procurement, aided in part by our Ariba Sourcing acquisition earlier in the
year, as well as industry specific offerings in resources, communications and high-tech, and health and public service.
In summary, we had a bookings quarter that was strong across both consulting and outsourcing, with $100 million, or
more in bookings at 10 clients around the world.
Now turning to revenues, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.7 billion, an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and
14% in local currency from the same period last year, reflecting a foreign exchange impact of positive 9%. These
revenues were above our guided range of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, a range that had assumed a foreign exchange
impact of positive 8%. Adjusting for actual exchange rates, we were about $40 million higher than the top end of the
range we provided in June. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.9 billion, an increase of 25% in U.S. dollars
and 16% in local currency. And Outsourcing revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 13% in
local currency.
Net revenues for the full fiscal year were $25.5 billion, an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency.
Consulting revenues for the full year were $14.9 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency.
And Outsourcing revenues were $10.6 billion, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency.
We saw revenue growth across all of our operating groups in the fourth quarter. Resources revenues grew 18% in local
currency. This revenue growth was driven by ERP and global operating model programs in many parts of the globe,
with particularly high growth in our priority emerging geographic markets. Revenue growth was primarily driven by
Consulting, with Outsourcing revenue growth lower. This trend is expected to continue for the near term.
The Products operating group had local currency revenue growth of 16%, driven by strong, and well-balanced growth
in both consulting and technology offerings across the products industry around the world. Our core ERP
transformation offerings continue to be the backbone of our revenue. In addition, Products revenues reflected continued
growth for operational effectiveness, supply chain, CRM, and an uptick in analytics.
In Financial Services, revenues grew 13% in local currency; and reflected strength in both types of work, particularly
for technology outsourcing. Clients continued to invest in replacing their core systems, in initiating more cost reduction
projects, and in improving operational effectiveness. Growth was also driven by global operating model programs and
post-merger integration projects.
Communications and high-tech revenues also increased 13% in local currency and reflected very strong outsourcing
growth, driven by clients' continued focus on improving their operations, particularly in supply chain, procurement, and
finance. Consulting revenues reflect a focus on operational effectiveness, improving customer service, and supporting

the launch of new products and services.
I would also like to note that on September 1st, we renamed this operating group Communications Media and
Technology. The three industries that make up the operating group, Communications, Electronics and High Tech, and
Media and Entertainment, remain the same.
Finally, Health and Public Service revenues increased 12%, driven by strong growth in our health offerings, including
health administration and electronic medical records. Our growth in H&PS overall was also positively impacted by
better delivery efficiency, compared to last year. As we have mentioned in previous quarters, our repositioning in
public service continues to progress.
I'm extremely pleased with the net revenue results we stepped up and delivered in fiscal 2011.
Moving down the income statement, let me run through the components of operating income. For the fourth quarter,
gross margin was 33.1%, compared with 34% in the same period last year, a decrease of 90 basis points. Gross margin
for the full year was 32.9%, compared to 33.6% in fiscal 2010, a decrease of 70 basis points.
Sales and marketing costs for the fourth quarter were $821 million, or 12.3% of net revenues, compared with $698
million, or 12.9% of net revenues in the same period last year, a decrease of 60 basis points. And sales and marketing
costs for the full year were $3.1 billion, or 12.1% of net revenue, compared with $2.7 billion, or 12.3% of revenue in
fiscal 2010, a decrease of 20 basis points.
General and administrative costs for the fourth quarter were $472 million, or 7.1% of net revenues, compared with
$433 million, or 8% of net revenues in the same period last year, a decrease of 90 basis points. And G&A costs for the
full year were $1.8 billion, or 7.1% of net revenues, compared with $1.7 billion, or 7.7% of net revenues in fiscal 2010,
a decrease of 60 basis points.
This all resulted in operating income for the fourth quarter of $923 million, reflecting a 13.8% operating margin,
compared with $714 million, or 13.2% operating margin for the same period last year, a 60 basis point expansion. I was
pleased with the profitability delivered in the fourth quarter and note particularly the improved profitability in products.
Full-year operating income of $3.5 billion reflected a 13.6% operating margin, compared with $2.9 billion, or a 13.5%
operating margin for fiscal 2010 and within our guided range of operating margin of 13.6% to 13.7%.
As a reminder, we manage our business to operating margin, and manage a number of levers. Throughout the year, we
worked the level and mix of our cost of delivery and sales, so that in the fourth quarter, we achieved operating margin
expansion of 60 basis points. At the same time, we continued to make investments in people and initiatives to fuel
strong growth over the year. We were pleased with our continued progress in managing G&A costs at a growth rate
lower than revenues, and with our delivery, as we finished out this year of the modest margin expansion we had
originally aimed for.
Below operating income, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 27%. The year-to-date effective tax rate was
27.3%, in line with our annual guidance range of 27% to 28%.
Net income for the fourth quarter was $683 million, compared with $510 million in the same period last year. For the
full year, net income was $2.6 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in fiscal 2010, also a record this year at an increase
of 24%.
Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.91, compared with $0.66 in the same period last year, an increase of
38%. The $0.25 increase is made up of $0.14 from higher revenue and operating income in local currency, $0.06 from
favorable foreign exchange rates, $0.02 from a lower effective income tax rate, $0.02 from a lower share count, and
$0.01 from higher non-operating income.
For the full fiscal year, diluted earnings per share were $3.40, compared with $2.66 in fiscal 2010, an increase of 28%
and at the top end of our guided range of $3.36 to $3.40. The $0.74 increase is made up of $0.42 from higher operating
income in local currency, $0.11 from a lower share count, $0.09 from a lower effective income tax rate, $0.08 from
favorable foreign exchange rates, and $0.04 from higher non-operating income.

Turning to some other key operational metrics, we hired 70,000 people in fiscal 2011 and ended the year with a global
head count of about 236,000 people. Our Global Delivery Network grew from 116,000 people at the beginning of the
fiscal year to 141,000 people at the end. In Q4 our utilization was 85%, flat with Q3 and in line with our targeted level.
Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 14%, compared to 15% in Q3.
Now let's touch on our cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a record $1.24 billion, an increase of $90 million
over the same period last year, resulting from cash from operating activities of $1.38 billion net of property and
equipment additions of $137 million. For the full fiscal year, free cash flow of $3.04 billion was also a record high and
about $340 million above the top end of our previously guided range, as DSOs were better than we expected. This
reflected cash from operating activities of $3.44 billion net of property and equipment additions of $404 million.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 30 days, down from 32 days in the third quarter and flat with the
end of last fiscal year. This metric continues to reflect the strong financial discipline of our people around the world.
Turning to cash, our cash balance at August 31 was $5.7 billion, compared with $4.8 billion at August 31 last year.
Now an update on how we are returning cash to shareholders; in the fourth quarter we've repurchased or redeemed 13.1
million shares for $731 million at an average price of $55.85 per share, including 11 million shares repurchased in the
open market. For the full year, we repurchased or redeemed 42.8 million shares for $2.2 billion at an average price of
$50.79 per share, including about 24 million shares repurchased in the open market.
In fiscal 2011 we delivered on our commitment of returning cash to shareholders through the more than $2.8 billion in
share repurchases and dividend payments we made during the fiscal year. Our weighted average diluted shares came
down more than 3% over the fiscal year. Since our IPO, we have returned a total of 91% of free cash flow generated to
shareholders. During this time, we have also seen our public float increase from 14% of our outstanding shares at IPO
to approximately 90% today.
Earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share.
This dividend will be paid November 15, 2011 and represents a $0.225 per share or 50% increase over the previous
semi-annual dividend we declared in March. In addition, the Board has increased our share repurchase authority by $5
billion. That authority now totals approximately $6 billion.
In summary, we had a strong quarter and ended the year in many ways above where we expected. I am very proud of
Accenture people and their extraordinary ability to drive our business in a way that serves both our clients and our
shareholders so well.
Lastly, I'd just like to mention that we were also pleased to see that we were added to the S&P 500 Index on July 5.
Now let me turn the call back to Pierre to give you an update on some key aspects of our growth strategy.
[009LZH-E Pierre Nanterme]
Thank you, Pam.
Our strong results for the quarter and the full year demonstrate that we are executing the right growth strategy, a
strategy that resonates with our clients. We are operating at the heart of our clients' business and are delivering unique
value propositions that are built on strong business cases. Our focus continues to be on driving sustainable and
profitable growth through industry differentiation, technology leadership, and geographic expansion.
We continue to grow our portfolio of Diamond clients, both the number of Diamond clients and the amount and scope
of work we are doing for them in mature and emerging markets. This focus is bringing even greater depth and breadth
to our business.
We are serving clients in more than 40 industries and continue to invest in industry differentiation. To accelerate the
execution of our growth strategy, we have prioritized our investments around specific industries where we see
opportunity for even greater return.

Last quarter, I mentioned our focus on the health sector. This quarter, I'm delighted to share the progress we're making
in insurance and banking, where we recently announced two acquisitions. The acquisition of Duck Creek Technologies,
a leading provider of software solutions for property and casualty insurance companies in the U.S. and in the U.K., is
enabling us to provide a complete end-to-end solution from underwriting through claims to policy administration. In
banking, we announced our plan to acquire Zenta, one of the largest residential and commercial mortgage processors in
the U.S. This should position us as a leading provider of services to the credit industry, where we see significant
opportunity to help clients adapt to the changing regulatory requirements.
In addition to building on our core, we continue to expand our technology leadership through our strategic initiatives to
ensure that we are positioned to capitalize on future technology waves. In digital marketing, we are helping clients with
digital strategy, website transformation, social media, and digital management. In China, we are helping one of the
largest online retailers improve user interaction and increase conversion rates to grow sales volume. In Smart Grid, we
now have more than 100 projects delivered or on the way in over 20 countries. And we continue to extend our cloud
capabilities and are seeing increased demand for software as a service. As a client in the energy management industry,
we're doing one of the largest global software-as-a-service implementations, involving work in 70 countries and almost
20,000 users.
Geographic expansion is another key area of focus. In fiscal year 2011, we made good progress growing revenues in
our 10 priority emerging markets by 30% in local currency to $3 billion. We are very pleased with this result and intend
to build further on this success in fiscal year 2012.
We continue to run Accenture as a high performance business, managing the company with rigor and discipline. We
remain focused on pulling all the levers, including improving sales efficiency, optimizing utilization, carefully
managing G&A, and lowering our cost to serve by further leveraging our Global Delivery Network.
Of course, we are carefully watching the macroeconomic environment. Clearly, there is more volatility and uncertainty
in the global economy as governments, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, continue to work to solve the deficit and debt
issues they are facing. At the same time, the long-term trends that we previously identified, challenges of globalization,
increased regulation, and the need for operational efficiency, are even more prevalent today than they were a few
months ago. Our clients continue to take steps to adjust to this new environment, and this continues to drive demand for
our services.
With that, I will turn it back over to Pam, who will provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2012.
[004YT1-E Pamela Craig]
Thank you, Pierre.
To tee up our fiscal year 2012 business outlook, I'd like to first share with you some of our thoughts on how we see this
fiscal year shaping up. We believe, as Pierre just shared, that our strategy and our proven ability to serve our clients'
needs combined with critical business and technology trends position us very well as we move forward. With that said,
we recognize that global macroeconomic risks have increased and global growth has slowed in the last few months.
This is not lost on us. And as you would expect of us, we remain vigilant about understanding any impacts and
managing our global business tightly.
So let's start with a couple of assumptions. First, we do continue to assume positive economic growth in the global
economy, although lower than where we assumed it in April, and we have factored that in. Second, regarding the
impact of foreign exchange, we have looked at how the rates have been trending over the last couple of weeks. And at
this time, we assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to be flat for fiscal 2012, compared
to fiscal 2011. The U.S. dollar is currently strengthening, and this could end up causing a headwind to actual dollar
growth this fiscal year. As we have done in the past, we will update the foreign exchange assumption each quarter
based on how the rates are trending, compared to fiscal 2011.
Our outlook components remain the same. We plan to provide annual outlook in the areas we have in the past, and we
will continue to update you on these measures quarterly. We will continue to provide a quarterly outlook for revenue so

that you have a basis for understanding our level of business by quarter as we progress through the year.
So starting with revenue for the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $6.8 billion to $7.0 billion. This
assumes a foreign exchange impact of positive 3%, compared to the first quarter in fiscal 2011.
For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect net revenue to grow in a range of 7% to 10% in local currency over fiscal
2011. Although there have been puts and takes over the past five months, this is consistent with what we stated at our
investor and analyst conference on April 14 and confirmed last quarter. For the full fiscal year, we are targeting new
bookings to be the range of $28 billion to $31 billion. And as you know, our bookings can be lumpy from
quarter-to-quarter. In fiscal year 2012, we expect operating margin to be in a range of 13.7% to 13.9%, a 10 to 30 basis
point expansion. We will continue to balance profitability with making investments to position our business for the
future. You should expect some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, as you've seen in the past.
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 27% to 28%. For earnings per share, we expect full-year
diluted EPS for fiscal 2012 to be in a range of $3.80 to $3.88 or 12% to 14% growth, consistent with what we stated at
our April investor and analyst conference of at least 12% growth.
Now let's turn to cash flow. For the full fiscal year we expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $3.6 billion to $3.9
billion, property and equipment additions to be $490 million, and free cash flow to be in a range of $3.1 billion to $3.4
billion.
To update you on our thinking for uses of cash, we are on course to continue our strategy this fiscal year. We will
continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions as a part of our growth strategy. We also remain committed to
return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal 2012, we now expect to return at least $3
billion through a raised dividend and through share repurchases; and also, now expect to reduce the weighted average
diluted shares outstanding by approximately 3%.
In closing, we know we need to stay very close to what generates value for money for our clients. And in doing so, we
will be focused on doing what we do best: drive profitable growth for Accenture, provide valuable work for our people,
maintain our strong balance sheet, and generate significant free cash flow, a substantial portion of which we would then
expect to return to shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that Pierre and I can take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first questions comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Yes, thanks, operator. So, I wanted to ask about the lumpiness of bookings. In the May quarter,
the bookings were solid, but not spectacular. And your bookings in both consulting and outsourcing this quarter looked
really, really strong. So, I'm just wondering about the lumpiness of bookings on the positive side in the August quarter,
and what that might look like from a lumpiness standpoint as you move into the November quarter. And specifically,
could you give us an idea of to what extent the Nokia deal contributed to the bookings in the August quarter as well?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Hi, there.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: So yes, first of all, as you might imagine, we were very pleased with the bookings. Regarding
consulting, you may recall last quarter we did expect them to pick up a bit in terms of the book-to-bill, and they did,

and so that was good. And I think the outsourcing has just been building and coming on stronger each quarter. Most of
those deals over $100 million that we had were in outsourcing, and we saw a book-to-bill there of 1.5. So, the Nokia
deal was indeed in the quarter, but we don't comment specifically on that.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay. Do you expect the bookings trend in the November quarter to be a little less strong
because potentially not as helped by chunky bookings items?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think we do expect that they'll build throughout the year, lumpy, but do that similar to the
way they did in fiscal 2011; so yes, potentially a little lighter.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay, great. And then the follow-up question is really just about what's happening in the
demand environment as you look forward. Clearly, with your guidance, you're feeling comfortable with where things
are. But I guess the question is, are you seeing any early signs of economic stress starting to affect demand patterns?
Are you seeing any delays in decision-making, any projects being delayed? Are you seeing priorities at clients shifting
from growth or development toward maintenance and cost takeout to just give us a gauge of whether there might be
early signs of the economy starting to affect the demand patterns at all?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Hello, Rod. This is Pierre here. As we speak today, and we have multiple conversations every
day with our clients, we do not see such things happening. We have very good discussions. Clients are very well aware
of what's happening outside. And indeed they continue to think about how they're going to transform their operation to
be more effective in the current environment. The trends we've been talking about this last quarter are still there
outside, and we continue to see our clients investing.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Okay, great. And then just finally, as a clarification, your growth rate in the U.S. is remaining
much stronger than in EMEA. Would you expect that to continue in fiscal 2012?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: The growth rate that we provided for the Americas represented or reflected strength in the
U.S., in Brazil, and in Canada, all of them. And we do expect the U.S. to continue to be strong as we go forward.
<Q - Rod Bourgeois>: Great. Thanks, guys.

We'll go next to Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Thanks, guys. Just real quickly, when you think about the pace of bookings, and what you
guys have seen so far, and what you're expecting at least for the rest of this calendar year, how much of your visibility
at this point comes from having a sense on calendar 2012 budgets or capital projections, so maybe if you can just frame
your own expectations for bookings, the target for fiscal 2012, as it relates to any conversations you guys have had
about calendar 2012 capital budgets, if you will?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, Julio, as you know, in our business our visibility is much better in the first part of the
year. And as we sit here today, we have roughly 13% more contracted revenue in place at this time, this year versus last
year, and that's based on strength in outsourcing. So, I think that it's the predictability in the second half of the year
given the macroeconomic uncertainty, especially in Europe, that's what we're thinking about. But that's really – and
yes, calendar year budgets will kick in. But the visibility that we have right now is very good based on the first few
months, which especially affects consulting.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay, and so that would explain the back half implied growth versus what you're expecting,
at least implied by the $6.8 billion to $7 billion. So, the tougher comps as you think about those in the back half of
fiscal year 2011 comparing those to the back half of fiscal 2012 will partly explain it. But clearly, at this point it just
seems like some element of that is just lower visibility as you really roll over into your second half of your fiscal 2012,
or is there anything beyond that to think about there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: No, I think that's fair.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Moshe Katri with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Thanks, and nice quarter. Could you talk a bit about what you're seeing out there, specifically in
the U.K. and Continental Europe? And again, going back to some of the discussions that you're having with your
customers, maybe talk about what's driving demand, and what are some of the concerns that you may have on those in
terms of looking at those territories.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, thanks, Moshe, for the question. Of course, we all know that Europe is as we speak
probably challenged, I would say with the global economic environment, but more specifically with, of course, the
sovereign debt. We know as well that all the governments are working extremely hard as we speak to find the right
solution, and we expect that indeed they're going to find the right solution, and so we can move forward.
Now if you look at Europe, you have very different countries in different situations. I think the north of Europe is
remaining strong, including Germany, and you have good momentum in those economies. Even France is doing well. If
you look at all Europe, they are planning anything between 1% to 2% growth, and that kind of growth is probably what
Europe is experiencing these last few years. So, to some extent, there is nothing really new in that part of the world.
We've been operating on slower economic growth for years.
Now if you look at our clients, our clients are the largest and more global organizations. So, as you know, they are not
operating only in Europe, but they are operating on a global basis. And when they consider their investments, they are
considering investing on a scale, which is going beyond Europe per se. And that's the kind discussion we have with
them when it comes to global operating model, merger and acquisition, global expansion, all the directions we have are
going beyond Europe per se.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: And then, Pam, just to follow up, recruiting targets for fiscal year 2012, you had a pretty big jump
in your GDN head count in fiscal year 2011. Do you have any – can you share with us some numbers?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, in fiscal 2011 we hired 70,000 people. And the first half of this past year was on a run
rate less than that, and we expect the first half of 2012 to be roughly comparable to the first half of last year.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: So that's for GDN; how about for the total hiring?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: That was for the total.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: And how about GDN?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Probably similar, I don't really have that many details on that. But just in terms of – I would
expect it to be similar.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Great, thanks.

Our next question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, Pam. I wanted to ask a similar question on hiring, if I could. If you think about any
buckets of hiring, so to speak, in other words, where do you anticipate hiring in terms of – I know you just mentioned
the global GDN, but in terms of Consulting versus some of the Outsourcing areas, if there's any kind of categorization
you could give us on where the hiring would be targeted?

And then the follow-up is just on financial services. It looked to be down a little bit sequentially. I just wondered if you
could help us think about financial services growth within the context of the guidance you provided both for the quarter
and the year. Thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Okay, great, so two separate questions. I think just in terms of recruiting, there's really nothing
to point out there specifically. We're matching supply and demand for our business around the world both locally and
in the Global Delivery Network, so there's really not too much more color to add there.
In terms of financial services, we do have our eye on the consulting part of financial services in Europe, probably for
obvious reasons just in terms of what's going on there. We have a lot of critical transformational work going on with
those clients, as Pierre talked about. But we may see a little just slight cutback in some other consulting work, and that
is reflected in the Q4 results, and also, in our outlook.
Operator
Is that all, Mr. Bachman?
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yes, thank you.

Operator
Okay, thank you. We have Nathan Rozof with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Nathan.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: First off, I just wanted to ask about the pipeline, more the velocity of deals entering and moving
through the pipeline. Clearly, deals are still coming out in a very strong manner. But have you seen any change in the
pace of new deals entering the pipeline or the speed with which you're able to convert new prospects into wins?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, I think we, of course, look at that. We look at the pipeline every, which way. And the
average days of the opportunities that are in the pipeline is slightly up. But interestingly, with that trend, we ended up
with a win rate that was higher, so that really then delivered the record bookings. And also the way those bookings are
converting to revenues is also faster at the moment. So, the conversion rate is very good; the aging, slightly up.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: And are you guys seeing any increase related to that? Are you seeing any increase in the level of
scrutiny by the client in terms of number of signoffs needed or the number of executives that have to sign off on new
projects?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No, we've not seen any of these happening as we speak.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Great, thank you, guys.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: I just want to go back to revenue here, obviously, keeping the 7% to 10% revenue growth
as we expected, but there is considerable investor skepticism. So, is it possible to parse out in a little bit more detail
some of the sources of growth, such as maybe globalization or how much of FY 2011 bookings might flow through?
And what are you assuming for project activity maybe?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I will answer the question and Pam might give more color as required. But overall, we
are entering the future in a position of strength, as we mentioned before. We're pleased with the backlog we have.
We're pleased with the level of the pipeline. We have good activity. And as we speak, we've not seen any change in the
clients' behavior.
When we look at the business, we can see growth in most of the dimensions of our business, if you will. Most of the
industries we are working with are on massive transformation for all sorts of good and varied reasons. We mentioned
financial services. We all know what's happening in that industry. You have all the new imperatives created with the
Basel III [indiscernible] (46:17), and they need to change their operating model in the way, which is more structural
now than tactical in the past. And what I'm saying for financial services is true across the patch in all the industries.
When you look at this from a geographic standpoint, of course, we are very pleased with our growth in our priority
emerging market, where we see as well more opportunities moving forward, and we are accelerating our growth in
those markets. But as well, we continue to see good potential in the more mature economies as the need for
transformation for all those big waves of globalization, regulation, more efficiency in the operations, and as well, the
new technology waves have been reasonably profound to carry forward in terms of demand.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Maybe I'll just give you a little color on – I mentioned the puts and takes on the 7% to 10%
growth rate that we first talked about in April at our investor/analyst day. And so just in terms of some of that, clearly
in the macro we see that the forecast for GDP has ticked down say 0.5 point to 1 point in that timeframe. And we have
moderated our consulting growth in FS Europe, as I had mentioned, and also, parts of management consulting.
And then on the positive side, we indeed had the signing of the Nokia deal. We also had the two acquisitions in
financial services, one signed, one about to be signed that Pierre mentioned. And we also had higher run rate of
revenues through the fourth quarter and with bookings, as I mentioned, that are converting at a faster pace. So, that's
how it all came out in terms of just at a high level in terms of the 7% to 10% that we see at this moment.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: That all makes good sense. I just wanted to ask a follow-on question on the flexibility of
your cost structure, if I may. If you do happen to see fluctuations in the top line, to what extent do you retain flexibility
in your cost structure today?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think this is something that we view as job two after delivering revenue, which is indeed to
manage our costs in line with the size of our business. And as you know, we have a lot of levers at our disposal that we
manage in order to deliver operating margin. And we will indeed use those as necessary both to deliver growth, as we
did this year where our business grew faster than we expected it to; and if it goes the other way, the same thing. Pierre?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. My three favorite words, if you will, are growth, rigor, and discipline, in that order. I
think when it comes to rigor and discipline, this is where the answer is coming. I think for a long period of time, we
have a track record of balancing supply/demand in the right way. We are extraordinarily specific in the way we focus
our business, in the way we are looking at what's happening in every part of the world and our different organizations.
And so this is what we will continue to do so we can make sure we're matching supply and demand in a very
disciplined and rigorous way.

And next we have Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Hey, how are you guys?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Jason, good.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Good. I just wanted to pick up on the comment you just made, Pam, in terms of the
puts and takes of where we were in April versus where we are now. And you mentioned a little bit of moderation in the
Consulting revenue growth outlook. How does that feed into your expectations for the fiscal 2012 bookings mix
between Consulting and Outsourcing? How do you guys see that split playing out versus how it trended in fiscal 2011?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I think – we don't expect the mix of bookings to change significantly, but it may tilt back
towards outsourcing slightly. That's how we see it today.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay, that makes sense. And when you think about the underlying drivers that
enabled you guys to beat your original fiscal 2011 guidance by the amount that you did, to what extent do you see some
of those factors being still being prevalent in the market as we think about the potential for upside to your fiscal 2012
outlook? I guess currency comes to mind as one, and clearly, it doesn't appear that it will be as much of a lift in fiscal
2012 as there was in fiscal 2011. But when you consider the non-FX type factors, how should we think about those?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, if you look at this and reflect on fiscal year 2011, as Pam mentioned, we have seen more
deals in average of bigger size, especially when it comes to the Outsourcing. And I think this trend is reflecting indeed
the need for, on one hand, more transformation, but as well more transformation on the cost side. And I think this trend
is reasonably profound in the business, as all our clients will have to, one way or another, adjust their operating model
to the new normal of the economy. They will need to structurally shift their cost, and that's why I think we see that kind
of trend around business process outsourcing and outsourcing.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay, so basically the big cost transformation deals in BPO, that's a continuing trend?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, we can see this trend as cost is going to be important. Of course, we have many
activities around working with our clients to generate more top line revenue with them. But it's the balance between
generating more revenues, as well as continuing doing a better job in terms of cost to management. And this is where
all what we are providing in terms of cost management, procurement, sourcing, and outsourcing is one of the elements
is vibrant as we speak.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: The other thing I'll just add to that, Jason, is globalization and complexity. The clients are
really trying to do some pretty big things in order to continue to invest to compete globally, and so that has really
played to our strengths. And of course, what's happening with the tech waves, with cloud, with analytics, mobility,
those were all generating, I think, additional demand throughout this past year.
<Q - Jason Alan Kupferberg>: Okay, understood. Thank you, guys.
Operator
And we'll go next to Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery Scott.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi, and congratulations. My first question here is just as you look back on 2008 and 2009,
maybe you could drill down on what you think is probably the most significant difference between the economic
slowdown we have coming up now versus then. Is it a matter of clients having visibility now? Is it the underlying
fundamental trends that you've talked about? I wanted to give you a chance to point that out to investors.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thanks a lot, Joe, and it's an excellent question, of course. I think what's different is the
current situation is not taking anyone by surprise. I think this is the main difference. The uncertainty is coming from a
very specific situation in Europe with the sovereign debt in some very specific countries. And it's very public now that
our governments, especially in Europe, are working hard to fix that problem. That's point number one.

Point number two is our clients are significantly stronger as we speak now. They're really in a very strong cash
position. They're all posting good results as we speak, if not record results. Some are much bigger and are operating on
a much broader scale, so they are more resilient as well.
And three, they're getting into the current environment in a way which is – they are more fit, if you will, and they are
now more looking forward than on a pure short-term basis to understand what it takes to compete in the new
environment in a way, which is, again, probably more structural than tactical. So, I think all of this is reasonably
different, compared to the same period in '08/'09.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Okay. And then just my follow-up question I guess building on that, when we look at Europe,
should we look at that on a country-by-country basis? And I know you talked about potentially seeing some slight some
cutback there. Is that on the discretionary side in financial services? I'm just wondering how to think about Europe.
Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, probably Europe, you're right. It should be looked at in different countries, because
when you look at this market, it is very different. As you know, Germany is doing very well. France is okay. The
Nordic countries are still in good shape. The U.K. are trying to recover, and then you have some very specific situations
in the south. So, indeed, it is very different.
That being said, as we speak, if you look at the IMF, all the economies are still planning for Europe positive growth,
slower, but positive growth. And that's the way we are looking at Europe, client by client, country by country, and
industry by industry.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Thank you.
Operator
And next we have Arvind Ramnani from UBS.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Arvind.
Operator
Is your line on mute?
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Hi, this is Arvind. You initially talked about 7% to 10% growth for fiscal 2012 in April of
this year. And then since then, you've had two stronger than anticipated quarters, thereby pushing out your fiscal 2012
revenue goalposts even further. So, given the weak macro and some of the opportunity where you guys have essentially
pulled back some of your growth rates as far as revenue goes, do you consider looking at these two quarters and saying
okay, let's get a little conservative, or none of the macro is really impacting you guys?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, thanks, Arvind, for the question. As you've seen, we've been very consistent since the
investor and analyst day because I think the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment has not happened these last
two months. That was something which has been around for quite a while, probably since 2010. And we've always
been factoring in our forecasts to put context in what might happen in the economic environment. We started to do that
in April. We look at it every quarter to understand what's the situation. And based upon what we know from the client
demand, what we understand from the macroeconomic environment, we continue to believe that the 7% to 10% is the
right forecast for Accenture, as we are entering fiscal year 2012.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Great. Also in the past, you have talked about your subcontractor costs for specialized
skill sets impacting margins. Given the weaker macro, are you looking to convert more of these subcontractors to
permanent employees?

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Just on the subcontractor usage, we started out the year with using more of them maybe than
we had planned for because of how the demand was coming in stronger. And we've now backed off of that a little bit so
that our subcontractor usage is not as – it's a little bit lesser part of our mix as we finish the year.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Okay, great, that's really helpful, and one last one, if I can slip it in. How are you
managing your recruiting and your utilization rates given that attrition rates will probably reduce over the next few
months?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: As we always do, Arvind [Laughter] this is just what we expect to happen. Sometimes I think
the level of attrition that we saw, we view as a very healthy level in terms of – this is just, as Pierre mentioned earlier,
managing supply and demand is an extremely important part of what we do.
<Q - Arvind A. Ramnani>: Great, congrats on a great quarter and good luck for fiscal 2012.

That will come from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - David Grossman>: Hi, great, thank you very much. Pam, last quarter you talked about conversion rates
improving, and I think you saw a similar dynamic that I think you repeated this quarter. That stands in contrast to
maybe things sitting in the pipeline a little bit longer. Could you just help us understand perhaps what drives that
dynamic?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, things are sitting in the pipeline a little bit longer. However, in terms of things coming
out of the pipeline, we were converting more, so that relates to win rates. And then also, we're converting it faster to
revenue because sometimes things are booked, but they don't become revenue for a while.
<Q - David Grossman>: Right, and that's what specifically I was referring to.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: So we just see more contracts and work with clients that need to get going faster in a bigger
way. And in our mix, we saw that this quarter.
<Q - David Grossman>: And is that typically a positive leading indicator when things do get finalized and closed that
they convert to revenue more quickly, in your experience?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I believe it is, yes. I believe it shows that the demand is strong [Laughter] let's get started. So,
clearly, I think that that is a positive indicator, yes.
<Q - David Grossman>: Right, and just one other question. I know you don't manage to gross margin and you're more
focused on operating margin. However, can you help us understand where the investment in the growth initiatives that
started a while back, was that the primary headwind to gross margin in 2011 versus 2010? And could you help us
understand how to think about what are the puts and takes to gross margin next year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Just to answer this question specifically about initiatives, most of those flow through on the
sales and marketing line, so they're not in gross margin per se. And I think that just what happens between the sales and
marketing line in gross margin is that there are various things that people do in addition to serving contracts that is in
gross margin that goes into both of those lines. So, sometimes you just see some back and forth between those during
the year.
<Q - David Grossman>: And is there any sense you can give in terms of how we should think of gross margin next
year in 2012?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: No because we guide and manage the business to operating margin, so I would stick with that.
