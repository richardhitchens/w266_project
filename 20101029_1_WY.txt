Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated
with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.
Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $1.116 billion for the third quarter or $3.50 per diluted share, on net sales
of $1.7 billion. This compares with essentially break-even results on net sales of $1.4 billion for the same period last
year.
In the second quarter of 2010, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $14 million or $0.07 per diluted share on net
sales of $1.8 billion.
Earnings for the third quarter included $1.035 billion from income tax adjustments primarily related to the reversal of
deferred taxes as a result of Weyerhaeuser's conversion to a REIT. Excluding the income tax adjustments,
Weyerhaeuser reported Q3 net earnings of $81 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, a $137 million increase compared
with last year's third quarter.
On our website we provide an earnings information package which includes a GAAP reconciliation of special items.
You will notice that we have added new information to this package, we hope you find this information useful. We
begin our discussion this morning with a review of chart 4, the waterfall chart, in the earnings information package. A
discussion of each business covering charts 5 through 10 will then follow.
Turning to chart 4, changes in contribution to earnings by segment. Weyerhaeuser's segment earnings from the second
quarter of 2010 to the third quarter were as follows, beginning with the first bar on the left hand side of the page. In the
second quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $168 million before special items, interest, and taxes.
Timberlands ended Q3 with earnings $5 million higher than in Q2. Wood products earnings were $89 million lower
than in the second quarter. Sale of fibers contributed $107 million more to earnings in the third quarter. Earnings from
real estate were $7 million lower than second quarter, and corporate and other contributed $2 million more in Q3.
The final bar to the right of the page is Weyerhaeuser's third quarter earnings of $186 million before special items,
interest, and taxes.
Turning next to the business segment we begin this discussion with timberlands, charts 5 and 6. Timberlands
contributed $75 million to pre-tax earnings in Q3, $5 million more than in Q2. The Q3 disposition of non-strategic
timberlands was $34 million pre-tax compared to $14 million pre-tax in Q2. This increase was partially offset by lower
log price realizations as illustrated on chart 6.
Log prices in the West declined 7%, export sales realizations were down 5% due to mix. Log prices in the South were
flat. Chart 6 shows fee harvest volumes in the West and South. The fee harvest was seasonally stronger in the third
quarter. Western harvest volume rose a modest 3%, Southern volume increased 10%. Year-to-date the Western harvest
is down 18% and the South is down 15% from last year. Harvest deferrals continue.
Spending for roads and silviculture was seasonally higher. Silviculture spending including a catch-up from activities
deferred as a result of poor weather earlier this year.
Turning next to wood products, charts 7 and 8. Market conditions rapidly deteriorated at the end of second-quarter and
difficult markets persisted in Q3. Wood products lost $100 million, $89 million worse than the Q2 loss before special
items of $11 million.
As indicated on chart 8, lumber prices declined 18% or $61 per thousand board feet, and OSB prices plummeted 30%
or $81 per thousand square feet. Engineered wood products prices increased slightly, but engineered I-Joists shipments
fell 24%. The wood products business reduced working capital by $54 million during Q3 and ended the quarter at cash
break-even.

Turning to cellulose fibers, chart 9. In third quarter, cellulose fibers, on a pre-tax basis earned $181 million,
contributing $107 million more to earnings than in second quarter. During the quarter, pulp prices reached a 15 year
peak. Pulp price realizations increased by $70 per ton, 8% higher than in Q2. Pulp sales volumes increased 8% in the
quarter. There were no maintenance outages in Q3 resulting in $30 million less of maintenance spending and an
improvement in productivity. There had been three maintenance outages in second quarter.
Real estate, chart 10. In third quarter, real estate contributed $20 million to pre-tax earnings, including income from
partnerships. This contribution from real estate was $7 million lower in the third quarter from the second quarter. The
volume of single-family homes closed declined 20%, from 625 closings to 501 closings. However, due to mix, average
prices improved 8% and gross margins modestly increased. Land and lot sales were fewer in the quarter. Land and lot
sales were $4 million in Q3 versus $13 million in Q2.
The backlog of homes sold but not closed declined in the quarter and stands at 660 units. The cancellation rate edged
down 20% from 22%.
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kathy. And good morning to everyone who is joining us today.
I'm pleased to provide my comments this morning on our quarterly results, as well as a review of current market
conditions. We have some good news to share regarding the record performance of our cellulose fibers business and the
ability of our real estate business to produce its third consecutive profitable quarter in a very weak market.
However, we continue to face challenging market conditions for wood products, which requires our continued focus on
improving the performance of this business. Before I comment on market conditions and our financial performance, I
want to talk about the management changes we announced on October 1.
Leadership is a critical element of business success. The changes I've recently made will accelerate our rate of
improvement and our overall competitiveness. First, I've eliminated the role of Executive Vice President for Forest
Products, and the leaders of each our four major business segments now report directly to me, increasing my direct
involvement in our operations.
Our most important asset is our timberlands, and that's why I've placed Tom Gideon in our timberlands lead role. Tom
has deep experience in timberlands management, having previously led this business. I expect Tom to apply his broad
set of experiences to managing our core timberlands asset in our new structure for the benefit of our shareholders.
Wood products has been our greatest challenge during the housing recession and I've asked Larry Burrows to lead this
business. Larry has been leading our real estate business since April of 2008. The last three years have been the most
challenging period WRECO has ever experienced. During this difficult time, Larry provided strong leadership as
WRECO repositioned land and product, reduced construction costs, and significantly reduced SG&A.
These changes, and strong local leadership, resulted in WRECO returning to profitability this year, outperforming
much of the industry. I expect Larry to apply his strong operating skills, his intimate knowledge of the housing market
and the home building industry to improve profitability in our wood products segment.
With Larry moving to the wood products business, I have chosen Peter Orser to lead WRECO. Peter most recently has
been the president of WRECO's Puget Sound based subsidiary, Quadrant Homes. Under Peter's leadership, Quadrant
became the largest homebuilder in the Pacific Northwest through its focus on manufacturing efficiency and profitably
serving the needs of entry-level buyers.
Our cellulose fibers business segment continues to be ably led by Shaker Chandrasekaran. As an introduction to the
market conditions affecting our company, I'll remind you that three of our major businesses, timberlands, wood
products and real estate, continue to be impacted by conditions in the U.S. housing market, which are very challenging.

We commented in this morning's release that the direction of the housing market remains uncertain. On our second
quarter call, we noted that the improved momentum that began last year and carried through the first quarter suddenly
turned negative following the expiration of the Housing Tax Credit at the end of April.
These negative housing trends continue, as evidenced by our own third quarter performance metrics compared with the
third quarter one year ago. In WRECO, our quarterly new home sales declined 30%. In our wood products business,
sales of our TJI Joist, which primarily are used in new construction, decreased 28%. And in our timberlands business,
combined external and internal domestic log sales volume was 9% lower, with export volumes helping to partially
cushion the full impact of the drop in domestic demand.
Housing fundamentals remain weak as we enter the final quarter of the year when construction activity is normally
lower. This is a result of the lack of job recovery, low consumer confidence, stagnant home prices, the overhang of
known and shadow inventory, and this week's front page story, the growing uncertainty related to home foreclosures.
New single-family starts for September were 452,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, a slight improvement from the
low levels this summer, but unfortunately well below the 600,000 level that we assumed as we entered 2010.
So let's discuss how these housing dynamics played out for us in the third quarter. Starting with our biggest challenge,
wood products, we expected a significantly larger loss in the third quarter as compared with the second quarter because
of rapidly deteriorating prices. Unfortunately, this is how the quarter played out. Comparing quarter-over-quarter
segment results for wood products 90% of the decrease in contribution was the result of price decline, with lumber and
OSB realizations dropping significantly from their second quarter peaks.
On balance, quarter-over-quarter sales volume also suffered somewhat with lumber and OSB volumes roughly flat,
while engineered wood product volumes were dramatically reduced. Despite these headwinds in the U.S., our three
Canadian lumber mills ran at over 90% of capacity during the quarter, performing well, aided by lower log costs, good
operating metrics, and improved export sales.
Timing and pace of housing recovery are still not evident and so we continue to match our production capacity with
demand. During the quarter we closed our Albany, Oregon engineered lumber mill. We reduced the size of our sales
and marketing staff by consolidating sales regions. We're dealing with costs for a number of closed and underutilized
wood products facilities, especially in our OSB and engineered wood products businesses.
Currently, 30% of our total OSB capacity is indefinitely curtailed. 19% of our I-joist capacity and 45% of our
engineered solid section capacity is shutdown. Even with this low level – even with this level of indefinitely closed
facilities, operating rates at the remaining mills were low, and given the slow pace of housing recovery, we will be
taking further action in the fourth quarter.
In our timberlands business, as a result of continued softness in housing demand, we continue to defer harvest in both
the West and the South in order to optimize longer-term values. Year-to-date harvest volumes in both regions are down
approximately 16%, and compared with 2008 they're down 42%. Looking forward, as a supply becomes constrained
and demand and prices improve, we have the ability to increase our harvest.
In addition to revenues from log sales and energy and minerals-related income from our lands, we continue to see
potential to generate additional revenues in the future as markets develop for biomass once we have some clarity
around U.S. climate and energy policies.
Our real estate segment was one of the bright spots in the quarter. Though we expected break-even results, we turned a
profit for the third consecutive quarter. Closings were lower quarter-over- quarter while average prices increased due to
mix and we remained profitable. Margins were slightly higher as a result of our continued actions, which include
repositioning product and managing costs.
Activity across our WRECO markets is mixed. California's Inland Empire, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas
markets are operating at low rates, and are extremely competitive. After outperforming the country for the last couple
of years, Houston has started to move downward. And in the Puget Sound area, most communities are slow, with the
exception of those located near military installations.

On the positive side, in San Diego and the Washington DC suburbs, activity is relatively strong. Winchester's Poplar
Run project in Silver Spring, Maryland, just opened its new models two weekends ago, attracting over 1,000 shoppers,
evidence that there is still a market for well-designed homes in an attractive community where employment is
improving.
I'll complete my remarks on business performance with a discussion of our one segment that is not tied to the U.S.
housing market, and that's cellulose fibers. This business is affected by global macroeconomic conditions, foreign
exchange rates, and the strength of demand for our differentiated cellulose fibers products, especially absorbent fluff
pulp from the U.S. South.
We expected earnings from this sector to be substantially higher than the second quarter, and as reported in our release
this morning, cellulose fibers turned in a record performance for the quarter due to higher prices, lower maintenance
costs, and strong operating performance by all of our mills. Our key customers are all growing, especially in emerging
global markets, and they acknowledge their reliance on our products to meet their growth opportunities.
In addition to the record performance in our pulp mills, segment earnings were enhanced by continued strong
profitability from our liquid packaging business. We certainly benefited from continued pulp price improvement over
the past six quarters and we've coupled that with steady improvement in safe, reliable operations across the entire
business system, manufacturing as well as sales. I want to recognize Shaker and his team for this record performance.
Before turning the call over to Patty, I want to comment on one other significant accomplishment during the quarter.
Though it may already seem to be old news, I'm pleased to report that our special dividend payment was completed on
September 1. Our conversion to a REIT structure supports our strategy to enhance the competitiveness of our core
timberlands business, increasing cash flow available for distribution to our shareholders. This transaction was
unprecedented in terms of size and complexity, given the historic nature of our timberland assets. And I want to thank
the entire Weyerhaeuser team who managed the process to a successful conclusion.
I'm looking forward to sharing our ongoing dividend decision in December, following action by our Board. And now
I'd like to turn the call to Patty who will provide fourth quarter outlook and financial comments. Patty`?
Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. I'll start the outlook with timberlands and my comments are summarized
on chart 11. In the West, our export and domestic log volumes and realizations are expected to decrease in the fourth
quarter compared to the third. In the South, grade log realizations are projected to be flat to slightly lower compared to
the third quarter.
Fee harvest volumes in both the West and South are scheduled to decline seasonally. Costs should increase slightly as a
result of catching up on silvicultural spending in the South. Excluding the effect of non-strategic land sales, earnings in
our timberlands segment are anticipated to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. Wood products average
sales realizations and sales volumes will likely decrease across all our major product lines in the fourth quarter. Log
costs are expected to decrease somewhat, which will offset some of the decline in revenue.
The seasonally slow nature of the fourth quarter, combined with lackluster housing demand, will likely lead to
increased downtime as we match production with demand. In addition, we are reviewing our capacity plan across the
system, including operations that are now indefinitely curtailed. As a result of this review, we may make decisions that
could lead to additional impairments to facilities in the fourth quarter. Before the effect of any impairments, we
anticipate the fourth quarter loss to be comparable to the third quarter.
In cellulose fibers, we expect average sales realizations to soften somewhat compared to the third quarter, although
demand continues to be strong. We have a short scheduled annual maintenance shutdown at one of our facilities, so we
will incur increased maintenance and somewhat lower production relative to the third quarter when we had no
maintenance shutdown. Overall, we anticipate fourth quarter earnings in our cellulose fibers segment to be very strong,

although lower than the record earnings of the third quarter.
Dan has already described the challenging market conditions facing our real estate business. Traditionally, the fourth
quarter is the strongest quarter of the year for home closings. While we do expect to close approximately 100 more
homes in Q4 compared to Q3, the number will likely be fewer than the 625 homes closed during Q2, which was aided
by the housing tax credit. We expect margins to moderate somewhat in the fourth quarter compared to the third, and we
don't anticipate any significant land or lot sales in the fourth quarter.
Overall, earnings in our real estate segment are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third. In
addition, our backlog will likely decline during the fourth quarter from the already low level of 660 homes at the end of
the third quarter.
As Dan mentioned, I will review some of the changes to the third quarter as a result of our special dividend and our
conversion to a real estate investment trust or REIT structure. On September 1st, we made a special distribution to our
shareholders. This distribution accomplished the payout of our accumulated earnings and profits, which was the last
critical milestone to enable our conversion to a REIT. This payout was made by distributing $560 million of cash and
approximately 324 million new shares.
To help you understand the reporting implications of the dividend, we have included a couple of additional charts in the
packet. Chart 12 lays out the reconciliation of the changes in our share count as of the end of the third quarter, as well
as the computation of the weighted average shares outstanding used for the calculation of our earnings per share.
Accounting rules don't allow for retroactive restatement of the historical EPS for the new shares issued in the dividend.
On Chart 13, we have provided the pro forma EPS, as if the shares issued in the special dividend had been outstanding
for all of the periods presented.
Looking forward, we anticipate using approximately 537 million shares for the EPS calculation in the fourth quarter.
As a result of REIT conversion, we also made a number of tax adjustments in the third quarter, these are illustrated on
Chart 14.
Our effective tax rate for the year is estimated to be approximately 18.5%. Applying this rate to our third quarter
earnings before taxes of $91 million, we have a tax provision of 17 million for the third quarter. The year-to-date
benefit from the true-up of the tax rate for the first and second quarters is approximately $7 million. We also have an
adjustment during the quarter for the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with our booked tax basis
differences in our timberlands of approximately $1.043 billion and a charge of 8 million, primarily as a result of
Medicare Part D plan changes. These adjustments net to the $1.025 billion benefit as shown as our third quarter tax
benefit.
While we're on the topic of taxes, I'd like to comment on the effect of the recent IRS clarification regarding the
cellulosic biofuel producers tax credit. Earlier this year, the IRS released a memo which allows black liquor to qualify
for this credit once companies are registered with the IRS.
We received our registration in the third quarter. On October 5th of this year, the IRS provided guidance allowing black
liquor to qualify for both the biofuel producers tax credit and the alternative fuel mixture credit in the same year but not
on the same gallons of fuel.
During 2009 we produced 238 million gallons of black liquor, which did not qualify for the alternative fuel mixture
credit. This equals approximately 240 million of potential cellulosic biofuel credit at $1.01 per gallon or $149 million
net of tax. We anticipate recognizing this credit in the fourth quarter. Since this credit offsets income-tax liability, we
will carry the credit forward.
At the end of the third quarter, we had nearly $1.370 billion in cash. This is a decrease of approximately 480 million
from the end of the second quarter, primarily as a result of the special dividend of $560 million. We have included a
full cash flow statement in the materials that we released this morning. Capital expenditures for Weyerhaeuser
Company for the first three quarters of this year are just under $150 million. For the full year we expect net capital
expenditures to be just over $200 million. We continue to have strong liquidity with minimal near-term debt maturities

and no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion line of credit.
Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.
Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Patty. Given the weakness we're seeing in today's housing market, we will continue to take aggressive actions
across the company to reduce costs and improve profitability. In WRECO, we'll continue to adjust product offerings,
we'll adjust pricing as dictated by market competition, we'll continue to seek opportunities to reduce construction and
operating costs, and we will continue to review and adjust our land and lot positions as necessary.
In our wood products business, we're committed to improving profitability at
today's level of housing starts. We need to improve margins using all available
levers by enhancing revenues, reducing operating costs and adjusting capacity.
In our cellulose fibers business, we'll continue to focus on operational
improvements as we serve the needs of our key customers as they take
advantage of global growth, especially in emerging markets. In sum, we're
committed to improving our performance at today's level of demand, and with
our scale we'll be prepared to take advantage of an economic recovery when it
comes.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Ruschmeier with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Peter.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: I appreciate all the details in your slides. I think the extra disclosures are helpful. And I
wanted to ask on your fee harvest for 2010, roughly how much would you characterize to be saw timber versus pulp
wood and how does that compare to a more normalized harvest?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Saw timber in the West is roughly 90%, Pete, and
65% in the South. There has been a bit of a shift toward fiber, especially in the South, but no significant change beyond
that.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Okay. And Dan, on your mineral rights strategy, can you remind us how you're thinking
about the strategy for the business and what kind of earnings or cash flow have you been generating in that business,

and how do you think about it going forward?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have approximately 7 million acres of mineral
rights. So we have mineral rights on land that we own as well as land that we have sold in the past where we've retained
the mineral rights. The way we manage that is we have our own minerals group. We are generally are entering into
operating leases with those that are exploring and exploiting the resource, whether it's gravel, oil or gas, those would be
the primary resources that would come off of our land.
Generally those leases are entered into, we receive an upfront lease payment that ends up being amortized over a period
of time and then we have the ability to collect royalties if they are successful. Over the last several years, our minerals
earnings have been running roughly in the $50 million a year range. In the quarter just completed, minerals earnings
were just a shade under $15 million.
The opportunities that we have are to continue to exploit the resources that we have on the lands that we have under our
control. In addition to the existing materials, we also have that group managing some of the newer resources, which
would include wind and geothermal energy.
The most significant resource that we have in the minerals group is in Louisiana, where we have land that's part of the
Haynesville shale play, and though prices are down a bit, natural gas – we continue to generate good earnings and the
operators that are operating under leases seem to be having some success. So we're optimistic about being able to
maintain and grow that over time.
<Q - Peter Ruschmeier>: Thanks very much. I'll turn it over.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Hi, good morning. Dan, can you give me a little bit more color on the timberland you sold in
this quarter, is that part of the 88,000 that you've been marketing in the West?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It is not the 88,000 that we have been marketing,
Gail. We had several sales during the quarter, the most significant was a property that we call Copper Creek, which is
located in the Western Oregon region. That was a sale of about 12,500 acres. It was non-strategic for our purposes,
roughly 65% Doug Fir, 35% Hemlock. It was lower value land in terms of what we would like to see the long term in
our portfolio and it was sold at a price that we felt was very competitive.
With respect to the property you referred that we call Willapa, which is the 80,000 plus acres that we have been
marketing on the West Coast of Washington, we have had a wide variety of interest from, quite frankly, a wide range of
buyer types. We are in active discussions and we are optimistic that we may be seeing values that would cause us to
transact that sale, although I wouldn't expect anything to happen until early 2011.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay. Can you give a quick update on asset sales outside of timberland? I guess you sold
Cosmopolis, an update on the railroads and just any other assets that could be on the market?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. As you noted, we did sell Cosmopolis, that's a
dissolving pulp facility that's been shut down for a number of years. We found a good buyer and we're pleased that
they're going to be able to reopen that facility and create some employment in a town that really needs it. We do have a
transaction on our railroads we are in the midst of, it's subject to federal approval and we would hope to receive that
approval before year-end.
In addition to those, we have a number of non-strategic assets that we identify over time that we seek opportunities to
monetize. We are engaged in some discussions at this point evaluating strategic alternatives for our hardwoods

business, which is a small niche business that reports up through our wood products segment, but that's just a process
that we're going through right now in evaluating alternatives.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay, and just last question. In terms of the wood products business, can you talk a little bit
more about what you can do there? Is this all about just shrinking the footprint or do you think there are other things
that you can do to improve results?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Improving the results in our wood products business
is our highest internal priority right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are looking at all levers that we have.
Improving revenues, reducing operating costs, both in the mills as well as SG&A, and then we are taking a very hard
look at our capacity. As I mentioned in my remarks, we already have a significant amount of capacity that's indefinitely
curtailed, but of those mills that still operating, they're operating at generally low levels.
So you should expect to see some activity in the fourth quarter related to capacity which would position us to be more
profitable in the current market because even for these facilities that are shutdown there are operating costs associated
with just maintaining them for security purposes and maintaining equipment. So it's a full court press in that business
and I'm confident that Larry Burrows, taking a fresh look at it and taking a very strong hand off from Tom Gideon, will
produce some results.
<Q - Gail Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Chun with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Christopher Chun>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Chun>: Just following up on the last question regarding wood products. Can you talk a little bit
more about what the magnitude of the cost cutting opportunities might be and what kind of year-over-year
improvement we might see if markets fail to improve next year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I can't give you specifics, Chris. We have, over the
last two years, been focused on this business. We have taken out a lot of manufacturing costs. As I mentioned, we have
indefinitely curtailed a significant number of facilities, but at today's anemic level of housing starts, we still have too
much capacity. As we entered this year, early in the year, you may recall that we were anticipating single-family starts
at a level of about 600,000. We're falling well below that.
As we move towards 2011, we commented this morning as we talked about WRECO, that WRECO is entering 2011
with a low backlog. Now I think WRECO is representative of other large homebuilders in the U.S. I would expect that
the entire homebuilding community will be moving into 2011 with a lower backlog than they entered 2010 with. So
given the nature of low level of backlog at the beginning of the year, we're anticipating that 2011 will be another very
challenging year.
And so we are sizing our activities to address today's level of demand and not counting on that improvement in 2010.
And I would say that's a significant change year-over-year in the way we were looking at that business. We had
anticipated recovery, we started to see it in the first quarter, it collapsed after the end of April. We believe long-term
that single-family housing starts will return to trend levels, but it is going to be a slow climb out of where we are today
and so we are addressing that in wood products business.
<Q - Christopher Chun>: Are you operating under the assumption that we're going to have another 600,000 type year
next year or do you see at least modest improvement at this point?

<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We don't have a forecast yet for next year. We
generate our own forecast, but we look at that of others, we'll share that later in the year when we have another
opportunity as we get closer to 2011. We are planning for flat activity year-over-year and hope to be pleasantly
surprised with recovery.
<Q - Christopher Chun>: And then, Patty, can you tell us about what percentage of timberland earnings are REIT
qualifying earnings?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, if you think about our
timberland earnings, probably the way to think about is what we've generated so far for the first three quarters. So I
think our overall timberland segment earnings are about $225 million for the first nine months, and our qualified
earnings are just over 70-ish million. So how do you get from that number to the 70 million? You first have to back out
the non-strategic land sales which are about $80 million for the first three quarters. And then you would also have to
back out the mineral income, which is down in the TRF, which Dan just mentioned, is about $15 million a quarter. So
that would be $45 million year-to-date, and then we do have some additional SG&A that we do have to charge to the
REIT structure, which is about 10 million to 15 million a quarter. So let's call that 10 million a quarter so that would be
30 million. So if you back out, take the 225, back out the 80, back out the 45, back out the 30, you get around to the
$70 million number.
<Q - Christopher Chun>: Great, and a final question if I might, you mentioned that the 2010 CapEx is looking like
just over 200, do you view that as a sustainable level or should we expect that to go up in the coming years?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it will probably go up
modestly in 2011. We haven't set those numbers as we sit here today, but I would say that somewhere in the 200,
250-ish range.
<Q - Christopher Chun>: Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Chip.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Looking at the results, I was actually quite surprised and encouraged by how strong the cellulose
segment came in, it seemed to be a lot better than I think we were looking for although, maybe there was – I missed a
black liquor credit or something in there? Was that 180 the actual number?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, there was...
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That number is, doesn't have any
black liquor credit in it, Chip. That segment performed very well during the quarter, all the mills ran very well we
didn't have, as we have said, any maintenance downtime. But we took no black liquor credit for that segment in the
third quarter. And you might recall that last year, of course, we did have black liquor in the third quarter. And if you
compare year-over-year, even with black liquor in the earnings for last year, the earnings this year are greater than a
year ago third quarter.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Gotcha. And as you think about looking ahead. You know, you've seen Procter and Gamble come
out with a very thin diaper that might now finally be getting some traction, the Dry Max, and of course that diaper
doesn't include hardly any, if any, fluff pulp. And as you think about that business, which has been very strong, are you
concerned about a further thinning of the diapers, if you will, across the marketplace where fluff pulp might not be used

in that product and obviously there are some offsets, I guess, with adult incontinence and other products. But how do
you, any early read on how you see the demand side there for fluff?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Chip, I would say that we work
very closely with P&G as one of our largest customers. And as we look at their demand and the demand for fluff
overall, it continues to be a very growing market, not only just a strong market this year but as we look forward in
demand. So I think we are very pleased with the outlook that we hear from P&G as well as our other customers in that
business.
<Q - Chip Dillon>: Okay, I might have just missed this with the other call at the same time but did you -- do you have
a view sort of how we should roughly look at the maintenance schedule? I know it can make the numbers kind of
lumpy in this segment as we look out at the fourth quarter and then maybe the first, or through the fourth quarter to
2011 sort of when would you take a lot of maintenance and when will you take a little and I guess the third you don't
take any at all?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Those maintenance shuts are
scheduled on an annual basis and this year we had two in the first quarter, three in the second quarter, none in the third
and as I mentioned we have one now in the fourth. We plan those annual maintenance around when we need to do
things like boiler inspections or put in additional capital plan. So we have not set that schedule and communicated the
schedule for 2011, but I wouldn't see that it would be terribly different from what you saw in 2010.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you. Just following up a little bit more on the cellulose fibers business, you gave us
the pricing being up $70, and I think you had indicated that the maintenance downtime had been about 30 million in the
second quarter. So if I add those, the impacts from those two I get, 70 – somewhere between 65 million and 75 million
of improvement, and you got 107 million. Is that all from the mills just running better, which then would kind of be the
question is, was the third quarter truly exceptional or were the mills just not really running as well, perhaps, as they
could have been in prior quarters?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think the primary difference quarter-over-quarter,
Mark, is the lack of maintenance downtime. These mills have been running well. And so the third quarter happened to
be a time when we didn't have any scheduled shutdowns, they all ran full. And as you know, we got the benefit of price
improvements. So it was an across the board accomplishment of just great operations.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I think also, Mark, the 30 million
that Kathy gave you for the quarter is maintenance spend, and it doesn't account for the fact of the downtime that
happened in the second quarter.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay, okay. Do you have a sense as to how much the downtime costs? And perhaps another
way to come at it, it seems like you – would it be fair to say that you roughly took half your annual maintenance
downtime in the second quarter? And so roughly how much is full year annual maintenance spend/downtime? How
much does that cost the company typically in a given year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think your assumption about roughly half in the
second quarter is correct. As Patty said, we had downtime in two mills in the first quarter, three in the second quarter,
we've got one coming up in the fourth quarter. I don't have the numbers that you're asking for specifically. But we can
get back to you.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Some other things in the quarter,
Mark, was we had somewhat lower fiber cost, lower chemical cost, and as I said, the productivity impact from just not
having those mills down was really the primary reasons for the improved performance of third over second quarter.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And just switching gears to building products. With prices having been falling during
the quarter, I imagine that makes it very difficult for the distribution business because effectively they're chasing the
price down, were their significant losses in building products distribution be tied to that?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, that's part of the overall loss, you're right.
There is a – we have a distribution business that primarily services our engineered wood products and OSB. So as
products flow through that system, prices are moving as quickly as they have been. We incur additional loss plus there's
some loss in that business that is associated with low utilization. At the level of activity that we're at today, not only do
we have underutilized manufacturing facilities, but our distribution system is underutilized and all of that increases
your operating costs.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And then one last real quick one. Pension contributions year-to-date, I think were
running about 190 million. So that's roughly 60 million, a little bit more than that per quarter. Is that kind of a decent
number on a go-forward, or do you expect that's going to change significantly in the year ahead?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure, Mark. As you think about
our pension plans, we have about – the largest plans are in the U.S. but we do have a number of Canadian plans as well.
As you look at the U.S. plans, we don't expect to have to make any contributions to those in 2011. The Canadian plans
don't all have annual valuations. Some of them are done on a tri-annual basis. We do have a larger number of them that
will need valuation this year and we will likely need to make contribution to the Canadian plan in 2011. We would
expect that when we add them all together, and we're doing those valuations, beginning that process, as we speak. So I
don't have exact numbers for you. But I would expect that that could be up to $100 million for all the Canadian plans,
but nothing anticipated for the U.S plans.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Richard Skidmore>: Good morning, thank you. Dan, maybe just on the wood products business for a moment,
can you – you talked about some closures in the fourth quarter. Are those likely to be temporary type of closures or
indefinite closures?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I can't comment specifically today, Rick. As I
mentioned, we already have a number of facilities that are indefinitely closed. We have – our operating facilities that
have various levels of utilization and so we're looking at the entire system and will be taking some action but I can't
comment whether it would be temporary or permanent closures. We are taking shift downtime in a number of our
facilities based upon today's level of demand as we have throughout the year.
<Q - Richard Skidmore>: And can you quantify, Dan, how much the indefinite closures actually cost you in a
quarter?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I can, but I don't have that number today. But we
can get back to you. We have closure costs where we provide security, we have when a mill's closed we have some
on-site people for some low levels of maintenance and security and we have depreciation that's related to those mills.
All of that runs through our P&L.

<Q - Richard Skidmore>: I guess the question that I'm ultimately trying to get at is, as you look at your sort of
thought on the U.S. housing recovery being a gradual grind higher from here over the next number of years, if there's
not a need to maybe take more permanent closures and take off some of those expenses that you're incurring each
quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: And Rick, that is something that
we are looking at as a part of this review. We don't have any decisions to share with you this morning. I think a way to
think about that cost is – and it's differential but it's probably in the neighborhood of $5 million to $10 million a quarter.
<Q - Richard Skidmore>: Okay, and then one last question, big picture. Dan, as you go to the Board here in the next
month or two talking about the dividend. Can you just frame how you're thinking about that and some of the things that
you're considering as you think about setting or proposing what the dividend should be as you go forward?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Absolutely. Our Board's intent is to set a dividend
that is sustainable and one that we can grow over time. In considering the appropriate level of that dividend, we start by
looking at the overall macroeconomic climate. We have an evaluation of our own forecast for earnings over the next
several years. We are looking at the level of dividend paid by other timber REITs. We're taking into consideration an
appropriate capital structure for the company, including appropriate level of debt, the need to maintain access to capital
markets and have appropriate liquidity as we go forward, and then longer-term we need to plan for growing the
business, especially the core asset of our timberlands. So all of that becomes part of the calculus for determining what
we believe is an appropriate level. And as I said, we'll be communicating that once the Board makes a decision in
December.

Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My three quick questions are all based on cellulose
fibers. First of all, with respect to Cosmopolis, I assume that there's a non-compete clause, they will not be doing
anything that's in grades that you're active in?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, that's a dissolving pulp mill and it does not
compete with any of our pulp grades.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: And then could you characterize your 1.7 million tons of capacity? How much is
commodity, how much is fluff and then what volume do you have that's in higher end products?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have five pulp mills, four in the U.S. South and
one in Grand Prairie, Alberta. The mills in the South primarily produce absorbent fluff. Our Grand Prairie mill
produces NBSK, and we have a facts book where we publish actually the capacity for each of these mills. They get you
up to that $1.7 million capacity level. Fundamentally, the U.S. South product is heavily focused to what we would
consider to be specialty pulp that is going to these large customers that are using it for absorbent products like diapers,
feminine hygiene, adult incontinence.
Roughly, if you think about our pulp business and the markets that we serve, roughly one third is North America, one
third Asia, one third Europe. Those percentages shift a little bit over time. But the business gives us great exposure to
global growth and especially what we're seeing from our customers is that they have significant growth opportunities in
emerging markets. The one consistent theme that we hear from our customers in the pulp business is that they are
growing, they need our product, and so we're really pleased with the performance, but also the outlook for that
business.

<Q - Steven Chercover>: Great, I did think it was absorbent. So there is quite a bit of capacity coming on stream, do
you believe that the demand is sufficient to absorb that capacity? No pun intended.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, long-term, I love the pun. Long-term – very
confident of the need for that capacity. When it comes on line, you're referring to a couple of conversions so, we've got
Alabama Pine and also the Don Tarp Plymouth mill that are converting to fluff, that will create in the short-term some
new supply. And so there may be a short-term disruption in the market, but long-term, all of that supply is needed as
long as – I mean, we have this unique characteristic of fiber coming out of the U.S. South from Southern Yellow Pine
that's manufactured into that fluff. That is the desired product worldwide for the absorbent products. And so what we're
seeing is – we're seeing this very strong growth globally as our customers penetrate new markets.

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Atkinson with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Stephen Atkinson>: Good afternoon. With relates to the credits, talking about the bio alternative fuel credit
versus the cellulosic credit. If I understand it correctly, you have 149 million relating to the cellulosic credit, are you
allowed to use the same two in one year or do you have to return the alternative fuel credits you've already received and
then redo the process?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the number that I referred
to was the number for the credit for primarily the black liquor produced in the first quarter of 2009. And in the first
quarter of 2009, we were not lending for the alternative fuel mixture tax credit. So that gallonage of about 238 million,
I think it was, would all be available for the cellulosic producer's tax credit.
Now what you're referring to is that, is there a potential to unwind the alternative fuel mixture tax credit that we already
took and replace it with the biofuel producers tax credit. And that's something that I think still from a procedural
standpoint, is being worked out with the IRS. But the numbers that I referred to are for a period of time where we did
not have the alternative fuel mixture tax credit.

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - George Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. I jumped on late and I'm guessing that you've already
answered several questions on wood products. My question would be, Dan, if you haven't already answered it, the
changes that you're making in the quarter as you're thinking about the business relative to your operating stance within
wood products. It's just a reflection of – it is a deeper cyclical downturn or more pernicious recovery, or do you think
that you will be changing your overall philosophy regarding wood products businesses that you're in and how they fit
within the portfolio going forward?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have two issues, George. One is the depth of the
housing recession and the slow recovery that I referred to. So even if we were to go back a year ago and look at our
housing forecast and that of most economists, what we're experiencing is 2010 was a lower level of starts than anyone

anticipated and a longer climb out of this for a variety of reasons. I talked this morning about – we still have an issue
with consumer confidence, we have an issue with employment, we've got an issue with an overhang of inventory and
then we have this new event which is the foreclosure problem and the documentation related to mortgage securities.
So that causes us to need to react to a more pessimistic near-term forecast. And what that means for us is we need to
adjust capacity to today's level of starts. As we do that, we're also taking the time to evaluate all of our operations. We
believe we have opportunities to both enhance revenues as well as to takeout operating costs, both in our mills and in
our SG&A. So it's a full court effort on all fronts and as I mentioned earlier it's the highest priority we've got right now.
<Q - George Staphos>: Okay, so you feel in total you have the stable of businesses perhaps that you'll have into the
recovery, it's just a combination of a cycle just being a little bit more difficult to climb out of and ways to optimize
costs within that stable of business? Would that be the fair characterization?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's a fair characterization but as I've said before,
all of our businesses need to be operating over the cycle at top quartile levels of performance within their respective
industries. And we are not operating at that level in our wood products business today. So that's why we need to
address it and we need to improve it.

<Q - Joshua Zaret>: Two questions and then a follow-up on someone else. Dan, I read in the press that you either
have restarted or are about to restart two lines at your Hudson Bay OSB mill. What's the thinking there and would you
be closing down something somewhere else to compensate for that? You know, given this market, it's kind of
surprising.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good questions. Our situation at Hudson Bay is that
that mill has been shut down for an extended period the time. And were we to leave it in its current state we would be
subject to additional costs including severance. And as a result, we made the decision to restart the mill and we'll be
aligning its posture as we go forward in a disciplined manner with production across all of our operations. There will be
a slow start. We'll have little production this year, we will start to see some next year and then we'll balance it across
the system. But fundamentally, it was a decision related to cost of extended shut versus reopening.
<Q - Joshua Zaret>: Great, thank you. That clears that up. And second, export log volume, can you give us your
volume year-to-date this year versus year-to-date last year? Are we to assume it would be a big step up and if there's
been any shift in mix there?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't have that number right in front of me. Let me
just talk about the nature of it a bit. One of the things that we've seen over the past year is there's been a mix shift. So as
we think export, historically for us, that's Japan. But over the last couple of years, export off of our Western
timberlands operations includes not only Japan but it is China and Korea. We've seen a pick-up in logs going to China
that for us really started two, three years ago as we were harvesting storm damaged wood off of the West coast of
Washington and Oregon. That was low quality, low price but it was a great takeaway. And what's happened is that we
have been able to develop an improved position in that market. The quality of logs has increased, we're shipping
Douglas Fir logs to China, we've got white wood going to Korea. And then as you know, the long-term quality Doug
Fir continues to go to Japan. The amount of exported volume is up out of the West about 15%.

<Q - Joshua Zaret>: Okay. And then...
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And then as I mentioned, that's really favorable for
us. We have long-term relationships in the export markets. We've got great logistics coming out of our Western
timberlands. So we are well positioned to take advantage of that and with domestic markets, which continue to be slow,
it has been beneficial for us as a takeaway for the logs coming out of our Western timberlands and we would expect
that that will continue over time.
<Q - Joshua Zaret>: In the old days, there used to be about a $400 – 1,000 board foot premium for Japan over the
domestic market, then it evaporated. Has that ever come back?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I can't comment on the specific spread.
<Q – Joshua Zaret: Fair enough. Let me give you my last question, because I think it's an important one. Everyone's
danced around the maintenance for cellulose, the maintenance charge spend. You gave us guidance in the second
quarter of 30 million, zero in the third quarter, what's it going to be in the fourth quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: The shut in the fourth quarter,
Josh, is a short shut at one facility. So it'll just be – probably a little around a week or so. So it won't be as significant in
terms of relative to the second quarter where we had most of our annual maintenance downtime. And the loss tonnage
won't be as significant either.
<Q - Joshua Zaret>: Okay, if that's the best you can do. I appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You bet.
Kathryn F. McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you very much for joining us this morning. I'm sorry, I'm going to turn the call back to Dan.
Daniel S. Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer
Just some concluding comments, I wanted to just close the call and summarize our key themes for the third quarter and
our current view of the fourth quarter. So as we entered the third quarter, we anticipated improved performance in our
cellulose fibers business and we delivered record results. In our wood products business, we were already feeling the
pain of rapidly falling prices and it was a very difficult quarter for us. With housing activity near record lows as we
entered the quarter, we expected breakeven results for WRECO and we turned in our third consecutive profitable
quarter.
And in timberlands, operating earnings were lower as expected and our non-strategic land sales enabled us to increase
earnings quarter-over-quarter. So as we move to the fourth quarter, we're especially cautious about the near-term
direction of the housing market, and we're planning accordingly. We're committed to improving profitability at today's
level of demand and we'll continue to take necessary action to reduce costs and improve profitability.
And with that, I'd like to thank you for your attention this morning. And we look forward to talking to all of you in
December. Thanks very much.
Kathryn F. McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations
