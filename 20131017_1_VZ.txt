Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I'd like to cover a few special items that are included in our
reported results. These are displayed on slide four. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a
GAAP basis. These results, including net gain on the sale of 700 [MHz] B block spectrum of $0.02 per share, offset by
net incremental interest expense of $0.01 per share related to the debt we have raised to finance the acquisition of the
remaining 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. We have accounted for the gain on the spectrum sale at the corporate level,
so it is completely excluded from Wireless segment results.
Excluding these non-operational effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.77 in the third quarter, compared with
$0.64 a year ago. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share was $2.18 compared with $1.87 last year. Our discussion of
operating results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of these two items, and they are not part of
our segment results. Finally, the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis,
unless otherwise noted as sequential.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our key strategic networks and platforms; Wireless 4G
LTE, FiOS and Enterprise strategic services drove very strong operating performance and financial results. Our
consolidated revenue growth rate increased once again, and our focus on cost efficiency and improved profitability
resulted in double-digit growth in both operating income and earnings per share, which we have delivered in every
quarter this year.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 was up 20.3%. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of $2.18,
represents 16.6% growth. In Wireless, we had another very strong quarter of growth and profitability. We posted
sequential quarterly improvement in terms of new retail connections and smartphones. Total retail net adds were 1.1
million, which included 927,000 high-quality postpaid net adds.
Service revenue growth increased to 8.4%. EBITDA increased 10.7%, and our EBITDA service margin was 51.1%. All
of this was accomplished with 7.6 million smartphone activations this quarter, which was up sequentially, and 12.5%
higher than last year.
Our Wireline results in the third quarter also showed improvement. Consumer revenue increased 4.3%, driven by FiOS
penetration. Enterprise strategic services revenue grew 5.2%. Total Wireline segment EBITDA increased 3.8%, and the
EBITDA margin improved to 22.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially, and 100 basis points year-over-year.
Our strong operating performance and disciplined capital spending is driving growth in free cash flow. On a
year-to-date basis, free cash flow increased $3.1 billion, to $16.6 billion, an increase of more than 23%. All-in-all, we
had a great third quarter, capped off by a lot of activity since Labor Day.
We announced an agreement with Vodafone to acquire its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. The transaction will be
accretive to earnings per share, provide additional operating cash flows, and enable greater flexibility to develop
converged solutions without any integration and due diligence risks.
The capital market environment was strong. And we had a fully executed bridge facility in place at the date of the
announcement. We successfully arranged, in one day, the required permanent bond financing with a $49 billion debt
offering. And earlier this month, we signed an agreement for up to $12 billion in term loans. Last week, we filed a
Form S-4 registration statement and our proxy statement with the SEC, related to the pending transaction.
Lastly, in a demonstration of their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows, our Board of Directors approved
a quarterly dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year. So we've been busy and productive on the transaction
front, but as always, our primary focus is driving strong operating results.
Now let's look at our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with consolidated results on slide six. Total
operating revenue grew 4.4%, continuing our solid top line growth trend. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of

growth in excess of 4%. The increase in consolidated revenues, along with effective cost management, resulted in
16.8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter.
On the same adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased to $11 billion, up 9.7%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin
expanded 170 basis points to 36.3%, which is the highest consolidated margin in more than five years.
Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide seven. Our consistent investment in
Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall
customer experience. We will continue to build on our network advantage in 4G LTE by deploying capital to provide
additional capacity and density to our network.
We will also be opportunistic in terms of acquiring new spectrum. In short, we will continue to focus on executing our
game plan. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate our ability to create strong operating momentum and deliver
excellent results. We continue to perform extremely well in a highly competitive market.
Total Wireless revenues grew to $20.4 billion in the quarter, representing 67% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. We
sustained our strong service revenue performance with 8.4% growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in excess
of 8%. EBITDA increased to $8.9 billion, and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 110 basis points to 51.1%.
Year-to-date, our EBITDA service margin is 50.4%. Our Wireless profitability has been very consistent with margins
of 49% or higher in five of the last six quarters.
Let's now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide eight. Service revenue
growth continued to be driven by increasing connections, data usage and smartphone penetration gains. Our Share
Everything plans are driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in increases in both the number of
devices and revenue per account.
During the third quarter, retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 7.1% to nearly $156 per month. We have
35 million postpaid accounts, and average connections increased to 2.72 per account, up 4.6%.
Customer adoption of our Share Everything plans has been exceptional. In just 15 months, 42% of our postpaid
accounts are on these plans. The value proposition is simple and straightforward. Our customers quickly recognized the
value of shared data across multiple devices, particularly in our 4G LTE environment.
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on slide nine. In the third quarter, retail net additions increased by 1.1
million, up 2.2% sequentially. As I highlighted earlier, we had 927,000 postpaid net adds. In terms of the makeup of
these postpaid net adds, we added more than 1 million smartphones, which was a 5% sequential increase. Including the
decline in basic phones, total phone net adds were 481,000. We added 370,000 new Internet devices, including tablets.
The remaining net adds of about 76,000 were primarily Home Phone Connect. We did encounter iPhone supply
constraints that created a backlog at the end of September, which resulted in some carry-over to the fourth quarter.
Within prepaid, we added 134,000 new retail connections, which was 38% higher than the second quarter. We ended
the quarter with 101.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base reached 95.2
million, with the balance being prepaid.
We maintained a high quality mix within our retail connections growth. Postpaid gross additions increased sequentially
to 3.7 million. 73% of these gross adds were phones, including 2.2 million smartphones, both of which were higher
than first or second quarter.
The number of customer upgrades in the quarter remained fairly steady on a sequential basis, with a postpaid upgrade
rate of 6.9%. The upgrade rate was also slightly affected by inventory constraints. As you would expect, a significant
percentage of our upgrades are smartphones, which continue to benefit us from a service revenue perspective. About
33% of customers upgrading to smartphones this quarter were purchasing one for the first time. A majority of the
remaining upgrades are moving from a 3G to a 4G smartphone, which we are able to monetize through higher data
usage and lower cost to serve. And while upgrades are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect
that our annual upgrade rate will be about the same as last year. Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Our
retail postpaid churn was 0.97%.

Next, let's turn to slide 10 and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations,
which include both gross adds and upgrades, totaled 10.2 million in the quarter, representing both a sequential and
year-over-year increase. Similar to first and second quarter, 88% of the activations were phones. Smartphone
activations totaled 7.6 million, and 77% of these were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced once again,
with roughly 51% of the activations being iPhones.
Our smartphone penetration continues to improve, and we ended the quarter at over 67%. We also had another strong
quarter of Internet device activations, which topped 1 million again in the quarter. 4G device penetration within our
postpaid base continued at a rapid pace. 38% of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G, up from 33% in the second
quarter, and 17% one year ago.
More than 50% of our smartphones and 70% of our Internet devices are 4G. Currently, about 64% of our total data
traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to add capacity and
optimize our 4G LTE network, ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they
expect from our network and devices.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting on slide 11. Our Wireline investments in platforms such as FiOS,
global IP, security, cloud services and machine to machine enable us to deliver the services, applications and solutions
that our customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will improve our overall
cost structure.
In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive revenue trends, highlighted by sustained FiOS
growth. For the last five quarters, consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the third quarter, revenues were
up 4.3%, driven of course by FiOS, which now represents about 72% of consumer revenue.
Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased to nearly $113, up 8.7%. Roughly two-thirds of our FiOS customers
are triple play, which have a much higher amount of recurring revenue per month. We had a good quarter of FiOS
customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 173,000 new FiOS Internet additions, and now have 5.9 million
subscribers, representing 39% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 56,000.
In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS Quantum
offers for higher broadband speeds. More than half our FiOS Internet sales in the quarter were at speeds in excess of 50
megabits per second, and just over 40% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to Quantum, with speeds ranging
from 50 megabits per second to 500 megabits per second. The incremental revenue from higher broadband speed is
contributing to overall consumer revenue growth.
In FiOS Video, we added 135,000 new subscribers in the quarter, up 13.4%. Total FiOS Video customers reached 5.2
million, representing 35% penetration. We also continued to make steady progress with copper migrations. During the
quarter, we converted about 80,000 customers. Through nine months, we've converted nearly 250,000 customers. So
we are on track to exceed our target of 300,000 customers for the year. By year-end, we estimate that less than 1
million consumer customers will be remaining on copper services within our FiOS footprint.
This network evolution initiative is important for us as we systemically reduce our dependence on older technologies.
Aside from the maintenance expense savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also
provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional ARPU over time.
Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail
residential connections declined by 4.9%, compared with a loss of 6.3% at this time last year.
Let's move to our Enterprise markets next on slide 12. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $113
million or 3%. Legacy CPE sales were down 21%, and represented $91 million of the year-over-year decline.
Excluding the quarterly decline in CPE, Global Enterprise revenue was down less than 1%. Keep in mind that our
Global Enterprise revenue includes both federal and state government. Strategic services, which now comprise 58% of
Enterprise revenue, grew 5.2%.

We continue to work through economic challenges in the Enterprise space. In the public sector, we are seeing the
effects of sequestering, budget cut backs and contract renewals. In the private sector, many Enterprise customers are
more focused on improving their cost structure, which puts pressure on our top line revenue. Generally speaking,
Enterprise customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions.
Moving next to Global Wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $113 million or 6.3%. While this quarter is an
improvement, the revenue pressure is driven by the continued decline in legacy transport services. As we have stated,
our wholesale strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to
next-generation Ethernet services.
In terms of profitability, while growth in Enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in
the rest of Global Enterprise and Wholesale continue to put pressure on Wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean
Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost structuring programs and retooling efforts, which we
believe will ultimately improve our operating efficiency.
Let's now turn to slide 13. To summarize our overall Wireline results, total operating revenues were down 1% in the
quarter. FiOS and strategic services continued their positive growth trends, while Global Enterprise and Wholesale
were pressured by declines in legacy transport services and CPE. Excluding the decline in legacy CPE, our revenue
performance this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year.
In terms of Wireline profitability, third quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of
22.7%. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was 22.1%. We continue to expect that our full-year
EBITDA margin will be similar to 2012, excluding the effects of Sandy from last year's results. We also continue to
target improved profitability and margin expansion in 2014.
Let's turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation in the quarter remained very strong.
On a year-to-date basis, cash flows from operations increased to $28.4 billion. Free cash flow increased to $16.6
billion, up 23%. This does not include the $1.9 billion of proceeds from the sale of a 700 B spectrum licenses, which is
included in cash flows from investing activities.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion and were $11.8 billion year-to-date, up 4.3%. We estimate that
full-year 2013 capital spending will be approximately $16.6 billion. We are very focused on improving investment
returns and capital efficiency, and expect that our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio will improve, even with the planned
additional spending in 4G LTE.
Wireless capital spending in the third quarter totaled $2.5 billion. Year-to-date, Wireless CapEx was $6.7 billion,
10.8% higher than last year. As noted on our last quarterly call, our 4G LTE coverage build is essentially completed. So
our capital spending going forward will be focused on adding capacity and density to our existing coverage. We are
utilizing our AWS spectrum to further optimize the network, and we are already spending some of the incremental
capital we allocated to Wireless capacity.
In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.5 billion year-to-date, which was down 3.2%
from last year.
In terms of the balance sheet, total debt increased to $99.1 billion due to the permanent financing we've put in place
related to the pending transaction to obtain full ownership of Verizon Wireless. However, since we do have the cash
until the close of the transaction, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained quite low at about 1.1 times.
Let's summarize. Our third quarter results were very strong, showing consistent performance in all our key strategic
growth areas. In Wireless, continued strong growth in service revenue, coupled with high-quality connections growth,
and the success of our Share Everything plans are driving double-digit growth in EBITDA and very strong cash
generation. We continue to lead the industry in profitability, and we are on track to deliver 49% to 50% EBITDA
margins for the full year. We also expect to see customer growth increase sequentially in the fourth quarter.
In Wireline, consumer revenue growth of more than 4% continues to be driven by FiOS, where we are on track to
achieve our net subscriber growth targets. In Enterprise, we continue to focus on strategic services and have announced

our new Verizon Cloud strategy.
In terms of an update on our pending transaction to gain full ownership of Verizon Wireless, our permanent financing
is secured, and we have taken out our bridge financing facility. An S-4 registration statement and our proxy statement
were filed on October 8, and are under review by the SEC. You can access these filings on our investor relations
website or the SEC website. Efforts are underway to obtain the required regulatory and shareholder approvals. We
expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2014.
Overall, a great third quarter. We are focused on continuing our momentum and finishing the year strong. With that, I
will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thank you, Fran. Brad, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] One moment for our first
question. Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two quick ones; first on the Wireless margins; Fran,
how much of an impact did the Edge plan and the 24-month upgrade cycle have in the strong margins you guys posted
in the third quarter? And then how should those issues effect the fourth quarter? And then, I saw you talked about the
uptick you had in the Wireless CapEx. You talked about the AWS deployment. Can you give us a little bit more detail
on how that gets laid over? And just sort of how quickly can you get some more capacity into the market on the LTE
side?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, good. Thanks, John. So on the VZW margin – so Edge; keep in mind, we launched
Edge at the very end of August. It really didn't – really pick up speed until September. Our indirect channels did not get
it until the very, very end of the quarter. So there really was no impact from the Edge program to these results. I mean,
we'll see more in the fourth quarter, and we'll wait to get to that to report it out, but very, very immaterial impact.
On the 24-month cycle, it's very hard for us to determine, because again, people are proactive on when they upgrade to
a cycle basis. Of course, it did delay some of the upgrades from going from that – the 20-month to the 24-month, and
that went into effect on September 1; so again, only really 30 days of impact there. We'll probably see more of that in
the fourth quarter.
As far as the VZW margin impact from the two of them; I would say very, very limited in this quarter. And you can see
why the margin was the way it was, just from a – an overall revenue increase, and some of the cost containment
measures that we have been putting in place for quite some time, and we can talk more about that.
As far as CapEx goes; so here's where we're at. Obviously, we know that we've completed the coverage build of our 4G
LTE. And obviously, if you look at our map, it's pretty significant coverage, compared to our competitors. And now,
post June, all of our efforts have gone into the capacity and densification. And given where we are, if you look at some
of the metrics; I mean, if you think about 38% of our customers are on the 4G network, and they're generating 64% of
the data usage; this is a pretty significant volume of usage going through that network.
And we know that, given the growth of this, we've had some densification issues in major cities like New York,
Chicago, San Francisco, and we are totally focused on those types of issues. And what you see us doing is being very
proactive in more in-building coverage, more densification cell sites, launching the AWS spectrum. So you're going to
see that through the fourth quarter, and that's why we increased the CapEx spending.

But I think the walk-away here is, is that we are extremely focused on our network. It is our brand. We will continue to
perform in this area. And also, the return here, if you think about every dollar I put into that network when you have
64% of the data on a tiered Share Everything plan, you can see that coming through from our revenue. So the return on
the invested capital is pretty immediate, and it's pretty significant. So we will continue to concentrate on that effort.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, Fran
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay. Brad, we're ready for the next call.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess focused on Wireline; first, the
FiOS volumes, very, very strong quarter in broadband, I think adds up almost 30% year-over-year. Saying that, the
extent to which video is bundled to this looks to have taken a bit of a hit in the quarter. I think there's a 40,000
disconnect between broadband adds and video adds on the FiOS side. That's much larger than normal. Can you help us
think through that?
And then second, just on Wireline margins. Good progress in the quarter on margins. The comment on margin
expansion for 2014; maybe you can help us think through – is there anything that that necessarily relies on? For
instance, if Enterprise is still under pressure next year, does that put pressure on margins or can you grow margins
despite that? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, Jason. All right, so on the FiOS broadband, we did have a very, very
good quarter from a net add perspective, especially on a year-over-year basis, and especially since – when you look
back in history, third quarter is normally a very high churn quarter for us. Keep in mind a couple things here; so on the
broadband side of the house, you have to remember that as we do 80,000 migrations from our copper, who are voice
and DSL only, over to FiOS, you're getting voice and FiOS Quantum adds.
And as I've talked before, we really don't approach these customers on a TV product for about five months to six
months. And then it takes us about another three months to four months of marketing to actually see some success in
conversion. And we see about a 30% conversion once we do that. They're really interested in the broadband speed, and
of course, what you see in the Wireline segment today is as we migrate these customers from the copper product to the
FiOS product, we're bringing them over at the same price.
But what we see is almost immediately, with the speeds that they're getting in the FiOS Quantum, they themselves are
choosing to upgrade right into that 50 megabits, and at times now, even into the 75 megabit product. So their ARPU is
going up, which is generating some of this Wireline increase that you see. So TV net adds were up 35 – 13% year over
year.
Now granted, I mean, some of these adds we've got came from some of the disputes that happened in the competitive
nature here during the quarter, but still, even without that, we would've seen an increase year-over-year in our
productivity and our penetration of FiOS. So we're very happy with where we are, but TV will always lag when we do
these migrations.
On the Wireline margin, look, I think I've been pretty consistent here with where we think Wireline is going. And I am
still very confident that 2014 will show improvement. And just to keep everyone grounded here, the reason I say this is
as I'm looking at Enterprise as being flat with no substantial growth, and we can talk about just the continued disruption
that's coming out of Washington and the uncertainty, and I think that will continue at least in the short term here, given
what happened last night, and extending some of this into the first quarter; what's going to happen? What's going to
happen when we get to December 31 on the cliff jump off, as we had last year with some of the tax preference items?
So I still think there's a lot of swirl going on, and just a lot of uncertainty. And Enterprise is going to sit on the sideline.
But as I look at 2014, I'm looking at that's going to be flat. So what do we see? We see continued progress in a FiOS

penetration. As I said, I'm very comfortable with 4% plus growth in revenue here going forward. I continue to think
that we will penetrate all of our markets and continue to gain share, both in broadband and TV.
And also keep in mind, as I said before, with the Hughes Telematics acquisition, VDMS and Redbox, they have all
been headwinds this year, because we've gotten them up to started, and we're eating some of the upstart costs with
them. That, I believe, starts to diminish in 2014, which actually helps. And with Hughes, they start to generate more
revenues. VDMS starts to generate revenues.
So there's a lot of things happening, but I also think we can't lose sight of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma efforts on our
cost initiatives that we have in our Wireline business. And you're starting to see some of these efforts start to come
through on our efficiency side of the house. So we are very, very optimistic that we can continue to move the Wireline
profitability forward.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great. That's really helpful. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, let's take the next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Philip Cusick>: Hey, guys, thanks. I think we all continue to be surprised with the Wireless service revenue
growth. Can you talk about where customers are in terms of taking more data than the minimum? How many customers
or how many families, or per devices are taking more than the sort of a standard 2 gig package per device? And where
does 4G usage look now? And if not an actual number, then versus where average usage was a year ago? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, Phil. So on the Wireless service growth, I think, obviously, I'm not
going to get into exactly how many customers break bundles and all of that. But I think there's some things that we
have to understand here that's driving this.
So first off, if you look at this quarter, again, we had a very strong quarter with 480,000 smartphone adds that are very
high-quality. And these are all coming in mostly on our 4G and shared price plans. Some of these are 3G phones,
obviously. But the majority is coming in on our 4G product.
The other thing I think you have to understand too is that we're coming up on the anniversary dates of the 3G when the
iPhone was launched, and those customers now are upgrading to 4G phones and moving into shared price plans. And if
you look at 3G usage and the customers moving into 4G, and they start to utilize this LTE network, they're starting to
realize the benefits of that, and their usage significantly goes up from where they were in 3G.
So that's stimulating, even if we come over, and I've said before, the way our sales force is approaching this is they
recommend two gigs for every device that a customer brings into shared pricing. So even with that, you think about that
usage versus a 3G device usage; that in itself is pretty significantly higher. So that drives the revenue.
Then, you look at the tablets and the Internet devices. You get into machine to machine connections; our machine to
machine, it continues to escalate quarter-after-quarter. And then of course, then, we look at the prepaid side of the
house. So I think it's a combination of all of these things that are driving that.
And when you think about 42% of our base is on shared plans, we still have a long way to go of converting a lot of that
3G product over to the 4G and into those shared plans. So there's still a lot of runway here to continue to grow this
revenue stream for us.
So that's that. And then, I think I answered the 4G versus the 3G usage.
<Q - Philip Cusick>: And then, if I can just follow up quickly on your government comment a few minutes ago; it
sounds like you're a little cautious on 4Q in terms of Enterprise decision making and things like that. Is that a fair read?

<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I think the cautious is, Phil, I don't see anything changing here from 3Q to 4Q. And
again, you heard me say that keep in mind, our federal and state government are in our Enterprise segment. And that
really is declining faster than the rest of the segment right now. Now the positive to this is, is that within our cloud
services, it's fairly flat. So where we see the federal government during the sequestering period pulling back in some
area,; they're actually buying some of the data center and cloud products. So there is a balance here, but I don't think
things get a lot worse, but I don't see them getting any better.
<Q - Philip Cusick>: Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, let's take the next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, I wonder if you could update us on the VoLTE
rollout and when we're going to start to see that, and when you start to see the benefit of lower smartphone costs and
lower subsidies going forward. You touched briefly relating to Vodafone about the ability to bring converged solutions
together; maybe you can expand on that a little bit and talk a little bit more about what we might see from the cable
joint venture over the next few quarters. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, Simon. So on VoLTE rollout, we are still on track. You'll probably see
us have a VoLTE capable handset here in the fourth quarter, and as we said that we will light up the VoLTE rollout
starting in the first half of next year. So we're still very much on track on that one.
As far as lower smartphone cost and subsidies; look, I think the ecosystem has a lot here. You're going to see a lot of
new and innovative product come out in the fourth quarter. But subsidy is done on a handset by handset, manufacturer
by manufacturer. And then obviously, as you've heard me say before; the more manufacturers we can get into this
ecosystem and it really comes down to an operating system, the more competitive nature this marketplace will become.
So I still believe that that will happen. Obviously, you've heard me talk about VoLTE will contribute to some, as we
start to remove some of the CDMA chip, but then there's other technologies like multi-class – multicast that will be put
into the phone. So there's a lot of technologies being removed from the phone, but new technologies that are being
implemented into the phone. So this is going to be a long path, but I do think, as I said before, subsidies will gradually
come down over the next two years to three years.
On the converged solutions side, look, I mean as far as the joint venture with the cable companies; we've talked about
we still have a distribution agreement with one another, and we continue to work with one another to sell each other's
products. But the other – the marketing joint venture or co-development has been terminated, and we're moving in our
separate ways on that.
And what you're going to see here is as we talked about Verizon Wireless, the acquisition of Verizon Wireless; we now
get to more of a converged middle with our consumer products between FiOS and Wireless, and we no longer have the
artificial wall up between the affiliate transactions or anything like that. So I won't talk about what you'll see, but I
think what you'll see from us is a move forward of bringing to the customer the best product available between
Wireline and Wireless.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Michael Rolland (sic) [Michael Rollins] (39:31) of Citi Investment Research. Your line
is open.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions; first on Verizon Wireless; if you can
give us an update, Fran, on the net debt? And then secondly, on the Wireline side, I think you mentioned that you have
less than 1 million copper customers in your FiOS footprint, if I got that quote correct. Can you talk about the
significance of that in terms of the opportunity to take those remaining copper customers and get them over to the
fiber? And the potential cost savings that you could generate by moving to fiber, and really getting to one network
architecture within your FiOS footprint for at least the residential customers? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay. Thanks, Mike. So I guess this should be the last quarter I have to answer this
question on net debt. So gross debt for wireless is $10.2 billion; cash is $6.6 billion, net is $3.6 billion.
On the Wireline side, yes, you did get the quote right. So there will be less than 1 million customers that are on copper
within our FiOS footprint. And you see us from our migration strategy in the last two years – I think in the last two
years now, when we exceed our 300,000 for this year, we have – we will have moved close to 600,000 customers from
our copper network into our FiOS network. We will continue to approach this migration.
Now, if you think that we do 300,000 a year, you're looking at three more years to get that completed. But we will
continue to try to accelerate as much as we can. And from a cost benefit, obviously, what you're seeing is some of those
benefits coming through the Wireline results today, just from a repair metric; from a truck-roll metric. The reliability of
this network is drastically different than the reliability of the copper network. So you're going to see us continue to
invest in the FiOS infrastructure.
One of the things that we're doing now is the network team has been working over the last year in provisioning the
FiOS network into our Enterprise and small business customers, using the GPON technology. So we fully expect to
utilize this FiOS backbone much more than it had been in the past. So you're going to continue to see this migration,
and you're going to see the cost benefits coming through our operating results.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: And Fran, if I could just follow-up on one other thing; so if you think about your Wireline
footprint in total, are there any updated views on what you do outside of this core FiOS footprint?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, what you're going to see us do is obviously now we have done some of this in the
past, but using Wireless – our Fusion technology from a broadband perspective. So when we talk about converged
solutions and bringing the best solution to our end-user customer, this goes into what do we do with our copper
customers outside of the FiOS footprint? And what do we do for them from a voice perspective and also a DSL
perspective?
And obviously, we have Home Phone Connect, and we have Voice Link on the Wireline side that we've already started
to sell to our copper voice customers as a substitute to the copper product. So we've already done some of this, but
you're going to see more technology come out here in 2014 that's going to address these issues.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions; two, if I could. Fran, just on the Wireline side,
you – the consumer business has been really on fire, the best performing part of that entire segment right now. And it's
really been in the last two quarters or so that you've added about a $500 million worth of run-rate revenue in that
business. And I know FiOS actually was growing in terms of net adds faster last year on average than it's growing this
year. Can you talk a little bit about what the real drivers of that consumer business are?

And are they extract – can we extrapolate those into 2014? And just teasing apart your commentary about Enterprise, if
you took out the CPE, you were kind of talking about Enterprise being flattish – Global Enterprise being flattish
year-over-year, but obviously government is a weight on that. Is it then – can we interpret that the basic Enterprise
business coming from non-government sources is actually starting to grow year-over-year? If you could kind of
elaborate on that, that'd be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, David. So the Wireline consumer business; so look, I think when we
size this all up, we have some – we really have three main focuses. As I've talked to before, we have become a very
disciplined pricing strategy around our FiOS product. I mean – and when we looked at cable a number of years ago, we
looked at they were very, very disciplined in how they did price-ups to match their content costs. And we were not
really good with that, but we started this, as you know, last year, very early in the year, and we have a strategy going
forward. So we will continue to drive that strategy of pricing up the product, equivalent to our content cost increases.
If you look at the next level of concentration we've had; is we are going after market share. Now, as far as slowness in
the net adds; there is some seasonality here. There's always something that happens in the environment that causes us.
But look, I mean there is some – there are some markets that we're over 50% penetrated. So those markets have a
slower growth, but we are still gaining share in some of our later markets like New York City, Philadelphia,
Washington, which are, in my mind, under-penetrated to where they should be.
So you're going to see a little shift. There could be some slowness though, as we start to penetrate some of these
markets in 50%. But the fact of the matter here is that we still have a long runway. If you look at our 39% penetration,
we still have a long way to go from a net add perspective. The other thing that's driving this growth, and we can't lose
focus of it is the migration of these FiOS – of these copper customers over to FiOS. And as we convert them, as I said,
it may take us a little while, but then we'd get that uptick in our TV product along with that.
The other focus that we have too that is not in the top line, but really comes in through content; you see us doing some
very innovative things around negotiation of content, moving away from a per subscriber type content to more of a per
viewer type cost of content. So we're in a lot of conversations with content provides that we're willing to pay for people
who watch their programs, but were not willing to pay on an overall subscriber base. And we've been successful here
with some of the smaller tier content carriers. But that's also been benefiting the profitability of this product going
forward. So I think there's a whole combination of why we think that we will continue this 4% plus revenue increase
with continued penetration, and continued profitability in FiOS.
On the Enterprise side, when we say relatively flat, if you take out CPE, our decline in Enterprise will be 0.9% this
quarter versus – or 0.8% this quarter versus 0.9% last quarter. So the government is declining faster than that. I
wouldn't sit here and tell you that Enterprise is growing. We do have certain areas of our business that are growing. If
you look at our security product, if you look at our cloud products, if you look at the Terremark product; they are in
fact growing. Hughes is growing. But then you have the legacy voice and data that is not growing, and that's declining.
So net-net, I would say it's relatively flat without the government pressure.

Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks for taking the question. When you launched the Wireless deal, you had talked about
an objective of getting back to your pre-deal leverage levels. And I believe you said about four years to five years, but
correct me if that's wrong. But regardless of the timeframe, I was hoping maybe you could just come back and talk
about some of the foundational assumptions that support that goal? For example, do you expect to see capital intensity
continue to improve? I'm curious what you're assuming about your ability to maintain or even grow your Wireless

margins over that four-year to five-year period? And then lastly, can you give us any color on what you've budgeted for
spectrum purchases?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So look, I'm not going to get into the details on what we projected. I
mean, if you think about everything that we had to consider here, we considered tax, we considered CapEx, we
considered the incremental tax rate; as I said, our tax rate will increase to a 35% to 36% range from what we've always
guided from a 31% to 33% range. And that's because of the VZW coming over.
We had to project out what our interest rate was. We know that what that is now, based on the offering that we did. As
far as CapEx goes, I've been pretty consistent here. You should consider us improving our CapEx-to-revenue ratio
going forward. You should look at us as to what we've invested this year, and we're going to do what we need to do to
continue to invest in our networks and our platforms.
But moving out of this, there were three priorities that we set up to come to that four years to five years; one was we
will continue to invest in our networks and platforms. That is top priority for us. The next is we will continue to invest
and buy licenses, either opportunistically or in the auctions. I can't tell what you that number is, because obviously it's
going to be a public auction, and we have a lot of strategies around how we acquire licenses. But that was built into our
model. And then finally, the dividend policy is also a very critical piece of this component to our equity shareholders.
And I think our Board showed that when they increased the dividend at the same time that they announced the deal.
They're very confident in our cash flow. And then finally, we have a commitment that we will de-lever the balance
sheet as quickly as possible. So look, I think if you look at the performance, if you look at our cash flow and our free
cash flow this quarter, I think we're demonstrating that that four years to five years is within our horizon, and we will
meet our targets.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: And are you assuming you can maintain margins at roughly the same levels?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: I'm not going to get into giving guidance around margins. I think that – I think our
performance speaks for itself, and the margins speak for themselves.

Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much. And good morning, folks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Morning.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Fran, just a follow-up on the prior question around VoLTE rollout. What does this mean
in terms of network investment here? And specifically, what I'm trying to understand is, are you where you need to be
with respect to your network in order to provide ubiquitous VoLTE services nationwide? Or should we expect some
additional investment in order to get to that level?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. So, Amir, on this one; it's a good question, but look, the issue with VoLTE is
coverage. And as I've always said, we will not rush the VoLTE launch until we are sure that when you connect up a
VoLTE voice call, it will be very, very similar to a 3G CDMA call, because that's what our customers expect. They
know what the CDMA footprint is. They know where they can call. It's an unbelievable network. We have to make sure
that our VoLTE experience is the same.
And that's why we have taken such a long time. And we believe that when we get to the first half of next year, the
network will be ready; the experience will be very, very similar, and we'll be ready to roll this out. But it is already
built into the CapEx that we are spending. You should not see incremental CapEx for rolling VoLTE. It really is around

coverage. And it's – of course, it goes into the densification and capacities.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: That's very helpful. And if I may, just a follow-up here, somewhat of a bigger picture
question; as you mentioned, this is sort of the fourth consecutive quarter in which you folks have posted 8% plus
Wireless service revenue growth. How sustainable do you think this is going forward? And the way I'm thinking about
it is what advantage does now controlling the full cash flow of Verizon Wireless provide you in driving initiatives to
sustain this level of growth?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, again, it goes back to the earlier answer that there's a lot of things going here. And if
you look at just sustaining this growth, I think I've been pretty open that says, look, I can't sit here and tell you that 8%
growth is going to happen forever in Wireless. I mean, you're talking a huge base of revenue. So I do think that the
growth rate will come down over time.
But look, I mean there is so much technology being developed throughout the world that's running over LTE. If you
look at our Innovation Center in Waltham, and [ph] Lowell (52:59) is out at our Innovation Center that we just opened
up in San Francisco to welcome all the application developers into that center to – so it really comes down to the
application developers developing new technologies around LTE. So it's hard for me to determine what this continued
growth rate will be. But there is a lot of runway, there's a lot of technology, and the growth rate is still there.
Now, I will tell you that in the short term, I do believe that we can continue an 8% growth. But over the long-term, I
would tell you that I think that's probably a high aspiration.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. Thanks for the incremental color.

Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. You're line is open.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thanks. I wondered if you could review where you are specifically in terms of the AWS
rollout. I think it's been quoted that – from Nicki Palmer -- that you're going to end the year at 5,000 AWS sites. Where
are you at the end of Q3? And can you confirm the 5,000 number? And what the target would be at the end of 2014?
And also, maybe what kind of user speeds, uplink and downlink, you're seeing in the AWS markets versus the 700
[spectrum] markets, particularly in New York, Chicago, San Francisco where you've cited higher congestion?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah. So look, I mean we're not going to get into a speed
discussion, because speed has a lot to do with nobody's on the network, so obviously, you're going to generate a lot
higher speed. And what we're building the network for is a very consistent, reliable experience. And we've always said
that the network engineers have designed the LTE network when it is fully loaded, and that's the key here; when it's
fully loaded, and obviously, with 64% of data being driven through that network, it's pretty loaded. You're going to
experience, on average, 10 megabits to 12 megabits. Now, you'll get a burst of 20 megabits, 30 megabits. And I know
there was a report that came out with AWS of 80 megabits, but there's no one on the network.
So I think it would be irrelevant for me to speak to that. But here's the point. The point is as we are doing a lot around
our network, we're launching the AWS; as I said, we're launching a lot of technologies. And the city – the issues what
we're currently having in some of the larger cities with the densification, these were – these are started to be fixed in the
third quarter, and we're going to make a lot of progress in the fourth quarter. So I think that's really what's important
here. And it's – to me, it's kind of irrelevant how many cell sites have what. It all comes down to the quality of the
network, the reliability and the consistent performance of that network.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: And you touched on the incentive auction. How long do you think this AWS Spectrum can
carry you? And if the AWS – if the incentive auction gets pushed back for whatever reason, do you have enough
capacity in AWS to last you through 2016, 2015? What are the scenarios?

<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. Well, it's not just AWS, because we can re-appropriate our CDMA spectrum and the
slivers we need over into our LTE network. So as I said before, given the timeframe we're in now, we're good for at
least three years plus, four years, with the spectrum holdings we have. But obviously, we are going to participate in the
auction. We're going to need more spectrum for the future of our business, and we're going to invest in that spectrum.

on what your cloud strategy is at this point; I know you launched a new product. But on Wireless, can you maybe just
discuss market share shifts? I know Sprint was shutting down the network and T-Mobile's been making some
marketing initiatives. Have you seen any real changes out there in market share?
And then, Fran, I know you talked about the ARPU growth, but are you seeing any resistance to the price increases? I
mean, it seems that ARPU growth is really, really positive for the longer-term trend if it continues, if the elasticity
doesn't kick in. I mean, just if you can talk about your new Enterprise cloud beta that you launched, that would be
great. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, Tim. So on the market share side, look, I mean we did our 927,000 net
adds this quarter, which was a strong quarter. Obviously, we could've done more, but there was constraints in the
iPhone, especially around the 5S. And I think that constrained us for this quarter. But that will roll into our fourth
quarter here. So from a market share standpoint, we continue to gain market share.
Now, I can't sit here and tell you that we don't lose customers to our competitors. If you look at some of the other things
that we're dealing with, I mean we do have some low-end, if you will, some single line, basic phone customers, and
older 3G smartphone customers. And what we see in the shift here is we're seeing them shift out of postpaid into our
retail prepaid products. But we're also seeing some of them shift off to some of the lower end price plans of our
competitors.
We did launch some things in September, and we saw some improvement there, and we will continue to get aggressive
with those types of customers here in the fourth quarter. But from a market share's perspective, we're gaining market
share. I mean, I think we'll still post the best quarter of any competitor out there.
As far as the ARPA trend; look, I mean this just goes to what I've said before is the focus going forward is not
necessarily how many net adds I do, it's how we generate the growth of our top line that produces the margins. And this
goes around everything I've talked about this morning with the quality of the network, 3G to 4G, all of these other
devices.
And some of this ARPA growth, as we say, is revenue per account. I mean these could be, as I said before, these are
other devices being attached to the network, not necessarily smartphones or tablets. The – as you know, we sold
cameras; we've sold a lot of machine to machine technology that are in our stores now. So there's a lot of things that are
contributing to this, even if it's $0.50 to $0.60 a subscriber, it's still generating that revenue coming through that ARPA.
And then on the cloud, obviously for some clarification here, Tim, I think what you're talking about is on October 3, we
launched a paid public beta of our new public cloud infrastructure. We're calling this Verizon Cloud Compute and
Verizon Cloud Storage for businesses and governments of all size. And our technology will give us the ability for this
cloud-based infrastructure to handle enterprise-level workloads securely, and in compliance with a lot of relevant
requirements, which will provide flexibility and economic benefits of the generic public cloud.

So the launch of this cloud is just the next step in our cloud evolution. You're going to see a lot more of us – a lot more
of this come through in 2014. We will unveil new features. We have this technology established in seven of our data
centers on a worldwide basis. You're going to hear more of this, but it is a trial and a beta at this point. And I think
you're going to see us do a lot more in 2014. And you'll start to see some of the benefits there.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, we have time for one final question.
Operator
Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Thanks, Fran. Two quick questions; first on SMB, cable seems to be moving more
upstream, at least that's some of the checks we're hearing. I'm just wondering if you're seeing that. And how critical is
Wireless as a part of your sales pitch to this segment, because that's obviously an advantage for you? And then quickly
on prepay; AT&T has made some more recent comments that they're going to be more aggressive on pricing there –
probably more through Leap, but just your quick thoughts on your prepaid strategy here. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: All right. Thanks, Jennifer. So on small business, look, I always split this between two
segments; we have a segment that's within FiOS, and a segment that's without – outside of FiOS. Obviously, Verizon
Wireless does an unbelievable job with small business in wireless product. But within our footprint within the FiOS
and outside of FiOS, there's two things; one is, within FiOS, we are actually gaining share in the small business
environment. The issue is, is that obviously, we have to pass those small businesses with FiOS.
And quite honestly, we – that has not been a concentration of ours. Most of it was to residential homes within our
footprint. So now it's building out all of those malls and so forth. So we've gone down the street. Now the issue is
getting that into the small stores of these small businesses. So within FiOS, we're doing a fairly good job. Outside of
FiOS; it's hard for me to compete with the speeds that cable can offer them through the DOCSIS 3 type technology. So
yes, we are using Verizon Wireless, we're using Fusion where we can.
But it's hard to compete, because Fusion can't supplement a hard-wired broadband connection into a very populated
area. So that segment, we're losing share. Within FiOS, we're gaining share. On the prepaid strategy; I've said all along,
we have our prepaid on 3G, and the theory here is to keep the 3G network as full as possible to contribute contribution
margins since we're not investing in that anymore. And we will continue to get as aggressive as we can. And you can
see that over the last year and a half, we have become more aggressive in the prepaid environment.
But we also use our resellers to drive the lower end of prepaid, because we don't want the brand of Verizon Wireless
connected to that low-end environment with the quality premium network of Verizon. So that's the differentiation I
think between us and our competitors. But you can see, we continue to make strides in prepaid, and we will be as
aggressive as possible on the 3G network to be competitive.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Okay. Thanks, Mike. Just a few comments here before we end the call. So our industry has a very healthy competitive
environment, and we are forecasting continued strong demand for our video and broadband across multiple networks.
We're executing effectively within this competitive environment, consistently delivering strong results, positioning
ourselves for future revenue growth, earnings and cash flow growth.
