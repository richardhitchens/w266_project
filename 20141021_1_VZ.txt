MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following
the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may
disconnect at this time.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor
Relations.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike Stefanski,
and I'm here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer.
As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the Investor Quarterly and the presentation
slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on
our website.
Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this
presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject
to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the
SEC, which are available on our website.

This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the
most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The
quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
In terms of our financial results, I will point out that there were no special items included in our reported earnings for
the third quarter of 2014. Earnings per share of $0.89 compares with adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share in the third
quarter of last year, an increase of 15.6%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 were up 21.6%.
Keep in mind that the $2.65 per share year-to-date result in 2014 does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless
from the beginning of the year since the transaction closed on February 21. As previously noted, full ownership from
January 1 to the date of closing would have represented an additional $0.07 of earnings per share in the first quarter.
For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the business within the public sector
that we sold on July 1 have been reclassified for all periods prior to the sale. These results, which previously were part
of Global Enterprise, have been moved to corporate and other, consistent with how we have dealt with divested
operations in the past. You can access this reclassified historical information on our website.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our performance and
our ability to compete effectively and deliver strong operating and financial results.
We entered the year with great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014, and our
conviction has not changed. We believe that steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms will drive
innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Our Wireless and Wireline networks will continue to be the
hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage.
The overall industry is very healthy, and we continue to see strong customer demand for wireless and broadband
services. The U.S. market has set the pace for global broadband infrastructure investment.
In Wireless, all four national service providers are investing in 4G networks, resulting in continued innovation, 4G
device adoption and increasing customer usage. Our competitive position is strong and we are focused on executing our
strategy of providing a compelling value proposition and a great customer experience on the best, most reliable
networks.
In the third quarter, we produced very strong customer growth in Wireless and FiOS and sustained our strong growth
trends in terms of revenue and earnings. We pride ourselves on being an and company, delivering quality growth and
profitability. We continue to stand apart from our peers with very consistent high-quality earnings results. We have
posted double-digit year-over-year growth in reported and adjusted earnings and earnings per share in 10 of the last 11
quarters.
In Wireless, we had a very strong quarter of high-quality connections growth and profitability. Retail postpaid device
activations of 11.7 million were up 14.9%. This is higher volume than the fourth quarter last year when we activated
11.5 million devices. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million, up 63.5% from last year. Year-to-date, postpaid net
adds of 3.5 million were up 37.4%, which is roughly 1 million more than a year ago.
Our Wireless EBITDA service margin was 49.5%. This is a very strong result given the volume of device activations
and the relatively low percentage of customers choosing the Edge program in the quarter.
In Wireline, we had a strong quarter in FiOS with 162,000 Internet and 114,000 Video net subscriber additions.
Consumer revenues grew 4.5% as we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our Quantum
broadband and video products. Our Wireline EBITDA margin remained stable at 23%.

Our strong cash generation enables us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and return value to our
shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2014, we have invested $12.6 billion of capital and paid $5.7 billion in
dividends.
In early September, we were pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase,
which raises our annual dividend to $2.20 per share. This is the eighth consecutive year that our board has approved a
quarterly dividend increase and the highest percent increase since 2008.
Now let's get into the third quarter performance in more detail, starting with the consolidated results on slide 4. On a
reported basis, total operating revenue grew 4.3% in the third quarter. If we exclude the revenues of the Public Sector
business we divested from the prior period, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.9% for the third quarter and
5.2% year-to-date.
Our consolidated top line growth continued to be driven primarily by Wireless and FiOS. In addition to top line growth,
we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma
program. Consolidated EBITDA was $11.1 billion in the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 35%.
Let's take a look at our cash flow results on slide 5. As I've noted in prior quarters, it is important to remember that the
transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior
periods in our statement of cash flows. Through the first nine months of 2014, cash flows from operations were $23.2
billion.
Additional cash outlays this year included $2.5 billion of incremental cash interest payments and higher cash income
taxes of $3.2 billion. In addition, we had $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not make in 2013.
In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $10.5 billion through the
end of September.
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.1 billion and were $12.6 billion year-to-date, up $817 million or 6.9%.
We project that capital spending will be around $17 billion for the full year. Our deployment of capital in Wireless has
been very consistent throughout the first three quarters of this year. In the third quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.5
billion and though nine months totaled $7.8 billion.
We are deploying capital to proactively stay ahead of demand and our capital investments continue to focus on adding
capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density and deploying spectrum. We have
been actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint and currently have more than 400 markets with
AWS, or XLTE as we branded it. Our continued deployment of spectrum, along with investments in small cells,
distributed antenna systems and in-building solutions, will allow us to build upon our network advantage.
In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion year-to-date, down $273 million or
6.1%.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our
strategic goals. Gross debt of $109.2 billion was down about $750 million from last quarter. Our net debt position
improved to $102 billion and the net-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3 times.
Now let's move into the review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 6. Our Wireless strategy is built on
making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. This value
proposition includes customer choice and an excellent service experience on the nation's most reliable network.
Our investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to our network to meet increasing demand, which is driven by
4G device adoption and higher customer usage. Growth in Wireless revenue and profitability continued to be driven by
our high-quality retail postpaid customer base, where we continue to see very strong 4G device adoption.
As I highlighted earlier, we had another exceptional quarter of smartphone and tablet activations. Customer demand on
our network continued to increase at a rapid pace. Our recently announced promotional pricing is designed to provide

even greater appeal to our More Everything Plan, which we believe will drive more 4G device adoption and stimulate
incremental usage on our more-efficient LTE network. We expect that continued success in driving 4G device
activations in the fourth quarter will create profitable growth for us as we enter 2015 and beyond.
Total Wireless revenue in the quarter grew to $21.8 billion, up 7%. Service revenues grew 4.8%, driven by 4G LTE
connections growth and higher usage on our network. The declining rate of Service revenue growth is attributable to
device mix, price changes, and the trade-off between lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings for
customers on Verizon Edge.
In the third quarter, the percentage of phone activations by customers choosing the Edge program was approximately
12%, which was down from about 18% in the second quarter. Based on recent promotional pricing for Edge, the
percentage of phone activations taking the installment plan option could more than double in the fourth quarter.
In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and our Service EBITDA margin was
49.5%. The EBITDA benefit in the quarter from the Edge program was approximately $115 million.
Let's now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide 7. Retail postpaid revenue
per account, or ARPA, grew 3.5% in the quarter. Growth in ARPA is a function of device adoption, account growth
and increased usage. The continued rapid pace of 4G device adoption is improving the quality of our customer
accounts. In the third quarter, we added 4.4 million 4G smartphones and 1.1 million 4G tablets to our postpaid
connections base.
All of the important account metrics are improving. We ended the quarter with a total of 35.4 million postpaid accounts
and the number of postpaid connections per account was 2.82, which is an increase of 3.7%.
57% of our accounts are on More Everything share data plan. The average daily usage in More Everything accounts has
increased nearly 50% year-over-year.
I would also point out that since the ARPA metric is calculated using Service revenue, it does not capture the monthly
equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the third quarter, these monthly equipment billings totaled
about $285 million and were approximately $533 million year-to-date.
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on slide 8. We ended the quarter with 106.2 million total retail
connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base topped the 100 million mark at 100.1 million, and our
prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million.
In passing the 100 million postpaid connections milestone, it is worth noting that we have added more than 20 million
new connections since 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of around 5%. Postpaid gross adds totaled
4.5 million in the quarter, up from 4.2 million in the second quarter and 3.7 million a year ago. Year-to-date, postpaid
gross adds were up 15.1%. In terms of the gross add mix in the third quarter, 54% were smartphones and about 36%
were connected devices, primarily tablets. Most of the remaining gross adds were basic phones. Our retail postpaid
churn rate of 1% was 3 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year.
As I highlighted earlier, retail postpaid net adds in the quarter totaled 1.5 million compared with 1.4 million in the
second quarter and 927,000 a year ago. Our postpaid net add mix in the quarter included 2.3 million new 4G devices.
Within that total, 1.2 million were 4G smartphones and 1.1 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled
457,000, which is comparable to 481,000 in the third quarter last year. Within the postpaid phone category, the 1.2
million new 4G smartphone adds were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Tablet net adds
were more than 1 million for the second consecutive quarter. Tablets provide good growth through increased data
consumption, lower churn at the account level, and have a lower cost subsidy than smartphones.
We have significant headroom in terms of further penetration as our postpaid tablet base was 6.5 million at the end of
the quarter. Further customer adoption of tablets clearly represents an incremental growth opportunity for us. Our
postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2% in the third quarter. Once again, these were high-quality smartphone upgrades, either
from a basic phone, 3G to 4G, or 4G to a newer 4G smartphone. About 1.2 million or 18% of smartphone upgrades this
quarter were from basic phones. Nearly 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetize

through higher data usage and lower cost-to-serve.
You will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we activated 3.1 million 3G iPhones as it was the first time we
offered a free Apple device to customers signing a new two-year contract. The majority of these customers will be
coming off contract this quarter, providing us with the unique opportunity to drive 4G smartphone adoption. Almost all
of our retail connections growth in 2014 have been postpaid. Through the first nine months, prepaid net adds were only
5,000 compared with 274,000 in 2013. We believe that price-sensitive prepaid customers are moving to the postpaid
market.
Next, let's turn to slide nine and take a look at device activations and our continued progress in driving 4G adoption and
usage. As I've highlighted, postpaid device activations were very strong at 11.7 million. During the quarter, we
activated 8.9 million smartphones and 1.3 million tablets. Our smartphone penetration at the end of the quarter
increased to 77% of total phones. We have 65.4 million smartphones in total, and 48.2 million of them are 4G. A year
ago, we had 29 million 4G smartphones, so we've made significant progress in driving 4G penetration. And yet, we still
have a significant opportunity in front of us with more than 17 million 3G smartphones and 20 million basic phones in
our connection space.
Beyond smartphones, tablets and other Internet devices are contributing to our overall 4G device penetration. At the
end of the third quarter, more than 59% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 38% a year ago. Data and
video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently, about 79% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE
network. As we handle this increased demand, our network continues to be acknowledged as the performance leader in
national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We have raised our own network standards,
and our performance continues to get better.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and Mass Markets revenue
performance on slide 10. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the
third quarter, consumer revenue growth was 4.5%, making it nine consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%.
Mass Markets, which includes small business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 76% of consumer revenue, and we are
sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth.
In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 12.3%, driven by customer additions, pricing actions and Quantum
penetration. Strong adoption of Quantum continued as 57% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to the higher
speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second. We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive
investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. In the second quarter, we introduced
FiOS Quantum TV, with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of
content. In July, we introduced SpeedMatch, a service upgrade that increases customer upload speeds to match their
download speeds. This competitive advantage provides FiOS customers with faster and more consistent upload speeds,
which is compelling for social media and gaming activities. Our focus in FiOS markets is to drive higher penetration by
adding quality customers, generating profitable growth in a very competitive market and improving our overall
investment returns.
In broadband, we added 162,000 net FiOS Internet customers in the quarter, and now have 6.5 million subscribers,
representing 40.6% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers in the third quarter were a positive 69,000, up more
than 23%. In FiOS Video, we added 114,000 net subscribers, so we now have 5.5 million subscribers, representing
35.5% penetration. During the quarter, we converted 55,000 customers from copper to fiber, bringing our year-to-date
total to around 200,000. This network evolution initiative is enabling us to systematically upgrade the network and
provide higher quality of service to customers. Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer
satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which
result in additional recurring revenue.
Let's turn to slide 11 and cover the Enterprise and Wholesale business. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work
through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $155 million or
4.4%. Revenue declines in legacy transport services and CPE continued to outweigh growth in newer and more
strategic applications which are smaller in scale.

Strategic services totaled $2.1 billion and grew 1%. This category, as currently defined, includes both the IP layer and
applications such as data center, cloud, security, and managed and professional services. Revenue from Services in the
IP layer have been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services. In
our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $79 million or 4.8%. Healthy demand for Ethernet services
in each of the last two quarters has offset a larger portion than expected of the revenue declines from price
compression, technology migration and other secular challenges. In the third quarter, Wireline operating expenses
declined 1.7%, and our EBITDA margin was 23%.
As we said, we are making progress but are not satisfied. We have more work to do in order to drive improved
profitability in this segment. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was up 60 basis points to 23%.
From an overall segment perspective, our strategy is to continue scaling our FiOS business and improve the Enterprise
revenue mix by driving growth in the newer Strategic services like cloud and security. In addition, we believe that
process improvements and retooling efforts using Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles will improve our cost structure
and drive operating efficiencies, resulting in a stronger Wireline business.
Let's move next to our summary slide. With three quarters of 2014 behind us, our financial performance has been
strong. We continued to deliver high-quality, double-digit earnings growth, and our cash generation is strong, enhanced
by full access to all the Wireless cash flows. These cash flows have allowed us to consistently invest in our networks
and platforms for future growth and innovation. In addition, we returned value to shareholders with a 3.8% dividend
increase. We have a strong market position, and that's demonstrated the ability to compete effectively and execute our
strategy. Our high-quality customer base and Wireless and Wireline networks continue to be the hallmark of our brand,
and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage.
We are also building for the future through our global platforms and video delivery and machine-to-machine. New
revenue streams from machine-to-machine and telematics are beginning to emerge. In the third quarter, these revenues
were approximately $150 million and totaled more than $400 million through nine months, an increase of more than
40% year-to-date. Our strong volume growth in both Wireless and FiOS give us great confidence heading into the
fourth quarter. We continued to target consolidated revenue growth of 4% in 2014. For the full year, our consolidated
adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as the Wireless EBITDA service margin results, will be dependent on fourth quarter
volumes and Edge installment plan take rates. The Wireline EBITDA margin remains on track to expand on a full-year
basis.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thank you, Fran. Before taking questions, I would like to remind everyone that we filed an application to participate in
the AWS-3 spectrum auction. As a result, due to the FCC's rules, we cannot answer any questions related to the auction
or AWS-3 spectrum.
David, we are now ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment for the first
question. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So two if I could. First, I was wondering if you
guys could just talk a little bit, in light of Lowell's comments in the briefing about his conviction level, confidence level
about 4Q, about the cadence of competition and how you felt you had to respond over the course of the quarter.

Obviously, things started off fairly stable, and then we had the T-Mobile promotion followed by the Sprint promotions
followed by incremental actions in terms of double data and things like that. So if you could kind of give us a sense as
to how the quarter trended and what you're seeing that's giving you the confidence for the rest of the fourth quarter
would be helpful. And then second, Fran, I think that we've got a pretty good understanding that smartphone customers
have been generating roughly double the value of feature phone customers. You are referencing the 4G smartphone
opportunity as being something incremental to the 3G smartphone opportunity. If you could put some numbers around
that, that would be super helpful. Thank you so much.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay, great. Thanks, David. So look, on the competitive front. I think that the takeaway
here is that we produced an extremely strong quarter from growth perspective, and I anticipate you're going to see that
across the industry. If you look at – as I said, we see a shift from prepaid to postpaid, not necessarily within our base
because of the high quality and strict requirements we have from a credit perspective, but there's still a lot of growth
out there. If you look at just the industry itself, I mean, you take tablets, you take the video consumption, you look at
machine-to-machine and Internet of Things, I mean all these things are contributing to our growth. If you look at
machine-to-machine, for us, it's the first time we gave you a revenue number, and that's growing at 40%
year-over-year. So it's more than just about a smartphone customer. As I've said before, if I could, I would stop
disclosing net adds. It's all about how we build the base of revenue and how we continue to grow this business into the
future.
If you look at the competitive front, there was a lot of movement, but it was not unexpected. I mean, as you go into the
fourth quarter, this is normally a very high competitive quarter. It's a very high volume quarter for ourselves from a
holiday perspective. But I think if you look at us, as we've done in the past, we look at what the competition is doing,
we take a very rational and logical approach to what we're going to respond to. If you looked at what we did, we
responded with some Edge pricing on a promotional basis that, quite honestly, puts us back into the market. Given all
the moves, we were slightly out of the market like if you saw back in the first quarter of this year, we did similar things.
And we continued to grow. And we continue to produce the profitability that's expected of our shareholders.
So I think the response you've seen is a logical, rational response. There will be upcoming promotions, I'm sure, from
everyone as the holiday season gets closer, and we have our own plans in place to execute on. So I think from a fourth
quarter perspective, you should expect high volume, you should expect from us that our upgrade rate will increase. We
have the highest backlog of any previous launch of an iPhone that we have coming into the fourth quarter, which is a
high backlog of both new customers and also for upgrades. So I know that our upgrade rate is going to be fairly
significant in the fourth quarter. As we said on the call here, 3.1 million 2012 3G iPhone customers are waiting to
upgrade now as they come out of contracts, so that's a great perspective, and that leads me into your second question.
So if you think about some of the data points we've given you from a 3G smartphone customer to a 4G smartphone
customer, the first time we've told you that within our More Everything plans, which is for the majority 4G smartphone
customers, their usage pattern is going up 50% year-over-year. If you look at tablets, a tablet customer uses more than a
3G smartphone customer. So if you start taking, together with the volume increases and other industries have put out,
what the usage pattern of video customers are on a 4G LTE network, video is a huge consumption for us. And it
continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, and that's driving that 50% increase in usage in our 4G base.
So when you combine all of that, every time we can move a customer from a 3G smartphone or a basic phone into our
4G portfolio, their usage and revenue goes up. So it's a great combination for us. And I'll end the question that says,
again, we are focused on the quality of our base and the quality of our adds to generate our growth.

<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys, thanks. Two things, one to follow up, Fran, on something you just said. Prepaid
customers moving to the postpaid customers – to the postpaid market, is that a good thing, a bad thing? Do you think
these customers offer a similar churn level? They pass the credit check, right? And do they tend to bring their own
devices or are they taking Edge at a different rate from what visibility you have? And then second, there's been a lot of
articles written lately on asset sales from you, whether that was Wireline assets or towers. Can you give us an update on
how you're thinking about that? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, thanks, Phil. On the prepaid customer move to postpaid, look, I mean, we're just
looking at the overall industry and where prepaid growth is from a year ago to where it is today. And the assumption is,
is that we do see the prepaid customer moving. If you look at the entry prices now that are on postpaid, and this is
really around single line, not multi-family, but if you look at single-line pricing, those price points are pretty darn close
to what a prepaid customer would pay on prepaid. So the hurdle is the credit check, and obviously, for Verizon, we
have not changed our credit profile for any of our customers. It's the same, it has been for over a year now even when
Edge was introduced.
So again, it's not as favorable to us. It was more of where are these customers going, and we think they're going to a
lower end type entry point, which is not unusual. I mean, the same thing happened back in the voice world when voice
became closer to what the prepaid were. So from a device perspective, some is own device, but others are also buying
up into device. As far as the asset sales go, look, I have nothing to announce today. We said publicly that we certainly
would entertain a sale of our towers if the terms and conditions were right. And at this point, we don't have anything
there. And as Will and I have always said, we continue to look at our portfolio for opportunities, but it has to be at the
right time, the right place and the right price. And so therefore, there's really nothing to talk further because there's
nothing to announce.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: All right. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: David, next question, please?

Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to maybe follow up on the full year
margin guidance. It sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like it's most sensitive to the Edge take rate.
And so along those lines in the past, you've been fairly agnostic, or you seem somewhat agnostic as to whether your
customers were choosing a subsidy or choosing Edge. I'm wondering, are you changing your thought process there,
meaning, are you trying to achieve a desired outcome? You noted that it looks like the take rate could double in the
fourth quarter. And then just broad levels, is there a breaking point, meaning, if Edge were to see an adoption rate
above a certain level, you probably would have margins that were up, and if it was below, they'd probably be down?
Just to sort of help us with a modeling exercise.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So, look, there's a bunch of factors entering into the fourth quarter
here. As I said, we do think that the Edge rate will take an uptick. You've probably already seen us increasing our
advertising around the price points of Edge, which is where the rest of the industry has been and advertising around, so
we need to be in-market with those price points, which is why we launched the promotional pricing that you saw. But if
you look at the 12% this quarter or the 18% last quarter, you can kind of get a flavor for on what the impact is to our
bottom line, which is 120 basis points this quarter, I think it was 134 basis points last quarter. So beyond that, I'm not
going to give any further information on that.
But if you think about the Edge take rate, if it doubles, then you can kind of extrapolate what that math would be. But
then offsetting that will be the upgrades. And at this point, I don't know where the upgrades will come in, whether it
will be Edge or under the old subsidy model. Again, we are very focused on customer choice. We give our customers
the choice of the subsidized handset with the higher service pricing, or we give them the Edge which they pay for the

phone over the term, but it gives them the ability to upgrade sooner.
So it is a customer choice, and it's hard for me to identify what that will be. But as I said, Brett, we have a very high
volume of backlog on the iPhone. We have a bunch of new phones coming out in the fourth quarter from other
manufacturers that are extremely good. So I think we'll have a great lineup of product. It's going to be a high-volume,
highly competitive time of the year. And beyond that, I'm not going to give any specific guidance to margins, but it will
certainly be based on those volumes and how those customers come in.

Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Fran, you talked about a $17 billion number for CapEx. You're
coming towards the end of the XLTE rollout. Is there some opportunity for the -- it seems like the growth rate has
slowed, but for – at some, the CapEx, as a percent of revenues, is to fall over the coming quarters. Or are we going to
continue keeping at this sort of rate as a percent of revenues? And then on the Wireline side, a bit of softness in SMB
and Enterprise. You talked about some of the secular factors. Do you detect any change in macro or in the competitive
environment, or is it just more of the same?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, Simon. So on CapEx, we said we'd be around $17 billion. As we said that
coming into this year, we were determined to improve our CapEx-to-revenue ratio, and I believe we will do that on a
year-over-year basis. This year, we had a much more flatness to our CapEx spending. So if you looked at prior year, we
always had more of a ramp into the back half of the year. You won't see that this year, so it's become more level. And I
do anticipate that we will be able to continue to improve on our CapEx-to-revenue ratio. As far as whole dollars go, we
set around the $17 billion mark. And I'll give you some more guidance in January, but I don't anticipate that, that will
change pretty materially going into next year. So again, the focus will be to continue to increase that CapEx-to-revenue
ratio.
And then on the Wireline side, first, let's talk about the consumer, Small business area. So we did have an inflection
point this quarter where we did suffer a 4.1% decline in the Small business. And some of that was due to a
year-over-year comparison, but some of that was due to some onetime things, and I think that will come back in line
here in the fourth quarter. But we did have a very good strong FiOS quarter at 4.5%. The other thing I would say
around FiOS is if you look at the components of content and our revenue per customer, our revenue per customer is
growing nicely, and is actually outpacing the cost of content. And this year, if you look at our content cost, we're
around that 2% to 4% growth rate in content. So from a competitive standpoint, that's an advantage for us to drop more
margin to the bottom line on our consumer piece. And if you look at FiOS, FiOS continues to contribute more and
more net income quarter-over-quarter. So that's a positive.
On the Enterprise side, look. I think that – I feel like I record this every quarter and it does not change. I really don't see
much changing in that Enterprise spectrum. If you look at the European market, that is softening for us, and also, with
the FX impact of some of that softness of where the dollar is. So I think we have a lot of headwinds right now in
Enterprise, and I will honestly tell you, I don't see that changing for at least the next couple of quarters at this point in
time.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fran, you referenced that the More Everything plans were
generating 50% greater usage year-over-year. Is there a way to think about how much revenue that usage is
contributing, and how you feel about the ability to monetize the growth in consumption as some of the rate plans have
promoted higher usage buckets? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, thanks, Michael. So, look, I'm not going to give you specific how the revenue
increases. I mean, you can see that in our ARPA, which is growing nicely. If you see the sequential improvement in
ARPA this quarter from last quarter, it grew to 161 from 159. So if you look at year-over-year, we're up 3.5%. So I
think that metric speaks for itself as how we're monetizing the increased usage. But if you think about this, the 4G LTE
network is three to four times more efficient than prior networks. So I guess I look at it this way. If you go back in time
and you go back to the voice world, and you go from the beginning of time to where the voice world matured, what
happened was the price per minute decreased and usage increased, and the overall industry increased its revenue
because of that increase in usage.
And I kind of look at the data world in the same perspective. You're going to see the price per megabit decrease, but the
usage is going outpace that, and at least under our tiered pricing structure and the More Everything plans, each time
you upgrade, you're going to incrementally pay a little bit more for what you use. And that's really what's favoring in
on the revenue growth. But it's also coming over a very efficient network that does not cost incrementally to produce
that increased usage. So it's a good combination to have in an efficient network with an ever-increasing consumption
rate. So I do anticipate that the structure works, I think it's going to grow, as long as we increase the data bundle usage
on a competitive standard basis. I still think, though, with the increase in usage, as we said, 50% year-over-year, you're
still going to see a healthy growth in the revenue on an ARPA basis. So I think the combination works, but you will see
that megabit per – or price per megabit decrease with the continued increase in consumption.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Next question, please, David?

Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Hey, great. Thank you. Fran, maybe a quick follow-up to Mike's questions on the Service
revenue. I mean, similar margins, there's a lot of moving parts as we look into fourth quarter, but you saw 100 basis
points of Service revenue growth deceleration. You're doing – you're going to be having more Edge come through. Is
that the kind of deceleration we should see again in the fourth quarter? Or does – do all the upgrades sort of offset that?
So that's number one. And then number two, Apple, obviously, recently announced their move to a soft SIM card, at
least for the iPads, the new iPads that they're introducing, and Verizon was conspicuously absent from the companies in
the U.S. supporting that. Can you give a little color on – in terms of your positioning in terms of that new product?
Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, thanks. So on the Service revenue side, look, there's a lot of puts and pushes here
from a Service revenue perspective. So if you go back, I mean, obviously, we had a price change in the first quarter,
which is working its way through the system. As we said before, we were not going to reprice our base in one lump
sum. We would work on that, and address those customers that were a high churn profile and treat them accordingly,
which we've done for many, many years. And we continue to do that, and that puts a pressure on Service revenue as we
get them into the price plan that's going to keep them on our network.
In addition, Edge has an impact here because you're moving Service revenue into Equipment revenue, and we gave you
those numbers in the upfront comments of how you should think about that. But that improves the, if you take those
recurring monthly billings on Equipment revenue and put them back into the revenue stream, that increases the rate of
percentage increase that we have, and also increases the Service revenue growth year-over-year.

But, look, there is going – there is some deceleration here, as Michael brought up on the last one. As we continue to
increase the bundles, there's going to take a little bit of time before people have to take the next step up. But I will tell
you, this quarter, with our NFL agreement and the amount of video consumption we're having, we had one of the best
quarters ever of customers stepping up to the next bucket. So again, I think all these things factor into it, but Edge will
definitely have a deceleration factor on the Service revenue. As far as the Softcard SIM card with Apple, we have our
own SIM card that we're putting in the devices, both in our indirect channels and our store channels. So, that's really all
there is to be said on that issue.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks, Fran.

Operator
Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys, thanks. Fran, could you just hit briefly on the Small, Medium, Enterprise
marketplace? It seems like you have continued weakness, which you pointed out. How much of that is this technology
migration versus the cable competitors starting to move up-market a little bit?
And then secondly, thinking about over-the-top, there's been a lot of stuff in the past couple of weeks and it seems like
it's sort of a building discussion between HBO, CBS. How do you guys think about that? I know you bought the Intel
OnCue business. When do you get more aggressive there?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Okay, thanks, Mike. So, look, on the Enterprise space, I think there's a couple of things
here. I mean, you do have the tech refresh. And obviously, as they come off legacy and go into IP, I mean the IP has a
lower price point. And then also, as I said in my opening remarks, this IP market is becoming more and more
competitive from a pricing perspective.
So what we're faced with, as we have major customers who are renewing, coming off three- and five-year contracts,
obviously they're being repriced back into where the IP market is today, which is pretty significantly lower than it was
three to five years ago. So, you're having that price compression happen there. We're gaining new business, but again
it's coming in at a lower rate. And we still have that decline of voice and LD that's going away and it just can't offset it.
From a Strategic services perspective, we're seeing some good things here. We're also seeing some improvement in the
federal space. But as you know, in this business, when you start to improve, it could take six months to eight months
before that revenue comes to be as you implement this new technology.
So there is some glimmer of hope here as the federal government starts to purchase more, but we're probably not going
see any of that until 2015. But then again, we're working against a bunch of headwinds as far as repricing on the IP and
the tech refresh.
As far as cable and what's happening in the Small business, look, I mean, as I've said in the previous quarters, where we
have FiOS and compete in the Small business market we are gaining share. We are losing share outside of that FiOS
footprint in the old copper and I'm not going to be able to compete there with the speed. So, that is something that we're
just going to continue to see here into the future around that copper plant.
But within FiOS, we continue to gain share. We expand where we can to capture more small businesses in that
footprint and we capitalize on that, but you have to remember it's only in 13 states.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Thanks. I just...
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: As far as over-the-top goes, I think the way I look at this is this is great for the customer,
this is great for the industry. This shows that there are new innovative-type arrangements that are happening. And as we
said before, we're having discussions with a lot of content providers around innovative models going forward and I

think this sets a lot of stage. So, I think it opens up a lot of doors and it's something optimistic for the future of the
Video business.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Fran, just a quick follow-up on the Small, Medium piece of it. Do you see cable gaining
more capabilities there or is it still really relegated to the very small customer base?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, when they say that they're moving up, my perception of this is as we look at Small,
Medium business and even in the Medium business, we capture Medium business as anyone that has 1,000 or less
employees. So it's a pretty different definition of where they're saying they're moving up from versus where we're
playing.
And again, within our Enterprise business, we're really focused on the major large Enterprise customers, and we really
deal with that Small business, which is what we classify as 20 and below employees, within our FiOS arena. So it is a
different spectrum of definition, but, look, they're increasing their capability. They're having success in that, what I
would consider, Small business arena, maybe the lower and mid-business level, but they'll continue to do what they do
and we'll continue to do what we do.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: Thanks, Fran. Could we talk a little bit about your net debt targets? Obviously with the
spectrum auction coming up, potential asset sales, all this stuff is going to impact your ability to deleverage going
forward. Could you talk a little bit about kind of where we should think about net debt at the end of 2015? And given
the lower interest rate environment, does that change your calculus on the amount of leverage you want to leave on the
balance sheet?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, thanks, Kevin. So here's what I'll say, because I'm not going to give any guidance of
where I think our debt will be at 2015 at this point. But today where we stand is, as you see, we're at net debt of $102
billion with our gross debt at $109.2 billion. We have a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a
gross-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times.
I'll reference you back to an S&P report that came out, I guess, maybe a month ago on some projections around what
they thought we would spend in the future for auctions and also how much debt that they think that we would pay
down. And the report was extremely optimistic and said that they could see us being upgraded within a 12- to 24-month
period of time if things continue.
So, I think we are right on track with where we said we would be when we closed on the Vodafone deal. I said that we
wanted to get back to an A- rating within four to five years. The S&P report shows that that could be accelerated based
on our performance here. We're generating strong cash flow. And what I would tell you is, we're in a great position to
execute on the strategic initiatives that we need to execute on. So, we'll have more to say on this as we close out this
year and come to our call in January.
<Q - Kevin Smithen>: And just quickly on FiOS, we've seen in the last two years significant price hikes, which as you
indicated has more than offset programming cost increases. Kind of as you look into 2015, should we expect more of
that and can you continue to have revenue growth outpace cost inflation on the FiOS side?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah, so I'll give you guidance next call on where we think FiOS growth rate will be. But
here's what I will say is, last year we did our price increases in the fourth quarter. We're doing that again this year to be
ready to absorb the content costs that always happen on January 1. So, that's something that you should anticipate and
you will see.

Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much and good morning, folks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Good morning.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Fran, just building on Mike's prior question on the recent developments around
over-the-top and unbundling, it seems as though you feel pretty comfortable around the opportunity, particularly given
your investment in fiber and delivering some of these high-bandwidth capabilities to your customers. I was wondering,
if we think about the competitive landscape in developments like this, does it strengthen your view on the diminishing
ability for competitive direct video services like satellite technology to compete in what seems to be an increasing
on-demand and OTT world?
And then I guess secondly, if we think about the opportunity on the Wireless side, you folks have made a number of
tuck-in acquisitions around content distribution, and I was wondering how we should think about – obviously there's
the relationship with the NFL – how we should think about the opportunities on that front and when we could start to
see some either material adoption from customers or sort of some of these new revenue streams come to fruition?
Thanks a lot.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. So a couple of thoughts here, Amir. So number one is, when I look at the
"over-the-top-type video area," I mean there's two avenues. There's the over-the-top into the home and then there's the
over-the-top via wireless. And I think over-the-top via wireless, you're already starting to see that with agreements like
the NFL and some other things.
I also think that with the technology of multicast coming, this will certainly open up doors for more of that content to
be delivered over-the-top via the wireless network because multicast is so efficient in delivering a programming-type
service over the LTE network. But of course, that will be major around more live events, concerts, sports, those types
of things.
As far as over-the-top into the broadband home, I think that what this says is is that the content providers, they have
realized that there's a whole population out there that do not subscribe to satellite TV or linear TV, and they're trying to
penetrate that millennial base that does not have these types of offers and want something smaller, more convenient for
them. And as I said, I think this brings in a lot of innovative-type models of how to really attack some of these other
segments of the marketplace that don't have that type of service. Do I think in the near term this is going to decrease
linear TV or satellite TV? No, I don't. But I think it's another avenue of how we open up the ecosystem with innovative
models, and that's something that we're very, very interested in, especially around Wireless and even as we go out into
more of the broadband-type market.

more about the rules to kind of express your enthusiasm. We know a little bit more today. I just wanted to kind of take
your pulse on what your thoughts are as we look at it today.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. So, Jennifer, unfortunately I can't. I'm not actually allowed to. My lawyers are
telling me I'm not allowed to answer any type of spectrum questions. And at this point, it's still far in the future and
we're focused on the current one. So I think at this point, I'll leave it at that.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Got it. If I could just explore just an M2M then?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Obviously, great growth there. You guided or talked about 40% growth year-over-year.
Do you think we're at the point we're kind of seeing this needle mover we've often been waiting for? Is this the year or
will it accelerate in 2014 – 2015 rather?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, look, I think that as we tried to allude over the last couple of quarters, we gave you
growth rates; this quarter we're giving you revenue numbers and we'll continue to do that going forward. As I said
before, this is not necessarily about how many connections I put on the network. This is about how many of those
connections actually pay revenue and we earn money.
And so, as you know, we stopped disclosing connections a while ago. But I will tell you that the connection growth is
ever increasing here. There's a lot of avenues that are being opened up around Internet of Things, around healthcare,
around energy management fleet. So you can go through all the verticals and there's so many solutions that are coming
to forbear (sic) [bear] (57:21), which is why we, over, I guess now a year-and-a-half ago, we opened up our second
Innovation Center out in Palo Alto.
So this is something that we're very, very focused on. I think there's a lot of good opportunity here. And this will
certainly be a driver of growth for the entire industry.
The other thing I think that separates us apart from our competition is, obviously with our Hughes acquisition, we play
in another tower that no one else plays in. I mean everybody's playing today in the connectivity tower. But with our
Hughes acquisition, we're actually playing in the customer service and concierge tower as well and being able to
deliver some of that big data and looking at ways to monetize some of that data to our end customers, who are really
business customers who are looking at business-to-business versus business-to-consumer. So this is just another area, I
think, of growth for the industry. And obviously, we're capable to capitalize on that.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Jennifer.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: David, we have time for one more question, please.
Operator
And your last question today comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jonathan Schildkraut>: All right, thanks for sneaking me in here. Yeah, I got a question on LTE broadcast. I
just want to get an update on where we were and understand whether sort of implementation go forward is about
technology or is it about content.
And then, Fran, you made some interesting comments about sort of the growth of video within the data consumption
packages that you currently have, and I'm wondering if you looked at what amount of that video could ultimately be
sent out over LTE broadcast and the potential implications to margins. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So, look, LTE multicast, the network was ready in August of this
past year, so we have built out the network to be able to handle multicast. As you know, we demonstrated it back in

January with the Super Bowl. So, the network is capable.
The chipsets are now being implemented into most of the devices that are coming out in the fourth quarter. Some
phones in the third quarter had the chipset, but most will have it in the fourth quarter, not all.
So, look, the way I look at this ecosystem is it's going to take us about a year before those chipsets ramp and we have
some volume there which gets the attention of the content provider. But as I said before, having a lot of great
conversations with content providers, they're excited about it, but again they want to see how many customers actually
have the capability to use that technology, and I think that will be a year away. But I think this opens up a lot of new
avenues for us.
I don't know yet how the ecosystem will generate revenue on this. Is it a revenue-share model? Is it an advertising
model? Is it a consumer-pay model? We're not sure yet of how the ecosystem will play itself out, and I think that will
come within the next year.
The other critical piece here is is that for the first time coming in the fourth quarter, we'll have an independent third
party to be able to tell the content providers who actually watches their shows on a mobile handset, which has never
been able to be done before other than from the carriers. So I think this does, again, open up some of that ecosystem. So
from that perspective, I think we're really in good shape from an ecosystem perspective.
And as far as the bundling goes and the usage goes, again, we'll have to wait to see how this multicast technology
comes to market and how it's capitalized on.
Michael T. Stefanski
All right, thank you. But before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Fran for a few closing remarks.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Here's my closing comments. I guess I would say, look, we
had another strong quarter of operating and financial results. We count ourselves on a quality base and a quality
addition. We count on the quality of our network in driving top line growth and profitability.
By focusing on execution around the assets we already have in place, we are delivering consistent high-quality earnings
and returning value to our shareholders.
At the same time, we are developing new products and services in the areas of video delivery, over-the-top,
machine-to-machine for future growth and profitability. We have great confidence in our ability to execute on our
strategy and grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future.
Thank you, everyone, for joining us today and have a great day.
