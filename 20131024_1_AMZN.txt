As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our
financial results, as well as our metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain
non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC,
each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures,
including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2012.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks, Sean. I'll begin with comments on our third quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow
increased 48% to $4.98 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 63% to $388 million. Trailing 12-month
capital expenditures were $4.59 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our previously leased
corporate office space, as well as property for our development of additional corporate office space located in Seattle,
Washington, which we purchased in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The increase in capital expenditures reflects additional investments in support of our continued business growth,
consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to
support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 3%, down from 10%. ROIC is TTM free cash flow divided by average total assets
minus current liabilities, excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends. The combination of
common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 475 million shares compared with 469 million shares.
Worldwide revenue grew 24% to $17.09 billion or 26% excluding the $332 million unfavorable impact from
year-over-year changes in our foreign exchange rates. We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage
of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $5.03 billion, up 9% or 13%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to
$11.05 billion, up 29% or 31%, excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM increased to 65% of worldwide sales, up
from 62%. Worldwide paid unit growth was 29%. Active customer accounts exceeded 224 million. Worldwide active
seller accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $12.37 billion, or 72.3%
of revenue compared with 74.7%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology, and content and G&A combined was $4.46
billion, or 26.1% of sales, up approximately 250 basis points year-over-year.
Fulfillment was $1.96 billion, or 11.5% of revenue compared with 10.5%. Tech and content was $1.58 billion, or 9.2%
of revenue compared with 7.8%. Marketing was $671 million or 3.9% of revenue compared with 3.8%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results, and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our
stock-based compensation or other operating expense line item. In the North America segment, revenue grew 31% to
$10.3 billion. Media revenue grew 18% to $2.61 billion. EGM revenue grew 33% to $6.73 billion, representing 65% of
North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 1% to $295 million, a
2.9% operating margin.
In the International segment, revenue grew 15% to $6.79 billion. Adjusting for the $327 million year-over-year
unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 20%. Media revenue increased 2% to $2.42 billion or 9%,
excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 23% to $4.32 billion or 28%, excluding foreign exchange. EGM
now represents 64% of International revenues, up from 59%. International segment operating loss was $28 million
compared to a $59 million loss in the prior period.

Consolidated segment operating income increased 15% to $267 million, or 1.6% of revenue, down approximately 10
basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, CSOI increased 18%.
Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income or loss includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating
expense. GAAP operating loss was $25 million compared to a $28 million loss in the prior year period.
Our income tax benefit was $12 million. GAAP net loss was $41 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared with net
loss of $274 million or $0.60 per diluted share.
The third quarter 2012 included a loss of $169 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, related to our equity-method share of
losses reported by LivingSocial, primarily attributable to its impairment charge of certain assets, including goodwill.
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities increased $2.44 billion year-over-year to $7.69 billion.
Inventory increased 20% to $6.07 billion, and inventory turns were 9.2 turns, down from 9.7 turns a year ago, as we
expanded selection, improved in-stock levels, and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 20%
to $10.04 billion, and accounts payable days were 75, consistent with the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to-date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations, as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we described in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign
currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rates can
all have a material effect on guidance.
Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings,
or legal settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange
rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q4, 2013, we expect net sales of between $23.5 billion and $26.5 billion, a growth between 10% and 25%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 125 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.
GAAP operating income or loss to be between a $500 million loss and $500 million in income, compared to $405
million income in the fourth quarter of 2012. This includes approximately $350 million for stock-based compensation
and amortization of intangible assets.
We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss, which excludes stock-based compensation and other
expense, to be between $150 million loss and $850 million income compared to $678 million income in fourth quarter
2012.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks. And with that, Sean, let's move to questions.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll go first to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Hey, Tom. On the press release, it says that you've signed up millions of new Prime members
and I believe if you read it, it says it, if that happened in the last 90 days. I wonder if you ever commented on a time
period like that before. And is that a normal run rate to add millions of Prime users in 90 days? Or is there something
special in this quarter that drove Prime? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I don't recall if we've actually given a 90-day period before. I don't believe that we have. In
terms of beyond that there is not a lot more that I can add to that, but we are very excited. Prime is growing very fast,
very excited for the service that we offer customers both in terms of physical and digital goods. So, it's exciting and not
certain enough to how well we put it in there today in the release.
Operator
We'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi, Tom. Two, if I could. First on the Kindle family, it seems like the timing of device
launches of the eBook library size and local language content could be drivers of different levels of penetration of
digital media in the U.S. relative to what you've been able to attain outside the U.S. to-date.
And I was wondering if there's anything else notable that you would highlight that helps explain the different dynamic
that seems to be playing out within the media revenue line domestically versus international? And whether you think
any of those issues are structural or will they just work themselves out with the benefit of timing and your execution?
And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about how you think about the lifetime value of a non-Prime customer versus
a Prime customer and what the intended outcome may be as it relates to the increase in Super Saver pricing in the U.S.
market? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the first question. Certainly, we've been launched devices in the U.S. earlier in
terms of content; you're really referring to mostly eBook content, both growing very fast. The base is different as you
mentioned. We have our higher base in the U.S. just based on when we launched. So, you're absolutely right, you do
see that difference in the media line between North America and International. And so, again both are growing very
nicely right now in terms of digital Kindle books in this case as you referenced, but it's just different base. And so,
we're excited about the opportunity that we have in both segments there. But we're further ahead right now in North
America. And then, I'm sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question again?
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Just, how you're thinking about lifetime value of those that are not-Prime subs versus Prime
subs, given they're increasingly recently good with Super Saver shipping in the U.S. from $25 to $35 threshold?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of the Prime customers, we've seen not only a very strong increase in Prime
membership, but we've seen very good retention of Prime members. And so, certainly when you look at that, in terms
of lifetime value, we have a customer base that's certainly staying with us longer. They're doing more cross shopping
and they're getting the benefits of Prime that we're offering that we continue to add to.
And then we still have a very good customer base that's non-Prime. You mentioned the threshold change. We did
change, we have different thresholds in various geographies around the world for Super Saver – shipping our Super
Saver delivery in those geographies.
And in the case of the U.S. we've had the $25 threshold for over 10 years and we changed to $35 and during this
timeframe, we've certainly increased our selection that's eligible for that by millions of items and certainly as you
would know, during this rather lengthy timeframe, transportation costs and fuel prices have changed significantly over
that time period. So, we had changed it. So, we just thought that was the right thing to do.

And we'll go next to Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. I want to ask about the North American EGM line, I guess, it's the second quarter
in a row you've had acceleration. When I asked you about it last quarter, I think you singled out fashion apparel and
consumer staples, but the growth is, the acceleration really seems to be in line with easing comps. Is there something in
there that to you indicates that you're getting real critical mass with your customers in those two particular categories?
And then, just real quickly on the Kiva robots, is there a reason you would call that out? Should that have some sort of
material impact over time on leverage in the fulfillment cost line? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure, in terms of our growth in EGM, you highlighted a couple categories that are growing
very nicely that we mentioned last quarter as well. What you're seeing there and actually the growth is very broad.
We've added a lot of unique selection in both our hardlines and softlines categories, including consumables, and
apparel, as you mentioned. The experience is getting better on the site. Unique selection has increased dramatically
over the past few years. So, then just a number of things that are coming together in those categories.
So, when I look at it, it just seems very broad, which we like and there's just a lot of new selection with great category
expansion, two of the last several years. So, that's really what you're seeing there.
In terms of Kiva, we have launched in a few FCs. We think it's an interesting opportunity. I think as I mentioned last
quarter at this time, we're ahead of the schedule that we had set forth at the time that we joined with Kiva and we're
excited what we see. Could certainly – we'll still be adding associates, certainly over time in those FCs. But this
certainly will be productivity with Kiva and we'll have to stay tuned to see what that looks like. But we're certainly
excited about that opportunity and the rollout.
Operator
And we'll go next to Victor Anthony with Topeka Capital Markets.
<Q - Victor B. Anthony>: Thanks for putting me on. So, ROIC is a metric you've highlighted each quarter. It's
hovered around 20%, 30%, 40% range throughout the quarters of 2010, 2011. It's obviously been depressed over the
past year-and-a-half due to investments. Maybe you could help us with the timing of when you expect ROIC to return
to levels we saw in 2011.
And second, you are investing a lot in video content for Prime Instant Video. Are there any hard numbers you can share
in terms of conversions from the Kindle devices? In the past there've been talk about converting Prime Instant Video
into a standalone product. Maybe you could share your thoughts there. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. Keep in mind, as you mentioned, we're investing very heavily in the business. We
think that's the right thing to do. We have a lot of good long-term opportunities, which is why we're doing it. It is
depressing ROIC.
Just keep in mind though, from a pure metrics standpoint, just as a reminder, the way we measure ROIC is free cash
flow divided by average invested capital. So total assets minus current liabilities and that's over a 5-point average. And
so, when you do that, first in the numerator, keep in mind it's about $1.4 billion in our free cash flow number that
relates to the purchase. It goes back to Q4 last year, but it's in our TTM free cash flow that relates to the purchase of our
campus here in Seattle and some nearby land, so it's $1.4 billion of that. So, that's bringing the free cash flow down.
Also keep in mind in the invested capital we do include cash and marketable securities, which is certainly the largest
piece of our invested capital. We think that's the right thing to do until we've either deployed that capital or returned it
in some way, but just keep in mind that that's included in the metric.
And in terms of, Prime Instant Video, we're getting great usage from a broad set of customers on Kindle, as well as,
other devices. And the adoption is going very well. I apologize, I can't share any specific metrics today, but we like

what we see. We think it's certainly helping the Prime numbers, the Prime membership increases that you're seeing and
we think it's interesting and we are investing there. We included in both, our Q3 results, as well as the Q4 guidance, our
assumptions around additional content that we'll be acquiring, including original content, so very excited about that
opportunity.
Operator
We'll go next to Mark May with Citi.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my question. The seasonal hiring is, I think, last year grew about inline with
the growth rate in U.S. revenue growth, but this year, you're growing at about 10 percentage points above the midpoint
of your range. Is there anything that's different this year that is driving that?
And then second question on pricing, there've been numerous reports recently, and I think, for a while now, that the
multi-channel competitors are competing more fiercely with the Amazon in terms of price parity, et cetera. What
impact are you seeing or do you think you could see from that and sort of how are you addressing it? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the seasonal employees, unfortunately, there's not a lot I can add to that. We're
getting ready for an exciting holiday season and that includes having to making sure that we have the right amount of
employees as well as seasonal help, during that period. It also includes, making sure we have the right capacity in
place, making sure we've added a lot of selection over the past couple of years and particularly over the past 12 months,
and making sure that we have good in-stock levels related to that selection.
We're making sure that we have people to help us with, not only serving customers with our retail inventory, but also
Fulfilled by Amazon has grown, certainly very strongly over the past year and that impacts the capacity and a number
of our employees that you see there. So, that's really what you're seeing in that number.
In terms of pricing, we operate in a very competitive arena. That's not something that's new. That's something that
we've been doing since our inception. We have many, many different competitors. You will pass those competitors on
your way to work, on your way home. They're offline. They're offline. It's a very competitive marketplace. Pricing is
something we worked very hard at over the years. We want to make sure we upgrade values for customers, and it's
something that we spend a lot of time on and work very hard to make sure that we can offer that to customers. So, I
wouldn't say that it's anything new; it's something that we've been dealing with since our inception, but it is a very
competitive environment.
Operator
We'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions. First, how do you see your competitive position versus
Alibaba in China? And what gives you confidence that you have a chance of being a relevant player there even in the
long-term?
And secondly, in the U.S., you have a service similar to subscription video-on-demand, that's a feature of Prime, which
is Amazon Prime Video, while in Europe you have a full-blown standalone service with LOVEFiLM. Why is your
strategy in Europe, so different from the strategy in the U.S. when it comes to video-on-demand? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of China, it's very early there. There's certainly a room for many winners. It's a
very large segment and we have a good business there, in terms of top line that's growing, and we continue to look for
ways to make sure that we satisfy customer demand. We work on a lot of the same inputs that we work on in our other
geographies, making sure we have great prices, good selection, speed of delivery, we've worked very hard in terms of
putting in a lot of capacity close to customers. And so, those are the things that we're working on to try to ensure
success there.

In terms of individual competitors, we have long-standing practices of not talking about other companies, but again,
there's room for a lot of winners. And in terms of video content, there's not a lot I can add to that question, I apologize.
But certainly, we have been ramping up our content in the U.S. on Amazon.com as part of Amazon Prime. It's
something that we've been looking at very carefully. We like what we see so far and we think it's interesting. But
beyond that, I can't speculate what we might do or might not do in other locations.
Operator
We'll go next to Mark Miller with William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good afternoon. On the AmazonFresh can you comment on what you're seeing in L.A.
versus the Seattle test? How important is the attachment rate with general merchandize? And then, as you're making
more frequent deliveries, are you finding that it is driving higher sales of general merchandize?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: It's very, very early in L.A., but what we see so far we like. We're having a lot of selection
there on behalf of customers. It is a great opportunity for customers to get both, a number of different items through
AmazonFresh and so we're excited. We like the trials that we've done, have been very good. The conversion has been
good. We look forward to improving that experience even more over time for customers, but it's very early, but we like
what we see, but you'll have to stay tuned on that one.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: And with general merchandise?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I'm sorry?
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Well, just, are you selling more general merchandise as a result of more frequent deliveries in
that market?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes.
Operator
We'll go next to Kerry Rice with Needham & Company.
<Q - Kerry Rice>: I just wanted to ask a question on your acquisition of TenMarks, which is really diving a little bit
deeper into that EdTech market. I know you sell and rent the text books. Can you talk a little bit maybe what your
strategy is there?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We've said it's a company that's doing some interesting things about helping students and
children learn math. We thought it was an interesting fit for us and we look forward to exploring what opportunities we
can do together there. And you have to stay tuned on that one, but we think, they're doing a very nice job and we're
interested. We're very excited to have them as part of the Amazon business.
Operator
We'll go next to Scott Tilghman with B. Riley.
<Q - Ronald Scott Tilghman>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to touch on the North American segment
margins for a little bit. We had seen some pretty good progress there in terms of year-over-year improvement, a little
bit of a back step last quarter, but not too much. The category fell back this quarter; wondering if there's anything
unusual in there in terms of timing or investments that maybe weren't called out and how we should think about that
over the next few quarters?

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of Q3 specifically, Q3 just because of the – as I would call it, the Q4
readiness, the seasonal readiness, you see this often in Q3, where both our total and our segment operating profit is
lower than other quarters. And that's certainly what you're seeing in Q3 and North America. So, that's in terms of the
investments we're making to get ready for the season, we talked about.
You saw in Jeff's quote the capacity that we're adding certainly in multiple geographies; but certainly in the North
America it's impacting that as well. You can see it in our fulfillment line item, as a percentage of revenue, being up.
You can see it in our tech and content. So, we're certainly investing. The other part too, that I mentioned earlier is, we
are investing in video content for Prime in the U.S. and you see that certainly in those results as well.
Operator
We'll go next to Tom Forte with Telsey.
<Q - Tom Forte>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to know where you stand. Last year, I think you
added 20 fulfillment centers on a full year basis and then last time you gave us an update, I think this year, it was five
U.S. and a handful international. I wanted to know where you stood on that and why the change versus last year. And
then, also very quickly, I wanted to see where you stood or how you felt about your Amazon Locker initiative. Thank
you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of fulfillment centers, the number is seven, but it's a net number, and so,
included in that are several consolidations. We are building generally larger FCs and we're consolidating some of those.
So, that's a net seven. And so, what that means is, if you were to take that as a percentage of our total fulfillment
centers, you certainly get a number that's less than the square footage that we're actually adding. So, we're adding
square footage that would be significantly higher than that.
In terms of Lockers, it's early. It's another way to get closer to customers to make it convenient for customers; and it's
interesting, we have it in a few different geographies right now. But it is limited; we don't have it broadly across our
full network. And so, it's something that we're learning and it's an interesting experience, and it's certainly something
that over time we'll continue to take a closer look at and certainly expand if it makes sense to do so on behalf of
customers.

We'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask two things. First, Tom, can you
give us some color on where you are in the shift from third-party to first-party eBooks, and how much of a factor that's
been in reaccelerating media revenue; we've seen reacceleration in media the last three quarters, I think, in North
America?
And then secondly, it looks like there's six fewer shopping days this holiday season between Black Friday and
Christmas. I'm just curious, what you do, if anything, differently to prepare for that? And do you think that could
actually even drive more holiday shopping online? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. In terms of your second question, there are fewer days; there's not a lot that we do
different. We certainly see when that happens, there is some behavioral differences on behalf of customers just because
of the shorter time period that we have certainly some more sizeable days during that period. But there's not a lot to add
to that.
In terms of the transition for eBooks, in terms of our total growth across Amazon both North America, total or global
total, it's not a significant or meaningful impact to the overall growth rate. And certainly, this transition's been going on
for some number of quarters now. So, there's not a lot I can help you with there.

We'll go next to Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to dig into the inventory a little bit. It looks like the growth slowed to
20%, if the sales accelerated. Tom, could you give us some insight as to why that is and maybe which categories
outperformed in the quarter?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. I would look at it more from turns perspective and if you look at it more over an
average turns basis, it has gone down. And the reason is unique selection. We keep adding, growth in unique selections
certainly has increased over the past year, in-stock levels have gotten better. And so those are the things that are really
driving it. In terms of endpoints for any particular quarter, they can be a little bit lumpy. But I would look to the turns.

We'll go next to John Blackledge with Cowen and Company.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, is it a priority to offer one-day or same-day
delivery at some point? There are some competitors who are offering same-day delivery in large markets for certain
brick-and-mortar retailers?
And then secondly, can you talk about the prospects for the Login and Pay program; how many online merchants are
signed up for it, and what is the Amazon getting out of it, either economically and/or from maybe getting data out of
the purchasers? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of speed of delivery, whether it'd be one day or same day, what's happened
certainly over the past 10-plus years is we've added a lot of selection, we've added a lot of fulfillment centers. As a
result of that, we have selection that's by default increased the amount of selection that's closer and closer to customers.
As a result of that, our speed of delivery has improved. And certainly for Prime customers, depending upon the
geography; in the case of the US Express, two-day shipping for free and then for small fees, you certainly can get it
faster than that. That's something that – so you've seen that improvement gradually over the past 10-plus years. You've
seen it certainly gotten even better the last few years as we've rapidly increased the number of fulfillment centers. So
that's something that we think is important and we'll continue to work on behalf of customers to give them those
options and to make sure that they get products when they want it.
In terms of Login and Pay, it's something that we think is interesting, because of our large customer base and the
credentials that we have and the secure payments that we have, we think it's an interesting opportunity, and we think
that there's certainly interesting ways to monetize that over time; but again, we think it's an interesting opportunity.

We'll go next to Ron Josey with JMP Securities.
<Q - Ronald V. Josey III>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about new international markets
and specifically I think Amazon India was called out, given 10 new category launches in the past 120 days or so. So,
my question is related to really the infrastructure in India and how good is it, and, so that Amazon can continue to
growth there? And then specifically, if other countries can follow a model like this and Brazil comes to mind. Thank
you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure, we have a few different models in India and we, from a – we have a marketplace
model which we offer, Fulfilled by Amazon, which, as you mentioned certainly the infrastructure is not as advanced as
some geographies, but we also view that as an opportunity and we're happy to help sellers, who are Fulfilled by
Amazon. So, it's an interesting opportunity. It's very, very early. We're in an investment mode there. It's a long-term

We'll go next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great, thanks. Maybe you could comment on what you're seeing domestically and internationally,
in terms of e-commerce trends in the current quarter? Anything specific standout, especially in North America, given
some of the mix commentary we've heard from some of your competitors? And then, just some additional comments if
you could on growth in the other revenue category, specifically on AWS and/or on your advertising business? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. I'll take the second one first. In terms of AWS, it's growing very, very strong. It's an
area that's very early for us. It's growing very, very strong. We have a great team that's working on it, servicing
customers, and we're very excited about the long-term opportunity.
In terms of – you mentioned the trends in North America, what you've seen is really a nice steady acceleration of
growth since Q4 last year. So, if you look back to Q4 last year for North America specifically, and you just trace that
back over the past four quarters; you see a really nice sequential increase from quarter-to-quarter.
And again, that gets back to – it went from 23% in Q4 last year to 26% to 30% and 31% versus the year-over-year
increases by quarter for North America revenue. And a lot of it is what we've talked about earlier. It's focused on a lot
of the retail basics as well as also improving seller performance as well. And so, those are the things that are driving it.

We'll go next to the Jordan Rohan with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Jordan E. Rohan>: Thanks so much. A follow-up to the last question on U.S. in particular, did you see any
weakness or any discernible trends around the government shutdown and all the politics going on in Washington in
September and early October?
And separately, can you talk about what you're learning from being an investor in LivingSocial? With the accounting
charges aside, can you talk about your own local business, how that may compete with other players in the space and
all the various initiatives you have with – what can be learned from what you know at this point? You're no longer a
new investor in that company? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of North America growth other than what I mentioned on the quarterly growth,
Q3 was strong. It was 31% growth. Again, we've seen a nice steady increase over the past four quarters. That's
overlapping the quarter from Q3 of last year that was 33%. So again, we like what we see from a growth perspective in
Q3 for North America.
In terms of total growth, giving a wide range for Q4 and that reflects our view for Q4, but we're excited about the
quarter and about getting ready for customers during this heavy seasonal quarter. So, we're excited about what we see
there.
In terms of LivingSocial there's really not a lot I can add to your question, I apologize. They're doing a good job in
terms of local. And we also have a local offering on Amazon. Team is very dedicated to make that work and it's an
interesting area. We're learning, but it's early.

<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thank you. Tom, when you look at the deceleration in growth in North America and
other revenue, I mean, obviously, it's still at a very high level, but when we're thinking about the major components of
that line; AWS, advertising, credit card relationship, is there anything relevant to the relative growth rates between
those components that we should be thinking about?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: I'm not sure how to answer your question. The only part I would call out, you mentioned
there is a number of different items that's in there. Certainly, the largest and fastest growing largest area by far is AWS
and it's growing very nicely and that's certainly reflected in that line item.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our Investor
