Our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez, will now review the firm's results. Marty?
R. Martin Chavez
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through the second quarter and first half results, then
I'll be happy to answer any questions.
In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $7.9 billion, net earnings of $1.8 billion, earnings per diluted share
of $3.95, and an annualized return on common equity of 8.7%. Taking a step back to review our year-to-date results,
we had firmwide net revenues of $15.9 billion, net earnings of $4.1 billion, earnings per diluted share of $9.10, and a
return on common equity of 10.1%.
As you can see, the first six months of 2017 reflected improved performance. We were able to achieve this despite what
continues to be a challenging operating environment in certain businesses. Our revenues were up more than $1.6
billion, or 12%, compared with the first half of last year. Meanwhile, expenses were up only 6%, demonstrating the
positive operating leverage that is embedded within our operations.
Despite a difficult backdrop for our FICC business, the firm grew pre-tax margin by 340 basis points versus last year;
and our ROE increased 260 basis points. The improvement stems from having a diversified set of leading global
businesses. Weakness in FICC, particularly in commodities, was offset by stronger results in Investing & Lending,
Investment Management, and Underwriting.
As all of you are aware, many of the themes that we've discussed during the first quarter continued into the second:
rising market values; and low volatility. On one hand, rising market prices were supportive of capital markets activity,
investment management performance, and our investing and lending activities. We recorded our third-best quarterly
revenue performance in debt underwriting, reflecting our multiyear effort to improve our relative positioning with our
clients. Another area of strength is Investment Management, where we posted record management and other fees, and
assets under supervision. And Investing & Lending generated $1.6 billion of revenues in the quarter, with net interest
income within debt securities and loans, reaching more than $400 million.
On the other hand, low levels of volatility, sequentially lower in several FICC asset classes, negatively affected the
FICC environment. The current backdrop has been particularly challenging for our FICC franchise, creating headwinds
in areas that are core strength for the firm. For example, we are a market leader in commodities, but it was a
challenging environment on multiple fronts. In addition, our clients place significant value on the firm's long-standing
commitment to market-making, as well as our strength in derivatives. But client activity levels understandably declined
given the low volatility environment.
With that as a broad overview, let's now discuss individual business performance in greater detail. Investment Banking
produced second quarter net revenues of $1.7 billion, up slightly compared to the first quarter. Our Investment Banking
backlog increased since the end of the first quarter. Breaking down the components of Investment Banking in the
second quarter, advisory revenues were $749 million, roughly flat to the first quarter.
Year-to-date, Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A. We advised on a number of
important transactions that were announced during the second quarter, including: C.R. Bard's $24 billion sale to
Becton, Dickinson; Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods; and DuPont Fabros Technology's $7.6 billion
merger with Digital Realty Trust. We also advised on a number of significant transactions that closed during the second
quarter, including: Syngenta's $43.6 billion sale to ChemChina; HPE's $13.5 billion spin-off and merger of its
Enterprise Services business with Computer Sciences; and PrivateBancorp's $5 billion sale to CIBC.
Moving to Underwriting, net revenues were $981 million in the second quarter, up 4% on a sequential basis. Equity
underwriting revenues were $260 million, down 16% quarter-over-quarter due to lower follow-on offerings. Debt
underwriting revenues of $721 million reflected continued strength across all products and were up 13% relative to the
first quarter.

During the second quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in: Qualcomm's $11 billion
bond offering in support of its acquisition of NXP; Intrum Justitia's €3 billion bond offering in support of the
combination with Lindorff; and Banco Macro's $766 million follow-on offering.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and Equities businesses. Net revenues were
$3.1 billion in the second quarter, down 9% compared to the first quarter. FICC Client Execution net revenues were
$1.2 billion in the second quarter, down 31% sequentially as volatility and client conviction remained low and led to
weaker client activity quarter-over-quarter. All of our businesses produced lower net revenues quarter-over-quarter.
Rates was down significantly. Credit, mortgages, and currencies all declined. Across many of these products, volatility
trended lower in the quarter, and clients were less active. Commodities was also significantly lower and was our worst
quarter on record. Not surprisingly, given the results, it was a difficult quarter on all fronts. The market backdrop was
challenged, client activity remained light, and we didn't navigate the market as well as we aspired to or as well as we
have in the past. Nevertheless, the firm remains committed in every way to help our clients manage their commodity
risks.
Now, moving to Equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees, and security services. Net
revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, up 13% sequentially. Equities client execution net revenues of $687
million were up 24% compared to first quarter due to stronger results in cash products. The business continued to
operate in an environment with global equity market strength. Commissions and fees were $764 million, up 4% versus
the first quarter as volumes increased modestly. Securities services generated net revenues of $441 million, up 15%
quarter-over-quarter due to seasonally stronger client activity. Turning to risk, average daily VaR in the second quarter
was $51 million, down from $64 million in the first quarter, the byproduct of lower volatility levels.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenue of $1.6 billion in
the second quarter. Equity securities generated net revenue of $1.2 billion, reflecting sales, corporate performance and
gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $396 million, and as I mentioned
before, included more than $400 million of net interest income.
In Investment Management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.5 billion. This was up 2% from the first
quarter, primarily as a result of higher management and other fees, which were a record for the quarter. Assets under
supervision increased $33 billion sequentially to a record $1.41 trillion. The increase primarily reflected $23 billion of
net inflows in connection with the acquisition of a portion of Verus Investors and $17 billion of net market
appreciation. This was partially offset by net outflows and liquidity products.
Now, let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense for the year-to-date, which include salaries, bonuses,
amortization of prior-year equity awards, and other items such as benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net
revenues ratio of 41%. This is the lowest first-half accrual in our public history and 100 basis points lower than the
accrual in the first half of 2016. As we discussed last quarter, the reduction in the accrual rate reflects the completion of
the nearly $900 million expense initiative that we announced last year. Second quarter non-compensation expenses
were $2.1 billion, down slightly from the first quarter.
Now, I'd like to take you through a few key statistics for the second quarter. Total staff was approximately 34,100,
unchanged from the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year-to-date was 19.1%. If you exclude the tax benefits
related to the settlement of equity awards, our effective tax rate for the year-to-date would've been roughly 29%. Our
global core liquid assets ended the second quarter at $221 billion, and our balance sheet and level 3 assets were $907
billion and $21 billion respectively.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% under the Basel III advanced approach on a transitional basis and 12.2%
on a fully phased-in basis. It was 13.9% using the standardized approach on a transitional basis and 13.5% on a fully
phased-in basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio finished at 6.3%. And finally, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of
common stock for $1.5 billion in the quarter.
For the four quarters CCAR cycle for 2016, we provided shareholders with nearly $7 billion of capital through share
buybacks and common stock dividends. In terms of this year's CCAR test, the Federal Reserve Board did not object to

our plan which includes the potential for share repurchases and increase in our common stock dividend, and the
issuance and redemption of capital securities. We are pleased with this outcome and believe we have flexibility to
manage our capital going forward.
Now for some brief summary comments. The first half of 2017 provided two important reminders. First is the value of
having a leading diversified franchise. Despite a difficult first half of 2017 for one of our major businesses, FICC, we
posted 12% year-over-year revenue growth and a 10.1% return on common equity. In addition, we were able to
produce $9.10 of earnings per diluted share. We benefited from leading positions in many of our businesses. And while
their relative performance may vary in any individual quarter, their collective value has been central to our
outperformance over the long-term.
The second reminder is the ongoing and long-term benefits associated with being a prudent manager of both cost and
capital. Over the last several years, we have been looking for ways to operate more efficiently. This includes shifting
our organizational footprint to different locations such as Salt Lake City where we now have more than 2,300 people. It
has meant leveraging technology to improve internal productivity and client engagement. It has also meant returning
more than $35 billion of capital since the beginning of 2012 and, in the process, creating our lowest ever share count.
This has positioned the firm to provide more operating leverage to shareholders, and it has also given us the capacity to
make strategic investments such as Marcus, and expand our investment management business by acquisition.
Ultimately, we know that by recruiting and retaining the best people and providing our clients with the best advice and
service, we are well-positioned to outperform over the long-term. Our commitment to these ideals is unwavering.
Thank you again for dialing in. And with that, let's move to the Q&A portion of the conference call. I'm happy to
answer all of your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your next
question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. So I definitely heard all the commentary on FICC, and I think commodities is
one of the things that stands out, that makes you different than the others. But maybe we could talk about mix of clients
and how much that adds to maybe the differentiated performance that we're seeing, meaning you seem more
volatility-dependent, right? We've talked about it in the past. And when vol is low, your revenues struggle more than
others. Is there anything that Goldman can do to broaden the mix of both clients and products to be less
volatility-dependent? In the past, you had a relationship with Sumitomo that brought a bigger lending mix. I'm just
thinking out loud.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure, Glenn. Obviously, that's a question on our minds as well as yours. And so to step back
for a moment, while there are nuances, and everyone's franchise is a bit different as we all know, our franchise
emphasizes providing liquidity to active asset managers. So it really isn't just a question of low volatility; it's more a
sequence of low volatility, less dispersion, less client activity, reduced opportunity sets, and lower revenues.
Also, as you mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a leading commodities business which has a
greater weight in our franchise than in other franchises, and it was a challenging backdrop for commodities; really
challenging on all fronts. And in addition, while it was a potentially better business environment for mortgages
year-on-year, we have a smaller weight of mortgages in our franchise. So those are some effects that are likely there.

To get to the second part of your question on actions that one can take, I can tell you that everyone in our FICC
business is intensely focused on this topic and, at a granular molecular level, working on it as are all of us in the
leadership team. So much of this is blocking and tackling. So in no particular order, we're looking to see where
potentially there are gaps in our client coverage and on-board new clients and serve them. Also, the ongoing question in
every business generally is how can we do better with the clients who are already clients of the firm, how can we cover
them better, how can we have a greater impact with them, how can we provide them new solutions to their challenges,
and that is really an iterative process of communicating with the clients. Our business starts and ends with them, and so
it's communicating with them, coming up with new products, technologies, tools, analytics, workflows, and iterating so
that we have an offering that is what they're looking for, and that's something that we're going to continue doing and
we're totally committed to it.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Maybe the related follow-up is more cyclical than that structural piece. I guess I scratch my head
at times and say why is volatility so low. Like, theoretically, we've been waiting for this inflection point for the U.S. to
be off QE to start raising rates which is different than what's going on in Europe and Asia. You've had some currency
movement, some commodity movement. You would've thought this would've been a better volatile backdrop and
people would've wanted your liquidity, but it's not happening.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well – I'm sorry, Glenn. I interrupted.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: No, I didn't know. Are we hooked on idiosyncratic events and actually these asset class moves
aren't good enough?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: What I would say there, Glenn, is really on predicting when anything will be different than
it is. Just looking back historically, one year ago – exactly at this time – I don't think anyone of us would've predicted
the strong client activity market environment of the second half of 2016. It arrived and we had the capacity to serve our
clients when they became more active on the back of any number of events happening globally. As for the
environment, generally one can think of a number of possible drivers that would change the environment. Some things
that would potentially be supportive to greater client activity would be of course economic growth, confidence,
pro-growth policies. But ultimately, our business is driven by the clients and their activity.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Thank you, Glenn.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Good morning. Just one more question on the FICC side. You mentioned in terms of looking
at the business, and maybe some the client gaps, the market share. I guess when we look at the first half of 2017, it's
weak and maybe commodities is a bigger part of that. But I think even in 2016, when we look at the global competitors,
it seems like the FICC business has been a little bit more challenged. So I'm just trying to figure out how far along
again in that process is the management team or is the FICC franchise in terms of reassessing whether it's the client, the
product mix, to try to diversify and broaden, like, some of the growth opportunities?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well it's a good question, so let's go into some other effects that may be going on here. And,
of course, I'll caveat it by saying that we don't have transparency into our competitors' FICC businesses, but I'll note
that historically we've had strength in derivatives. And this was a weak quarter, like the first quarter, for derivatives.
Also, it's likely that some of our competitors have bigger corporate footprints than we do as well as bigger financing
footprints than we do. And so while the core of our business in FICC has been, as I mentioned, providing liquidity to
active asset managers, it isn't a matter of just focusing on active asset managers and having a leading active manager
franchise; it's also a question of how we can deepen our impact with the clients and have a leading cash offering as

well. So it isn't one or the other; it's a question of doing both.
Similarly, talking about asset managers, we can have a great asset manager franchise and a great corporate franchise,
and working on both. And so this is something that all of us are evaluating and making changes and working on, and
we're committed to it. We know we need to do better.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. And then just a follow-up I guess on CCAR and just capital priorities. Given I guess
the combination of some of the challenges on the trading side but then also just the valuation, the stock, has anything
changed in terms of how much you guys are focused on capital return versus reinvesting in the business? M&A
activity? And if there's areas – I know you guys have been active on the asset management side, but anything else on
that front?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: So, just a few thoughts on CCAR. We've learned a lot going through the process for a few
years now. And without question, the process makes the industry safer and sounder. This year, the Federal Reserve's
analysis showed that 34 banks could withstand $0.5 trillion in stress losses and continue lending to their clients. It's a
robust process, and it's evolving every year. And, ultimately, regulators have the authority for capital. Of course, we
have our view and detailed analytics of what's the right amount of capital to hold.
At various times in the past, as you all know, we've resubmitted on CCAR, which is another way of saying that we
believed that we had more excess capital than we could return or deploy. This year, we did not resubmit, and we deem
it important to operate from a position of strength, to have, therefore, excess capital, and also to have excess capital to
deploy to the clients. And we're ready and looking forward to increased opportunity, increased client activity, and
therefore, more opportunities to deploy capital.
<Q - Michael Carrier>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning, Marty.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So, you talked a lot about customer sets and just very, very low levels of volatility and
activity. And I think a lot of that has sort of manifested in the market, so we get that. That said, you've said now twice,
in last quarter's call and this one, that you could've navigated the markets better. Is that only with respect to
commodities? Is that more broadly? And can you just give us a little bit more color on what you mean by that?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. So, looking at our FICC businesses, as we discussed, year-on-year, they all declined
except for mortgages, and sequentially, they all declined. And while there are nuances, the primary driver across most
of the businesses – and I'll get to commodities in a moment – the primary driver for the decline sequentially or
year-on-year was lower client activity with all the drivers that we discussed: lower volatility; less dispersion; less
opportunity set.
Commodities is a story of challenges on all fronts. And there, it was lower client activity and also a difficult
market-making environment. As you know, in market-making, if I could use for a moment a store analogy, though it is
more complex than a typical store, our clients – we need to have in our store the products that the clients are seeking,
and we need to have a capacity to create the products that the clients are seeking. And sometimes, clients are also
selling us products that go into the store, which is maybe different from a typical store.
And all of this is happening in a dynamic market environment, where the value of all the products in the store is
moving up and down. And so, managing that central problem of risk management in a market-making business requires

choices, and art, and science. And it's an uncertain process. And you can make good choices and have less than good
outcomes. And so, that's what I mean when I say it's a challenging market environment. And also, we didn't navigate
the markets, in making those choices, as well as we want to and as well as we typically have.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then turning the page to equities, which we haven't
really talked about much, but where you actually had a pretty meaningful improvement relative to both of the reference
quarters. And looking in particular at the customer execution, are you starting to see some of the benefits of the
investments that you've made in quant-oriented products? Did you just have a very successful period in terms of equity
derivatives despite the fact that vol wasn't great, right? Actually, you said cash products. It doesn't sound like it was
that. Maybe you can just give us a little bit more color for how you saw such a significant increase in execution results?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well, Guy, I'd be very happy to go into some significant detail on our Equities business. As
you mentioned, it was an environment of higher equity prices and low volatility. And then you asked, the question is
how is this different? And I would note several things.
First, our volumes held up rather well, and you can see that in the commissions line, which we break out. Then looking
at the equities client execution line, and you referenced this, we had better cash results globally. And beyond the U.S.,
we had better cash and derivatives results.
And we noticed our market share going up, not just with our active manager clients, but also the passive managers. As
for providing capital in equities client execution, we observed increased demand around a variety of events: the
European elections; also, as we noticed last year, around the Brexit referendum. In addition, as it relates to equities
client execution, we observed a normalization in the markets in Asia.
And to get to another part of your question, we are observing the positive results of investing over multiple quarters in
both execution and in capital commitment. And then, in addition, I would note corporate activity remained healthy and
is typically not correlated with the activity of the active manager clients.
And so, I'm referencing all of these, because they're all interesting and useful observations and notions that we can
apply in our other businesses. For example, in the FICC business, we've already begun applying some of these in, for
instance, U.S. corporate credit. And now, we're extending it to Europe, and into our other businesses.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Super. Thanks. And just one more for me, which is sort of part question, part observation on
the CCAR result. I guess, the question is would you ever consider changing your policy to tell us what you were
approved for, like all your peers do? I think analysts/investors are grown-up enough to understand it's not a
commitment, that it's just an approval. But the observation part of it is I just don't think you're doing yourselves any
favors by not telling us.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well, appreciate your sharing that observation, Guy. And I'm not going to make a prediction
about what we will or won't do in the future. Obviously, we do think about this a lot. And we have observed that the
other banks who went through the CCAR process disclosed their authorization. We just see it as such dynamic process.
As you said, it's not a commitment, and we know you understand that. Nevertheless, because it's an authorization and
we're constantly reevaluating it, we haven't disclosed it, and that's just where we are.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: You bet.

Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffery J. Harte>: Hey. Good morning. My question is more on a macro level as we're looking at potential LCR
and kind of SLR easing. I'm kind of sitting back trying to think how much LCR, SLR easing could potentially increase
the financing available to clients, so therefore, kind of boost trading volumes and overall market activity. And I guess,

I'm kind of looking back at 2Q 2014 when we got the final SLR rule, and we saw your repo book really kind of decline
that quarter. How much could easing there help overall trading activities? You're kind of attracting trading activities as
opposed to just helping Goldman Sachs. I mean, do you have a feel for how big an impact that had in your trading
businesses back in 2Q 2014?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. It's a great question. I'll just step back for a moment to observe the executive order and
then the Treasury report that followed it, which I know all of us have reviewed. There's order of 100 recommendations
in that report, as you know. And about two-thirds of them, roughly, are activities that the regulators could undertake
that don't require legislative authorization.
And the report did get a bit more specific on the ratios that you mentioned, particularly, SLR. And there's certainly
been a lot of commentary and research out in the market about what changes to the SLR might create in terms of
capacity. And there's many views on this. As you know, SLR was the most binding metric for us this year. It was the
first time that it was incorporated into the CCAR process, although as to how the CCAR process will evolve with stress
capital buffers and other proposal, it's really not knowable.
We also know, and you know, that various regulators have expressed different views on a recalibration. So, for
instance, Governor Powell was broadly in favor; and the Chairman of the FDIC, Mr. Gruenberg, not so. And so, I
wouldn't want to speculate too much beyond saying that if the Treasury report's recommendation were to be adopted by
the regulators, and as I said, that's not knowable right now, but if it were, potentially, a recalibration such as that might
change the way that we think about our Prime Brokerage business and the Matchbook business. But as for how that
will show up in client activity and revenues, there's many inputs to client activity, and this is just one.
<Q - Jeffery J. Harte>: And so, I mean, has the availability of financing to kind of active trading accounts been a
meaningful deterioration, I guess, maybe problem over the last couple of years?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: I wouldn't say it's a problem. It's just we're continuously evolving and responding to the
regulatory environment capital plan. It's a planning process. It's complex; it's nonlinear; it's changing. And not sure that
any of this has really much of an effect on whether there are alpha opportunities for the active managers.
<Q - Jeffery J. Harte>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hey, Marty.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Two questions. Just one, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some of what
you think you'll be doing or focusing on as an organization is just plain old blocking and tackling. Could you just give
us a sense as to what you mean by that? I have my own views, but I wanted to understand what you meant by that.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. So, blocking and tackling is actually a very broad topic, and a lot of this is just what
any business would do. It's our people across the firm at all our levels of seniority meeting with clients. There's no
substitute for going to visit clients and talking with them and understanding their objectives, their benchmarks, their
challenges, things that are working for them, things that are not; understanding how they see the value that we're adding
to them, whether it's in liquidity provision or other services; understanding ways in which we can have a better
engagement with them.
And for instance, a topic that we've been working on for some time now, ways of extending and sharing our analytics
and data with them as a way of bringing them the relationship, strengthening the relationship, and leading potentially to
more activities. So, there's certainly just this aspect that's constantly changing, because the clients' needs and
requirements are changing for risk management products and services, and the format, the package, the way in which

they want those services delivered.
And the only way to know about that is to work with the clients at various levels: front, middle, and back, across the
client organization, engage with them and iterate. We've done this in other businesses. As I just mentioned, we've seen
the fruits of doing this in, for instance, our Equities business, which has led to new offerings over the last few years.
But it's really something that applies very broadly across our businesses.
And in Investment Banking a few years ago, we identified an opportunity to do better with our clients and to cover
more clients in debt capital markets. And you've seen the results of that multiyear effort in our league table rankings
and in our revenues. In Investment Management, the opportunity to provide holistic solutions to clients, for instance,
CIO outsourcing and to deliver that organically as well as through acquisitions, so that's an example. And, really, we
see all of these approaches and techniques as applying very broadly across all our businesses. And there's a huge
emphasis in doing that in our FICC business as well.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Got it. Okay. And then just separately, switching gears to Marcus. There's been some
commentary. I think Lloyd and others have talked about the take-up rate that you've had. Could you give us a sense of
progression from here? Are you looking for the same level of growth that you've been able to generate? And how much
over the course of the next couple of years do you anticipate taking your risk capital and utilizing it in Marcus?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. So, as you know, with Marcus, we saw an opportunity not so very long ago, given our
market position, our strength in technology and analytics, the fact that we didn't have bricks-and-mortars branches or
legacy systems, or credit cards, and just looking at all of the activity in this burgeoning world of digital consumer
finance, we saw an opportunity. And we put together a deliberate, methodical, organic plan.
Lloyd mentioned some of our progress according to that plan where we crossed the $1 billion threshold in loan
balances. And this customer-centric plan is progressing, and we're executing according to plan. We don't have loan
balance targets, and we're excited about this business and believe that it can generate high-teen ROEs.
Just stepping back, I'd like to take a minute to put Marcus in a broader context of all the ways that we're seeking and
delivering growth opportunities for the firm. First one is the markets, another one is expanding the franchise, another
would be improving our relative positioning, and then also, new products and opportunities. Even in our mature,
competitive markets, such as banking, institutional client services, investment management, there's opportunities to
close market share gaps, improve the client mix, do better with the clients. And we've taken purposeful actions to make
that happen.
There is in the area of the consumer a number of new opportunities that we're evaluating, including Marcus, which is
the first example, and an opportunity to leverage our strong brand into areas beyond our traditional franchise. And
Marcus is one such greenfield opportunity, where we don't need a leading market share for it to be a significant
opportunity for us.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: And then last, does it help with CCAR at all?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: I'm sorry, could you repeat that, Betsy? I didn't hear that.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Oh, the Marcus revenue stream, the NII associated with it, does that help at all with
CCAR? Is there an opportunity to improve the optionality in the capital structure by having this type of revenue stream
come through?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: I think it's a little too early to answer you on that one, Betsy. Marcus, really, it's not a
material NII story. At this point, it's really much more a return on attributed equity story. And as you know, CCAR is a
fluid and constantly evolving process.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Sure. Okay. Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hi. Good morning, Marty. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: You're welcome.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Hey. I've got a follow-up on FICC. So, you spoke to the market-making and issues with
central risk book, but just wanted to dig in a little, because, sequentially, VaR is down for you guys, but yet stable at
many of your money center competitors, which I would think should normalize for market volatility, so could you
square those two factors going on? Did something happen where the market-making difficulties you ran into were early
on in the quarter, and then you guys cut back a bit on the balance sheet? That's what led to the VaR decline versus peers
sequentially? How did that all shake out, or any increased color would be helpful?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. Everyone's approach to VaR and the way in which people incorporate VaR into their
businesses is different. We don't have VaR targets, and VaR is an output of client activity, client demand for capital. As
we discussed, and as you noted, it declined from $64 million to $51 million sequentially, so call it 20%. And looking
across the product areas, really, it's – lower volatility is the main driver. In currencies, there's a bit of a positional driver
in addition to the vol driver, and then also there's a diversification effect, so there was increased correlation. And as the
change in the VaR as it's measured in the different product areas, that led to a change in the diversification effect, so
that was a small contribution to VaR. But really, it's not a matter of cutting it back. It's just a matter of there was less
client demand for the VaR capacity.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Okay. And then another follow-up here on the commodity comments that you made
earlier. So, a few years ago, Goldman disclosed the breakdown of your FICC business with commodities being roughly
8% of ICS revenues. It seems as though your commentaries suggest that, that has increased in recent years. Can you
give us a sense about how large you think on average that's trended over the last couple years versus this several years
ago disclosure at this point?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: So I would just observe that out of the 73 quarters that we've been a public company, it was
the worst quarter for the commodities business, and we don't break out further the contribution of the individual
product lines. There's a lot of reasons for that, but really we just think of it as a business that serves the clients
holistically across a number of different products, and that's where I'll leave it.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Is it possible just to clarify a bit here? Given it's the worst commodities quarter on
record, does that mean that it might've actually even been a – there could've been a negative revenue figure or was it
positive or is that something you cannot disclose?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: I'll just say we don't disclose the product break out.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: All right. Worth a shot. Thanks, Marty.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Hey. Good morning. Maybe a question on the derivatives bigger picture. You guys have
always had superior risk management that's enabled you to be kind of top market share in derivatives. But I guess the
question is now how much do you think or are concerned about maybe structural headwinds on the demand side when
you have greater transparency in the markets, you have pressures on fees and flows on active managers from passives,
and even exchanges are trying to grab market share from OTC markets? At what point I guess do you start to rethink
that business and your advantage in that business or is it something, hey, we just have to maintain our top market share
and, hopefully, it comes back? Just how are you thinking about the response to any, I guess, continued pressure in that
business relative to the peer group?

<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. It's a great question. So just to one micro point that you made on exchange versus
OTC, I'll note that it's often the experience that they might seem like they're in opposition to one another, but often
there's actually a virtuous cycle where the availability of on-exchange liquidity actually makes it easier for market
makers to make markets in the OTC products, so therefore hedging more on exchanges, so it's a virtuous cycle. So I
wouldn't necessarily see those in opposition.
As for derivatives versus cash, again, I wouldn't see it as one or the other; why not both? And, of course, we're going to
continue investing in our historical strengths in derivatives and stay with our clients over the long-term, not just in the
quarters where they're extremely active. But I'll just note that as for product format or package, there's so many
different formats and they're constantly evolving, right? So for a particular kind of risk, you could have futures,
derivatives, cash, systematic trading strategies, ETFs, and it just goes on and on. And, really, as opposed to attempting
to predict which product format is going to be appealing to the client, I think that would be really brittle to have a
prediction and move everything in that direction.
And, really, the way we're seeing it, the way we see generally everything, is preparing the firm to respond to a variety
of different market states and a variety of different client needs. And so if the clients are in some period of time, and it
could be secular, it could be cyclical, doesn't matter, who knows? If the clients are looking for cash solutions, then
building strength in cash solutions is part of what we'll do. We have experience, and I'll just note the Equities business
is one example of declining commissions. And commissions are at a small fraction in the Equities business of where
they were, say, 15 years ago, and that has not been an obstacle to constantly evolving the business and finding new
ways to serve the clients. And I expect that kind of learning and things we've learned and observed in our U.S.
corporate credit business to be valuable observations that we can extend to all of our businesses.
<Q - James Mitchell>: That makes sense. Just maybe one quick follow-up on that. Do you think there's a correlation
in, say, a hedge fund client's willingness to take on leverage in the derivatives markets? Is it correlated you think with
sort of flows, like their desire to stay more liquid and therefore don't want to take on, say, more illiquid assets like
derivatives, and that's something we should be watching to see an inflection there? How do you think about what is
driving their decision-making process?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: There, it would be tough to speculate on their thought process. Of course, we talk to them
all the time, and what they're telling us is that this whole backdrop of lower volatility, less dispersion, leads to less
conviction and a lower opportunity set for them and for us.
<Q - James Mitchell>: Okay. Great. Fair enough. Thanks.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Thanks, Jim.

Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Thanks. Hey, Marty. So I had a follow-up question on the line of discussion on derivatives.
There was a report that was published a few years ago by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission which showed that
derivatives actually contributed more than 50% of your FICC revenue. And given the impact that weaker derivatives
had on results this quarter and recognizing, as you noted, there were a lot of different derivative product formats we
need to think through, I mean, how has that mix evolved in recent years and how should we expect that to traject
longer-term?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: So, well, great question, Steven. I'll just note that we don't really. Well, of course, we have
all kinds of analytics. We don't really break out the business in that particular way. We have noted that that ratio
between cash and derivatives, for example in the rates business just to give one example where there is, for instance,
the swap data repositories and there's other data sources, it seems that there's more activity really across the industry in
the product format of T-bills and futures. Of course, swaps – vanilla swaps – continue to be a hugely important part of

that business.
Again, I'll just go back to what I mentioned which is something we believe profoundly, which is that we go where the
clients lead us, and of course it's iterative. We have ideas for new products and solutions, and we work on that with the
clients and we see if it fits their needs and we evolve from there, and we plan for a variety of different outcomes. So is
there a trajectory on more derivatives versus cash in the future or less? That's really not how we think about it. It's
much more a matter of being prepared to offer the clients both, and it's become increasingly much more dynamic than
just that kind of dichotomy of cash or derivatives. There's product formats that are being created really all the time, and
having the capability and the capacity to operate across products and across different kinds of product formats is core to
our franchise.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Got it. And just one follow-up for me on the discussion on the Treasury white paper and the
SLR in particular. We and many of our clients are going through the exercise of trying to assess the cumulative benefit
that could accrete to you as well as many of your peers, and you noted that the SLR and CCAR appears to be your
binding constraint today. But the constraint that appears to be nearly as binding is the 4% Tier 1 leverage in CCAR. I
didn't know if you had any thoughts as to whether you anticipate that, in a similar vein or fashion, that the carve out
would be applied to that measure as well or how you're thinking about binding this in the event that you get some of
those reforms as outlined by the Treasury push through?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well it's a great question, Steven. I would say that we don't really, other than the
observation which you can see on the Fed's website, that SLR was binding this year. We don't really – I don't think it
would be useful to call out a particular rule. As we look at the way the rules were written, they're having a powerful
effect on systemic safety and soundness. And even before the election and the executive order and the Treasury report,
regulators were already beginning to step back and look at the totality of the rules and see all the ways that they
interact.
Just as one example, Governor Tarullo gave a very thoughtful speech on the stress capital buffer concept as a possible
evolution of CCAR. We don't know when or if that concept will appear in CCAR. But interestingly, that approach links
capital returns, balance sheet, risk-weighted assets, spot and stress ratios, really in a matter that's very aligned with how
we think about capital planning, and all of these metrics kind of feed into one another and there's an interplay. So I
don't think it would be useful to speculate on any one metric other than to say we do what we do which is we build
analytics, models, processes, and we set ourselves up so that we can respond to the clients in a variety of different
regulatory and market scenarios.
<Q - Steven Chubak>: Great. Thanks, Marty.

Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Hey, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, Marty. I don't know if I heard you correctly, and I apologize ahead
of time, but when you were talking about the FICC business, obviously the customer behavior in the markets, the lack
of volatility was a contributor to the weak number in FICC. But I think you also said you weren't as happy about your
navigating or your company's navigating the markets. If I heard it correctly, how much of the downturn was due to the
customers versus your own trading capabilities, and how does that compare to the first quarter when you compare the
two?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well, I need to go back to that store analogy. While it would be maybe a wonderful utopian
thing to be able to separate the two and say one is client activity and one is navigating the markets, they're really
interwoven. And so in making prices to clients, they want to buy, so we sell; they want to sell, so we buy; there's

choices there. And then in the strategies that we employ to manage the resulting basis risk, there's strategies there. And
then we step back and, at the end, observe the results. And it was a comment that I really wanted to make very
particularly about the commodities business. As for the rest of the FICC businesses, it really was a story of lower client
activity.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Very good. And then coming back to the Investment Banking pipelines, can you give us more
color geographically or industry strategic versus financial? What are you guys seeing in that pipeline?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Sure. So if I look at the backlog, really it's driven primarily by Underwriting. But looking at
banking broadly, I would say the CEOs are confident. The conversations are happening all the time. Strategic M&A in
the U.S., those discussions are occurring especially in technology, in consumer retail, in natural resources. In Europe, I
would say it's hard to predict given the Brexit uncertainty. There's healthy activity and we certainly see opportunities in
Europe for debt underwriting. In Asia, we're still seeing the trend of Chinese buying of international assets and we
remain optimistic over the long-term. And as for the debt markets, again, no predictions here other than to note what
we all know which is that trends in rates and spreads and volatility and M&A activity all drive demand for issuance.
And even though rates have moved up, overall financing costs are still quite low by historical standards.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. And then just finally, can you guys give us any additional color on the Treasury's
proposal for retrofitting the Volcker Rule, just how you guys are seeing it evolve?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well, again, I would say there is the Treasury's proposal and there's discussions about how
Volcker might evolve as it relates both to market-making as well as to the Volcker-covered funds. I wouldn't make any
specific comments on how Volcker might evolve other than to observe, again, with the regulators. Multiple regulators
have talked about this publicly. They're taking an opportunity to step back and potentially recalibrate. What I would say
is that as and when this recalibration occurs, we'd expect the regulations to continue to be thoughtful to protect the
system and, at the same time, to support growth and well-functioning markets.

Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alevizos Alevizakos>: Hi, Martin. Thank you for taking my questions. My question is basically we talked a lot
about Equities, and obviously the performance is very strong particularly after, I think, the relative underperformance
in Q1. And I wanted to actually touch on the equity capital markets, on the ECM. I was surprised because the figure
was actually weaker than I was expecting, and it was coming off a weak-ish Q2 2016, and I also believe that the
Dealogic numbers were pointing up overall materially for the quarter. So would you mind telling me if there was
something special there or you think like it was a kind of one-off that's going to be reversed in Q3?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: That's a great question. So as you noted, year-to-date our volumes are strong and
outperforming, and of course the quarter is an important and useful and standard construct, at the same time it can also
be a relatively arbitrary boundary. But working within that boundary, sequentially there were lower follow-ons and
year-on-year lower converts. And as for the drivers of the revenue results, as distinct from the volume results, it's
something that is a very complicated output. There's a place where one can get conflicted out. Sometimes, in smaller
deals there's actually fewer underwriters. And as you know, everyone is part of the league table but there's fewer
underwriters, there's fewer banks to share among. And so there's a lot of effects going on there as for what the actual
drivers are. As we always do, we'll look into it and respond.
<Q - Alevizos Alevizakos>: Great. And if I can turn your attention into the I&L division. You've already spoken about
the NII strength, and you said that the figure is more than $400 million. I'm just trying to get a feeling on the recurring
part that relates to your increased lending through corporate and private banking versus the standard kind of one-off

interest that's coming from your equity investments. Could you kind of give us an indication whether you start seeing
more and more recurring NII hitting that division?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Well, looking at the I&L portfolio, right now it stands at just over $106 billion, and that's
almost a $4 billion increase sequentially, and 79% of that is Lending. On that NII figure that we quoted, more than
$400 million, that is recurring.

Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Good morning. Thanks, Marty. So a couple of quick questions here. On the deposit front, I
know you've been growing in kind of consumer, I guess we would call those consumer deposits, and I know that you
haven't really been growing markets that much. So what other businesses are being funded by those deposits?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: I'm sorry. I didn't hear the last part of the question. Could you say that again, Brian, please?
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Yeah. Which other businesses are utilizing that deposit funding? Are they supporting I&L?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: All right. Sorry. Yes. Well our Private Wealth Management business is an example of one
of those businesses. As of the first quarter, it's about $29 billion of loans and commitments to our Private Wealth
Management clients, and that's up about $1 billion sequentially.
<Q - Brian Kleinhanzl>: Okay. Thanks. And have you seen any specific impact from MiFID II on your overall
businesses, both in Equity and FICC? Does that play a role in the results this quarter?
<A - R. Martin Chavez>: I would say it's significant certainly in terms of the effort across our businesses. And really,
as you know, MiFID II is an extremely broad undertaking, arguably broader than, for instance, the U.S. regulatory
changes since the crisis. I would just call out a couple of major areas of MiFID II. So on execution services, as that
evolves we're staying close to the clients. And then as for research, it's crucial we believe to continue to provide
differentiated strong content and to be a scaled player with differentiated content that the clients value. Potentially,
there's some mind share impact because this is a big lift across the industry with a singular go live date in early January
