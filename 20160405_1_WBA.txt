Stefano Pessina
Thank you, Gerald. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2016 earning call. It is a pleasure to
be talking to you all today. Although, I must say that these quarterly earning calls always present me with a mighty
challenge. The work that we are doing within our businesses around the company is far-reaching and over time will
have a transformative impact. But quarter-to-quarter, it is not always easy to find new things to say or to demonstrate
the changes in our company other than by the meticulous taking of the [ph] daily (03:00) numbers and that is naturally
[ph] we'll show is (03:03) easier to do.
My goal on this call is to put the results in the context of a bigger picture. But that bigger picture, though it will look
very different over the year to come, does not show [ph] great shift and low shift (03:20) over time and frankly, we
should all be glad about that as stability is generally a good thing.
The changes we are making must be managed carefully and progressively if they are to have a long-term and
sustainable impact on the company. This quarter, we have continued to make good progress in driving costs out,
establishing even more efficient working practice and [ph] impacting (03:54) the company appropriately for the future.
We can see the impact of this in the company's results announced today, with adjusted net earning attributable to
Walgreens Boots Alliance per diluted share up 11% compared to the same quarter last year to $1.31.
All three division have, we believe, delivered a very creditable financial performance, but there is plenty more to do
and we are still at a relatively early stage in this process. Since last quarter results, we have made good progress in
developing the company with a more focused mindset and strategic direction, and I will talk about this later in our
presentation.
But for now, I will hand over to George to talk us through the financial performance.
George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Stefano. Good morning, everyone, and good afternoon to those listening in Europe. Overall, we view our
second quarter performance as quite good, particularly given the number of headwinds including the weak cough, cold,
flu season and currency translation.
So beginning, as usual, with the key financial highlights for the quarter. Net sales were $30.2 billion, up 13.6% versus
the same quarter a year ago. This increase was largely due to the consolidation of Alliance Boots for the entire second
quarter this year and to sales growth in our Retail Pharmacy USA division. Foreign currency translation adversely
affected sales by approximately $750 million or 2.4%. This was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
On an adjusted basis, operating income was $2.1 billion, up 15.2%. Our net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots
Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 14.4%. And diluted earnings per share were $1.31, up 11.0%.
These results are of course not directly comparable with the second quarter of fiscal 2015 due to the Alliance Boots
transaction in December 2014 and the resulting changes in our consolidated group and segmental reporting. We've now
lapped the closing of that transaction and will have fully comparable quarterly results beginning in the third quarter.

On a GAAP basis, operating income was $1.9 billion, up 35.1%. At the GAAP net earnings level, our performance
versus last year was impacted by a number of accounting factors, the most significant being last year's non-cash gain on
the re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and the change in fair
value adjustments on our AmerisourceBergen warrants. As a result, GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens
Boots Alliance were $930 million and diluted EPS were $0.85.
As this is a leap year, our second quarter results have benefited from one extra day versus last year. We have therefore
prepared all comparable sales and prescription figures to include only the first 28 days of February.
For completeness, here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal 2016. I will not go through those in great detail, but
you will note that adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.34 is up 18.2% versus the same period a year ago.
So turning now to our segmental performance, total Retail Pharmacy USA sales for the quarter were $21.5 billion, an
increase of 2.1% over the same quarter a year ago. Sales on a comparable store basis increased by 2.2%. The sales
growth was driven by increased market share, partially offset by the sale of a controlling interest in our infusion
business last April and a weak cough, cold, flu season which was particularly strong in the comparable period last year.
Adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points to 27.7% primarily due to procurement efficiencies. This resulted in
$6.0 billion of adjusted gross profit, up 2.8%. Adjusted SG&A was $4.3 billion, an increase of 30 basis points as we
continued to focus on store efficiencies and controlled corporate costs.
Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 2.1%, giving an adjusted operating margin of 7.6%. Excluding
Walgreens' share of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the year-ago quarter, adjusted operating income for the
division grew by 10% and adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points.
So turning now to look in more detail at pharmacy. Pharmacy sales were up 3.2% for the quarter. 233 million
prescriptions were filled on a 30-day basis including immunizations. That was an increase of 3.9%. On a comparable
store basis, pharmacy sales increased by 3.7% with comparable scripts filled up 2.8%. We view this as a good
performance, particularly given the weak cough, cold, flu season this year which we estimate had a 30 basis points
negative impact on comparable scripts.
The reported incidence of flu across the U.S.A. declined by 16% compared with the year-ago quarter according to IMS
Health. Overall, our retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis increased by 19.5%, up approximately
20 basis points over the year-ago quarter, again as reported by IMS Health.
Our increase in comparable store scripts was driven by our Medicare Part D growth strategy where we grew market
share. Consistent with our expectations, we experienced a decline in pharmacy gross margins, which were impacted by
ongoing reimbursement pressure and changes in mix, including an increased contribution from Medicare Part D.
As you know, the new Medicare Part D rates came into effect on the 1st of January this year. Our second quarter results
therefore included two months of the new rates. But looking ahead, our third and fourth quarters will reflect their full
impact. As we've said before, we continue to anticipate gross margin pressure in pharmacy, but remain confident in our
ability to grow the business over time.
Retail product sales were up 30 basis points compared with the second quarter of 2015, with sales on a comparable
basis down 30 basis points. Gross margin increased compared with the year-ago quarter.
Again, we are pleased with these results given the weak cough, cold, flu season. We estimate this headwind had an
impact of approximately 100 basis points on comparable sales this quarter.
We saw good performances over Christmas and New Year with strong sales in giftables and candy. Wellness, another
area of focus, also performed well driven by sales of vitamins and first aid products. We also made good progress in
driving sales of No7 during the quarter.
As I've mentioned before, we're on track to roll out our differentiated beauty offering to an additional 1,600 stores
beginning this summer. This will increase the total number of stores with this beauty offering to approximately 2,000

by the end of calendar 2016.
So let me now provide more detail on our Retail Pharmacy International division. Total Retail Pharmacy International
sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion with pro forma constant currency comparable store sales up 2.3%. Adjusted gross
profit was $1.5 billion with an adjusted gross profit margin of 41.1%. As you're aware, this quarter is not directly
comparable with the same quarter last year which did not include December 2014. December is a very significant sales
month but typically has a slightly lower gross margin, reflecting a higher proportion of gifting items.
Adjusted SG&A was $1.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $335 million. The adjusted operating margin of
9.1% was higher than the year ago period due to the seasonally strongest month of December being part of our second
quarter this year.
So looking more closely at this segment, comparable pharmacy sales on a pro forma constant currency basis were up
2.6% and comparable retail sales were up 2.1%. Comparable pharmacy sales in Boots UK increased by 3.0% as a result
of an increase in average item value and additional high value drugs dispensed in hospital pharmacies. Comparable
retail sales at the Boots UK were up 1.8% driven by good performance over the holiday period.
Growth in our boots.com Order & Collect service was strong with seasonal categories and our beauty product brands
such as No7 and Soap & Glory being key drivers. Liz Earle also performed very well in the quarter both in-store and
online. We're continuing the UK rollout of Liz Earle and Sleek which we acquired in November. Outside the UK, sales
growth continued to be particularly strong in the Republic of Ireland.
Turning now to our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Total sales for Pharmaceutical Wholesale were $5.6 billion.
On a pro forma constant currency basis excluding acquisitions and disposals, comparable sales increased by 1.6% over
the same quarter in 2015. This was in line with our estimated market growth weighted on the basis of our country
wholesale sales. Turkey, the UK and Norway performed well, while the French and Russian markets remained
challenging.
Adjusted operating income for the division was $155 million in the quarter and adjusted operating income margin was
2.8%. Going forward, the Pharmaceutical Wholesale division will include our share of net earnings attributable to our
equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.
I'll now just take a few moments to explain how we will account for this. As you know, following the exercise of our
first tranche of warrants on March 18, we owned 34.2 million shares or approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of
AmerisourceBergen. We will account for this investment using equity method accounting subject to a two-month
reporting lag. The lag synchronizes our reporting with the end of their quarterly fiscal periods. Due to the lag, in our
third quarter, we will only recognize our share of equity income for a couple of weeks. But of course, we will recognize
a full quarter of equity income in our fourth fiscal quarter based on AmerisourceBergen's quarter ending June 30. From
a funding perspective, we used approximately $1.2 billion from existing cash on hand to exercise the warrants.
Combined net synergies in the quarter from the Alliance Boots program were $329 million, taking the cumulative total
for this fiscal year to $617 million. We are well on track to deliver our goal of reaching at least $1 billion of combined
net synergies in fiscal 2016. We're also continuing to make good progress in delivering our $1.5 billion cost saving
program by the end of fiscal 2017 and are well on track to achieve this.
Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.4 billion, driven by a combination of operational performance and cash
conversion from the sale of seasonal inventory. Cash capital expenditure in the quarter was $317 million. As I have
said on previous calls, we continue to invest in key areas that develop our customer proposition including IT. This
resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.0 billion. As we have stated previously, we're very focused on cash flow
and are very disciplined in making capital allocation decisions and we remain committed to a solid investment grade
rating.
As you have seen from our press release, we have narrowed our fiscal 2016 guidance range to between $4.35 and $4.55
by raising the bottom end of the range by a further $0.05. This assumes AmerisourceBergen equity income on a
two-month lag, no material accretion from the agreement to acquire Rite Aid, the previously announced suspension of

the balance of our $3 billion share buyback program, the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program
relating to equity incentives, and no significant changes in current currency exchange rates.
Please remember that we have currency translational exposure. Not only does this impact our adjusted operating
income and EPS, but it can also cause quarterly volatility in the sales, gross margin and SG&A line items.
We estimate that a 1% move in pounds sterling and the euro versus the dollar impacts full year sales by approximately
$150 million and $125 million respectively. And on adjusted earnings level, a 1% move in pounds sterling impacts full
year adjusted EPS by approximately $0.01 per share, of the impact to the euro is somewhat less significant.
[indiscernible] (22:02) other currencies can also impact reported results, particularly on the sales line as they did this
quarter. Our guidance reflects current currency rates and so factors in a headwind of $0.06, since we provided our
initial fiscal year 2016 guidance back in October 2015.
Since Walgreens provided its fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings per share goal way back in August 2014, that was a $4.25 to
$4.60, we've encountered a currency headwind of around $0.19 per share.
And lastly, when considering the outlook for the balance of this fiscal year, please keep in mind that during the third
quarter of our last fiscal year, that we had a temporary pause in certain investments within our U.S. business as we
evaluated the returns being generated on certain projects.
By the time we entered the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we had finished this exercise and resumed a more
normalized SG&A spend. This led to SG&A last year being a little lower in Q3 and a little higher in Q4 than you
would expect on a more normalized basis.
So, with that, I will hand you back to Stefano.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George. So, as you have heard, overall, our company is performing pretty much in line with our
expectation. In many respects, we are now past many of the exceptional items that have impacted us during the last few
quarters as we began the work of bringing our management information system together. And [indiscernible] (24:09)
work as with most of our projects is now complete after such a short time as a unified company, we are making good
progress. As our business begins to normalize and embrace a new approach to reporting and control both at the fiscal
and operational level, we are beginning to see far more clearly the impact and implications of the levers we have to
influence our operations in the areas where we have the greatest opportunity and the areas where we have the most
work to do.
I have to face that this is very much what we expected. It is an important and necessary exercise to help ensure our
priorities are correct and our assumptions are not flawed. I believe that one of our greatest strengths as a management
team is that where we can we, we base our decision on provable factor and where we can't, we always and I mean
always question our own assumptions.
Then we go back and check whether we were right or not, so that we can learn and do better next time. In our U.S.
division, you can see some examples of how a slightly new focus on the way we work is impacting the company
already in a very real way, behind the impact that our cost saving and synergy programs are bringing. In the more
innovative approach is we are taking in terms of partnership and strategic relationship such as that we have entered into
Valeant Pharmaceutical. Why Valeant is as a company, is clearly still working its way through some challenges.
The collaboration we have with them, though still in its early stages, is showing some very promising result in terms of
improved access and affordability of their product. Since the close of the quarter, we have announced the partnership
with OptumRx to create a new 90-day at Retail Pharmacy collaboration, giving eligible OptumRx member choice of
how to receive their medication and providing them with 24/7 pharmacy availability. Although I cannot disclose the
terms of this contract, it is fair to say that it has been structured so that there is a share and neutral benefit to us working
together to increase the utilization and volume in a more collaborative manner that I understand to have been the case

in the past.
Of course, our agreement to acquire Rite Aid is continuing as we expect with the regulatory approval process
progressing in line with the timetable we had expected. All these actions not only contribute to the development of the
company but also provide us with opportunities and the flexibility to continue the process of reviewing and
rejuvenating our existing operation both in retail and pharmacy, further differentiating us in the marketplace.
These actions also validate that in seeking to lead improved efficiency in the healthcare value chain, we not only target
highly selected M&A activities but also new partnership and relationship driven on equity alignment like
AmerisourceBergen, innovative commercial relationship such as the Valeant supply contractor as well as improvement
in long-standing arrangements with our critical business partners.
As we have always said, this is much longer term, but it's essential to the sustainable future of our company. We have
to find new innovative and valuable offering to continue to bring people to our store. In pharmacy, the contracts can
help us to do this to an extent, but we need to announce our patient offering and ensure we maximize the value of that
interaction, both to the patient and to ourselves as a company; to [ph] announce (28:36) services and a richer
relationship between the patient, the pharmacy team and our company overall.
In the front of our stores, we need to focus our offering: be clear what we stand for and define our two areas of
expertise and differentiation, and we need to offer this to whatever medium of interface the customer wants. We've
done well in controlling cost and improving efficiency, but we understand that this has a limited lifespan if the slowing
of the sales growth cannot be altered and reversed. Alex and his team know this and are very focused on their strategies
to address the recent trend.
If this all sound very U.S.-focused, it is perhaps not surprising, as today the U.S. is the market where we have the most
immediate opportunities. This does not mean we are neglecting our other markets. Far from it. In the UK, the team is
working hard on strategies to keep Boots stores and our brand portfolio not just ahead of the market, but the most
relevant to its customers while working on plan to manage and mitigate the next round of what is ever-present
government pressure on pharmacy pricing.
And across our businesses, owned and in partnership through our equity investment, the work continues constantly
daily to a newer structure [ph] theme (30:16), to be the best they can be and to always be ready to address the
challenges and more importantly to face the opportunities where we see them. As ever, we must do this with extreme
vigilance and vigor so that we achieve it without disrupting the extraordinary level of service our customers have come
to and they have a right to expect from us and without failing to deliver for you as the owners of our company.
Now let's open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. You may begin.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and great performance in the
quarter. I just had a question on the U.S. Retail Pharmacy operating margin. On an adjusted basis, it looks to be flat
relative to last year, so I'm wondering to what extent did the soft flu season hurt your margin this quarter. And as a
follow-up to that, based on what you're seeing out there, what is your level of confidence that the operating margin in
the U.S. Retail business will continue to improve both this year and longer term?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. Morning, Alvin. It's Alex here. Yeah, the cough, cold season, I mean, the mix
particularly in the front of store does have an impact. You probably noticed that we actually managed to increase the
margin in the front of the store despite that impact. On the other side, which is still the bigger impact on the operating
margin in the U.S., is pharmacy reimbursement, and we continue to see the pressure as we've spoken about in the past

and today and also going forward.
As George mentioned on the call, the Med D season has been good from a volume point of view on plan and we've had
the expected impact on margin and reimbursement pressure as a result. So I would say that there is really no change
overall in the margin. We continue to work hard to improve the front of store margin with some successes. And we
continue to see constant reimbursement pressure, which we're dealing with as we are planning to do going forward.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Thank you. And on the guidance, it does appear to include the ABC equity income
now. I'm just curious what you're building in for the EPS contribution from that.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Yes, I mean, it does include ABC. We've obviously – this is no change to where
we've always internally looked at this because obviously the economics of the warrants were such that it was the right
thing to do to exercise the warrants, the first set of warrants, at the earliest opportunity, which is what we've done.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Got it. And last one from me, I'm just curious about the beauty rollout. I know New
York and Phoenix are some of the most mature markets. I'm curious if you could give us a little bit more color on what
you've seen there. Have you seen an uplift I'm sure to the beauty section, but I'm curious if you've seen one to the
overall front end?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Alvin. It's Alex again. Yeah. We're really pleased with the performance both –
particularly in Phoenix, which is more normal for the Walgreens estate. And we've taken the best model we saw in
Phoenix and we're now rolling that out, as George said, to 1,600 more stores this autumn and we're very confident
about the return we'll get from that.
It's certainly impacting the beauty basket in a positive way, and in particular No7 continues to be the brand, and skin in
particular, which is driving more frequency and driving a bigger basket. So we're feeling good about this. The
execution plan's on track and the team are really excited about this.
And the final thing I'll say, it's not just about the products; it's also importantly about the customer care model and a
slight and important enhancement to the overall look and feel in our standard drugstores. So it's not just about the
products; it's about the overall experience the customer will start to get in beauty. And it lays a really good foundation
for the future where [ph] we offer (34:36) potentially more opportunities with more brands and more opportunity over
time to satisfy more customers in the front end in beauty.
<Q - Alvin Caezar Concepcion>: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - Robert Willoughby>: Just a quick one. Do you have any opportunities to expand the generic purchasing power
of your consortium? I guess what we're asking is, do you have any role whatsoever in the Amerisource discussions with
Express Scripts about renewing their distribution agreement this year?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Of course, Amerisource, it's a separate company and they have to manage their contract
independently on us. For the generics, the situation, it's quite complex because it's not obvious that if you buy more,
you buy better. It depends on what you buy, on where are you buy. It's an analysis which has to be done very carefully.
And we have also to think that if you want to really be a preferred customer, we have also to abide by a certain rule.
One of those rules being the fact that you must have the right quantity of products because if you need more product
than a manufacturer can manufacture, you have to go and have many manufacturer at a certain time. And at that point,
your bargaining power, of course, is less because instead of them needing us, we need them.
So the situation is complicated. Of course, we analyze any opportunity on the market. We are open to discuss
everything which can improve our efficiency, but we don't have to believe that every contact or every addition at the

Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Percher with Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you. Alex, you mentioned in Part D, you're seeing the type of volumes you expected, but
obviously rate pressure. Could you speak to your overall strategy on rate versus volume and what you've seen in
commercial plans? I know there's some major contract renewals this year. What you've seen in January and February in
terms of volume delivered and how this fits in with the broader Optum strategy?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Thanks, Eric. Yeah. I think starting the talk, we've been pretty clear that we want to try
more volume into our pharmacies and we've been encouraged by what we've seen in [ph] their D (37:55). And again,
this season has gone well and therefore, you should expect us to continue to drive that strategy in Optum. [ph] Smart90
(38:03) is an example of that where we have an opportunity to work with the team at Optum and to really take care of
customers 24/7 and provide more services, whether they want to get a mail order or whether they want to pick it up in
their local pharmacy. And we're pleased with that partnership and, of course, that starts in January 2017.
In terms of our overall strategy to drive more volume into our pharmacies, we know that we have to continue to build
good relationships and strong relationships with every single peer, including PBMs and health systems and insurance
companies, and that's what we intend to do. That's been a real focus on of Brad and Richard and their teams, and we're
happy with the progress we're making.
The last thing I would say is that, as we always say, and we said this from the start, is that we know that reimbursement
pressure will continue. So, therefore, we think this is going to be an effective strategy and we believe this will be true to
model as it has been for us in the last 12 months. And, of course, finally we don't make any comment about the major
contracts. As you know, that's not something we talk about in the open until we have completed them.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Fair enough. And maybe the follow-up is have you seen uptake as a result of programs, clinical
programs you're putting into place? Have you seen any willingness to adopt narrow networks in a more aggressive
stance? I'm thinking back to the Caterpillar-type strategy that we saw several years ago.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah. I think we are seeing narrowing of networks. I think that's been a feature of the
market certainly for the last couple of years. But more importantly, we're seeing people pushing for more of the health
outcomes particularly in the Med D space where there's more payment available now for delivering against the [ph]
stars (39:58) and generic utilization. So I think these features of the market are continuing and we continue to recognize
them and do what we can to make sure that we're part of that – these networks and delivering good care and good
quality to our customers.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning and congrats on a very good quarter. Stefano, in your prepared
comments, you talked about really how you are challenging the norm and looking for new ways to partner with the
different players in the continuum. So when we think about the Optum relationship, can you maybe share with us any
thoughts about drug opportunity to extend that beyond to Optum and also to include the United population? Or are you
having these conversations or is this something that would depend on the success of the relationship with Optum?

<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, this is a first step. Of course, as you have said, we are very keen to create new
partnerships and to have a good relationship with as many companies and many people as possible. And I don't exclude
that we could do similar things with other partners. Whether this is the first step for further integration, well, it seems to
me that we go too far if we say this.
It's obvious that any kind of additional relationship, any collaboration, it's helping to understand better each other and
to find other ways to collaborate. But this agreement is what it is. It's a commercial agreement which make a lot of
sense which can create value for both parties. It could be followed by other agreement. Of course, we are open, but we
could also have similar or different agreements with other partners.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Ricky, it's Alex. I just had one thing. Our biggest Med D partnership remains with
United. They're a very important player in that space and we've been with them for some time and Walgreens is going
to continue to work closely with them.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. So I guess the question was varied. It seems that there's opportunities to ones who tie
in the health plan data to take a more holistic view of a patient and really empower the pharmacies, which I think are
things that you've been talking about in the past. So, for us, when we step back and we think about the longer term, this
is part of the bigger vision for an Optum-United tie?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I wouldn't give too much weight to this agreement, but I can also say that this agreement for
sure is not an impediment for better relationship in future.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then I noted, obviously, you can't say a lot about Rite Aid, but obviously, the
divestitures are top of mind for investors. We get a lot of questions about it. So, I guess, has anything changed in the
competitive landscape since you announced the deal that could impact the potential divestitures?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: No, nothing has changed except the fact that we are collaborating. As the time is passing,
probably the solution will be closer because at the end of the day, we knew from the very beginning that this would
have been a very long process that we would have been asked for many, many documents and information. We are
going to the process; the process is developing in absolute normal way. And so, we hope that sooner or later, we will
have an indication on where we are.
But, of course, we cannot put a day or even a month for this indication because it depends very much on how deeply
the FTC wants to analyze all of the documents that we have given. But it's nothing atypical, exactly on line with what
we were expecting.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Great. And last question for George. I know I think you said that no comment on
Express, but in terms of maybe timing clarification given your fiscal year. Should we think about just an Express
contract – is it relevant to fiscal year 2016 or is it more fiscal year 2017 type of an impact?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We obviously don't comment on individual terms of contracts with any of our
payers as just Alex had said earlier, so really I'm afraid I can't really answer that question.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is with Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great. Thanks for the questions. I mean, sorry if I missed this, but could you share what
the generic headwind and price inflation impact were on the U.S. pharmacy same-store sales? It seems to us like price
inflation meaningfully decelerated. So I guess, first, is that correct? And then if that is correct, did the weakness come
more from the branded or the generic side?

<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, hi. Hi, Robert. It's Alex here. Yeah, there was a shift there towards more of a
deflationary impact particularly in generics which is the – obviously the bulk of our volume, not our value. So, again,
that is true. But again, obviously, it's a trend that's been happening. We were more or less flat last quarter and this
quarter, we're going slightly deflationary.
I think the other thing that's worth remembering really in terms of sales is importance of the specialty business within
that as well and again, we're driving that pretty well overall. But again that was an impact in terms of sales
year-on-year, again, in terms of some less inflation in specialty, which is quite a big value number overall.
So I think that was the two key things. We're very pleased with volume and the volume was, I think as George said,
was up 3.9%. We gained some market share according to IMS and that's pretty much on the trend that's been going out
for some time now. We continue to drive that quite hard. So that's who we are. So, yeah, a slight deflation in generics; a
slight slowdown in specialty. I'm pleased with volume.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Got it. And then I guess, George, just wanted to ask a question on the proposed treasury
rules from last night. I know it just came out, but is there anything specific around the proposal specifically around
intercompany lending that would affect your tax strategy? Just curious if that or either of the proposals, as you see them
at kind of first glance, would limit your ability to generate a more efficient tax rate.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We continue to obviously closely watch all those developments. At this stage, it's
too early to comment. We continue to look to ways to optimize our arrangements in terms of funding. But at this point,
really, I'm not envisaging any change from what you're seeing in our account numbers but we will keep you posted.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Fair enough. Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Thanks very much. I just wanted to go back to a couple of comments. First, Stefano, you
talked about pace in offerings then announcing services related to your pharmacists, can you give us any indication as
to some of the things you're thinking about there? And does that tie into specialty? We're starting to hear more in the
market that we're seeing more and more specialty drugs actually come through the Retail Pharmacy. Is that a trend that
you're seeing and is it more that you'll have pharmacists helping to manage some of those trends? If you could just give
us an indication as to what your thoughts are there.
And then as it relates to Optum, I know you don't want to give specifics, but is there any way that you can maybe give
us parameters, you or George, around how to think about how many incremental prescriptions we could see come with
this relationship based on other narrow network-type relationships that you've had with United?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: No, I don't believe that we can give numbers. We cannot give indication about the contract.
And about the specialty, what do you want to know exactly?
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: So are you seeing more specialty drugs coming through your Retail Pharmacy than in the
past where perhaps in the past, it's gone through specialty pharmacy rather than coming through the retail network? So
are you starting to see programs, for example, where your pharmacist was interacting on behalf and doing more
services around specialty? And just any thoughts that you have around specialty contracting and the impact to your
business right now.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: I believe that this should be an important development in our company in the future. We have
started. We are focusing our attention on specialties. Specialties are important and it will continue to be important even
though the margin will probably shrink. And so, they will be important because they will be a big part of the market,
but they will not be probably in future so profitable as they are today.

All the same, of course, we have to play our part, and so we are focused on that. But it's true that we could offer further
specialty service to the customers that – at pharmacies that not many other people could offer.
Maybe, Alex?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah. Yeah, Lisa. It's Alex here. Again, I think it's a really insightful question. For
sure, there's more interest from manufacturers in mixed model of central specialty on distribution through Retail
Pharmacy, and that's because the patients and customers do like having care closer to where they live when they're on
certain medications, so the carers do as well.
We've seen that trend, I would say, growing for a while. There has been more interest – more contacts with us,
particularly since we started speaking about a new model and the relationship with Valeant. So at this stage, we're
really working that through in terms of what does that mean for what we do today. So we've got some great assets in
communities beyond the almost 1,000 centers of excellence that we have within our normal drugstores. We have
community pharmacies well over 100 now close to where some of these specialist doctors look after patients. And we
have, again, our plans for well over a couple hundred in hospital pharmacies as well, again, dealing with outpatient
specialty. So we think we've got a fantastic network to be honest to deal with this trend as it comes through. But we're
still working out. So the interest is high. We're building out our assets and we're working out what other partnerships
we need with both manufacturers and others to try and take advantage of this trend.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: And then just my last question would be your comment, Stefano, around the relationship
with Optum and the fact that it doesn't preclude you from working with others. You could see some closer relationships
in the marketplace. Back to the comments around the Express Scripts contract being up, I know a few years ago there
was a Smart90 contract that was signed. I'm just curious, do you see incremental opportunities to work with Express
specifically? Are there ways to enhance what you've learned from that Smart90 relationship and perhaps to increase the
offering and have a tighter relationship between Walgreens and Express Scripts?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We have been very clear that we consider partnership as one of our – the most important value
that we have, and we want to put this in practice. So we will try to create a partnership with as many players as
possible. And of course, I see the opportunity to have a great relationship with Express Scripts. I don't see any
impediment. After, you have to do what is possible. If there are certain relationship which could be good on the paper
but be difficult to achieve because after you have to interact with other players, so the manufacturers, the insurance
company, maybe certain partnership cannot be achieved, practically achieved. But everything that can be achieved and
everything that can be in the interest of the two parties has to be explored and if possible, has to be done. So, for sure, I
see the possibility of having a very, very, very good relationship with Express Scripts.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. And this one's either for George
or maybe Alex. I guess as we think about the moving pieces that drove the improvement in Retail Pharmacy gross
margins in the quarter, I'm just trying to get a sense for understanding the severity between the generic drug price
deflation and the changes in reimbursement rates that impacted at the start of the year. And I guess were they – was it a
big positive from the changes in drug pricing, any big negative from reimbursement? Or should we think of a small
positive from the changes in drug pricing and a small negative from reimbursement changes? I just want to understand
the severity of the mix.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, and again, the first thing I would say is – it's Alex here, it's the Scottish alley cat
accent. It's Alex here. The impacts happen different in each quarter, to be honest, so I wouldn't look at any quarter in
isolation. As George I think has said, we've only had two of the three months this quarter actually had the Med D
impact. So I think it's difficult to look at one quarter in isolation.

Page 12 of 16
What I would also say is that we are constantly working hard at procurement, not just because of deflation, as Stefano
said, because of the good capability we have out in Europe. And therefore, we are working hard to deliver more
synergies. The cost base also that we're working on is balancing that out.
But all of that is balanced out by the ongoing reimbursement pressure beyond simply the Med D contracts. There are
commercial reimbursement pressures. And when they impact us, we'll let you know, but they are definitely there. And
also, we are working them hard as well.
So I would say on balance, the operating margin in this quarter was slightly more positive because of the impacts of
when certain things hit. The overall trend is really the same trend as we've seen and we've been seeing for some time,
and we're just managing that trend.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird. You may begin.
<Q - Eric W. Coldwell>: Thanks. I have just a couple here. First, going back to Optum quickly, without going into
contract-specific details, could you explain in more detail how the economics of a deal like this might work in terms of
revenue and profit to Walgreens? And will you be booking full scripts revenue on the 90-day fills, just the service fees,
some combination of both? And realizing this won't be overly meaningful to revenue for some time, would a deal like
this generally be seen as margin accretive, or margin dilutive to the Retail Pharmacy segment?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. A lot of detailed questions there, Eric. I'm sorry, I can't answer them; it's part of the
contract. What I can say is our objective is to get more prescriptions into our pharmacies. That lowers our overall
operating margin by making better use of our fixed assets. That's a really important component in this particular
program. It also allows us to take better care of Optum members within the pharmacy, particularly making sure they're
taking their medication properly and making sure that if they're in chronic conditions that they get directed back into
the right part of the health system a bit more fast as well, saving costs elsewhere. That's the real aim of this program.
We are comfortable with the deal that we have struck. It's a fair deal both ways. And we had a great conversation on the
way through with the team from Optum, and we are in good shape. Obviously, there are certain assumptions that's gone
in from both sides, and we'll wait and see what happens over the length of the contract. Remember, this doesn't really
start until January 17. So it will be some time before any impact of this new contract is seen in our P&L.
<Q - Eric W. Coldwell>: Yeah. Okay. That's fair. If I could just do a quick follow-up on Bob Jones' question, I'm not
sure if I caught it but did you specifically quantify the year-over-year revenue impact from generics shifting from
inflationary to deflationary?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, we didn't and we can't.
<Q - Eric W. Coldwell>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. You may begin.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the U.S.A.
retail gross margin. It looks like the first year-over-year expansion in a couple of quarters, so congrats there. With your
Part D rate and those Part D contracts, do they all now have price protection built into them so if generic inflation
comes back, you have protection on the reimbursement side?

<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Again, Dave, I can't be specific, but what we can say is we've been working hard to put
that in, so the majority do have some price protection, yeah.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. And then in terms of the gross margin expansion that we did see, was it due to generic
deflation like George was asking earlier for the most part?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: It was a combination. That was part of it. I think also as we said before, we've still got
another month of the real impact of Med D to come. We're not fully protected on deflation. We are mainly protected,
not fully protected. And finally, we are making good progress on the front end. You saw that the front end margin
improved in the quarter as well despite a slight change in mix.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. And then just one last one. It looks like for the wholesale piece of the business there
was a sequential decline in operating income and revenue was slightly below our model. What drove that? And can you
remind me what impact FX had on the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: [indiscernible] (1:00:40) to take into account the fact that most of it, it's – most all of it is in
UK, in Europe, in other countries whether the currencies have played a big role in – and the mix of the different
currencies. So it's difficult to really to judge what is happening. And after you have also to appreciate that in the last
year we have divested some small businesses which are irrelevant of course. But of course, we presented some phase
because we have tried to streamline and we are still trying to streamline our selling business – our business more
generally, not just our selling business, eliminating all those businesses which are not profitable or which are requiring
a big attention, a big absorption of energies.
Now we have a big program. We have a big opportunity set to create value and it's time to – and we started this last
year to, let's say close, extract, sell, all those small businesses which are not adding much but can reduce the overall
efficiency of the company of the group. I could say that independently on the number, if you look at, as we do of
course, the country specifically, overall most of the countries are doing quite well, even well surprisingly country like
Turkey and Egypt are doing very well. Romania and the other countries are suffering, particularly France I would say
and particularly Russia and also Germany is not particularly brilliant.
So it's a mix and the combination of these portfolio with the combination of the different currency because we don't
adjust the pound sterling and the euro but we have the Turkish lira, we have the ruble, we have many other currencies.
The combination of these two things can give strange FX. But overall, you see that the results are not bad. The margin
is still there which is important of course in an offering business.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. You may begin.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So I have a strategic question and then one's more tactical. When you look at the partnership
with Optum and maybe other PBM partnerships, how does that – how do you think that fits in with potential ownership
of Envision? Is Envision too small to matter? Or do you think – are you committed, assuming Rite Aid goes through,
committed to owning Envision? Or maybe you'd divest that. How would that work with the partnerships?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: First of all, we will decide to do with Envision once we will have completed the deal. With
Rite Aid, we cannot anticipate what we will do on something that is not year-to-date. Secondly, even if we decided to
develop it, I don't see any difficulty because of course, we are – we would not be a major competitor on the market, and
so we could find a niche where we could collaborate. And we could have a big collaboration as a pharmacy chain, and
maybe some niche or more limited collaboration on the PBM business. So we – it's not – we cannot be considered a
true competitor, a competitor had a point that we could not collaborate in the most important element of the business
which is to [indiscernible] (1:05:23) the PBM and to give to us a very good service to the customers.

Page 14 of 16
<Q - John Heinbockel>: And then more tactically, I mean a lot of the improvement in gross this quarter in the U.S.
look to be front end. Maybe for Alex, if you think about, and I know you're probably more focused on driving top line
than margin per se, but if you think about where the Walgreen front end margin is today, maybe benchmarking that
against Boots or others, do you think there's a significant amount of front end margin opportunity left from mix and
maybe promotional cadence? Or not so much from where we are right now?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. Yeah. I still think there's a lot to go. It'll just take us a number of years to get there.
So the focus has been on operating margins so we're really focusing on removing unprofitable activity, unprofitable
items and try to simplify the offer and focus in on the key destination categories for us which really is primarily health,
beauty and convenience. And we feel good about where we are. But there's a long opportunity ahead of us, and that
opportunity is to get customers to reevaluate the offer inside of Walgreens and to see us more unique and more
differentiated. And we start on that journey really with a beauty differentiation project.
We spoke about earlier in the call later on this is summer and autumn. So I think the opportunity is still a lot to come,
particularly on the expansion of differentiation and higher margin products. It will just take us longer to get that done as
customers one by one reevaluate what they're seeing inside of Walgreens.
I think finally I would say is that we've had a one-size-fits-all approach to the Walgreens front end for quite some time.
And as we evolve think on omni-channel and formats, again, we believe there will be more opportunity there in the
outer years. But the first thing I think is to get people to reevaluate their current Walgreens, which [ph] we're on with
(1:07:29) right now, and then we'll figure out how do we use this space differently over the medium- to long-term.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. You may begin
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. From a pharmacy margin environment, you talked a couple quarters ago about
some of the challenges and ongoing challenges. I'm just curious, as you reposition the company to some degree with
some of these relationships if you feel more – on more stable footing about the future of pharmacy margins in the U.S.?
Or if you have a different view of how that is going to play out?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: No, I think that – again, it's Alex here. I think we've said this already, but it's an
important point. We see the volume mix very important for both our partners and payers, customers and also for
ourselves. So we will work within the market which means that we believe with the ongoing reimbursement pressure,
and then we'll work hard within that to drive our volume through – offering better volume, better care to customers.
That's really the strategy. I know it sounds very simplistic, but that's what we're trying to do.
If we do these things, we think we can stabilize the operating margin over time and we can grow the business. That is
what we are doing right now and we believe that's the future going forward. So that's how we see it. But we accept and
I said this, I think Stefano said this, and I've experienced it in Europe, reimbursement pressure is a constant factor, and
we believe it will be a constant factor here in America going forward and our strategy is as I've described it.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Within that, it sounds like the strategy is therefore more volume in order to leverage the
expenses and net out to a stable or beneficial operating margin. Rite Aid is actually...
<A - Stefano Pessina>: [indiscernible] (1:09:26)
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Rite Aid is a piece of that. Optum is a piece of that. Is – am I correct in the perception that, that
is the strategy has more volume and therefore are there more alliances that you will evaluate or pursue to drive more
volume through the business?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: It's part of the strategy. You see, when you have to accept that the margin, the gross margin
[indiscernible] (1:09:51) decline, will decline over time. You have to find ways to compensate for it. So additional

services like Valeant can help better, a better organization of the work, not just synergies but a different structure of the
work, a rethinking of the organization of the flow of the medicine, of the flow of the work, the use of the pharmacies
can help. Other – an increase, better relationship with your suppliers can help of course because it contributes to the
margin, a better relationship with the clients, with the PBM, with all the people who are at the end of the day, the
source for the scripts.
And clever way of collaborating with them can help because can increase the number of [ph] treatment (1:11:10). Of
course, the volume is very, very important because if you can compensate at least partially the volume, by the volume,
the reduction in margin of course, this can help substantially. So there are many, many different action that you can
take and we are taking. And this action can stabilize the results, the final result as Alex was saying for years and years
to come. And in 10 years time or whatever, we will have probably another organization of the business and we will see
what will happen at that time. But for the next year, we see enough ways to compensate the margin reduction. We
accept that the margin reduction will be there and we are trying to find and we are finding different ways to compensate
for it.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. You may begin.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just actually just one other random question, I guess
maybe, I think there's a bill coming up in the UK regarding I think the European Union, I guess they refer to it as the
Brexit. If that referendum were to actually happen, how would that affect the Boots business here and I guess
Walgreens in general? Thanks.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: To be honest, I don't believe that it will be impacted directly because at the end of the retail
business is, let's say a local business and the brand business, well, even now, we don't manufacture just in UK. So, at
the end, we will find a way to continue to manufacture at the lowest possible cost. So the brand will not be impacted.
The retail business is local so it will not be impacted. It could be impacted by a change of the overall economy. If we
had a recession or if we had difficult consequences from the Brexit, these could impact more generally our business as
all the other businesses. And the same is true for you but because our business is in Europe, again, our local business is
our retail and not selling businesses, our local business will depend more on the consumption of the medicines, of the
products than on the political and economical situation. So they could be just impacted by a general trend, but they're
not specifically.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay. So I mean [indiscernible] (1:14:22)
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We don't take – we have [ph] totaled it (1:14:23) and we don't need – we have decided that we
don't need an emergency plan for it. Why? When there are big changes. We try to think at least potentially of an
emergency plan. But in this case, we don't see the need for it.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Gerald Gradwell for closing remarks.

more entertained with his comments until then. If you need – if you have any other queries or need to speak to us, the
