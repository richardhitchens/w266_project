Darren Richard Huston
Okay. Thank you very much and welcome to The Priceline Group's first quarter conference call. Thank you for joining
us before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with The Priceline Group's CFO, Dan
Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the fourth quarter of approximately $13.8 billion, up 12%
year-over-year or about 26% on a local currency basis. Room nights exceeded 100 million for the first time during a
quarter, while growth accelerated slightly to 25%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $8.12, up 4% versus prior year
surpassing FactSet consensus estimate of $7.72 per share, and our guidance for the quarter. Our U.S. dollar
denominated growth rates were substantially impacted by the stronger dollar.
Our international business recorded 29% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, up from 27% last quarter.
Gross bookings benefited from growth in hotel supply at Booking.com which now has over 640,000 hotels and other
accommodations in over 200 countries and territories, up 40% over last year.
We are continuing to ramp new property acquisition including individually-owned vacation rentals, with new
on-boarding tools that allow owners to list their property quickly and easily on our websites. Vacation rentals nearly
doubled year-over-year to 275,000 instantly bookable and confirmable properties including villas, chalets, apartments,
aparthotels and other self-catered products.
Two important innovations were also launched at Booking.com in the first quarter. Booking Now our mobile phone
app for spontaneous bookers, and BookingSuite, our partner facing software services platform. Both launches were
executed well and early results are encouraging. Each of these growth extensions represent innovation beachheads that
will be further expanded upon in the coming weeks, months and quarters.
International results also benefited agoda.com and rentalcars.com, both of which accelerated in the quarter. KAYAK
and OpenTable continue to pursue the international opportunity, and while much work has been done and both
businesses are growing, there is still a lot of potential ahead of us. KAYAK is focused on product innovation and brand
building and has made some solid biasness progress particularly in Europe. OpenTable has now more or less completed
its technical replatforming to a more modern cloud-based architecture.
We are now executing plans to optimize the product and roll it out globally. Against these plans we will take a
determined but test-and-learn approach over the coming quarters as we have with all our businesses. Demand for
OpenTable solutions from both restaurants and customers remains very strong.
Priceline.com's domestic growth continued to be hampered by the shrinking opaque business. Priceline.com's retail
business remains healthy, including acceleration in retail hotels, and a new management team there is poised to
rejuvenate and maximize the potential of The Priceline.com brand. We also acquired Rocketmiles in the first quarter,
an innovative hotel booking platform for frequent fliers based in Chicago. Rocketmiles is being managed independently
as part of our Priceline Ventures portfolio.
Mobile's uninterrupted growth in share of our business continues. From Booking.com's Booking Now app for
spontaneous or last-minute bookers to priceline.com's iWatch app to our pay with OpenTable mobile payments app to
KAYAK's mobile itinerary management tools, innovation and execution on mobile is in our DNA and critical to the
group's continued success.
Across the group, our customers completed over 100 million reservations from their smartphones in the last 12 months,
and that number continues to grow very rapidly. We believe the group's business performed well in the first quarter,
and we're pleased with the progress of our brands in growing and improving their platforms.
Our fundamental growth momentum as measured by units and in constant currency remained strong. We again
delivered strong organic performance on both the top and bottom line, providing substantial earnings to reinvest in
profitable growth and share buybacks while maintaining attractive operating margins.

We repurchased $309 million of our common stock during the quarter and have a remaining authorization of $2.8
billion remaining for future quarters. I believe as strongly as ever that our formula of out-innovating the competition,
smart and sustainable organic growth and earning versus buying our customers' loyalty through best-in-class consumer
experiences, end-to-end and across devices, is the winning long-term formula. I commend my colleagues around the
world for their focus and execution.
I will now turn over to Dan for a more detailed summary of our financials.
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide
guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As we highlighted when we gave guidance for Q1 in February, our U.S. dollar
reported results are impacted more dramatically by extreme currency volatility in most companies because about 90%
of our full year 2014 gross bookings and operating income were generated by our international brands.
Our two most impactful currencies, the euro and the British pound grew weaker by about 18% and 9% respectively for
Q1 as compared to the prior year. The euro was also about 2% weaker compared to the rate assumed in our Q1
guidance.
The strong U.S. dollar means our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP
net income mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they would have at least year's exchange rates
for Q1, Q2 and the remainder of the year.
Since our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, they will also translate
into fewer dollars. Therefore, our operating margins are not significantly impacted by currency fluctuations and we
believe that the impact of currency on our bottom line is generally similar to the top-line impact.
However, due to our normal business seasonality, the bottom line currency impact is somewhat less pronounced in Q1
than the top-line impact. Although the stronger dollar has a significant negative impact on our growth expressed in
dollars. The fundamental performance of our business is still evident in our unit growth rates, and our growth rates
expressed in constant currency for gross bookings, international gross bookings, and gross profit.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Priceline Group. Accelerating unit growth paired with less margin pressure than forecasted
resulted in over performance compared to consensus at both the top and bottom line. Room night growth was strong
relative to Q4 across all our key regions. Room nights booked grew by 25% in the first quarter accelerating slightly
compared to the 24% growth rate for Q4. Rental car days grew by 18% in Q1 also accelerating compared to Q4 growth
of 16%. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs for Q1 2015 were up on a constant currency basis by about
2% for the consolidated group.
Q1 gross bookings grew by about 26% on a constant currency basis and by about 12% in U.S. dollars compared to
prior year. International gross bookings grew by about 29% on a constant currency basis and by about 14% in U.S.
dollars. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the
results are a mix of solid growth in retail room nights and rental car days offset by declines in Name Your Own Price
services which continue to be challenged by a lack of discounted rates.
Gross profit for the quarter was $1.7 billion and grew by about 32% on a constant currency basis and by 19% in U.S.
dollars compared to prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $1.4 billion which grew by about
30% on a constant currency basis and by 15% in U.S. dollars compared to prior year.
Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable's U.S. business, amounted to $277 million which represented
38% growth versus prior year. OpenTable generated worldwide revenue in Q1 of about $61 million.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 31.1% of non-GAAP gross profit for Q1, which is 448 bps lower than last
year. As I said when we gave guidance for the quarter, we are investing in OpEx to add people, offices and IT capacity
to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth.

Q1 also reflects deleverage from the inclusion of OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing
services.
Online advertising also had deleverage due to lower ROIs and gross bookings acceleration that benefits revenue in Q2
and Q3 when Easter and summer travel takes place.
Investments in OpEx and advertising typically have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q1 when we earn a
lower percentage of our annual gross profit due to the normal seasonality of our business.
Operating margins did come in better than our guidance, however, due mainly to lower than forecasted non-advertising
OpEx.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $532 million, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $510
million and represents 4% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 3% including interest expense
from our recent bond offerings, and non-GAAP EPS grew by 4%.
In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $209 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2015
which is about 18% above last year. We invested $31 million in CapEx and repurchased 251,000 shares of our common
stock for $309 million in Q1. We expect to execute the remainder of our $3 billion common stock buyback program
going forward to return capital to shareholders at a pace that makes sense relative to available cash in the U.S. and
potential other uses for such capital.
We completed two successful financing transactions in Q1 at attractive interest rates. We raised €1 billion for our U.S.
parent company by offering a 12-year bond in Europe at a 1.8% interest rate. We also raised $500 million by issuing a
10-year bond in the U.S. investment grade market with a 3.65% interest rate. Our cash and investments amounted to
$9.6 billion at March 31, 2015 with about $2.5 billion of that balance in the U.S.
Now for Q2 guidance, the travel market continues to be fundamentally healthy from an occupancy and ADR
perspective broadly and in Europe. We are pleased with the resilient unit growth that our business has delivered
historically and is inherent in our Q2 forecast. Our guidance assumes that our growth rates will decelerate for the
quarter due to the size of our business.
Our Q2 forecast assumes foreign exchange rates of $1.12 per euro and $1.51 per British pound for the remainder of the
quarter which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about 19% for the euro and about 11%
for the British pound as compared to the prior year. As a result, our gross bookings, gross profit, operating expenses,
adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income will mathematically translate into significantly fewer dollars than they
would have at last year's exchange rates for Q2, and the remainder of the year. Barring further deterioration in
exchange rates, we believe that Q2 represents our toughest year-over-year currency comp for 2015.
For Q2 guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 15% to 22% on a constant currency basis, and by
0% to 7% in U.S. dollars, with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0% to 5%. We expect international gross
bookings to grow by 17% to 24% on a constant currency basis, and by 0% to 7% in U.S. dollars.
Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by less than 2% compared to
the prior year period. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 0% to 7% and gross profit to
grow by 17% to 24% on a local currency basis, and by 1% to 8% in U.S. dollars. We expect that declines in our Name
Your Own Price service will continue to negatively impact revenue growth rates in Q2.
We expect about 550 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating margins compared to prior year, expressed as
non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit. Q2 forecast reflects the impact of investing in OpEx to
add people, offices and IT capacity to build up the capability of the business to handle future growth. Q2 also reflects
OpEx for OpenTable and our BookingSuite of hotel marketing services. While we are not giving you earnings guidance
beyond Q2, we do expect pressure on operating margins from non-advertising OpEx to significantly diminish over the
back half of the year as we lap the OpenTable acquisition and the launch of our BookingSuite initiative.

Our Q2 advertising forecast assumes lower online ad ROIs and increased investment in offline advertising, including
rolling out campaigns in new markets. Our approach to advertising spend is consistent with our past approach. We
invest in a manner that we believe is sustainable over the long term with the goal of building our brands with
consumers. We then strive to win the loyalty of our customers by giving them the most choices and the best booking
experience across all devices they use to search and book. This approach has resulted in a nice balance between top and
bottom line growth, and loyal customers that over time are increasingly coming to us directly rather than through pay
channels.
Our adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $715 million and $765 million which, at the midpoint, is a
decrease of 9% versus prior year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we estimate the currency impact on EBITDA growth
is similar to the impact that we are forecasting for gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA growth is also impacted by
deleverage in operating margins just discussed.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately 15%, comprised of
international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S. The non-GAAP EPS
forecast also reflects the dilutive impact of a full quarter of interest expense from the bond offerings we did in Q1
without any assumed share repurchases we may make using the proceeds.
We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $10.95 to $11.75 per share which, at the midpoint, is a
decrease of 9% versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 52.8 million
shares based upon yesterday's closing stock prices. We forecast GAAP EPS between $8.85 and $9.65 per share for Q2.
The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our
earnings release.
Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and
net earnings from any further fluctuation in the euro and British pound versus the dollar between now and the end of
the quarter. The hedges do not offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, or operating
income. They also do not hedge us against fluctuations in other currencies and do not hedge our earnings beyond the
second quarter.
Although we remain concerned about economic conditions in general, our forecast does not assume any further
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. We will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. You may begin.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. When we look at your bookings guidance for 2Q, it looks pretty healthy and consistent
with Q1, but it does seem like gross profit is decelerating ex-FX. And can you just talk about the dynamics there? And
then as you look at the marketing deleverage, are you seeing really pressure on ROI or what's really driving that? Is it
mix – mix of businesses or what's really driving that? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Dan, do you want to take that?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yeah. Hey, Justin. So, in terms of gross profit, we're seeing very healthy performance
there. The impact of OpenTable is a little bit more significant in Q1, the inorganic impact just given the normal
seasonality of our travel businesses.
And in terms of the online advertising forecast, ROIs are the key driver there. We don't go into all the building blocks
behind what are putting the pressure on the ROIs, but it's a story we've been telling you now for a couple of years and
we saw it in Q1 and we're forecasting it to continue in Q2.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you.

<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Darren, I think you mentioned that Agoda bookings showed acceleration. Could you give
any more color on what's happening there and also talk about the China outbound market to the extent that that's
building up in materiality? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. So why don't I – thanks, Mark. So first of all, the way I think about Agoda is
more broadly how things are going in Asia. And as you know, we have two big brands in Asia, Agoda and
Booking.com and together, we have a really strong business.
Agoda has traditionally been a business of Southeast Asian bookers but it's really expanded nicely to include a lot of
North Asian bookers and Oceania. At the same time, Booking.com which started the European business has had a lot of
success expanding into Asia. And really, the real strength of the two brands is in Asians moving around Asia. So you
have a lot of movement right now between China and Japan, Taiwan and Japan, Korea and Japan there's a lot of
movement also, Australia and going to Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia also going in North Asia. So we participate then
in a lot of the movement within Asia and both brands continue to grow and have a lot of success.
China specifically, is an amazing market. You know we have our relationship with Ctrip. We are constantly meeting
the teams, I just got back from China, I met with James and Jane, and it's turning out to be a great partnership. Our
outbound business with them is up quite significantly year over year. That said, we have more work to do still. We
haven't on-boarded Ctrip's inventory as fast as I'd hoped. There are a lot of issues we're working through. We're also
exploring the need to ramp up our own efforts in China to bring on inventory.
And also, Ctrip is not our only relationship in China. We've got a lot of deep partnerships with various other sources of
demand, so we're very bullish. I believe the group is really leading in independent travel outbound from China. I mean,
most Chinese do still travel in packages. But over time, that's going to change, and I think we're in a really nice position
in that specific market which is going to be likely in the next five to 10 years the largest outbound market in the world,
and we're making sure that we're serving it as well as we can.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, Darren.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tom White with Macquarie. You may begin.
<Q - Tom White>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Dan, could you maybe just clarify a bit about some of your
comments around FX impact on EBITDA in 1Q? It sounds like maybe it was less impacted due to FX. And I'm just
kind of curious. Does that sort of reverse, or how does that play into the 2Q guidance?
And then, just quickly on the European competitive landscape, one of your competitors is seemingly making
concessions on their take rates, hotel take rates in Europe to get more competitive. Are you guys seeing any sign that
that's impacting your ability to, I guess, get share of rooms for given properties?
And maybe just comment on how badly maybe your international hotel partners. Do they need additional sources of
distribution generally? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Dan, why don't you take the first one and I'll take the second one?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Sure. Hey, Tom. So, on that first question, we gave you specific calculation for the impact
of currency on a top line both for gross bookings and gross profit. It's easy for us to precisely calculate – maybe not

easy, but we can precisely calculate that because we know the currencies that all those bookings and gross profit are
generated in. It's a little bit more difficult at the bottom line because particularly online advertising, we're making
various assumptions as to the currencies that some of the keywords would pertain to.
What we determine based upon our estimates is that generally, the impact at the bottom line is similar to what we're
quantifying for you at the top line. In Q1, the impact is not as dramatic because seasonally, less of our earnings are
denominated in euros in Q1. So, it's about 14 percentage points at the gross profit line. You can assume it's something
less than that at the EBITDA line.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. And, Tom, on your question on competition in Europe, we haven't seen any
specific impact. We really set the low bar on take rates, and as we continue to grow in Europe, I'm sure there's a lot of
pressure on our competitors. It's hard to take commissions and start with the two in Europe when we're – everything we
have starts with a one. But we're really the one setting the standard, and I think there's probably – competitors have to
match that if they're going to ultimately get access to availability. We've always believed that any hotel, any partner
should have various sources of demand.
We don't cover every customer base in the world, so we would encourage them to use channel managers, have all the
source of demand that they can find, but of course, we want to fill our fair market share of those rooms. So, I don't see
anything specifically that's coming from that rather than just probably a long overdue balancing, rebalancing of the
market as it relates to take rates, but our business here. I just got out of the market in Europe. It's very healthy, and our
position. I feel very good about.
<Q - Tom White>: Good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Zhu with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - Steven Zhu>: Hi, thanks. So, Darren, from a unit – growth of units sold perspective, rental car days you stopped,
paced to the growth of your hotel room nights sold, but more recently that has slowed. It seems like that should be a
less online penetrated sector in travel so the growth rate should be higher as a result. So, can you help us reconcile what
may be going on? Is the supply a lot more constrained or is online penetration a lot higher than we think? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Well, thanks, Steven. I don't think I would take either one of those conclusions
because in both cases, even though I believe we're likely the leaders in rental car bookings in the world online among
independent parties and certainly the same on hotel room nights and neither one [ph] will be (26:22) such a big player
that it reflects either one market maturing faster than the other. It's largely our own execution.
I am actually really proud of the acceleration we're now seeing in rental cars. In particular, our rentalcars.com business,
as we've talked about before, used to be a very opaque model. And last summer, we went through a transition to make
it much more retail. So, adding reviews, adding brands and that was a lot of work but we feel really good how we've
come out of that transition and really improve their direct business, their loyalty, much more as let's call it a
Booking.com approach to rental cars. And we're quite excited about the momentum. But I don't think the market
specifically, neither one of them are we reaching any kind of feeling on potential. And really it's how fast and how hard
can we execute to get to the ultimate potential of the business.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And just one other point I'll add, Steven, our retail unit growth for rental car days is much
healthier than the consolidated growth rate that we quote. So, mainly on price rental cars are down year-over-year
because of lack of availability of discounted prices. So the growth rate per retail is more similar to what you're seeing
with the hotel business.
<Q - Steven Zhu>: Thank you very much.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Thanks. You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe one big picture topic for Darren. Given your
continued comments around marketing deleverage, and appreciated the color around direct versus paid, how do you
think longer term about directing all your business to the direct channel versus the variable channel? And how much
might you accomplish that, and how mobile might fit into that as you evolve over the next couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Well, thanks Eric. Yeah, at the very highest level our business is becoming
more direct and that's also allowing us to lean in to pay channels more. What we like is the combination of online
marketing as well as our offline marketing is helping to build our brands. And we always judge things on the basis of
earning positive ROI in the transaction. So if I can get positive ROI in a transaction then there's enough opportunity to
do that, then we're going to lean into it. It's like fishing, you bring the fish in and then you actually have to work with
the customer to make them loyal over the long term.
So that rhythm in our entire business is working very well. Obviously, the more direct business you have, at some point
is an endgame where you are completely direct but not obviously dramatically improve the marketing economics but
we're not at that time and we're still very much having to search out more and more customers to bring on to the
platform. So that's one area. I don't know, Dan, if you want to make a comment as well on marketing.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: No. I'd say the same thing. I mean there's – it's likely that some business forever will come
to us through pay channels. So many people just use Google as their entry point to the Internet and with meta-search
players and TripAdvisor just having very strong brands too, some customers probably will always prefer to start there,
but we like the trends that we see in terms of people continuing to increasingly come to us directly.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. And then, second part of your question was on mobile. Obviously, there's a lot
of talk. If you get somebody on a mobile app, then there is the panacea because then their entry point to the Internet is
always through you, and it's a very valuable customer. But to get people on to your mobile apps itself is marketing
spend.
But also, there's a large chunk of business that still happens through mobile Web, and we're a big partner of particularly
Google but other search engines and meta engines. And I feel really good about how our mobile Web product
performs. So, I don't think there's a place specifically in our business. We're not a high frequency thing like a Facebook
or Twitter, so our business is never going to end up being 100% app, and it's always going to be a nice balance between
Web and app.
I should say and a couple of exceptions to that in the portfolio. OpenTable is very heavy app because of the nature of a
restaurant reservation. Actually, KAYAK is very heavy app because people are always checking flight schedules. It's a
much more frequent occurrence than actually going out and booking a hotel room or renting a rental car, and that's why
mobile Web, by the way, performs a lot like desktop Web. It's a different product you're buying, but you're holding it to
similar ROI standards and spending as well.

<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Okay, Naved. So, we're really very happy with the progress there. As I
mentioned, we're now over 275,000 properties. I always like to remind people, the way we count property is I would
count an aparthotel as a property or a block of apartments. We actually have over 1 million rentable units. So, we
actually have a very competitive supply relative to others in the market.
Our vacation rental business, we don't have a number to announce. We talked about it, maybe each year, we'll talk
about that, but I will say it's growing faster than our core business. It is a product that's very demanded by our customer
base, and we feel like our tools and our various rhythms are getting better and better at ingesting this kind of stock. We
have a lot of innovations now we're working on to get to the single owner, single-property market, which is a whole
new market that we haven't, as to date been addressing as well. Most of our vacation rental homes are through property
management companies. So, there's a large segment of the market where the homeowner actually manages their home.
So, really excited about it, it seems to – our customers seem to want the product, which obviously is important to
balance out the supply and the demand side. And we're going to continue to push there and innovate in the coming
months and quarters.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin.
<Q - Michael J. Olson>: Hey. You mentioned Priceline brand domestically is facing some headwinds right now
especially in the opaque business which makes sense, but you have you some new management of that brand to try to
revitalize growth. But can you talk more specifically about how the Booking.com brand is doing in the U.S., and how
the initiative to grow that brand domestically is maybe comparing to your expectations at this point?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay, Mike. So, we don't release specific numbers but generally speaking, if you dig
around and you ask the average of U.S. hotel, they would generally say we're the fastest growing of the players. We're
growing off of a smaller base. We're trying all sorts of things in the U.S. For us, it's a big growth market because we're
just – we're starting, we under index in the U.S. And it seems like it takes time but the market is also sticking with the
American customer base. So, we're excited. It's a super high priority on my list.
The Booking.com model works particularly well in really small countries that don't speak English and people who
move around countries. And for us, we generally under index in really large countries where people don't leave the
country and that's where our growth – one of the angles of our growth potential. So, that's why we focus so hard on
China, Japan, United States, even Germany to really work on getting that domestic booker base as well. And so far so
good, but like everything in this business, it's a lot of hard work and a lot of small steps and we continue to invest and
push forward in the U.S. market.
<Q - Michael J. Olson>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. Dan, can you talk a little bit more about the spending and
the profit guidance for 2Q, and you obviously pointed out the lower ROI for advertising, as you have for several years
now. But is there a difference in the marketing strategy in this 2Q versus in the past, and how do we think about how
much impact here is coming from OpenTable and BookingSuite spend? And I know of course you're not guiding for
the rest of the year, but can you just comment on how you're thinking about that more in the back half? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Sure, Doug. So spending for Q2, starting off with other OpEx, non-advertising, you get a
sense from what you see in Q1 for what you can expect in Q2, and then pressure should subside, as we move beyond

that and we lap the OpenTable acquisition.
In terms of advertising, no change in our approach. I actually said that in the prepared remarks. So, we've been very
consistent all the way through. One thing that is different in this quarter is that there was more of a ramp in offline
spend. So some markets that we've introduced recently, France for one, Germany, which we launched in the back half
of last year, so now we're spending in Q2 this year against no spend last year, and we'll be looking to roll out into
additional markets as well, which you'll see as we proceed through the quarter. So that's having more pressure on Q2
margins than it did on Q1.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Okay. Thanks, Dan.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Thanks, guys. Just two questions. One, sticking with the marketing, on the offline campaign, can
you talk about the impact that this is having on the overall business? I guess how many countries you're in right now,
and are you seeing any improved efficacy with your online in the countries where you had the TV going for some
period of time?
And then the second question is around the newer hotel software business. Buuteeq plus the other pieces. So can you
just talk about the strategy around this area? Is the goal to improve the transaction side of the business, or could this get
built up to be a meaningful standalone business within the group? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay, Ross. So first of all, the offline, again this is just a Booking.com statement. The
markets we're in now are U.S., Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany and France. And the way we think about it is,
obviously we have a lot of micro data. So we're trying everything we can to measure the effectiveness of running an ad
on this channel, versus that channel. And we built a great team that can optimize the way we spend our advertising,
relative to the bookings we get from that advertising.
So then when you go to the macro level, the goal is to hit a return on advertising standard that adds both our online
spend and our offline spend. Of course, what you want to do is have a higher return on that total spend, after you begin
spending offline, than you did when you only spent online. So, you always get a combination of more and more of your
business coming direct, but also an improvement in your online spend, because people might click on your ad because
they you saw you on television when they might not have clicked on your ad, because they're like, who are these guys?
So we've been measuring that. And it usually takes some months to figure out that you're into a positive ROA territory,
and with almost every market so far, we've proven that we can get to positive ROA. Maybe not always in 12 months,
but we can ultimately get to positive ROA, and that's what encourages us.
It doesn't mean we can spend offline today and tomorrow our ROA is higher than it was before, because it doesn't
happen that fast. That's the big challenge with offline marketing. But more or less, we now have enough experience to
know that macro metric is getting to where we want to do it, and that's why we continue to lean into markets. And
ultimately the ROA improves because of the clicking, but again, we're getting more and more direct business.
BookingSuite, so the play there, there's two sides to it. One is building a SaaS business. This is a software business, and
we think because we already have a sales force in place, which is the toughest thing in a SaaS business is distribution,
that's where all the costs go. But we have a sales force in place, so we can have specialists [indiscernible] (39:16) our
sales force and we can go out and talk to many, many hotels everywhere in the world, and have a set of specialists help
with that.
But we also already have a lot of the hotel content. We have the availability. We have a booking engine. So we can
build a hotel site very fast, with almost no variable cost. And that's why the BookingSuite product is basically free, the
base product, and then we earn money off the transaction, and we've done all of our modeling that will be a good

material business for the group.
I don't see it likely ever being bigger than our core transaction booking business, but it's a sizable business on its own.
The other side of the reason of doing BookingSuite is helping our partners become more capable with technology, and
the more capable they are with technology and keeping their calendars up-to-date and keeping their pricing right, the
more able they are to plug into our platform.
And a third thing, but it really is the third, is we can do all of this and save our partners money, and they can then trust
us more as a company, that we do more than just building transaction. We actually make it easier to rent a property.
That's another benefit. So it's really three-fold. But we're not just doing this to be nice. It's a real business, and we
expect in, let's call it the medium to longer term, to have a pretty substantial impact on our overall business.
<Q - Ross Sandler>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. You may begin.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the pricing parity clauses, I think
the agreement this quarter with the EU. Feels like hotels now have somewhat more control on inventory availability
while requiring the same price. I'm just wondering what's changed, and what the potential impact could be.
And then a quick follow-up on Ross' question around BookingSuite. I know you said it launched this quarter, and the
medium long-term could be bigger. But where are you in sort of – it launched but what does that mean? Are the sales
force selling it? That would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Okay, Ron. So first on the parity clause, we're pleased with the outcome. We
wouldn't have proposed it otherwise. For us, parity is not a construct of the online industry, it's actually the whole travel
industry. Like if you had to go to a site that sold a Delta Air Lines ticket and it was always $10 more, it's hard to be in
business.
Apple has the same thing. If you go buy a Mac at an Apple Store, and then you go to a third-party distributor and it's
$10 more, there won't be any third party distributors. So parity is a very important construct that levels the playing
field, and allows us to really reach our primary objective. Our primary objective is to always make sure that our
customers get the best price. We can't be in business if our customers feel like they're playing more using any of our
assets.
So we worked through this compromise, I think it was well understood by the authorities that there's a free riding
problem in our business like ours. If our suppliers who basically load the prices onto our system can load higher prices
on our system and lower prices on their system. But more importantly, regardless of whether there's parity or not, if a
hotel is on our system and the prices are too high it won't convert, and if it doesn't convert, then won't show up because
there's a ranking mechanism anyway that always makes sure that the best product moves to the top.
And our best partners have the best product have a very strong incentive to give our customers good value, because our
customers won't buy things that aren't good value. So there's already a really strong reinforcing element. I don't see this
as having any significant impact on our business. But it's a moving target. There's always new discussions and things,
but the way that our business runs and the reason customers use our product, they want to have confidence that we're
getting the best pricing, and this agreement doesn't at all affect our rights or ability to make sure that they get the best
price, and that's what's important.
And then on the BookingSuite topic, we don't release right now how many sites we're putting out. Maybe in a few
quarters we'll give everyone an insight into that, but it's off to a very strong start. So it's promising. The team in Seattle,
which was Buuteeq, is our back end team, and we now have salespeople out in the field. They're really a second tier

sales force. They're not in every office but they're there in when a warm lead happens, it gets handed off to somebody
who really knows the depth of what they're talking about.
We're in the bigger countries, but in the smaller countries we're just getting to that. Our teams are just getting trained up
on that, so it's sort of a rolling motion. But early signs are very, very positive. And the demand for the product is

<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Darren, I was hoping you could kind of give us a bit of an update on how your thinking
has evolved about the lifetime value of mobile app customers. I know in the conversion – in the questions you've
answered, before you've generally talked about CPA as the primary value that you're driving towards – driving your
ROI towards. Wondering if, as you've learned more about the way mobile customers act on apps, and have better
understanding of sort of cross-platform attribution, if the way that you're thinking about mobile app acquisition or
customer acquisition, relative to that LTV, has changed?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay, Heath. Thanks. Yeah, what we find, at least in our business, and this is now
more a Booking.com, Agoda, rental car statement. I'll put aside KAYAK and OpenTable because of the
aforementioned, that they're primarily on app, and they get sort of the really high repeat frequency type customer,
which is a different set of behaviors. But in our business, our most loyal customers, it's a bit of a circular arc because
our most loyal customers are the ones that carry the app, and our most loyal customers are the ones that bounce over all
the screens. So the app for them is not just a booking experience. It's the thing that they carry their reservation in.
We now have travel guides, so the travel guide is in the app. When they check into a hotel, immediately it says, are you
happy or sad? So all of these things come with the app, and help our most loyal customers that are often the people who
booked with us already many times, continue to repeat with us. So it would be a stretch to say that everyone who uses
the app is a more loyal customer, because the input to that generally is the more loyal.
But we do find generally now going away from app and talking about mobile more generally, the move, the biggest
thing that's changing in our business is the move from a single screen world, where you only did one thing with us,
which was make a booking, to a multi-screen world, where you have an end-to-end experience, from looking to
booking to enjoying your trip on the ground, is giving us more and more loyalty. People realize there's lots of reasons
to use our products, but when we can actually make the whole experience better, people see that, wow, this is just a
better way to do things. And it's hard to make that multi-screen experience all tie together, and we are certainly not
complete with that work. But it's a huge differentiator, and for a big player like us we have the assets and the resources
to invest to make that seamless, and for you to be able to do that anywhere you travel in the world.
This isn't easy work, by the way, because all of these softwares don't naturally speak with one another, and you've got
to get the right cloud-based architecture where your account can sit in the cloud, and then no matter if you're the app or
the Booking Now or you're on an Apple Watch, or you're on the website, that your account immediately gets tied
together. But that's work the team has done and I think does reward the bigger players who can really plumb that new
sort of end-to-end multi-screen digital experience for our customers.
So I'm excited. For eCommerce players, mobile is a real positive. When you're in the media business, mobile has this
extra tradeoff, that it's harder to convert something through media on a smaller screen. That's obviously – you're seeing
that trade-off between those who own the transaction and those who don't.

Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. You may begin.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Hi. Thanks. Could you talk broadly about how you're thinking about margins in the
vacation rental business, compared to hotel booking, and is there any difference in how you approach ROA for that
business? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Well, Kevin, yes, we – so first of all, you start out with hotels, and then below
hotels, there's a whole collection of things that you could call self-catered products. So, first just commenting on B&B's
and apartments and things like that, we see that the commission levels and the take rates in that space are equivalent to
the hotel space. We don't feel any extra pressure. Again, that's all with the lens that we have a very low bar as it is,
around the world, compared to most of our competition. But we don't feel pressure to go lower.
When you get into the single vacation home space, we still have generally signed up, without having to dilute our take
rate much. So we have a little bit more pressure there, because the average vacation home owner, it's a marketplace
with a lot of friction, and a lot of uncertainty. We're the first and only transaction engine that works – that's instantly
verifiable, so that property has actually the calendar that works. There's no back and forth with the consumer, like once
the consumer buys, then they have to pay.
So, there's a lot of work still yet to be done, and a lot of these players are used to marketing themselves through a
classified ad, or on an Internet website, and they're expecting phone calls, or maybe it's some of them might even be on
Airbnb and there's different economics in that, that I would say, let's say that the story's still out in the vacation home
market, but we've at least to date been able to approach it in a similar way.
The other argument of vacation homes is the length of stay is a lot longer. The ADR is potentially higher, and therefore,
they would argue that the take rate percentage should be lower, but that the absolute take rate is actually very healthy
relative to the booking. But – sorry a long answer to the question. I don't feel a lot of pressure, but in the vacation
home, single owner market we of course will compete as aggressively as we need to, and be smart about the
economics.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, just to go back to the gross profit
guidance in 2Q, and what we saw in the first quarter, it looks like constant currency gross profit per room night, if I
back out OpenTable, was about up 1% year on year versus 4% last year. Is that geo mix from Agoda, or is there
something else going on that we should make sure we consider in our 2Q modeling?
And then a higher-level one, as you talk about strategies to drive more direct business, any thoughts about offering a
broader loyalty program for Booking.com or how do you think about loyalty programming at this point?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Dan, why don't you take the first? I'll take the second.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Sure. So, Brian, gross profit relative to room nights. Room nights are on an as booked basis
and the gross profit is on a stay basis, so you've got a little bit of a mismatch there. We had a strong quarter with
accelerating growth and to a not insignificant degree, those checkouts are going to occur in Q2 around Easter and then
Q3 around summer.

And the other factor as I mentioned before, OpenTable has a more dramatic, inorganic benefit to Q1 because the travel
businesses are just seasonally smaller in that quarter. And so that's gross profit that's in our numbers with no room
nights associated with it.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: And Brian, on loyalty programs generally, so we do have a couple in the group.
Agoda has a loyalty program, although we're slowly phasing that out. OpenTable has a points loyalty program. This is
in the more traditional earn points, earn nights, get things free. Booking.com specifically, we believe that that kind of
mechanism for the really infrequent traveler can be as much of a turn-off as a turn-on, because they may only do two
bookings a year. Or they may be wanting to do one booking, and they maybe do it quite infrequently. And for them,
what they want is just a great experience.
So we focus – to drive loyalty, we focus very much on the product, and getting them amazing pricing. When you go to
a destination, it's not about what this hotel [indiscernible] (52:48) costs, it's about what does the selection and
assortment allow me to buy, and our users love the fact that they can find that place that directly matches what they
need, at a great value. And that's what's driven our loyalty over time, has really been product experience.
That said, Brian, I can tell you, you haven't booked five times on Booking, because if you do within a year we have a
program called Genius that we offer in more of a surprise and delight fashion to our most frequent guests, and that
allows them access to other closed user group rates that are supplied by our hotel partners. Our hotel partners are really
interested in our most frequent guests. It improves their conversion and therefore improves their placement on our front
end to all customers. And that's something we've had in the market now going on a couple years, and has been really
successful.
So that's been our approach to date. It's not that we won't change that. We're always questioning these things.
Rocketmiles we bought, is a really interesting small company in Chicago that uses airline miles. We're interested in it
because it's a real fast-growing very unique business, but we're obviously now bringing in some people with some deep
expertise within Rocketmiles, many of who came from the airline frequent flyer miles business. And we'll see if we
learn anything from that, that might impact our thinking differently in the future.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And, Brian, one follow-up to your first question, which is what you might have been
getting at. No substantial change in our take rates in Q1 or Q2 forecast.
<Q - Brian Nowak>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question will be from Manish Hemrajani with Oppenheimer. You may begin.
<Q - Manish Hemrajani>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. As you look at room night growth up 25%
year-over-year, how much of that growth has been driven by new properties, let's say properties that have been on the
platform for less than a year? And how much of the growth has been driven by older properties?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay, Manish. I'll take that. We don't divulge that specifically, but at the higher level,
I've shared this before, that if you were a property on Booking.com five years ago, on average, every year, we've given
you more bookings. So if you're a brand-new property you come on, and that's always been our goal, is to have enough
demand so that all of our existing properties don't feel like we're taking business away from them, but they continue to
get more, and we can always feed our new properties.
When you look at our property growth, that 40% we talked about, the properties are getting smaller and smaller on
average. It's not that we aren't signing up big hotels, big resorts, but on average, that's getting smaller. So, our unit
growth in terms of bookable properties is not growing at the pace of our business, which therefore, allows us to
continue to keep our property partners happy, is the way to think way to think about it.

<Q - Manish Hemrajani>: Got it. And then can you comment on the recent consolidation in the space, and what
should we expect your response to be, especially in markets where you're under-indexed versus the global travel market
share?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. As I said on the last call, we think the consolidation clarifies competition. It's
not the strategy we're following. And we continue to stay focused on what we're good at, and I – even if the three
players are now one player, we have the same strategy in the United States we've always had. It hasn't changed our
product, it hasn't changed our value proposition and we continue to push forward, and I would say quite successfully.
And by the way, I say that, not saying the other strategy is bad. It's just different than what we've been doing, and the
space that we occupy is very large.
This has been said many times. But it's either $1 trillion or $1.3 trillion. Even if you add our largest competitor with us,
we still make up less than 10% of the opportunity. So it's not like we're running against one another every day. It's more
our segment of the business, which is online travel, largely independent travelers, people who leverage the Internet, has
a nice tailwind behind it, and we're making sure that we do our best to capture as much of that as possible
<Q - Manish Hemrajani>: Thank you.

Yeah, thank you for all joining us and wanted to – I know a lot of our employees and others have joined this call as
