Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Ellen, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. So, we just finished our first full year as an
independent E&P company and all of us here at ConocoPhillips are pretty proud of what we've accomplished.
2013 was a year in which we had to achieve several strategic and operational goals to position the company for 3% to
5% volume and margin growth in 2014 and beyond. And that's what we did.
So if you turn to slide 3, let me describe some of the highlights from this important year. Operationally, we met our
production goals for the year. As importantly, we grew our reserves to fuel our future growth.
As we saw it in announcement today, we achieved 179% reserve replacement ratio and grew reserves about 3%, pretty
strong results for a company of our size and it certainly speaks to the quality of our asset base and our investment
programs.
Our 3% to 5% growth will come from major projects and development drilling programs across our operations. In
2013, we achieved start-ups in several major projects and we continued to ramp up our unconventional programs in the
Lower 48. These activities will ramp up during 2014 as well and also provide strong momentum into 2015.
In looking longer term, our exploration program, which is key for sustaining our future growth, we had another
successful year in 2013. We announced three deepwater Gulf of Mexico successes. We advanced our North American
unconventional exploration programs and accessed additional opportunities around the growth goal. So operationally,
we hit the milestones we set for ourselves in 2013 and we have positioned the company for growth.
2013 was also a strong financial year. On a full year adjusted earnings, we were at $7.1 billion, up 5% compared to
2012's adjusted earnings. This translates to $5.70 per share for the year. Cash from operations grew year-over-year and
we ended up 2013 with $6.5 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet.
Our cash margins grew 11% compared to 2012 and this reflects the fundamental shift toward liquids in our portfolio
and certainly a key aspect of our value proposition. Strategically, it was an active year for ConocoPhillips as well. We
closed over $10 billion of non-core asset dispositions, including Kashagan and Algeria and these are certainly
important steps toward high-grading our portfolio and Nigeria is really the only remaining announced asset sale to
complete and we hope to have that done relatively soon.
During 2013, we maintained our commitment to pay a compelling dividend. We increased our dividend by about 4.5%
at midyear and remain committed to increases over time.
So in summary, 2013 was a very successful year for the company operationally, financially and strategically. We
accomplished what we set out to do, to high-grade our portfolio, to position ourselves for volume and margin growth,
to access and build opportunities for future growth, to maintain our financial strength, and finally, deliver strong
shareholder return.
So, let me now turn over the call to both Jeff and Matt for some additional comments on 2013 and a look into 2014.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thanks, Ryan. Well, first to recap the fourth quarter results on slide 4. Fourth quarter 2013 adjusted earnings were
$1.74 billion or $1.40 a share. Adjusted earnings were essentially flat to last year's fourth quarter and down slightly
sequentially despite lower realizations.
Some of the drivers in this quarter's performance aren't obvious, so I'll add some detail on those items. Embedded in
this quarter's earnings are weaker liquids realizations in North America, reflecting wide differentials to WTI and WCS.
For example, in our Lower 48 segment, our realized price for crude oil averaged 90% of WTI in Q4 2013 compared to
101% of WTI in Q4 2012. Bitumen prices were also particularly weak this quarter.

Volumes for the quarter were negatively impacted by unusual weather in the Lower 48 and the North Sea, which we
pre-announced. We also had continued curtailment in Libya and a planned turnaround in Qatar.
And finally, the quarter benefited from lower tax expenses. Our tax expenses were lower both because of increased
proportion of production in areas with more favorable fiscal terms as well as an approximately $100 million benefit
related to changes in tax estimates in several regions, and an $85 million tax benefit related to the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar.
Now our fourth quarter segment earnings are shown in the lower right hand side of this chart, and we provided
additional details on our operating and corporate segments in the backup materials.
Next, I'll cover full year 2013 financials on slide 5. As Ryan mentioned, full-year 2013 adjusted earnings were $7.1
billion or $5.70 a share, and adjusted earnings were up about 5% from the full-year of 2012. And this makes a point
that underlying performance is improving. Realizations are about flat, but margins are growing due to increases in
liquid production from places with better fiscals, which is consistent with our strategy.
Despite volatile pricing and basis differentials throughout the year, all of our significant operating segments were
profitable. We continue to believe that our diversified product and geographic splits are key to providing consistent
performance over time. That was a quick review of our reported earnings results; again, there is additional information
in our backup and supplemental materials.
Now, I'll turn to slide 6 for some specific comments on production. Total production in the fourth quarter 2013 was
1.518 million BOE per day, which included 1.473 million BOE per day from continuing ops and 45,000 per day from
discontinued operations. This chart shows the drivers of the change in production from continuing operations compared
to the fourth quarter of 2012.
Fourth quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 1.566 million BOE per day. Adjusting for dispositions
and Libya, which were 10,000 BOE and 43,000 BOE per day respectively, normalized production from continuing
operations was 1.513 million BOE per day in last year's fourth quarter and that's the middle blue bar on the chart.
Moving to the right, we show the variance in downtime this quarter, driven by unusual weather impacts and a
month-long turnaround in Qatar. Finally, you'll see that growth just about offset decline.
I should note that there wasn't much of a contribution from the major project start-ups since they came on late in the
quarter. But they'll start making a visible difference in our future production. The majority of our growth came from
our development and major projects in the Lower 48 shale plays and the oil sands and Asia.
The full year volume story is more telling, so please turn to page 7. This chart shows the same convention as the
previous chart. Adjusted for downtime, Libya and dispositions, we grew production about 2%. Growth of 207,000 BOE
per day was 30,000 BOE per day higher than decline of 177,000 BOE per day. This reflects underlying production
growth in the Lower 48, the oil sands and in Asia.
Again, the contribution from our recent major projects was negligible given the late year timing. And one note in 2013,
Libya contributed 30,000 BOE per day of production and absent those volumes, 2013 total production was 1.472
million BOE per day. And we intend to exclude Libya in our future production outlooks. So, we now think of this
1.472 million BOE per day as the base on which we're going to grow 3% to 5% in 2014 and beyond. And that growth is
bringing stronger margins and slides 8 and 9 put our growth and margin trends in perspective.
The chart on page 8 shows the 30,000 barrel a day production change from the previous slide, sliced by segment and
product in order of year-over-year change.
At the top of the chart is our growth from liquids focused assets, especially the Lower 48 unconventionals, the oil sands
in Canada and higher margin production from the Asia-Pacific segment. We're growing in the places and in the
products that have higher margins and declining in some of the lower margin streams like North America natural gas.

During 2013, liquids production from continuing operations increased to 56% of total production and should continue
to improve in 2014 and beyond. The impact of this mix shift on cash margins can be seen on slide 9. This slide shows
year-over-year cash margins both on a reported basis on the left side of the chart and price normalized basis on the right
side of the chart.
As you can see from the left chart, 2013 cash margins grew 11% on an absolute basis, despite flat realized prices
compared to 2012, reflecting the impact of production mix and location.
On the right side of the page, we've priced normalized the margins with 2012 as the baseline, and margins grew 9% on
this basis.
We provided a reconciliation of this chart in our backup materials. We expect this metric to continue to improve, and
we'll continue to track it, since it's a key aspect of our value proposition.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks with our cash flow waterfall, which is another good story, so if you'll turn to slide
10. This shows our cash flow performance for 2013. We began the year with about $4.5 billion of cash on the balance
sheet. For the year, we generated about $16 billion of cash from operations and over $10 billion from asset sales.
Our continuing operations and capital program was about $16 million. We paid about $3.3 billion in dividends.
As we announced in December, we prepaid $2.8 billion of future obligations to our 50% owned joint venture interest at
FCCL, and the remaining cash flow items such as debt repayment, and capital associated with discontinued operations
were a $1.5 billion use of cash. This leaves us in a very strong financial position at the end of 2013 with about $6.5
billion of cash and short-term investments on hand and a positive outlook for margin improvement that can grow cash
from operations.
So as we start 2014, we're well positioned to execute on our investment programs for the company. That concludes the
review of our financial performance.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Matt, for an update on our operations, beginning on slide 11.
Matthew J. Fox
Thanks, Jeff. I'll kick off with the operations section with some comments on our 2013 reserve replacement
performance. We achieved very strong results for the year. We ended 2013 with 8.9 billion BOE of reserves, up 3%
compared to last year.
Importantly, we added over 1 billion barrels of reserves organically, resulting in our organic reserve replacement ratio
of 179%, including last year, we've now averaged over 165% organic reserve replacement as an independent E&P
company.
Our all-in reserve replacement ratio was 147%. This takes into account the impact of dispositions completed during the
year, primarily at Kashagan, Algeria, and the Cedar Creek Anticline, which reduced reserves by 188 million BOE.
Some of the key additions came from the Eagle Ford and Bakken. Most of the additions in these two plays were a result
of higher confidence in performance and offset bookings. However, we've only booked less than 30% of identified
resource in Eagle Ford and Bakken, and that's based on our current well spacings of 80 acres in the Eagle Ford and 320
acres in the Bakken. So, resource upside potential still exists in these plays, as we get results from our spacing pilots.
Canada contributed about a quarter of the additions, predominantly from the oil sands. We also added reserves to
APLNG as we continued to drill our acreage there and with some contributions from both the UK and Norwegian
sectors of the North Sea.
We'll provide more details on our reserve bookings including costs incurred in our 10-K that will be filed in February.
So again, we're really pleased with these results and we believe the differential for a company of our size. And the
bottom line is that these reserve additions give us confidence in our ability to deliver sustained growth and value

accretion from our capital programs.
So next, I'll review our operating segments. In each segment, I'll address key results from the fourth quarter and overall
highlights from 2013 and I'll give you some color around activities to watch out for this year.
I'll start with the Alaska segment on page 12, starting from the lower left with highlights from the fourth quarter. We
applied for a two-year export license for our Kenai LNG plant. You may remember we placed this facility in cold
storage about a year ago to retain the option to restart, but conditions changed with increasing gas production that
cannot take advantage of that LNG capacity. At CD5, we began critical ice road constructions that will allow us to
move materials for roads and bridges, a key to accessing and preparing this project site.
Moving to the top right, 2013 was a big year for our Alaska business. Probably the most significant highlight was the
passage of SB21 or the More Alaska Production Act. These changes have made the investment climate in Alaska more
attractive, and as a result, we'll execute a much higher budget for 2014, $600 million more than in 2013.
And this capital increase is focused on adding production. For example, in addition to CD5, we'll continue our major
project work at Drill Site 2S and Greater Moose's Tooth. And these three projects alone could add over 40,000 barrels a
day growth by 2018 to offset the claims through tax.
And we continue to make progress on the Alaska LNG project. This month, we executed an enhancement agreement
with ExxonMobil, BP, TransCanada, and the State of Alaska that defines a path forward for the commencement of
pre-FEED, and if all goes well, pre-FEED work could start as early as the second quarter this year. So, I'd say we're
making progress on all fronts in Alaska.
Let's move on to slide 13 to cover the Lower 48 segment. As Jeff already mentioned, like many other operators, we had
adverse production impacts due to weather in the fourth quarter in this segment. But despite the weather, we achieved
some significant progress in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, in particular.
In the Eagle Ford, our operated program reached a milestone of more than 500 total wells online. Production averaged
126,000 BOE a day in the fourth quarter, representing 42% growth versus the same period last, the previous year, and
we reached a peak rate of 141,000 BOE a day in late December.
In the Bakken, we achieved a peak rate of 43,000 barrels a day and averaged 39,000 for the fourth quarter, and that's a
63% increase compared to the same period last year.
In the fourth quarter, we also made progress in our emerging deepwater business. We announced the discovery at Gila,
conducted appraisal activities at Tiber and Coronado, and continued exploration drilling in Deep Nansen in the western
Gulf of Mexico.
Moving to the full-year highlights, Lower 48 production was up 34,000 BOE per day, representing 7% growth versus
2012. But more importantly behind this overall growth, our oil production grew 24% year-on-year, delivering the mix
shift we're targeting as we execute our strategy. In fact, for full-year 2013, the Eagle Ford and Bakken grew 60% on a
combined basis compared to 2012.
During 2013, we also matured our appraisal programs in the Delaware and Midland Basins and in the Niobrara. We
continued to test various horizons, completion designs and lateral wins in these plays with encouraging results to-date.
We'll give you an update on what we're learning at our Analyst Day in April, but the goal with these appraisal programs
is to have a clearer view of the development plans for these plays by the end of this year.
In our emerging Gulf of Mexico deepwater program, we announced significant results at Shenandoah and Coronado in
the first quarter and the discovery at Gila the fourth quarter. These are important milestones and establish strong
momentum for our exploration and appraisal activities for 2014 and beyond.
Our Lower 48 business is a very unique and high-value segment. We have peer leading positions in several of the best
Lower 48 unconventional plays, where we're growing production and continuing to identify upside. Also, we have an
enviable position in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, best delivered early success and provides future growth and

significant value for the company.
Now please go to slide 14 and we'll talk about the Canada segment. Operationally, our Canada business performed very
well in the fourth quarter. Volumes continued to ramp up at Christina Lake Phase E, and our Western Canada winter
drilling program underway, where we were focused on drilling our liquids-rich inventory. We continued to drill and
evaluate unconventional plays in the Duvernay and Montney. And we spudded our first horizontal well in the Canol
play where we hope to drill two horizontal wells this season.
And overall, 2013 was a very important year for this segment. Like the Lower 48, we advanced a very substantial yet
diverse set of opportunities. For the year, production was up 1%, and we achieved a 13% increase in liquids production
compared to 2012 mostly from the oil sands.
And our oil sands business performed extremely well operationally. Volumes grew 17%, and by year-end, the Surmont
2 project had achieved over 60% completion and this positioned us very well for first steam in mid-2015 as we
planned.
The theme for 2014 in Canada is continued investment and growth. Our conventional liquid-rich plays, our
unconventional plays and our oil sands assets will all be active, with some significant milestones on the horizon.
So, let's move on to our Europe segment on slide 15. Like the Lower 48, this segment experienced some very
challenging weather that impacted fourth quarter production. However, the big news in the fourth quarter was the start
of production at Ekofisk South in Norway and Jasmine in the UK.
Ekofisk South production started in late October from the first of four pre-drilled wells, two months ahead of schedule.
Ekofisk South is designed for 35 production wells that will grow production as they are drilled over the next five years.
At Jasmine, first production was achieved in November. Production is currently constrained about half of platform
capacity until we fully commission the Judy riser platform, which should occur during this quarter. Clearly, the major
projects dominated the operational themes for 2013.
By extensive turnarounds, in large part to prepare for project startups were a key activity in the middle of the year and
were executed very well. In addition to the two major projects, I just discussed, work advanced on additional projects,
the Eldfisk II, Britannia Long-Term Compression, and Clair Ridge.
We entered 2014 focused on ramping up and optimizing our major projects at Ekofisk South and Jasmine and
establishing production for new East Irish Sea asset plant.
In addition, the Britannia Long-Term Compression project is preparing for startup in the third quarter of this year and
pre-drilling is underway at Eldfisk II in anticipation of startup in early 2015.
On the exploration front in this segment, we expect to see results from our unconventional appraisal in Poland. Two
vertical wells and one horizontal well are planned. We'll also begin exploratory drilling in the Barents Sea.
So our Europe segment had a pivotal year in 2013 after several years in project mode. We're positioned for growth
from high-value production that will extend the life of our legacy positions in Europe. We have a lot of work to do to
ramp up and optimize our operations in 2014, but these activities will position us for a strong future in that segment.
Finally, I'll cover our Asia-Pacific/Middle East segment on slide 16. Key fourth quarter highlights in this segment
included the completion of the QG3 planned turnaround in Qatar and continued progress and access on future
exploration options.
We obtained operatorship and 100% working interest in the Palangkaraya PSC in Indonesia and we completed a
seismic work in the Qijiang Block of China. These are both examples of relatively low cost early stage exploration
options and plays with the potential for materiality.
Highlights for all of 2013 included progress in major projects that will make a step function contribution to our future
production levels in this segment. During 2013, our partners progressed towards major project startups in Malaysia.

We're now anticipating a first quarter startup at Siakap North-Petai and a second quarter startup at Gumusut.
Our APLNG project is on schedule for first LNG by mid-2015 and overall the project stands at about 60% complete.
On the exploration front, we announced the Proteus gas discovery in the Browse Basin, which was an untested structure
to the southeast of the Poseidon discovery.
The big catalysts for 2014 are the Malaysia startups SNP, Gumusut and Kebabangan and we have an important year
ahead at APLNG as we approach startup in 2015. And we expect to provide a full update of these projects at our April
Analyst Meeting in New York.
Our appraisal programs offshore Australia will continue in 2014 with two wells each planned in the Poseidon area and
the Caldita/Barossa. And the punchline in this segment is very straightforward: Significant production ramp-up over the
next couple of years from high-margin volumes and upside from a growing exploration inventory.
I don't have a slide on our other international segment. The main focus last year was on executing the divestitures that
Ryan mentioned. In 2014, the key segment activity will be our exploration in Senegal and Angola, which should get
underway by mid-year.
I'll conclude my prepared remarks with some comments on our production outlook for the first quarter. We're on track
to deliver 3% to 5% growth in 2014 from the projects and activities I just described. Excluding Libya, we expect to
achieve approximately 1.5 million barrels a day this year.
As Jeff mentioned, we'll exclude Libya from future production outlooks, since we're not optimistic that production will
resume from the Eastern fields anytime soon.
In the first quarter, we estimate that volumes from continuing operations excluding Libya to range from 1,490 MBOE
per day to 1,530 MBOE per day. This range reflects short-term uncertainty around the ramp-up of recent and pending
startups and includes a 15,000 barrel a day impact from a turnaround of the second train in Qatar that will occur in
March.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Ryan for a brief recap and summary of the key themes for 2014 on slide 17.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Matt. So, I hope there's no doubt that 2013 was a successful year for the company. We delivered on our
commitments, but perhaps more importantly, we positioned the company for a strong 2014.
Operationally, we're at a significant inflection point for the company. We expect to continue ramping up our
unconventional drilling programs and progressing our major growth project. And as Matt mentioned, we expect to
grow in almost all of our business segments this year, while progressing the major projects that will continue our
growth into 2015 and beyond. Meanwhile, it's a big year for our exploration programs and our conventional program
will be drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Senegal, the Barents Sea and Australia.
In our unconventional program, we'll have an active year in the Lower 48 Permian, the Niobrara plays as well as
Poland and Canada. We should see ongoing improvement in underlying margins as we bring on new volumes. And
we'll maintain our focus on improving returns, while staying committed to returning capital to our shareholders.
On the strategic front, we're moving beyond the positioning phase of our journey as an independent E&P company. So
now, we're focused on executing our current plans to deliver growth in volumes and margins, while positioning the
company for long-term success.
Our goal here is to have a deep inventory of choices and options for investment and be the best capital allocators in the
business. We think our diversified approach to this business will serve us well over the long term. We are not
dependent on any single product, play type, or geography and this allows us to consistently execute our programs
through the cycles.

Bottom-line, we're positioned to deliver 3% to 5% growth in both production and margins with a compelling dividend.
That's our value proposition that we set out and we're committed to delivering on it.
So, I hope, Jeff, Matt and I have given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones in 2014.
It should be exciting year and I look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Meeting in April in New York.
And I would mention, I think, Matt mentioned 2014 production at 1.55 million BOE per day. So, now, let me take all
your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from
Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Good afternoon, Doug.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good afternoon, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: In Lower 48 and also in international E&P, cash margin seem to have been significantly
stronger versus the year ago period, despite the absence of help from realization, which I think one of Jeff's slides
indicated. And on this point, I want to see if we could get some color on the improved performance in those two areas,
and specifically, where you're seeing the improvement regionally in both Lower 48 and international E&P?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, Doug, I think it primarily comes back to changes in mix...
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Yeah.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: ...when you look at cash margins within that segment, and that's what we were trying to
highlight with the slide, it just kind of shows year-over-year changes in production. You just saw a fairly large shift in
liquids production that we talked about increases of a very significant percentage, related primarily to Eagle Ford and
Bakken...
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: ...was the biggest driver of that change.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: And internationally, Jeff, could it be the loss of some lower margin production as well?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, I think that's the overall mix.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: As you would have properly flagged there, Doug, if you look year-over-year we basically had
the same kind of overall realized price.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: But the shift of production within different jurisdictions, which kind of is highlighted on that
one slide we have, shows production going up in the Lower 48, up in Canada, up in Asia, down in Alaska, down in
Norway, down in the UK. So, up in kind of lower tax areas and down in higher tax areas. I'm sure that has a lot to do
with helping drive the cash margin – that and just the shift overall to liquids production over gas production.

<A - Ryan M. Lance>: And, Doug, that's what we said. That's going to continue because that's the direction, that's the
strategy, that's how we're allocating our capital, and that's how we're thinking about how we grow the margins and
grow our cash flows as the production grows.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Right. And then just quickly on capital expenditures. I think slide 10 indicated that the
company pre-paid almost $3 billion of its oil sands commitment. And so, I wanted to see if you could spend a minute
on that item specifically, why the company chose to do so? Whether or not there any interest or tax benefits that were
meaningful, and also how it affects the spending profile on that project going forward?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. As we mentioned, we pre-paid a $2.8 billion obligation that we had and that was
something that was – we incurred when we set up the joint venture back many years ago.
Now, the key for us is that was an interest-bearing obligation, it had about a 5% interest on it. You can really think of
that as being equivalent to debt. It was an obligation that we needed to pay over the next several years, and when we
had as much cash as we have on our balance sheet just from a kind of balance sheet management point of view, it
makes sense to prepay that obligation and save the 5% interest as opposed to leaving that cash on your balance sheet
and variable return on the cash.
But the other thing we want to make sure we point out on that is, that is cash that's moving into a 50% joint venture. So,
while it's a $2.8 billion outflow for us, it means that we essentially still own about half of that $2.8 billion, so it's more
of a $1.4 billion net of outflow. So that does reduce capital that we'll have in the subsequent years. We did that
primarily just from kind of a balance sheet management point of view of getting rid of an interest-bearing obligation
and taking advantage of the fact that you would otherwise just had said cash on your balance sheet not making a very
good return.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: Hey. Yes. Good afternoon and good progress on the cash margin story. Just thinking about
one of the components of that is obviously your shale portfolio and you gave good guidance back at the Investor Day
last year. Still some growth in the Eagle Ford, although you seemed to be a bit ahead of plan in the Bakken and
Permian then accelerate. So, what's the constraints on perhaps even driving a little bit harder in terms of shale? Is it the
amount of money that you have to still spend on some of these longer life pancake type assets, SAGD, APLNG or is it
that the shale itself has not yet delineated enough for you to put more capital to work? Thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well, Ed, this is Matt speaking. It's really neither of those things actually, really what it is that
we're focused just now on running a safe and efficient operation. We don't want this economy to scale, we don't want to
get too far ahead of infrastructure.
But the real reason is that we're still benefiting from a cost learning curve, and are drilling in the completions and that's
going to improve even further as we move toward pad drilling for most of our wells. So, the cost learning curve – and
then as a huge technology learning curve ahead of us in the unconventionals that's going to improve the overall
efficiency of these developments in the years to come. So, we're staying consistently for example in the Eagle ford with
an 11 rig program, but we do have the flexibility as you point out to change that if we think that's the right value
proposition.
<Q - Edward Westlake>: All right. Then, most of the rig which is HBP, so there's no pressure as well. And then just –
and a follow-up on shale then, Matt, what were you most excited about that you feel that you can talk about last year
when you think about the North American shale, but fairly, not just – and maybe include Columbia as well, but not just
in the U.S.?

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So, I mean, I think, we're making progress on all of our shale plays. Clearly, the Eagle Ford
and the Bakken are now in development mode. But, we're still seeing upside there associated with pilot test that we're
running for looking at decreasing well space and I sort of alluded to that in my prepared remarks.
We're getting encouraging results in the Permian, both in the Delaware and the Midland Basin and encouraging results
on the Niobrara. And in Canada, we're still getting good results from our unconventional program up there, and we're
going to give you a lot more detail on this when we get to the Analyst Meeting in April, because we think we owe you
a sort of update on what we're learning in all of these plays, but that'll take a bit of time and we'll do that in April.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I would add, Ed, that we continue to believe and I think our results are proving out that we're
in the best positions in the best plays and any surprises, we get are usually to the upside, and we've got more resource
and more opportunity as we think about our capital program and our allocation of capital as some of the big projects
start to wind down.

Thank you. And our next question is from Jim Sullivan of Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good afternoon, Jim.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Just wanted to look a little bit ahead on this margin story. Obviously, the passage of SB21, the
Alaska Production Act, as you guys thinking a little bit differently about Alaska. And we obviously appreciate the
details on Moose's Tooth and so forth. And with the reservations that I'm sure you guys are going to want to talk about
this in more detail at the Analyst Day.
Could you guys just comment a bit on how you see that affecting the margin profile going forward? I mean, obviously,
you have an array of tax benefits in that bill? So, just, how it compares to the base production, and is it kind of along
the lines of Lower 48, or how should we think of it?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, it's not as strong as the Lower 48, because there's still – even with the tax improvements
in Alaska, higher tax we're seeing in Alaska than there is in the Lower 48. The Alaska production is all oil, which helps
on the cash margin side as well. Where you think about something like Eagle Ford is kind of 60 oil and 20 NGLs and
20 natural gas. So, Alaska is going to also contribute to helping with cash margin – it continues to help with oil
production, probably not as much as increased Lower 48 production.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Okay. Great. That's all I had.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Jim.

<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I have two question, one maybe is a near bit overall picture. Ryan, one of your competitors
Shell, the new CEO is essentially saying that the elephant hunt is risky and want to scale back. Obviously, for the
company of your size, you can't just always go for the single, it won't work? So, that's basically that you have what
internal they consider, the proper allocation of capital how much is your percent of your capital you want to chase those
really high risk big elephant, or how much is that you go for, that's a lower risk and smaller one? And then also,
whether it's capital or production, I mean is there anything you can share on that thinking?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. What I'd say, Paul is that broadly at the higher level in terms of allocation. We think
about, spending about 15% of our capital on the exploration. And we like to do that through the cycles. Now, if we get
success and we start to appraise, we've got a decision that we face about increasing that percentage for appraisal and
keeping an exploration program going. But I'd say, broadly speaking, we're spending about 15% of our capital on
exploration. And we're really kind of value-based as we think about it. I don't go into it trying to overload either
unconventional or conventional. And today, our program is pretty balanced. It's about...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Yeah.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: 50-50 conventional and unconventional. But everything has to compete. So, whether it's a new
unconventional play that we might be looking at in other country or here in the U.S. or in North America, it's got to
compete on a cost to supply basis and an expected rate of return. So, if we're doing our risking appropriately, doing our
technical work appropriately everything has got to play. So, I don't really look at it and say, I'm not going to go
elephant hunting or anything like that, we're just trying to do the best technical work we can, risk it the best way we can
and then every dollar competes. So, we're not...
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: I guess, I mean, Ryan, if I could clarify myself. When I say elephant hunting, it's not just for the
exploration. So for example, when you go with Alaskan LNG, if indeed that the project trying not to be economically
viable is going to be extremely expensive? And even the partner that your share is going to be huge. So, there is huge
block, and if anything, happened there is going to be a huge negative impact on the company. And so, those are the
kind of projects, so I'm wondering that if they internally, sell off a percentage of the capital or the production, you want
to be in those big projects?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, I think we look at – we still look at returns and cost of supply and try to ask ourselves is it
competitive in the portfolio. We know that big resource, long-dated projects like Alaska LNG that you referred to are
similar to what we're executing in Queensland or what we're doing in the oil sands of Canada. Both have a different
profile, different return profile than unconventionals in North America; but again this is the part where we think a
diversified large global E&P company with the balance sheet like we have is important because there is a place in the
portfolio for some of those projects to balance it out.
Over time, they reduce capital intensity and they have a place in the portfolio. But we have to be careful. We have to
look at the other alternative investments and the other options and choices we have in the portfolio. And we haven't
made that decision on Alaska gas, because we're still studying it and we're still trying to understand what that cost is
going to look like, what the economics, how it competes in the global marketplace for LNG and how it competes in our
portfolio.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. And the second question is for Matt. Matt, on Eagle Ford, based on your previous
production chart from this point on that the growth is really going to slow down. But I guess my question is, is that just
being ultra-conservative or indeed you think that is the most likely base case scenario? Should we be more aggressively
trying to shift and increase the activity in either Bakken or in the Permian?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah. So, we're going to give you an update on that, Paul, when we get together in April for
the Analyst Day. That was a view of how production would be likely to move in the Eagle Ford. Our view has been
changed. We were going to show you something that's a bit more optimistic than that in April.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Blake Fernandez of Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Folks, good afternoon. I'm sorry to ask you to repeat the guidance. But I just wanted to make
sure and be 100% clear. I thought I heard a first quarter guidance number and then a full-year. And I was hoping you
could just repeat that if you don't mind?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yeah, the first quarter guidance, Blake, was 1,490 MBOE to 1,530 MBOE a day for the first
quarter...
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Yeah.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: And as I said that's really – there's quite a wide range of uncertainty there because of the
ramp-up of new projects that are going to be happening in that quarter. And this also would be affected by the
downtime in one of the Qatar LNG trends. And so that was the first quarter.
And our full year guidance is basically unchanged from what we've been seeing at 1.55 million barrels a day for the
year. And all of those numbers I just gave you exclude Libya.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. And Matt, just to be clear because I know, you had some weather-related impact in the
Lower 48 in 4Q, obviously, we've seen some pretty rough weather this past week. Does that contemplate anything you
may be witnessing currently for 1Q?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That range includes some uncertainty in any weather impacts that we'll see for the remainder
of the quarter.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. Great. The second question I had for you, this may be a bit premature, but on pre-salt
Angola, I know you'll begin drilling this year. Some of your peers who have had success and ended up having some
gas, basically the fiscal terms from what I understand didn't really contemplate monetizing gas. Are you trying to
proactively get ahead of maybe kind of reevaluating your contracts with the government or are you just taking a
wait-and-see approach there?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: We don't have gas rates, within those two blocks, blocks 36 and 37. And the way that we
model the petroleum system there, we don't expect to find gas. The way we model the maturity of the source rock, our
expectation is that we will find oil, if we find anything, it's still exploration in this program. So, we're still hopeful for
that. We have our blocks. There's quite a thick salt section above the structures and the effect of that is that it cools the
source rock which means the source rock is less mature, not to get too technical on it. But nonetheless, we expect that
that's going to be an oily petroleum system prospect.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Okay. Good to hear. Thank you.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: I'm not sure who wants to take this one, but if you go to slide 7 in your book. I'm wondering if
you could give us a little bit of help with the puts and takes on how you see 2014. So 1.55 million BOE per day,
guidance, I'm really looking at last two bars, the decline in the growth because what I'm really trying to get to is the
composition of the decline in terms of gas in particular, obviously that's when you look at your realized margin, I'm
guessing that would be a big help, because there is a lot of gas in there. So, if you could help me with the puts and
takes. Then I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Doug, this is Ellen here. Love to take this kind of offline with you. We've got the data that
could help here, but I don't have it at my fingertips. Obviously, in the 177,000 per day, quite a bit of – our North
American gas is declining, of course. And obviously in the 207,000 BOE per day, the growth we show on that page,
that's the liquids ramp in the unconventional.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I think, Doug, your question is probably more looking forward to 2014, right?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yeah, yeah, it's pretty much for 2014. I'm trying to get a feel for the underlying decline on the
mix and underlying decline.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah. I don't think that's data we've got really at our fingertips right now.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: At our fingertips.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Directionally, we're going to see the same type of things. We're going to continue to grow more
liquids production than gas production as we ramp up oil production in Malaysia as we continue to grow the
unconventionals, that the oil sands continue to grow. So, you'll see a lot of the same things in 2014. We probably have
to – I'm not sure if we've got that information or if that's something we can probably give you more detail on in April...
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: At the aAalyst Meeting.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: ...when we do the Analyst Meeting.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Yeah, that's great. I'll pick it offline. My follow-up, though, is kind of related, I guess, but
hopefully, you can help me with this one, Jeff, but if I look at the mix of the projects coming online, it looks to us at
least that there's a fair number of them that will not incur cash taxes at least in the early years of production.
And I'm just wondering if you could help offer some color and particularly things like escrow bid. Basically, you came
in all the feedstock, I'm guessing. You won't be paying cash taxes in the early years. I'm just wondering if you could
confirm that, and maybe put some numbers around that. And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yeah, let me just mention a few things and we'll see if that helps. So if you think about where
our capital's going in the Lower 48, a lot of it's going into drilling. A lot of that capital is IDCs, and which, of course,
get very rapid depreciation. Norway, you get rapid depreciation, the UK you get essentially almost immediate
depreciation on your capital. So directionally, you're right on all of those.
The way that manifests itself in kind of our results is just what you see on the deferred tax line on the cash flow
statement. You've seen that that was a pretty significant source of positive cash in 2013, a little bit less so in the fourth
quarter than in the other quarters, but there were some impacts of how the impairments that we took in the fourth
quarter rolled through the cash flow statement that ebbs and flows impacts. You would have seen a similar number in
the fourth quarter to what you saw in the previous quarter.
So, it was a pretty substantial impact positive to cash. That'll probably continue on into 2014, but I don't have a number
that I can give you that's exactly what that impact is going to be. But that's where it shows up for us, how much of it
add back to your deferred tax on your cash flow statement.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: And that's embedded in your reported cash margins, Jeff?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No. It's not. The way we do a cash margin calculation is just simply an adjusted net income plus
your amortizations, plus your DD&A and your dry hole cost and your leasehold amortization. So, we don't factor in

deferred tax into that. So, if we take a rather, kind of a simplified approach to cash margins and we do that because
that's the kind of metric we can have a comparison against other companies with.

Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate the guidance on margin growth and production growth. I
was also wondering, whether you guys have sort of goals on return on capital employed and what those looks like
underneath, sort of the assumptions you have for 2014 and for that matter even going forward?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: So our return on capital employed for 2013 is pretty similar to what we saw in 2012. And it'll
be a bit challenge to improve return on capital employed in a very near term. A lot of that has to do with the fact we've
got large capital going into projects that are not really producing much right now, if you think about APLNG, some of
the oil sands assets.
And also due to the fact that as Matt mentioned in his remarks, we were relatively conservatively booked on a lot of the
unconventionals, which leads to some pretty high DD&A rates on the unconventionals. And all those things kind of
impact net income, which of course impacts return on capital employed.
You'll see a better picture for us once APLNG starts up, when Surmont starts up and once we get a little bit more fully
booked on the unconventionals. So yeah, we do see that we'll be improving returns on capital employed. Of course,
prices can affect that metric as they change. But those improvements are probably more in a 2016-2017 kind of
timeframe.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. And just on Alaska, so I understand it's kind of early to figure out what the
cost of this project would be, what type of capital are you spending right now on it, and what are the – what sort of the
critical sort of timelines, or sort of time post, in order for this to sort of move forward or even gain some traction?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I assume you're talking about APLNG?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Yes. Yes.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. So, as you know, we've selected the concept, we've selected the site, we just announced
an HOA with a – that puts the structure in place for the project, and we're hopeful we'll start pre-FEED in the second
quarter.
Right now, it looks like a project that will be somewhere between $45 billion and $65 billion, and that's got some
movement, different scope and so on, but that sort of scale. And it'll be something around the 17 million tons per
annum since three chains there.
And the timeline that we're working with just now is that we would make a final investment decision in 2016 or 2017.
There's quite a bit of FEED required for a project of this scale, and between the pre-FEED and the FEED that will be
2016 or 2017 before we make a final investment decision. And first gas would be 2022 to 2025. So, that's the sort of
range that we're thinking about just now for the project.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.

you reiterated the 3% to 5% volume growth, 3% to 5% margin expansion. Can we walk through here where the margin
expansion should be? From at least my growth assumptions, it's more of a second half 2014 event, but I just kind of
wanted to hear what your take is on that?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: I think that's probably a fair assumption. As Matt mentioned earlier, as we think about volumes
overall for 2014, the impact of timing on start-ups at some of these key major projects is going to be a question.
I think like some of the previous questions that I've gotten too. The same kind of things that drove margin growth this
year are going to be the things, the drivers next year as we continue to ramp up oil sands production ramp up, Lower 48
production and get to a full production in Gumusut, which because of the way the production recovery works there, had
some really strong cash part and so you'll see those real same, three drivers.
North America natural gas probably won't grow in our portfolio going forward. We could see a slowing of decline in
Alaska, but overall that's probably not going to cause margins to move significantly. So, it's really back to the same
primary drivers that we've had this year, going to be drivers in 2014 as well.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: With the same reductions in the gas side, so Europe, Lower 48, some of the lower margin gas
is not getting capital investment, Roger. It starts to decline, so it's that mix that Jeff described in his remarks.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. So, it's safe to assume that margin is sort of a full-year event in the production. Like I
said, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but at least in my assumption on project startups, more of a second half
event is a good way to look at it.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. And really with cash margins on a metric like that, we try to warn every quarter that,
that can swing up and down, because income and DD&A can be less than perfectly ratable through the year for
different reasons. So, we think it's important as we go forward that we talk about just kind of how we're progressing on
more longer term measures than just looking at it quarter-to-quarter.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. And while I know you don't give quarterly production, the last question I had was last
year, especially in the summer months, a lot of turnaround activity had a pretty significant impact on production
volumes. Can you kind of characterize for us this year what we would be anticipating in terms of maintenance and
turnarounds?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes. In 2014, we're expecting about 20% more planned downtime than we had in 2013. And
we've got a downtime that I mentioned in QG3 [indiscernible] (56:41) in the first quarter. We have turnarounds in
Prudhoe Bay in the second and third quarter, turnarounds in the UK in the second and third quarter and a big
turnaround in the Bayu-Undan Field in Australia in the third quarter. So, we're expecting our overall planned downtime
to be about 20% more than it was in 2012.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: 2013.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: In 2013, sorry.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Roger.
