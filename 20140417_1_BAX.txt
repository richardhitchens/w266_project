Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.
Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning. Thank you all for calling in. As you read in the press release issued earlier this
morning, Baxter reported strong financial results for the first quarter, which exceeded expectations and we've also
confirmed our full-year 2014 guidance.
Adjusted earnings increased 9% to $1.19 per diluted share, and worldwide sales, excluding currency, increased 16%.
Excluding Gambro and foreign currency, Baxter sales advanced 5%. Positive momentum is building and Baxter is off
to a strong start in 2014. I'm pleased that we delivered strong financial results, continued to enhance our flexibility to
invest for future growth and position the company for sustained performance and success.
Our new product pipeline is focused on a number of programs that improve the quality of care and address key high
potential areas of unmet medical needs. Some recent highlights in the quarter include: FDA approval of a label change
allowing for a shorter total infusion time for GLASSIA, a chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy for hereditary
emphysema, an underdiagnosed condition characterized by a low level of alpha-1 protein in the blood. This change
enhances convenience and allows for less overall time for the entire infusion process, from preparation to
administration.
Also a success in meeting the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III study of BAX 111, the first standalone
recombinant treatment and clinical development for von Willebrand disease for on-demand bleeding events. We expect
to file for regulatory approval in the United States before the end of 2014. We also intend to pursue a study for a
prophylaxis indication.
Baxter also presented interim data at the European Association for Hemophilia and Allied Disorders from our first year
of observation from the ADVATE Hemophilia A Database study, a four-year outcomes registry of hemophilia A
patients. A total of 562 patients have been enrolled to date and the data supports the clinical experience of prophylaxis
treatment with ADVATE, showing 51% experienced no bleeds during the one year of treatment.
Also in the quarter, we executed a new exclusive agreement with Xenetic Biosciences for the development of BAX
826, a recombinant Factor VIII therapy for hemophilia A, utilizing Xenetic's proprietary polysialic acid technology.
BAX 826 is currently in preclinical development as a treatment that may be administered less frequently, potentially at
once weekly intervals, without compromising efficacy.
And lastly during the quarter, the company acquired Chatham Therapeutics, including their developmental gene
therapy preclinical hemophilia A and ongoing hemophilia B programs and the potential application for additional
hemophilia treatments. As you may recall Baxter and Chatham are currently in a Phase I/II trial evaluating Chatham's
biological nanoparticle platform as a potential treatment for hemophilia B. The vector-based technology, which
provides a mechanism for the patient's own liver to begin producing Factor IX following a single dose of the
genetically engineered treatment, has the potential to redefine the concept of longer-acting therapy.
And finally in the first quarter as you all know, we reached a significant milestone in our company's history with the
announcement of our plans to create two separate independent global healthcare companies; one focused on developing
and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life saving medical products. This decision supports
Baxter's evolution and underscores our commitment to ensuring our long-term strategic priorities remain aligned with
shareholders' best interests, while creating value for patients, healthcare providers and other key stakeholders.
The two businesses operate in distinct markets with corresponding underlying fundamentals. And each possesses
unique and compelling growth prospects, investment requirements and risk profiles. The spin-off will create two
well-capitalized independent companies with strong balance sheets, investment grade profiles and disciplined
approaches to capital allocation.

And other benefits of this include, one, greater management focus on the distinct businesses of biopharmaceuticals and
medical products; the ability to more effectively commercialize new and existing product offerings; the ability to drive
innovation across the franchises and allocate necessary resources to the areas presenting the highest growth potential;
and the flexibility to pursue respective growth and investment strategies resulting in revenue acceleration, improved
profitability and enhanced returns.
We look forward to closing this transaction by mid-2015. And preparations are already being made to effect an
efficient and orderly transition to position both companies to capitalize on the exciting opportunities that the future
holds.
So with that I'd like to ask Bob at this point to review financial results for the first quarter and also discuss our guidance
for the remainder of 2014. Bob?
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned adjusted earnings per diluted share in the first quarter
advanced 9% to $1.19, which exceeded our previously issued guidance range of $1.06 to $1.09 per share. These
financial results include an after-tax gain of $35 million or $0.06 per share, associated with the sale of certain equity
investments, which will largely be re-invested in the business over the balance of the year.
As we mentioned in the press release GAAP earnings of $1.01 per diluted share included after-tax special items
totaling $96 million or $0.18 per share for intangible asset amortization and costs associated with the integration of
Gambro, business development and business optimization initiatives. The business optimization initiatives include
additional costs related to the decision to explore strategic options for the vaccines and cell therapies R&D programs.
Now let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item before turning to the financial outlook for 2014. Starting
with sales, worldwide sales of approximately $4 billion advanced 15%. On a constant currency basis sales rose 16%
and exceeded our guidance range, primarily due to strong demand for hemophilia products, as well as the accelerated
timing of vaccine milestone payments and a renal PD tender. Excluding Gambro revenues of $400 million, which were
in line with expectations, Baxter sales rose 5% on a constant currency basis.
In terms of individual business performance global BioScience sales of more than $1.6 billion advanced 5% in the first
quarter. On a constant currency basis sales increased 6%.
Within the product categories hemophilia sales of $827 million increased 8% or 9% on a constant currency basis. This
is the result of capitalizing on our global leadership position and brand differentiation, broadening our portfolio with
new product launches like RIXUBIS for the treatment of hemophilia B and expanding access to care, particularly in
emerging markets.
Specifically global demand for ADVATE remains strong as we continue to benefit from our label expansion, improved
prophylaxis penetration and shipments to Brazil as part of our ongoing collaboration with Hemobras to enhance access
to recombinant Factor VIII therapy. We've now converted more than 30% of the total patients in Brazil. And we expect
to generate sales of more than $100 million in 2014. In addition global demand for FEIBA also remains robust,
resulting in double-digit sales growth in the quarter.
In BioTherapeutics sales of $502 million declined 1% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Growth in the
U.S. of 7% was a result of improved product availability and growth of immunoglobulin therapies, albumin and alpha-1
treatments. This strength was more than offset by lower sales in international markets as a result of lower albumin sales
in China and decisions to exit certain markets due to previous supply constraints.
Sales in BioSurgery of $176 million increased 2%. On a constant currency basis sales rose 3% driven by demand for
surgical sealants like TISSEEL and FLOSEAL. As you know growth of these products is tied directly to growth in
surgical procedures.

Finally, vaccine revenues totaled $103 million and increased 23%. Sales advanced 25% on a constant currency basis,
driven primarily by accelerated milestone payments of approximately $40 million related to ongoing government
collaborations for the development of influenza vaccines.
In Medical Products global sales exceeded $2.3 billion and increased 22%. On a constant currency basis sales advanced
24%. Excluding Gambro and foreign currency Medical Products sales grew 4%.
Within the product categories renal sales totaled $991 million, including Gambro sales of $400 million. Excluding
Gambro and foreign currency renal sales increased 4%. This was a result of strong PD growth of 9% supported by
strong patient gains in the U.S. and emerging markets, as well as a benefit from the timing of certain tender sales of
more than $15 million. This momentum was partially offset by the divestiture of the CRRT business.
Sales in the fluid system category of $757 million increased 2% or 3% on a constant currency basis. Performance
continues to be driven by price improvements for the injectable oncology drug, cyclophosphamide, which more than
offsets lower sales of drug delivery systems.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies posted sales of $367
million, reflecting an increase of 1%. Sales rose 2% on a constant currency basis, as strong global anesthesia growth
offset lower sales of certain nutritional therapies resulting from ongoing supplier shortages.
Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $228 million with growth of
1% on a reported basis or 4% on a constant currency basis. This performance can be attributed primarily to the easing
of supply constraints which impacted orders and shipments in the first quarter last year.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter was 51.0% compared to 51.7% last year. Margin expansion
in the base Baxter business was more than offset by the impact of lower margin Gambro business and foreign currency.
SG&A totaled $903 million and increased 16% with the Gambro acquisition accounting for the vast majority of the
growth. Excluding Gambro, SG&A increased 2%, as leverage was derived from benefits associated with our business
optimization initiatives. This was partially offset by select investments and promotional and marketing initiatives for
new product launches and within international markets to enhance our global presence.
R&D spending in the quarter of $282 million increased 15% versus the prior year. Excluding Gambro, R&D rose 2%
and continues to be driven by investments we are making to advance a number of programs in our pipeline, including
those in our leading hemophilia franchise, programs to leverage our expertise in the therapeutic areas of hematology,
oncology and immunology, and investments in renal therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes across the
continuum of care.
The operating margin in the quarter of 21% is lower than last year's operating margin of 22%. However, excluding
Gambro, leverage in the base Baxter business resulted in an operating margin improvement of 80 basis points to 22.8%
versus the prior year.
Interest expense was $43 million, which reflects recent debt issuances to fund both the Covington plasma
manufacturing site and the Gambro acquisition. Other income totaled $41 million compared to income of $30 million
last year. This includes $44 million of pre-tax gains associated with the sale of certain equity investments. As
referenced earlier on an after-tax basis, this equates to a benefit of $35 million or $0.06 per share which will largely be
re-invested in the business over the balance of the year. The tax rate was 21.4% for the quarter, in line with our
expectations and as previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share advanced 9% to $1.19.
For the first quarter, cash flow from operations was very strong and totaled $559 million. This reflects an improvement
versus last year of approximately $175 million. DSO ended the quarter at 53.6 days and excluding Gambro, Baxter's
DSO was 49.9 days, lower than the prior year by 3.7 days.
Inventory turns of 2.0 are lower than 2.2 turns in the prior year period due to increased plasma inventories to support
strong demand and future growth. Lastly, in the first three months of this year, we repurchased approximately 3.7
million shares for $250 million or on a net basis, 1.2 million shares for $123 million, in line with our full-year

objective.
Finally, let me conclude my comments this morning by providing our financial outlook for the second quarter and full
year 2014. For the full year, we continue to expect adjusted earnings of $5.05 to $5.25 per diluted share. As we noted
last quarter, we're providing a wider range than our historical practice as a number of factors and assumptions impact
the outlook, particularly, headwinds created by cyclophosphamide competition and emerging market FX volatility.
Specifically by line item of the P&L and starting with sales we continue to expect growth, excluding the impact of
foreign currency, of approximately 9% to 10%, which includes annual sales of more than $1.6 billion for Gambro. At
current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 8% to 9%.
Excluding Gambro, we expect the base Baxter sales to grow approximately 2% on a constant currency basis. For the
full year, we continue to expect gross margins for the company to decline by approximately 150 basis points from the
2013 margin of 52%. Given the strong first quarter, we expect the first half margin to be approximately 40 basis points
to 50 basis points higher than the gross margin in the second half, which includes the impact of new competitive
entrants. In terms of expenses, as mentioned earlier, our first quarter performance enhances our flexibility to invest in
the business to drive future growth. Therefore, we now expect R&D to grow in mid single digits and SG&A to grow in
mid to high single digits.
We expect interest expense to total approximately $160 million, and we now expect other income of approximately $40
million for the year. We expect a tax rate of approximately 21.5%, and we expect a full-year average share count of
approximately 547 million shares, which assumes approximately $300 million in net share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, we continue to expect to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.5
billion. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we
are making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.
Let me move to sales and expand on our assumptions for the two businesses and the major product categories, which
are very consistent with our original guidance. Beginning with Medical Products, on a constant currency basis,
including the contribution of Gambro, we expect sales growth of approximately 13% to 14%.
Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 0% to 1%. Specifically, we expect renal sales to
grow approximately 40%, including the benefit of continued PD penetration, the incremental revenue contribution from
Gambro, as well as commercial synergies.
We expect fluid systems sales to decline 3% to 5%, reflecting the impact of lower cyclophosphamide sales. As we
mentioned, if we have two competitors by mid-year, the sales [indiscernible] (19:00) impact would equate to $150
million to $200 million.
We expect Specialty Pharmaceutical sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics, to grow in
the 3% to 5% range. And we now expect our BioPharma Solutions sales to be flat for the full year. For BioScience, we
project sales growth, excluding foreign currency, at 3% to 4%. Our outlook includes growth of 4% to 5% in our
hemophilia franchise.
While we continue to expect increased competition for recombinant Factor VIII therapies in the second half of this
year, performance will be fueled by underlying global demand for ADVATE, convergence of recombinant therapy in
Brazil, new tender awards, as well as a benefit from new product launches including RIXUBIS, OBI-1 and FEIBA
prophylaxis.
For the BioTherapeutics franchise, we continue to expect growth of approximately 4%, with sales of albumin in China
and immunoglobulin therapies ramping up, particularly in the second half of the year. In BioSurgery, we expect growth
in the 5% to 7% range. And finally, given the first quarter performance, we now expect our vaccine sales to decline in
low single-digits.
As mentioned in our press release, for the second quarter, we expect earnings per diluted share, excluding special items,
of $1.18 to $1.22, which reflects the timing benefits that were accelerated and recorded in the first quarter. We expect

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] So that we may be respectful
of everyone's time, please limit your comments to one question with one follow-up question, if necessary. We
appreciate everyone's patience and would like to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question.
We will pause for a moment while the list is being compiled. I would like to remind participants that this call is being
recorded and a digital replay will be available on Baxter International's website for 30 days at www.baxter.com. Our
first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Bob, just let me start off on the financial guidance for the second quarter.
Obviously, a very nice start to the first quarter here on earnings; some was the gain, but just the underlying business
was stronger and margins were good. Can you talk to us about what factors changed here in the second quarter, because
that earnings number is a little lower than we would have expected, considering the strength in the first quarter?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Certainly, David. There are definitely an unusual number of timing impacts here that have
benefited the first quarter to the detriment of the second quarter. And I would gauge that in the $0.05 to $0.06 range.
So, let me walk you through those. It's really two main things. We have a collaboration on the vaccine side to do a tech
transfer related to our vero cell technology. We expected a milestone to occur later in the year, including in the second
quarter. The good news is those were completed a bit early and fully recognized in the first quarter, but that does create
about $0.03 of upside in the first quarter at the expense of the second quarter.
And then secondly, again, along the lines of revenue recognition in terms of timing of when tender sales occur, we had
a large tender in the PD franchise that we expected in the second that occurred in the first. So, the combination of those
two and a couple other things really is what drove the strong performance in the first quarter.
I would also mention though, as you know the gains in the first quarter that we highlighted there of $0.06 related to the
two minority investments that were sold, we also incurred incremental FX in the first quarter that dampened the impact
of some of these timing benefits, primarily related to Argentina and other emerging market impacts, including related
to the Gambro business.
So a lot going on between the first and second quarter. I think if you look at the two of them combined it will give you
a better sense of where we're at and that's largely why if we look at the full-year, we've maintained our full-year
guidance. Again a lot of volatility potentially yet ahead of us with cyclo and FX, but operationally a very, very solid
start.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And David, I would also add that in plasma we have some plasma tender timing as well that
impacts the second quarter versus the prior year. Those tenders are going to occur more in the third and fourth quarter
this year versus some of the major tenders that occurred in the second quarter last year.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Thanks, Mary Kay. Very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up. The key strength here
we've seen the last couple quarters has been the hemophilia, and I imagine that's a surprise for certain investors. So if
we think about that strength in hemophilia the last two quarters, obviously it's coming out of the OUS markets.
And there's really two factors going on this quarter it feels like. One is Brazil, and there may be some of the early
product launches like RIXUBIS. But you talked about Brazil being about $100 million in 2014. Frankly based on the
trendline out of 2013 and the first quarter result, $100 million just seems low. So is there anything going on in terms of
the timing of Brazil? Or maybe you can give us the mix of the factors contributing to OUS hemophilia strength here in

the first quarter? Because it seems like that $100 million number could go a lot higher here in 2014.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah. It could go somewhat higher, David. I would tell you in the first quarter though, the
contribution from Brazil was not outsized in the sense of what the trend would need to be in order for us to deliver
something just north of $100 million. So we're very pleased with the progress we're making. And so that certainly is a
contributor. But frankly ADVATE continues to do well in many other international markets, including markets like
Japan where we've had very strong growth over the last couple of years.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: [indiscernible] (25:22) clarifications on the guidance. It looks like you took another price
increase, about 30%, on cyclophosphamide in January. Can you just maybe clarify what you're assuming in the second
quarter relative to competition? I haven't seen anybody announce anything. Just want to clarify what you're assuming.
And then second with the guidance for the year, I assume you weren't assuming the $0.06 gain in the original guidance.
So why shouldn't we move that number by $0.06, given the gain you had this quarter? Thanks.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Okay a couple things. So on cyclo I'd like to first point out we in our Q1 guidance did not
assume any competition, nor did we see any competition. And results in the first quarter were basically as expected. So
cyclo was not a contributor to outperformance in the first quarter relative to our guidance.
At this point we're not expecting a competitor to enter until very late in the second quarter, so not much impact in the
second quarter either. But certainly in the back half then, depending on when the second and/or third enters in, that will
determine how that plays out for the remainder of the year. But for the second quarter again not expecting a significant
competitive impact on cyclo.
As to the price increase we did take a price increase. Obviously there are different channels and different customer
relationships, so I wouldn't say it was across the board at the same level. But we did take a price increase in the first
quarter.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And then the gain, Bob.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Oh as it relates to the gain. Yes. And so as I mentioned there are some offsets here as
well in the first quarter, FX being one. But as we look at the balance of the year in some of the areas that we want to
ensure we position ourselves to generate the best success, we are looking at R&D and SG&A re-investment here that
over the balance of the year, we're not going to be taking that gain to the bottom line.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And we did change our guidance, Mike, for...
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: [ph] Let me ask a different (27:12) question for Bob Parkinson, and I really want to focus
on strategy for the Medical Products side of the business [ph] as opposed to then (27:20). Can you just talk a little bit
about what drives that business? And I'm really thinking not only about the top line, but about margins. Obviously
there's going to be a big reset the next let's say two months with cyclophosphamide going away. But once that's done
what drives not only top line, but what drives margins there? And what creates kind of a story beyond this kind of the
underlying growth we're seeing right now? Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah okay, Mike. So let me not be too lengthy in my response, because there's not a
simple response there. Let me start with the Gambro acquisition, which as we discussed before allows us to participate
in a leadership role in a large global market that we believe will grow in the 5% to 6% range long term.
And so the acquisition of Gambro, the expansion of our presence, augmenting our PD business to address treatment of
end-stage renal disease is a significant, long-term growth platform for the newly-defined Medical Products business.

But I think you all understand that.
Within the traditional medication delivery business if you will, again our plans are to intensify focus in those product
categories that are higher growth and higher margin. So anesthesia would be one, parenteral nutrition would be another.
Also there continue to be opportunities to improve margins in our core global IV business in terms of manufacturing
efficiencies, productivity, supply chain productivity and the like.
So, again, there's not a simple answer to that. I think there's a lot of levers, Mike, that can be pulled to enhance margin
over the long term in the newly-defined Baxter, if you will, going forward. And I would also say that as we've
accelerated business development activity over the last couple years, certainly it is our plan to continue that as we go
forward with the new company. So I think the – I think with increased focus, which is one of the primary rationales
behind the decision to spin off the biopharmaceuticals business, with that increased focus globally, frankly, I think will
allow us to address a number of margin improvement opportunities over time.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Great. Thank you, Bob.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Bruce, are you there?
Operator
Please check your mute button, sir. And we'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Larry
Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Larry S. Keusch>: Hi, good morning. Just two perhaps for Bob Hombach. You obviously mentioned in your
prepared comments that the underlying Baxter gross margin has been improving, I believe, you said up 80 basis points
year-over-year. So I just wanted to dig into that and fully understand what is driving those improvements there because
that's pretty impressive. And then secondly, if we could just get an update on where you guys stand with the large
volume infusion pumps.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Sure. So, yeah, the comment was around operating margin, and there's obviously a
number of factors there in the base Baxter business, holding FX to the side, which tended to be more of a headwind the
last couple of quarters. Mix certainly plays into that, strong hemophilia sales here for the quarter. The business
optimization efforts that we've put in, not only this year but last year as well are certainly playing into that. The vaccine
milestones come with fairly high margins as well, so those being recognized here in the first quarter were beneficial as
well. And we are starting to see the benefits of the Gambro synergies starting to come into the P&L. I know we're
talking about the base Baxter business, but overall, that is something that is going to drive our margin throughout the
rest of the year.
<Q - Larry S. Keusch>: Okay, great. And then on the pumps side, where do we stand there?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: So updates on the pumps is we had filed the necessary documents and are waiting for the
review to be complete and we expect to hear something by the middle of this year. So I don't think there's really any
other update at this point.
<Q - Larry S. Keusch>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask just, Bob, if I could – Bob Hombach, on the gain and
FX loss. You mentioned the incremental FX kind of offsetting the gain. I guess we were looking for about a dime of
FX impact this year. Does this push you closer to $0.15 or can you give us any more color on to just how that offsets
that number? And then I have a couple of quick follow-ups.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, so, Matt, actually we characterize more like a $0.15 – at the time we gave guidance
for the full year, we had FX at about a $0.15 headwind, and in fact, it's going to be a little bit higher than that, given the
Argentina situation as well as how things are playing out.
The thing I would note about FX is historically, a stronger euro would be beneficial to Baxter, given the size of our
business there and our overall global manufacturing footprint. As we bring Gambro into the fold, though, the vast
majority of their manufacturing, a lot of their cost base is in euro, and so we benefit less from a stronger euro in the
near term, but it did increase our exposure to all other currencies outside the U.S., given the footprint they have. And so
as emerging market currencies have continued to struggle a bit, our current set-up here with Gambro, given the stronger
euro and the weaker emerging market currencies, actually creates incremental FX downside to that original $0.15
assumption.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: That's helpful. And then the other comment I think to Bob or one of you made here in the
beginning of the call was around sort of synergies or sort of the broad portfolio of hemophilia products. Of course,
FEIBA launching in the quarter, prophy FEIBA and OUS strength. I guess, can you tell us a little bit about anything
that – any sort of synergy effect of launching these multiple therapies into this general category, whether it's for
hemophilia B, hemophilia A or the treatment of inhibitors as in FEIBA, that you're seeing develop in the market either
in the U.S. or internationally? And then I have just one last quick one.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Okay, sure.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Why don't you...yeah...
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So a couple of things. So I want to come back to the comment that was made on the strong
demand ex-U.S. for hemophilia. I must add to that we also continue to see a strong demand for ADVATE and FEIBA
in the U.S., and that although it's not reflected in the sales numbers since there were some inventory adjustments versus
first quarter of last year, so we stick to our full guidance and we believe that the U.S. is also showing a very strong
demand.
As far as the launches is concerned, the launches are staggered geographically. RIXUBIS is, at this moment, a U.S.
launch only. As you know, we submitted the application end of last year, both in Europe as well as Japan. And so we
expect to launch RIXUBIS ex-U.S. by beginning the 2015. As far as the launches are concerned, so ADVATE prophy
is on track. We launched it in 2012. We have more than 500 patients converted. FEIBA prophy is on track. We
launched it at the beginning of this year, and it is ahead of expectations and it's also reflected in our numbers. And the
RIXUBIS launch, as I said, in the U.S., is on track. We've converted quite some patients. So we're really pleased with
the launches in the hemophilia franchise.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Great. And then, Ludwig, the last one actually is for you. Just if you – we are all looking at
competition or the threat of competition in the back half hemophilia, and of course, also to some top line indication of
the BAX 855 data, hopefully around mid-year or third quarter. And I'm just wondering, you said before that if you did
receive an inhibitor event in that data that you would announce it as you received it or shortly thereafter. If you could
help us understand with the trial fully enrolled, in say November or whenever it was, just how far along here do we
need to be to feel like – or can we feel like there's any sort of comfort level that, okay, we've gotten this far in without
an inhibitor, inhibitors usually happen in whatever the early part of that therapy. Any color you could provide us as to
whether we should be feeling more comfortable as we get to May or June or July or what's the timing would be very
helpful? Thanks.

<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Yeah, so I'm not going to speculate on the outcome of the study, but as far as timing is
concerned, yes, we did enroll the last patient in the study end of last year. It is a six-month study, so that will give you
some idea of when the last patient, last assessment will be. And correct, we have not seen any inhibitors. We plan to
release the data third quarter of this year with a submission before the end of this year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. First question was on the BioTherapeutics business,
just on the ramp in the back half of the year. Can you maybe just enumerate some of the details that are supporting
that? I presume on albumin it's obtaining the licenses in China. But can you maybe update us on Sanquin as well in that
question?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: With respect to BioT, yes you did see a negative growth for international in the first
quarter. We believe that this is going to change moving forward. We stick to our guidance that we give for the full year
for BioT which is plus 4%. So you will see an uptick in growth in the next quarters. There is an impact of albumin,
especially on China. IG international will pick up also in the next quarters, so that's overall where we are.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, we do expect to start meaningful shipments to China in albumin in the second
quarter, David. We already have one of the two licenses renewed. And so at this rate, we expect to sell almost as much
albumin in China this year as we did last year.
<Q - David H. Roman>: And then the ramp in IG, is that coming from contribution from HyQ or a ramp-up in
production somewhere else?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: It will primarily come from the IG IV business and the subcu business, not HyQ. As we
said, the ramp up for this year for HyQ ex-U.S. as well as U.S. will be minimal, but there will be some contribution.
With respect to your question on Sanquin, Sanquin will not have an impact on the 2014 numbers.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay, great.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: I would just add, David, we didn't expect Sanquin to impact 2014 as the capacity won't
come on until early next year.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Got it. Okay. And then on the renal business, I think you said 4% organic growth and that
included the tender win. And I know it's early in the Gambro integration process, but can you give us some sense as to
what the magnitude of commercial or "revenue synergies" you might be able to realize from that deal going forward
and can that business get to sort of a sustainably, ex these kind of one-time tenders of 4% to 6% growth rate over time?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah, David, it's Bob Parkinson here. First of all, yes, is the answer to the last part of
your question. That clearly is our expectation. It's a little bit early in the game to quantify commercial synergies,
although I would say the first quarter for Gambro in revenue came in virtually spot-on our model. And of course, the
rest of the renal business, the legacy renal business was even stronger than our forecast. And we're beginning to see
early stages of synergies. One example would be certain tenders, where our ability to bid more broadly with product
offerings and all the categories allow us to compete where previously we've been unable to do that.
So we anticipate that we're going to be able to experience more things like that as we go forward, but certainly, the
long-term projections, the growth of Baxter's renal business broadly defined, both the legacy business and Gambro is
going to be very much in line with what I said.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Yeah.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on David's question.
With the Gambro acquisition, I think, Bob, you said $400 million this quarter and PD growth of 9%. Are you seeing
some early cannibalization of your historic hemodialysis business and is there any quantification there?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Well, our historic hemodialysis business is very modest, so I don't think there's any
cannibalization that we're seeing there at all. Bob, I don't know if you have any specifics...
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, there's two things I would say. We did mention that the CRRT divestiture, that was
about a $55 million business that we had to divest as part of closing the deal. So that will be a headwind throughout
2014 from a growth rate perspective.
And while there are some modest impacts because largely our HD business previously was through – was us acting as
the distributor for other parties. And now that we've acquired Gambro, that will tail off over time. But in 2014 no
significant impacts that we're expecting on those relationships.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson, Jr.>: Josh, I think it's important for you and everyone to understand too, that you raised a
question of cannibalization. In terms of our legacy home presence with PD and of course our aspirations to launch our
new home hemodialysis system, we really believe that our broader position resulting from the Gambro acquisition will
actually enhance our ability to penetrate the market on both our traditional PD business as well as support the home HD
launches as those cascade out over time. So we see that as a positive synergistic effect.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: All right. Good. Thanks for that. And then just one for Ludwig just on the BAX 111
approval, can you just help us frame the global von Willebrand factor market? And I'll stop there. Thanks a lot.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Thanks, Josh. And maybe I should correct you. We didn't get approval, but BAX 111...
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Yeah.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Your question was BAX 111, yes. So we just the Phase III results, and we released those
earlier this week. So we're really pleased with the results. The product, a couple of things on the product. It could be the
first recombinant von Willebrand. And we received orphan drug status in U.S. and Europe. It's a pure von Willebrand
molecule with a ratio of 100:1. The Phase III study was very positive, since 100% of the patients had positive response
on the efficacy rating scale, which we've redone with the FDA.
As far as the market is concerned, currently it's a $300 million to $400 million market. It's 100% partner. But I do see a
significant opportunity to grow this market through increased diagnosis, since diagnosis rates are really low, as well as
a prophy use, since the prophy use is really low, it's about 5% in total. And when you look at the type 3 severe patients,
it's only at 20%. So we look at this market as a potential market where we can continue to make a difference in those
patients' lives and increase the value.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify back on Mike's original question. Was the
gain on the sale of the investment contemplated in your guidance that you issued back in January?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No, it's not.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just on...

Page 12 of 14
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Kristen, can I just add to that as well? Because I think Mike's question I tried to jump in.
But we did increase the guidance in terms of our R&D spend. We did have an acquisition in the quarter, Chatham,
which is going to increase some R&D as well as some other things that are planned as we accelerate some programs.
So guidance there went up as well as guidance in SG&A.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And these investments, have you disclosed or is there any filing to show what
exactly you sold and why you sold them? Because I know you guys have had a portfolio of investments.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Well actually these were much older investments going back 12 to 15 years. There were
minority positions we had. The underlying companies made an independent decision to sell. And so we really had no
impact on the timing. And they both happened to happen in the first quarter, and they were sold to private firms.
One of them was GHX, which is an EDI platform that a number of large healthcare companies got together to form a
consortium, again 10, 15 years ago. And so that was recently sold again to a private firm. So that's really the extent of
it.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Right. So the gain was not in your control in terms of the timing of it? It was just simply
these underlying companies were sold that you were [indiscernible] (46:11)?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah we owned less than 10% I think of both. So yeah we had very little say on timing.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Great. And then you had also mentioned, I guess Bob, you had mentioned just kind
of the parenteral nutrition business and your interest there. How do you just think about I guess expanding that
business? Would you consider different acquisitions to kind of bolster up your nutritional franchise? And does I guess
the split-off, I guess in general just make it a little bit more challenging to do M&A over the next year or so?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: I mean there's certainly – in terms of the financial strength clearly we have the ability to
continue the kinds of acquisitions that we've done in the recent past. I actually think in some ways, Kristen, after the
split we might even have more latitude and flexibility to pursue some things. Given the nature of the new Baxter
without the biopharmaceutical business they would be more aligned with expectations of shareholders. So clearly
business development and acquisitions are very much part of our strategy of the new Baxter going forward.
And the area of parenteral nutrition specifically I think is a significantly underpenetrated market globally. And I think
the opportunity there is really more internal investment to cultivate the growth of that market, where as you know we're
a leader in that market today.
Whether specifically there are acquisition candidates within parenteral nutrition, not really going to comment. It isn't
evident to me that there are. But the key thing is the underdeveloped nature of that market and I think with the
increased focus and associated investment and opportunity to accelerate the growth of that product category.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks for bearing with me, phone problems here. Ludwig, you know, it's
been very hard to get an extension of the half-life of Factor VIII and the Xenetic's thing sounds like it's a departure
from that. And could you basically explain why you think it might work and the likelihood of success?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, first of all, this is early stage. This is still preclinical. The PSA, I think you
understand it's a polymer of sialic acid, it's about the same. Maybe the difference here is that it's biodegradable. In our
preclinical studies, it was in monkeys, we showed a prolongation by a factor of more than 2 compared to ADVATE.
But we need to see what it means in the clinic and what is the chances that it will go all the way. I think you know [ph]
the funds (49:14) of biopharmaceuticals in the preclinical, we believe that it has a lot of value, but the proof is in the
pudding and our clinical studies will show if we can repeat the factor 2.

But I want to come back to maybe what is the most important thing here. For us it is a belief it works. And it's not
about extending the half-life. It is about making sure that we have zero bleeds, and you get zero bleeds by factor levels
that are high enough constantly, not during the peaks and it's from that perspective that our approach on gene therapy in
hemophilia, we believe, could be disruptive. And that's why we want to be a leader in that technology as well.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks. And my follow-up is just very tactical. With regard to Sanquin, I know there are
regulatory issues that were out there. How are they looking? Is it likely that this will be coming online in 2015, kind of
in a seamless way as planned?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: Well, we are working with Sanquin on the questions, as much as we can. As we also said,
Sanquin volumes are not reflected in our 2014 numbers. And we believe that the guidance that we gave on our ability
to grow with the market, 6% to 8%, will not be affected for the next couple of years, irrespective of the outcome of
Sanquin. But we believe that we should be able to work with Sanquin through those questions and by next year most
likely have that input.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks so much. .
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: We have time for one more question.
Operator
Yes, ma'am. The final question is from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Just starting with a quick question here, wanted to
have you remind us of your expectations for SUPRANE, generic competition and what is factored in your guidance this
year for that?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: We had a modest competitive impact put into our original guidance. And given the latest
information that we have, we don't expect much of an impact here. So it's largely competitive [indiscernible] (51:46)
out of our guidance here for [ph] SUPRANE (51:48), but the delta between our original guidance and where we're at
today is around $10 million or so. It's not significant.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is for Ludwig. On the long-acting
recombinant Factor VIII market, two things there. One, we see now Phase III data from a number of the other
competitors, Novo as well as Bayer, in addition to Biogen's product. I just wanted to kind of get your reaction now that
we've seen more of the Phase III data come in on just what you think of the long-acting competition, maybe how that
might relate to your product.
And then secondly there, one of the big questions, I think, that's out there is how pricing in the market might change
with the entrant of new competitors, particularly competitors who currently don't have a presence in the market and
wanted to get your thoughts on that as well.
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: So let's start with the pricing question, which is going to be a short answer, so
[indiscernible] (52:50) on that. The market [indiscernible] (52:54), so no comment here.
With respect to your question [ph] on VIII (53:01), maybe a couple of observations, the first one is, we call them
long-acting Factor VIII products. I mentioned it several times, I do believe that these are not long-acting, these are
extended half-life products. The half-life is still shorter than one day, shorter than our RIXUBIS half-life and I would
not call RIXUBIS a long-acting product. So, that's number one.
Number two is the – what the data shows consistently is that when we're pushing the dosing regimen towards five or
seven days, that the data consistently shows that the ABR, the annual bleed rate [ph] improves (53:47). And then, we
shouldn't ask ourselves the question, are we doing the right thing for the patient here? Again, this is a bleeding disorder
with the objective of zero bleeds and it's not an infusion disorder.

Page 14 of 14
So my answer is that I do believe that we are on track with what we're doing with BAX 855. That it is based on the
added molecule that is proven, that is shown to be preventative, that is shown to have consistent factor level data
irrespective of the assay that's being used and I believe that we have a very strong platform to work from. I really feel
comfortable with the BAX 855 approach.
In addition to that, as I mentioned, I believe that gene therapy could be disruptive. We are post proof of concept in
hemophilia B. And with the new acquisition, we are on the lead from a gene therapy perspective across the board,
broader than B. So I'm really comfortable with our strategy. The data, as I said, for BAX 855 will get [indiscernible]
(55:00).
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Ludwig, do you expect this class of extended half-life products to expand prophylaxis use in
hemophilia A, and how much does it expand market growth?
<A - Ludwig N. Hantson>: I would say the prophy penetration will increase irrespective of the extended half-life
products. We've seen a significant uptick since we launched ADVATE prophy. You should know that our label shows
up to three, every three days. And more than 50% of our patients are on three days or longer dosing regimens. So,
irrespective of the entry of the extended half-life products, I do believe that the prophy segment will increase over time.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. Thank you very much.
