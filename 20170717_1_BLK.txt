MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated second quarter 2017 earnings teleconference. Our host for today's call will be
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer Gary S. Shedlin, President, Robert S.
Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade.
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Christopher J. Meade
Thank you. This is Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking
statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these
statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017. Before I
turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our
earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted
results.
BlackRock's globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider
of choice to both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and
efficiently reinvest in our investment and risk management franchises in order to provide increased value to both clients
and shareholders over time.
As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth
accelerated in the second quarter. Total quarterly inflows exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types,
asset classes and investment styles, highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform which includes
cash, market cap-weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high
conviction alpha strategies, and illiquid alternatives.
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized
organic asset growth rate of 7%. Annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12
months, despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last nine months.
Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6%
higher than a year ago, and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected
$26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current
quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter.
Our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable
projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of
additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year.
Second quarter base fees rose 7% year over year, driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market
appreciation on average AUM, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously
announced pricing changes not reflected in last year's second quarter. While the dollar has recently given up gains
versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year
base fee growth by about 1%. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue
in the second quarter, which increased 11% driven by seasonality and higher on-loan balances.
Last month, at the Morgan Stanley conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and
FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have
achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second
quarter with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has
stabilized, and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent.
Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year, due to weaker relative performance in
long-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $164
million increased 12% year over year, driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins.
Market demand remained strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for
Wealth Management, Provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk
analytics, portfolio construction and scalable distribution tools, and our first three Aladdin Risk for Wealth
Management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter.
In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we
announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash
management process for corporate treasury clients, and a minority investment in Scalable Capital, one of the
fastest-growing digital investment managers in Europe. Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe

BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses, while simultaneously benefiting from their
unique capabilities.
The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we've made in our business over
time. And we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future. Expense increased 6% year over
year and 3% sequentially, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense, as a result of higher average AUM and
higher G&A expense.
Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million or 2% year over year, primarily reflecting higher head
count. Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2%, reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the
current quarter and $20 million of one-time expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in
the prior quarter.
The accelerating shift to passive is impacting growth in our volume-related expense, and direct fund expense was up
$29 million or 15% year over year, primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise. G&A expense was
up $34 million or 11% year over year, reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth, including investments in
technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also
impacted by the timing of certain accruals and additional expense related to the sale of our UK defined contribution
platform.
Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16%, reflecting similar increases in
technology, data, and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter.
Assuming stable markets and given the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate
planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million.
Our first (sic) [second] quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year over year and up 130 basis points
sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but remain
committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for
both clients and shareholders.
We're also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then
returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of
First Reserve's infrastructure equity funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the
broader ecosystem to support future growth. We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the
second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset
classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global
AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth
channel and the rapid adoption of iShares ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional
money managers.
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion, representing 21% annualized organic growth, with
strength across our core and non-core exposures. In the nine months since we announced pricing changes to the core in
October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment through organic growth alone.
iShares equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market
exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares net
inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment-grade corporate, emerging market bond, and treasury funds.
Our institutional business generated $13 billion in long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies.
Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset
by equity and fixed income outflows.
Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series, which saw record net inflows of $9 billion. We also
saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors, each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows. Alternatives

generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise.
Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong flows of $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by
index equity outflows of $9 billion, as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter.
Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally, led by fixed income and index equity
products, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across
our top-performing platform and include $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into
municipals and total return strategies. While total multi-asset flows were once again impacted by outflows from world
allocation strategies, our multi-asset income strategy nevertheless raised another $2 billion during the quarter, as
investors continued to target income-oriented outcomes.
BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the
future. Our diversification, scale, and globally integrated investment and technology platform enables us to generate
differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and base fees, resulting in long-term value creation for both
clients and shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
BlackRock's second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continued to place in our global investment and
technology platform. BlackRock's ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and
technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter, with a record $94
billion in long-term strategies, which were positive across all client types, product types, and investment styles.
While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more of their assets to work and global
equity markets continued to rise in the quarter, underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that so
far markets have been resilient to political shocks. Through the second quarter, the S&P was up 8% year to date,
reaching all-time highs. And many international markets have even outperformed. At the same time, while markets
have started to anticipate a normalization of policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a
reality in some countries and expectations for a continued low-yield environment persist.
And while amounts of cash still are uninvested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the
horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients' future needs. Both institutional and retail clients
are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction
technology.
They're also turning to BlackRock for our insights, to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape.
Insurance companies are one example of clients that continue to face significant challenges in this low-yield
environment. Last month, leveraging BlackRock's extensive experience with the needs of insurance clients and risk
modeling capabilities, we launched an insurance industry risk study. We took the investment portfolios of the entire
U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in
a variety of ways to see who's taking what kinds of risks and how are they being rewarded for that type of risk.
And we brought together a group of insurance company CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is
the current opportunity set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed
economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers. And
so it's an incredible peer analysis for the CEOs.
Our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock, to help them making strategic decisions
that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. This is just one example. BlackRock is increasingly using our
technology, our scale in innovative ways to enhance the value that we could provide to our clients.

As the wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their
changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts, and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the
U.S. over the next several years. As a result, our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on
portfolios, not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock.
They're also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investments can provide to investors. And
increasingly, our partners are looking for access to high quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help
execute repeatable processes. In this environment, BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management
clients than even before.
And in the U.S., through technology like Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which I'll talk about in a few minutes,
the reinvention of our sales model and tech-enabled advisor engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more
financial advisors this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost. The combination of
BlackRock's differentiated technology offerings and our broad-based investment platforms position us as the most
sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers.
Looking at flows for the quarter, BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows, driven by multi-asset, fixed income and
alternatives, which contributed to strong organic base fee growth in the quarter. BlackRock is seeing increasingly
strong fund-raising momentum in illiquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitments year-to-date. We've
particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we've made in our platform over time are resonating
with our clients.
Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds, which closed in the quarter, adds a talented team with
specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform. We now have over $16
billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients.
We also launched the UK's first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pensions searching for
yield a long-term outcome-oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which again leverages BlackRock's specialist teams
across credit, real estate, and infrastructure. We now manage $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform
and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. BlackRock saw $86 billion of net
inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74
billion of net inflows, for a total of $138 billion of net inflows year-to-date.
As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows
in iShares Core funds in the quarter. Importantly, non-core iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows,
contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm.
The rapid growth we're seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive
allocation, but by active investors to generate alpha in their portfolios. ETFs provide those investors targeting
exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one – any single bond.
Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we're making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF
ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it's innovation in distribution, it's innovation in portfolio
construction technology, an ETF in portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of
which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide. As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to
strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings, Global iShares' market share of year-to-date
flows has expanded to more than 40%.
Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. After several
years of BlackRock working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on the mechanics of fixed
income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities. They will treat it through as a
look-through treatment to the underlying assets, making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs
for their portfolios.

Another example is the new segment for ETFs. We recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry
flagship mortgage-backed security ETF to drive accelerated growth. We're evolving MBB or our mortgage-backed
bond ETFs to become the leading financial instrument, and I want to underline risk management tool for institutions to
access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with
direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient, a more liquid option for hedging their
mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage origination.
We also launched BlackRock's first self-indexed ETFs, two smart beta fixed income ETFs. These new indexes are
based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock's analytics and modeling capabilities to
achieve superior investment outcomes for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale and
technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients.
Technology is transforming the asset management industry and that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I've
talked about BlackRock's aspirational target of 30% of our revenues being enabled by technology five years from now.
That is a vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock.
Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings. But much of it will come from
using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities, ultimately delivering
growth in base fees and performance fees. And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of
BlackRock's employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change BlackRock,
is going to change our clients' needs, and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do.
Technology will impact all aspects of our business: the way we generate alpha, the way we build portfolios, the way we
manage risk, the way we distribute solutions, the way we engage with service providers, the way we operate, and even
the way we source talent. Aladdin's portfolio on risk management technology continues to be in demand by
institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200
institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional
fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable alpha for our clients.
As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management
technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction, asset allocation and risk management
tools for wealth management. Our first three Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management clients are now live, and they are
benefiting from the Aladdin technology. We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital
distribution platforms, so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable and a more repeatable
way.
Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor and our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital
distribution capabilities with an acquisition of Cachematrix and a minority investment in Scalable Capital. Both
platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable, technology-enabled solutions.
In addition to driving growth, we're using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we made in our
trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by
80% over the last five years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic costs, and it's totally driven by technology.
Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset manager's
business, our client service, our asset generation, and operational excellence. This year, we will be spending $1 billion
on technology and data and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles.
We recently signed a 20-year lease for our new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the
state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable, and operationally resilient. Our new
headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients.
As I've said many times but I mean it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunity for BlackRock than I
do today. The record growth we're seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time.
Continuing to invest in high-growth areas of our business and moving into adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we

can offer to our clients both remain critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both
our clients and to our shareholders.
With that, let me open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Thank you.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello there. So I wanted to get a little follow-up on the Aladdin for Wealth. So we've been
watching you invest in this. We turned three on this quarter. I'm assuming there's not much in the way of revenue yet
and it's more expense up front. So maybe as we roll forward, say, over the next year or so, what are we supposed to
think about in terms of – I'm sure there's a lot of training going on behind the scenes. What kind of uptake should we
expect? And when do you think we'll see it show up in both revenues and flows? Because retail is still 10% of AUM,
but I, like you, have a lot of high hopes for this investment.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, Glenn, it's Gary. Good morning. I think we're obviously working very hard on an active
pipeline for Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. I think first of all, it's generating revenue today. Obviously, there
are long implementations as there are for any Aladdin implementation, which could be as long as 12 to 18 months,
where we bear more significant cost up front, as we've talked about before.
But I think really the clients that we had are – we're all still learning together about all of the amazing things that we
can do with these clients both from the top-down in terms of some of the risk and compliance opportunities, and then
more importantly, some of the other bottoms-up, more specific financial advisor opportunities regarding portfolio
construction and asset allocation that move from advisor on up. So I think it's hard for us to basically specify any given
level of revenue, other than to say that we think it's going to accelerate significantly over the next couple years, both as
we continue to adopt new opportunities with the existing clients and basically work through the pipeline of new
opportunities going forward.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Glenn, I would – very similar to institutional implementations, Aladdin for Wealth
Management is actually even more complex because we are not dealing with, let's say, dozens of portfolio managers.
Ultimately, Aladdin for Wealth Management is going to be dealt at the house level, at the CIO level. And then
ultimately, it will be implemented, maybe depending on each firm, at the individual financial advisor level. And this
will allow us to have an opportunity to be at our financial advisors' desktops.
So the actual implementation probably is a little longer because of the significance of the scale of it. But let's be clear,
this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more
of the opportunities for Aladdin for Wealth Management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail
globally.
And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important in the overall ecosystem in wealth
management. It gives us – the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools. It provides risk management. It
is not a tool to sell only BlackRock products. It is a tool to enhance the wealth managers' value proposition. They'll be
able to use other products to audit other firms. But we believe by having that placement in the desktop, that placement
– and we've seen this in other areas, it gives us that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues.
So we look at this as one of the more fundamental long-term strategies for our positioning. And as Gary suggested,
there are revenues now, but the revenues are very similar to how the institutional side are. They're very modest and the
margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized, depending on how well they're utilized

and by the amount of financial advisors, then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization,
more revenues from the platform.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Hi, good morning. The FCA conducted a review on the mutual fund industry with
some conclusions on competitiveness of the market and on pricing. What sort of reactions have you seen from that
review, and how might this parallel your minority stake in Scalable Capital?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: I think that we, as always – hey, Ken, it's Gary. As always, I think we obviously support a
better ecosystem for investors. We think that to the extent there's a better ecosystem that supports more transparency
for investors and they feel more comfortable, they'll obviously put more money to work.
So I think we're obviously broadly supportive of a lot of what's in the study, we're just debriefing. In fact, we're going
to be going through it in more detail. But I think that everything there feels constructive. We're supportive of basically
trying to inform how we do business in a more transparent manner with investors. And we'll be making and obviously
continuing to work with the regulators to make additional comments to effectively try and optimize that going forward.
But I think we feel that we're incredibly well positioned from the study to drive our business. I think the U.S. in many
respects in terms of most of the change that's occurred here, in terms of the migration to fee-based planning, which we
think is obviously where Europe is going to go, positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that
opportunity. And I think our desire to basically grow that is exactly why we looked for an opportunity like Scalable
Capital to do it in a manner that will help us evolve with the marketplace.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: But unquestionably, Scalable Capital or any digital advice, it's a portal that is offering
low fee products such as ETFs, it's going to be of greater value. We did not – we bought Scalable Capital on a macro
basis believing that, as Gary said, the U.S. experience will be similar in Europe. And so once again, we're trying to stay
a couple of steps ahead of our clients and we are, I think, paying a good attention to the ecosystem changes that the
regulators are evolving themselves in terms of making this a better environment for more investors.
One thing I would say, the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great
reasons why PE ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is, most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If
through regulatory changes, through digital advice, through low-cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a
better alternative that they look towards for investing over a long horizon by being positioned there with digital
technology, with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we're as well positioned as any firm in the whole continent.

Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So the data shows that ETFs aren't just stealing share
from mutual funds or active managers, but also from other sources like single security investors, including insurers...
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Yeah.

<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: So the industry is stealing wallet share financial assets, and total retail flows have actually
accelerated in 2017 despite the DOL rule. Do you have any data or thoughts that you can share behind this trend to help
us think about how much of iShares' growth is actually coming from outside of the asset management industry?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, I think you cited it quite well and I cited it in my prepared talks. We're seeing
regulatory changes change of ETFs' environment. We do believe we're seeing accelerated flows because of MiFID II,
because of the movement towards the fiduciary rule in the United States.
We're seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures, which I talked about. I think that is
accelerating. Having the insurance commissioners changing capital – having a look-through treatment for fixed income
ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use ETFs because of a differential in capital charges, just
because of the CUSIP number, and now you have a look-through treatment.
And so we believe the environment for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it's continuing to grow and much of it
also has to do with ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage-backed area is going to have even
a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production.
So I think what's going on is and that I'll let Rob Kapito to speak up, I do believe you're seeing more utilization for
ETFs from institutions and retail for an exposure. In the active side, we're seeing more utilization across the board in
more products. And I think that's what we're starting to see that acceleration.
Before Rob speaks, I just want to say one important point. Index and ETFs still only represent 10% of the entire equity
market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows, but with $160-odd trillion global
equity market capitalization, we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow, not just on equities, but in fixed
income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young, driving the
mortgage-backed securities market in the late 1970s, early 1980s. Well, for me, in late 1970s, Rob in the early – I'm
older. Rob, any comments?
<A - Robert Steven Kapito>: Yeah. First of all, I am younger than you. But second of all, Craig, I think it's not just
stealing market share. It's obvious where that's coming from, whether it be mutual funds or whether it become futures
or others. What's exciting is new areas that are being created with the awareness of ETFs that not only can that be used
for hedging vehicles, they can be used, as Larry mentioned, in the insurance area, now with mortgage-backed securities
which as you know are very expensive to buy because of prepayments and because of custodial cost.
So there's new and newer uses for ETFs every single day. And that's why what we're trying to do is respond and be in
front of our clients and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been
able to use them before. So I would say it's not only stealing market share, it's creating new market share, which is
really the big opportunity for all of us.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: One last thing I would say that's really important, historically, many institutions used
derivatives, swaps or futures for hedging purposes. And that was very obscure and non-transparent. What we are now
seeing, whether it's a bank, a trading desk or bank balance sheet, an insurance company, a mortgage originator, we're
now starting to see more and more utilization of ETFs, which is transparent.
So we look at this as a net positive. And when people talk about this, they're not taking into the context how large
derivative swaps and futures have been, which was totally non-transparent. And now, all this activity is moving much
more onto a transparent platform, which obviously is one of the reasons why you're seeing the growth. And the other
thing I would just say and Rob talked about it, we're seeing more and more investors, instead of buying individual
stocks or individual bonds, they're using ETFs to get their exposures.
<A - Christopher J. Meade>: Is there a next question?

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Brennan, good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So just wanted to follow up on Gary's comments about the fee rate. So I know that you
walked through the fact that it's stable which is certainly attributed to the reversal of some of the divergent beta and FX,
as you highlighted.
Just kind of curious whether or not – is it too much to expect that some of the reversal of those trends that have
hindered your fee rate over the last few years could actually turn into tailwinds which might allow for the fee rate to
expand, or is stability the best way we should think about it? And I know that sometimes averages can cause the
numbers on a quarterly basis to not necessarily affect the whole story. So when we think about the exit rate coming out
of the quarter here, how should we think about the fee rate here tactically more in the near term, too? Thanks.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Thanks, Brennan. Good question. So again, I just want to take a step back, again just back to
the Morgan Stanley conference. So we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years
has obviously been impacted by a variety of factors that we don't control. We've talked about them as exogenous
factors. We've obviously pointed to both divergent equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly also shifting client
preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year where, obviously, we saw
probably – we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate. And that actually also
has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit
we've achieved from executing a pretty good differentiated growth strategy.
The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year, and that was a continuation of some of
the things we've talked about, the impact of international market underperformance, dollar appreciation throughout last
year, impact importantly of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our iShares franchise that
were not reflected in last year's prior second quarter and, importantly, a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative
to asset growth in the second half of last year.
Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds, as you mentioned, associated with divergent beta and FX
have abated. And should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate, which has
been about 6% year-to-date so far clearly should be more apparent over time.
In my opinion, if we can sustain organic base fee growth in excess of 5% and, frankly, we've done that in 2012, 2013,
2014, 2015 and year-to-date this year, last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn't do that. I'm not
really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it's the basis of a lot of
the modeling that everybody is doing. But I think right now, we're feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of
organic base fee growth rate that we're seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we
can generate that revenue momentum.

Your next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Fannon>: Good morning. Can you discuss the reaction from both clients and your distribution
partners from the repositioning of the equity platform earlier this year? And, in particular, maybe talk about some of the
flows at the product level and if there are outflows that you anticipate that may still come as a result of those changes.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: So look, we continue to believe in active management. And as clients focus more on
outcomes, both the actives and the index are going to play a role in portfolios to drive returns. So we announced
changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid to late June. So it's a little
early to tell and see any material progress from the reorg of both flows or financial advice.

But as anticipated, we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to
some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that weren't
part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows. Additionally, we had a few large
client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as
certain clients moved into index strategies.
So our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with
our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes, to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental
active equity funds since last year. And there, I have already seen some excellent performance. In the quantitative side,
92% of our quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and
peer mediums (sic) [medians] for the three-year period. And then the creation of our Advantage series, which is
offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees, all of those are showing results. And all of this, I
believe, is part of our announcement of Monarch and the upside that we have to come.
So we're very encouraged. The portfolio managers are energized to be able to share information across both of the
platforms. We've heard very positive views from our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize
the big data that's out there to their advantage to create performance. So the rollout of it has been something that we've
gotten very, very good client feedback from, and I'm very optimistic about it going forward.

Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Thanks. Thanks. Hi, good morning, everybody. So I want to go back to the comment you
made around $1 billion you guys are spending currently on tech and data with over 3,000 people. Obviously, it's been
and continues to be a very important growth area for you guys. But how much, I guess, do you guys expect that to grow
over the next several years and which area specifically you're targeting more either on the data side or the technology
side?
And I guess just taking a step back, bigger picture, how should we think about overall margins in the tech and risk
business as you guys continue to invest and scale this up over the next couple years?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me let Gary answer that, and I'll give some color.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So good morning, Alex. So just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment,
the 3,500 rough-cut people in technology and data-related roles includes expected technology roles such as
programmers and quant modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like
our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams.
So as Larry basically mentioned, we're thinking technology much more holistically, not as a specific definition, but
embracing technology to drive our overall business. We're spending about $1 billion this year to support that
technology and data initiative, which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses
associated with obviously those people, as well as hardware, software, and market data costs for the firm more broadly.
I think in terms of margins more broadly, as you know, we're not really big on talking about individual margins of
vertical businesses. And so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses, that's not
an overwhelmingly relevant number that we think about day to day.
But for example, to think about driving growth in iShares as an example, we're investing beyond simple product
innovation. We're investing in the entire ETF ecosystem. We're investing in distribution. We're investing in portfolio
construction technology. We're investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction education. We're talking
about building new markets for new users. And I think there's no question that the accelerating growth that we're seeing
in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly.

We're really trying to take a much more portfolio-oriented approach to investing in technology. And so notwithstanding
some of the things that we're doing that go also through our P&L, you're also seeing us make a number of strategic
acquisitions or other investments. Sometimes they're controls like Cachematrix, and sometimes they really do get a seat
at the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve like Scalable Capital and iCapital.
I think the important thing is that whichever direction we're going to go, we're going to continue to use our scale, which
we think is a huge driver of our ability to efficiently spend on technology in ways that others can't, really to drive that
growth and increase market share for both shareholders and our clients.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I would argue, in every industry in the world today, technology will be changing how
we operate, how our clients operate. And if we are not aggressively trying to be providing technology to interface with
our clients better, technology to create more efficiencies as we operate, and technology as we think about how to get
better insights, we will not provide the information and the ideas to our clients.
And I believe we need to be driving this faster and I do believe, as I said, for quarter and quarter and quarter, I believe
through this relentless investment, we are able to secure deeper, broader relationships with more clients worldwide. I
think Aladdin for Wealth Management is going to allow us to have a much better position going forward, with all our
distribution partners and helping them think about the risk for their own clients, so they do a better job for their clients.
And the key for all of us worldwide, if our clients have better outcomes, as I talked about Europe and the amount of
cash, if we can provide better outcomes and better risk information, so people look to investing more for the long term,
we will all be better off. And I believe this is an important responsibility and role for BlackRock to use technology to
enhance financial literacy, financial literacy to our financial advisors and ultimately financial – and allowing that
technology to allow our financial advisors to provide better literacy to their clients. And this is something that we're
very aggressive on, and I do believe the relentless pace that we have related to – towards technology puts us in a
differentiated position than any other asset manager, and we will continue to try to drive technology to make us
different.

Your next question is from William Katz with Citigroup.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. And this actually feeds on
what you guys are sort of talking about. If you think about the margins, I was trying to look back to your last Analyst
Day, it seemed like the formula was some revenue growth, some operating leverage, and you get some sort of
mid-teens earnings growth on top of that with low capital management. Is there a shift here just to more of a top line
focus and maybe a little bit more flattening of margin opportunity on a go-forward basis?
And within that, the $750 million you mentioned to sort of second half of planned G&A, could you talk about, is that
sort of like a new run rate as you look ahead given the relentless drive to grow the business? Thank you.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Thanks, Bill. Good morning to you. So look, as we've said in the past, we really don't manage
the business to a specific margin target. And in my view, my personal view, quarterly comparisons here are less
relevant and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time, especially in the context
of the organic growth that we're generating today.
Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient
way possible, especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think, if you look back over
the work that we've done since BGI, in particular, the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points and we've
invested significantly back into the business.
We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12
months, $335 billion plus of net new business, that's 7% organic AUM growth and importantly, 5% organic base fee

growth. There was a significant time where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels. And,
well, I think it's still early to call it sustainable. For a significant period of time, this level of growth is clearly a direct
result of the investments that we've made over time.
No one likes higher margins than I do or, well, maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does. But I also know that our
level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic
growth is a critical priority for us. And one that will be maintained going forward. While there is obviously an upward
bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his remarks, we
intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence Douglas Fink
I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning for your interest in BlackRock. Our second quarter results,
once again, highlights our long-term investments we made to enhance and differentiate BlackRock. It is differentiated
because of our global investment platform. It is differentiated because of our global technology platform.
We will continue to invest in both our technology and investment capabilities and use our scale to deliver better
outcomes for our clients and shareholders. And if we could use that scale to provide better financial literacy and better
long-term results on behalf of our clients, which will enable them to invest in more financial assets, we and the whole
industry will be better off.
We believe we have a good start in doing that and we believe we have deeper, stronger relationship with more clients
worldwide than we ever had before, which I believe will lead to future growth for the firm and for our shareholders.
Everyone, have a very good quarter, and we'll talk to you soon.
