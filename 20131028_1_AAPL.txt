Timothy D. Cook
Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us.
We're eager to share with you the results of the final quarter of Apple's fiscal 2013. We had a strong finish to an
amazing year, and Peter will provide details about the September quarter shortly. But first, I'm happy to tell you that
Apple's business is stronger than ever. We're in a unique position of having world-class hardware, software, and service
skills under one roof, which enables us to provide an unparalleled user experience to hundreds of millions of customers.
And working with our vibrant developer community, we've built a large and thriving ecosystem. We're winning with
our products in all the ways that are most important to us, in customer satisfaction, in product usage, and in customer
loyalty.
Our relentless focus on providing innovation that enhances our customers' lives is evident in the extraordinary list of
products that we've launched in just the last couple months, from the colorful iPhone 5C and forward thinking iPhone
5S to the powerful new iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac Pro to the stunning iPad mini with Retina display and the
dramatically thinner, lighter, and powerful iPad Air.
Thanks to a deep collaboration between our design and engineering teams, we also launched iOS 7 with a stunning new
redesign, powerful new features, and a great new service called iTunes Radio. We introduced OS X Mavericks,
bringing new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance to our Mac, and we introduced
next-generation iLife and iWork apps for iOS and OS X. And we're making all of this incredible software free because
we want our customers to have access to the greatest new features. All of these are products that only Apple could have
delivered, and most companies would be proud to just have one of them.
Looking back, we're very pleased with Apple's many accomplishments during fiscal 2013. Our customers had an
incredible response to our product lineup, buying 150 million iPhones, 71 million iPads, and 16 million Macs across
the fiscal year. We expanded the breadth and depth of our ecosystem, and we generated over $16 billion in revenue
from iTunes, software, and services.
We also welcomed almost 400 million visitors to our retail stores and opened or remodeled 49 new stores. And for the
second year in a row, we produced over $50 million in revenue per store.
We generated record total company revenue of $171 billion, earnings of $37 billion, and operating cash flow of $54
billion. We paid over $8 billion in capital expenditures to bolster our supply chain, expand our infrastructure, and
increase our retail footprint. We also completed 15 strategic acquisitions. That's an average of one acquisition every
three to four weeks.
We more than doubled the size of our capital return program to $100 billion, including the largest share repurchase
authorization in history, and we've become one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In fact, we've returned over
$36 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last five quarters alone.
We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business
performance and our return of capital. We review our capital program regularly, and our board is engaged in the
discussion of capital allocation on an ongoing basis. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from
shareholders in the past. We've greatly appreciated their suggestions, and we will actively seek their input again this
year. As we have in the past, the board and the management team will consider a wide range of issues and be
thoughtful and deliberate, and we will announce any changes to our current program in the first part of the new
calendar year.
We're off to a great start in fiscal year 2014. We continue to be very confident in Apple's future, and we see significant
opportunities ahead of us in both current product categories and new ones.
We are participating in large and growing markets. Today, smartphone penetration of the global handset market is only
a little over 50%. The smartphone category is expected to grow significantly in the next few years, from about 1 billion
units per year this year to over 1.7 billion in 2017. And the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate, from about

225 million units this year to over 400 million in 2017. We're continuing to invest in R&D and distribution. We're
expanding our geographic coverage, and we are building upon a phenomenal but still very young retail store presence.
We're also proud to be a force for good in the world beyond our products. Whether it's improving working conditions
or the environment, standing up for human rights, helping eliminate AIDS, or reinventing education, Apple is making
substantial contributions to society.
I'd like to thank all of our customers and our long-term shareholders for their loyalty. And I'd also like to thank Apple's
many talented employees who have worked tirelessly to bring us this far and who are passionately focused on making
great products that enrich people's lives.
I now turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the most recent quarter. Peter?
Peter Oppenheimer
Thank you, Tim.
We're pleased to report the results of the final quarter of Apple's fiscal year 2013 with record fourth quarter iPhone
sales, driving our highest September quarter of revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 billion, up $1.5 billion
or 4% from the year-ago quarter and slightly above the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 37%, at the
high end of our guidance range. And operating margin was $10 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was
$7.5 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $8.26.
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 33.8 million iPhones compared to 26.9 million
in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 6.9 million or 26%, and a new September quarter record. IPhone sales were
ahead of our expectations and grew strongly year over year in each of our geographic segments. We were particularly
pleased with growth in a number of developing markets, with unit sales up sharply year over year in Latin America, the
Middle East, Russia, and India. We were also very happy to add NTT DOCOMO to our carrier lineup in Japan, a
country where demand for iPhones has been especially strong.
IPhone sales remain very robust in the U.S., with comScore estimating that Apple was the leading smartphone
manufacturer with a 40.7% smartphone subscriber share for the three months ending in August. And among North
American customers polled by ChangeWave late last month who plan to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 63%
indicated they planned to purchase an iPhone.
We exited the quarter with about 14.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential
increase of 3.3 million from the June quarter and placed us at the low end of our target range of four to six weeks of
iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis.
Customers are loving their iPhones. Based on the most recently published research, ChangeWave measured a 96%
customer satisfaction rate among iPhone users, and Kantar measured a 92% customer loyalty rate, significantly higher
than the competition. And we believe that a great customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact,
Experion reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on their phones than Android phone
users.
IPhone continues to be a key productivity tool for organizations around the world, aided by apps from the App Store as
well as those custom built for internal use. In fact, nearly 35,000 companies representing millions of employees
worldwide are building custom apps that address specific workflow improvements for their iPhone and iPad users. In
the U.S., over 14,000 employees of Johnson Controls are using iPhones for work. The company has created in-house
apps that have enhanced field technician service delivery and customer communications. And China's AVIC
International, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China, has equipped 27,000 employees with iPhones to access
internally developed apps for office administrative documentation, approval processes, and key business intelligence
systems.

Turning to iPad, we sold 14.1 million iPads during the quarter compared to 14 million in the year-ago quarter. IPad
sales exceeded our expectations in the September quarter as we approached our new product introductions. We
experienced robust year-over-year sales growth in Japan, Russia, the Middle East, and we were pleased with strong
back-to-school demand for iPad in the U.S. and Canada.
IPad sell-through is roughly equal to sell-in, so we exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel
inventory, within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis.
Interest in iPad remains incredibly strong. In an August survey by ChangeWave of consumers who intend to purchase
tablets within 90 days, 55% indicated they plan to purchase iPads, more than four times the rate of the next most
popular alternative. And of those who already own iPads, the survey measured a 99% customer satisfaction rate.
The momentum of iOS devices in enterprise also remains incredibly strong. In its latest Mobility Index Report, Good
Technology indicated that the iOS platform accounted for 95% of enterprise mobile app activations and 72% of all
mobile device activations in the September quarter, while iPad accounted for 90% of total tablet activations.
Companies around the world are using iPads with custom apps to reinvent their legacy business processes, improving
efficiencies across organizations and job functions. For example, direct store delivery reps at Dr. Pepper Snapple Group
use iPads to facilitate communication and streamline the product delivery process. East Japan Railway personnel use
iPad minis to stay informed about schedule changes and access to conductor manual. And Swedish manufacturer SKF
uses a custom iPad app to calculate the life of their ball bearing products, saving 10 to 15 minutes per calculation for
every engineer several times per day.
Schools around the world continue to adopt iPad to transform teaching and learning in the classroom. In the UK, the
number of iPads sold to K-to-12 schools has more than doubled year over year. And in Latin America, over 70,000
iPads are being used by Sistema Uno students across 800 schools to improve their learning experience.
Here in the U.S., school districts continue to roll out large iPad initiatives to students. The Coachella Valley School
District in California is currently distributing over 19,000 iPads to its entire student body. And in South Carolina, every
one of the Horry County School District's 10,000 middle school students will receive an iPad this year.
These broad deployments are in part driven by the great educational content available on iPad. And we're pleased to
report that iBooks textbooks are now available across the U.S., UK, and Australian national high school curricula.
Last week we were thrilled to introduce new iPads featuring the A7 chip with 64-bit desktop-class architecture,
ultra-fast wireless, and expanded LTE connectivity. The new iPad Air features a beautiful Retina display in an elegant
unibody design that is 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the fourth-generation iPad. And the iPad Mini with Retina
display packs all the pixels of the iPad Air into its stunning 7.9-inch display and runs over 475,000 iPad apps available
in the App Store.
Turning to Mac, sales of 4.6 million Macs were above our expectations, which is a 7% decline from the year-ago
quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 10% during the September quarter,
indicating that Macs continued to gain share, just as they have for 29 of the last 30 quarters.
We were especially pleased with strong year-over-year growth in sales of MacBook Air, which we updated in June.
And in late September, we updated iMac with fourth-generation Intel quad-core processors, new graphics,
next-generation Wi-Fi, and faster PCIe Flash storage options. Last week we launched new versions of MacBook Pro
with Retina display, featuring fourth-generation Intel Core processors, faster graphics, longer battery life, and a more
affordable price.
Also last week we launched Mavericks, the tenth major release of OS X, with more than 200 new features. Mavericks
brings iBooks and maps to the Mac, includes a new version of Safari, enhances multi-display support, introduces
Finder tabs and tags, and delivers core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance, and is now
free.
We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was just below our four to five-week target range.

We continued to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services and the strength of the Apple
ecosystem. Our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.4 billion in the September quarter thanks to continued
strong growth in sales of apps. The quarter's iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of $2.4 billion, up
15% from the year-ago quarter. The strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in
total quarterly revenue of $4.3 billion from iTunes software and services, an increase of 22% year over year.
Cumulative app downloads have reached 60 billion, and our app developers have now earned $13 billion from sales
through the App Store, half of which they've earned in the last year.
We had a tremendously successful launch of iOS 7 last month, with hundreds of millions of downloads in the first few
days alone, making it the fastest software upgrade ever. Last week we reported that nearly two-thirds of iOS devices
were already running iOS 7. That's significantly higher than the percentage of users running the latest versions of other
mobile operating systems. This rapid transition to the latest version of iOS not only means that more customers are
having the most advanced experience possible, but it also enables developers to offer their latest app innovations to
hundreds of millions of users in a single software release.
iOS offers something now for everyone with its great new design and features, such as Control Center, AirDrop, and
iTunes Radio. In fact, the number of unique listeners who have tried iTunes Radio is now 20 million and growing. iOS
7 also includes significant features that make iPhones and iPads more secure and easier to manage in corporate
environments, offering new ways to configure and deploy devices at scale.
New device management capabilities include controlled sharing of documents and attachments, App Store license
management, wireless managed app setup, and streamlined mobile device management enrollment. And in terms of
security, iOS 7 offers enterprise single sign-on, default third-party app data protection, and per-app VPN to
automatically connect storage, corporate apps to the network without the need for users to change complicated settings.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $4.5 billion, up 6% from the year-ago
quarter. The stores produced very strong iPhone sales, with unit growth of 36% per store per week compared to the
September quarter last year. We completed the remodels of two stores and opened eight new stores during the quarter;
ending with a total of 416 stores, including 162 outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 30
new store openings in fiscal year 2014, about two-thirds of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to remodel
about 20 stores over the course of fiscal year 2014.
With an average of 411 stores open in the September quarter, average revenue per store was $10.9 million compared to
$11.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $709 million. We hosted 99 million visitors to stores
during the quarter, which translates to 18,500 visitors per store per week.
Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $467 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was
$113 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%.
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $146.8 billion in cash plus short-term and long-term marketable
securities, a sequential increase of $100 million from the June quarter. Our domestic cash was $35.5 billion at the end
of the September quarter, a sequential decline of $5.2 billion, largely attributable to our share repurchase activity.
$111.3 billion, or 76% of our total cash, was offshore at the end of the September quarter, and cash flow from
operations was $9.9 billion.
We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases of 10.4 million
shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of $36 billion in payments for dividends
and share repurchases over the last five quarters, of which share buybacks were $23 billion. This has resulted in
cumulative retirement of almost 47 million shares, and represents 5% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch
of our repurchase program. More than 44 million of these shares have been retired in the past two quarters alone.
Finally, given that our capital return program must be funded from domestic cash and as a result of our payments to
date, the cash that we can invest domestically and return to shareholders has stopped accumulating. In fact, we have
returned to shareholders or invested essentially all of the increase in available net cash generated since the beginning of

our capital return program in 2012. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share,
payable on November 14, 2013 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 11, 2013.
Now as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to in the beginning of the call. First, I want to explain a bit about
revenue deferrals. We believe that our software and services play a tremendous role in delivering the overall experience
that our customers have come to know and love. Over the last few years, we have added significantly to the offerings
that we provide our customers at no incremental charge, from operating system upgrade rights to non-software services
such as Siri and iCloud. The iLife and iWork apps have become as essential to the user experience as mail, messages,
and calendar. So we're now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynotes available as free downloads to
customers who purchase new iOS devices. And we're also making Mavericks and future OS X upgrades as well as
iLife and iWork free to our Mac customers.
As a result of these additional rights and features, we are deferring a greater portion of the sale of each iOS device and
Mac sold. We anticipate that the additional deferral per device sold coupled with our sequentially greater unit volume
expectations in the December quarter will result in about a $900 million sequential increase in the net amount of
revenue deferred for software upgrade rights and non-software services.
In total, we expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $58 billion compared to $54.5 billion in the year-ago quarter.
We expect gross margin to be between 36.5% and 37.5%, reflecting approximately $105 million related to stock-based
compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, including about $585 million
related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to
be about 26.25%.
In closing, we're very pleased with the results of the final quarter of our fiscal year 2013. We enter fiscal year 2014
with an incredible lineup of products, including our amazing new iPhones and iPads. We remain committed to
delivering great innovative products and services that delight our customers to enhance their lives, and we are very
confident in our new product pipeline.
With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the
first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] First we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks. Peter, I'm a little surprised your December quarter gross margin guidance isn't even
better given the increased total iPhone mix and also iPhone 5S within the iPhone line. I imagine there are a lot of
offsetting factors given the products that were launched last week. So I just wonder if you can walk through some of
the gross margin headwinds that you see in the December quarter.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. We expect, as I said in my prepared remarks, our gross margins to be between
36.5% and 37.5%, so essentially in line with the September quarter. We're pleased to be guiding gross margin about flat
sequentially, given all the new products that we have launched in the last few weeks.
During the quarter, we expect gross margin to benefit from the leverage on the substantial sequential increase in
revenue. Offsetting these benefits, we see a few factors, including: the higher deferred revenue relating to the software

that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And as I said, we expect the sequential increase in our deferral, which is not
only revenue but affects margin as well, to be $900 million; second, a richer mix of new iPads with higher cost
structures and lower pricing; third, FX headwinds, primarily from the yen; and fourth, the new lower-priced MacBook
Pro and iMac, which have higher cost structures than their predecessors. So those are four things that I would point out,
Katy.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay, that's very helpful. Tim, the press and even some of your competitors are quite
complimentary of the innovation in the iPhone 5S, but it seems like investors are looking or glancing over the 64-bit
ARM processor, the fingerprint sensor, the M7 processor. And part of this is that they're not exactly sure what those
technologies enable; i.e., why do you need a 64-bit ARM processor in a phone? So I'm just hoping you can enlighten us
a little bit on that question.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think everything that you mentioned, Katy, is the front end of a long roadmap. And so we
have the first 64-bit smartphone, as you mentioned, and this is our first use of the fingerprint sensor. And if you've used
it so far, you know that it's pretty profound to both use it from a security point of view and use it also to purchase apps
or music or movies et cetera. And so both of these I think are – the most important person here obviously is what our
customers think, and these new innovations on the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C combined led us to have our best
iPhone launch ever, with selling about 9 million units through the weekend. So we're off to a great start.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
We'll go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. Looking at the iPhone business as well, for the iPhone 5C, there was some
anticipation that the price point would be lower, and there as obviously some debate around that when you launched it.
Now that you've had the device out there for a while, a few weeks, what type of response are you seeing from the more
cost sensitive regions? And can you remind us of some of the things you are doing to make the products increasingly
affordable for the emerging regions in particular?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Bill, it's Tim. If you look at what we've done with our iPhone line, we are selling the iPhone
4S as our entry offer. We're selling the iPhone 5C as a mid-tier offer, and then of course the iPhone 5S. And our goal is
to overall have growth for total iPhone. But also within that, we want to have each of those categories grow as
compared to what we were doing previously. And so if you look at the total offers that we're making in the low-end
space and mid-tier and high end, the sum of all the price points we offer there, we'd like to grow in each one of those,
and we're really pleased that we did that. And so that's how we partly measure success. Of course, the most important
thing for us is to make a great product. But we do need growth, and we're happy that we've seen that.
I realize that some people were reading rumors about that the entry phone would be the iPhone 5C, but that was never
our intent, obviously. Our entry iPhone is the iPhone 4S. And as you know from comments that I've made previously,
we were selling the iPhone 4 in very good volumes. And as we began to experiment in different regions at somewhat
lower price points, we saw a fair amount of price elasticity. And so we were hoping and thinking that that will continue
with the iPhone 4S.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. And then related to that somewhat, looking at the iPhone ASPs overall, last quarter you
reminded us that the iPhone ASP and mix tends to be at its highest levels in the first few months of a product cycle and
then tends to trend downward throughout the product cycle. Do you think we should assume similar patterns holds for
this cycle, or are there some unique factors we should consider, particularly given the change in the product lineup?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: All things being equal, what we would normally see on our products is that you have a large
number of people that are early adopter related that come into the market right after we announce and buy our very best
product. And so other things being equal, that's what we would expect to see.

Next we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. Tim, you commented in your initial remarks about new product
categories. I think this was also something you were explicit about in your April quarterly conference call, where you
said that consumers and investors should expect new products, including new product categories in the second half of
this year and the first half of 2014. So can you reiterate that we should have that expectation? And when you talk about
new product categories, I presume that since you made the statement in April, there have been none. I just want to
make sure I understand the semantics of what you referred to as a new category.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, I didn't say in April that you would see them this year and the first half of next year, so
just to be clear on that. But what I have said is that you would see some exciting new products from us in the fall of this
year and across 2014. And I obviously stand by that, and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months.
In terms of new product categories specifically, if you look at the skills that Apple has from hardware, software, and
services and an incredible app ecosystem, these set of things are very, very unique. I think no one has a set of skills like
this. And we obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products that are in categories that
represent areas where we do not participate today. And so we're pretty confident about that.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And as a follow-up, I wanted to revisit the question of your pricing strategy. Last quarter
you spoke very ebulliently about elasticity that you experienced on the iPhone 4, and you had lowered the price in
many emerging markets to about $400. And yet when the new products came out, the iPhone 4S was actually at a
notably higher price than the iPhone 4 had been the previous quarter. And the iPhone 5C was obviously in line with
what we had seen before with the iPhone 4S, and the iPhone 5S was in line with the iPhone 5. So if anything, one of the
common themes that came out of the last earnings call was a desire to embrace the elasticity of the iPhone. But as best I
can tell, price points across the board seem to be a little bit higher than they were three months ago despite the
significant success you had there. So I'm wondering how we should think about what lessons you learned from the
iPhone 4 pricing changes, why you didn't choose to keep the iPhone 4 given that it was an extraordinarily strong seller
as best we could tell last quarter, and how you expect to try and continue to address the lower priced segments in the
smartphone market?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Toni, the $400 number, just to clarify, is your number, not mine. What we did with our
lineup this time was the iPhone 4S is replacing the iPhone 4. And so if you look at the U.S., as an example, the iPhone
4S is now free. The iPhone 4 previously was free. When you translate that out of the U.S., it depends on the market as
to what specifically happened. As you know, currency changes and the strength of the dollar doesn't play in our favor
in some geos from that perspective. But generally, we see the iPhone 4S as our entry iPhone offer that gives somebody
the ability to access the entire ecosystem with a fantastic product. And we clearly understand that there is elasticity in
that market and will move accordingly.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?

believe, of 6% if my math is right. What happened, and do you see that growth rate accelerating? We're hoping you
have new partnerships there. And how can you expand distribution?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yes, Ben, we had a pretty good quarter in China. We obviously want to do better. But if you
look at the quarter, we did grow by 6%. Underneath that, iPhone units were [ph] at (36:03) 25% year over year despite
significant constraints on iPhone 5S that affected the whole [audio gap] (36:11). However, we were able to launch in
our first round this time in China, and that was a big change and the result of a closer relationship with the carriers in
China and the government, and so we feel really good about that. We were able to do that on the iPad as well, as we
announced last week.
For the full year, the Greater China region generated over $27 billion of sales for us, ended up 14% year over year, and
so we have a reasonable-sized business there. In the year-ago quarter, iPad launched; it launched late in China, and so
that pressured the 6% down some. Otherwise, it would have been I think even a stronger quarter given the strength of
the iPhone. And so we are continuing to invest in stores. We opened one additional store in Greater China in the last
few weeks. We're investing in indirect distribution. Our point-of-sales are up by about 50% year over year on the
iPhone, and we're continuing to go out to more cities. Initially, we were very focused on just the large cities, and so
we're working on both coverage, on launching earlier and execution, and continuing to build on our retail practice
there.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. And I guess nothing to announce on [ph] more (37:50), but my second question is for
Peter. There's some confusion around the revenue deferral, and I was just hoping you could clarify it for gross margins.
The $900 million is about I guess 160 basis points, if I have that right on gross margins. How much of that should we
say is pressuring gross margin down in your guidance? Do we take about – would your gross margin guidance have
been about half the difference there higher if it weren't for this revenue deferral? And then when do we recoup that
margin? How many quarters does it take to recoup, and how will that flow back through the model? Thanks.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure, Ben. We have been deferring revenues from the sale of each iOS device and Mac,
given that we had been providing updates to software. Given the announcements that we made last week and that I
went through in my prepared remarks, we have actually increased those deferrals. IPhone and iPad, we are deferring
between $15 and $25. That's up as much as $5 per device. And Mac has gone from $20 to $40, so up an additional $20.
On a sequential basis, given the increased deferral rates that we have as a result of increasing the software that we are
providing to customers for free coupled with our sequential unit increases, we will defer, we think, about $900 million
more in revenue in the December quarter than we deferred in the September quarter, so you can calculate the impact to
gross margin on that, and that goes straight through to margin. It's revenue and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in gross
margin. We will then record that revenue that we've deferred for iOS devices across a two-year period of time ratably
and for Macs over a four-year period of time.
So then just to summarize, we have been deferring revenue on both iOS devices and Macs now for a number of years,
given the software that we had been giving away for free. We have increased those rates beginning in September for
the iOS devices and in October for the Macs. And it will come back into those products over two and four years, as I
said.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Great, thanks. That's a pretty good guide for gross margin if you take that out – if you're leaving
that out. Thanks.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Ben, just to add on to that, thank you for saying that, and I agree. And I would also say
that we're really happy to be guiding gross margin flat not only because of the deferral but in addition to all of the new
products that we've introduced with higher cost structures and lower prices. And no hard and fast commitments, but
we're going to work really hard to get down the cost curves as we have successfully in the past.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.

From Piper Jaffray, we'll go to Gene Munster.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Hey, good afternoon. And just to make sure this is crystal clear here on the gross margin,
about 38.5% would have been the midpoint of the guide excluding the change to deferral. Is that correct, Peter?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Probably in that range, Gene. I didn't do it precisely, but you can take the $900 million
that we're deferring across the revenue ranges and do the math.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Okay, great. And then beyond the December quarter in terms of structural elements around
the iPhone gross margin, a couple years ago with the iPhone 4S, we saw the launch and then we saw the margins ramp
nicely after the launch. I know you're not giving guidance beyond the December quarter. But are there some structural
things that have changed in the profitability of the iPhone that would be good to know as we think about our models in
2014?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: I don't know that there are any structural differences, but I'll make a couple of comments.
I'm not giving guidance beyond the December quarter, but just a couple things to think about. We're benefiting this
quarter, as I talked about in answering Katy's question, from the benefits of leverage given the very big sequential
increase in revenue. Leverage cuts both ways, so presumably that would go against us in the March quarter. However,
we would expect to defer less for these software deferrals in the March quarter as well. And as I noted at the end of
Ben's question, we will endeavor to work very hard to get down cost curves as we have in the past, no change.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Okay. And then for my follow-up question, in terms of the iPad and the iPad mini price
change, I guess just broader thinking around the iPad, we've seen fluctuations in the growth rate. How do you think
about that segment in terms of growing at or above or below market growth rates around tablets? And separately, is
there any differences in terms of how often people are upgrading their iPads versus iPhones? It feels like they're
upgrading them every three years versus a little bit over every two years for the iPhone. Is that accurate? So the size of
the opportunity and then maybe just any nuances in upgrade behaviors between the iPhone and the iPad.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Gene, it's Tim. We continue to view the tablet market as huge. We see it as a large
opportunity for us. We are not solely focused on unit share. As I've said many times, we're focused on usage on the
customer side and loyalty and other things that are very important to us. We do believe that this has been – or the
announcement last week was our largest iPad announcement ever. And we are confident we're going to grow year over
year. And if you look back, we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago.
We got off to a great start this weekend with iPad Air. And then later in the month, we'll begin shipping the new iPad
mini. We did feel that we wanted to reduce the price of the iPad mini. And so we did that and now are coming in at
$299, which is an incredible value to get access to the whole of the ecosystem and so forth. And the iPad Air is just an
absolutely incredible product, the best iPad we've ever done. And so I think both of these products are going to do
really well. I think it's going to be an iPad Christmas, but we'll see. We will report the numbers back to you in January
on how we did. But we're pretty confident.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?

app on a mobile device. We wanted all of our customers to have access to our very latest software so they would have
access to our best features. And so we decided to make the bold move of making it free. And I note some other folks
charge $199 or so for each of these actually, for the OS and the productivity apps, that we really wanted to make it a
part of the experience. And so we're making it free, and we're going back all the way to Snow Leopard on the OS side,
and iWork is free for all new Macs. And so I think it's a very strong offer. I think it's just another reason that everyone
should buy a Mac. And we think it was a great decision to do so, but most importantly we think it's great for our
customers.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great, and then I just had a question on educational, which somewhat ties into this since
iWork and iLife I think or some of these operating systems run through there. I'm curious what your thoughts are with
regard to Chromebooks, Google Apps, any kind of foothold that we're seeing with Google taking share in education
because, as we've seen, some of the price points for the devices are pretty low. But clearly, you guys are able to sell
into education as well, so I'm curious as to how you view the competition and how you position your products vis-à-vis
some of the things that are fairly low priced.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: That's a good question. We had our best education quarter ever. We went over $1 billion in
revenue for the first time ever. We were up strongly year over year, up 8%. IPad was up 22% year over year, and the
Mac was up 8%. And as you know, the PC market was down 10% in the aggregate and likely down even more in
education. And so we feel like we're doing great on both fronts, both in the iPad space and in the Mac space for people
wanting to buy Mac. And we do see Chromebooks in some places, but the vast majority of people are buying a PC/Mac
or an iPad. Our share of tablets in education is 94%. It's unheard of. I've never seen a market share that high before. So
we feel like we're doing really well here and feel great to be making a contribution to education.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Shannon. Can we move to the next question, please?
Operator
Next from UBS, we'll go to Steve Milunovich.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the supply side? There has been some thought
that the fingerprint technology has been a little bit hard to manufacture, and you indicated that the Retina mini would
be out later in November. So I'm curious if you're going to be able to meet the demand for the holidays with the iPad
mini that you would like to, and maybe some general supply comments and also comments on component costs.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Sure. Steve, it's Tim. In terms of supply, iPhone 5S ended the quarter with a very significant
backlog. We still have a significant backlog. However, our supply is building each week, and we're very confident of
our ability to keep ramping. And so we've rolled out 30 more countries with the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C as of last
Friday, and we'll roll out another 16 this week, and so we're right on where we would like to be in terms of achieving
100 countries by the end of the calendar year.
In terms of the Retina or the iPad mini with the Retina display, we'll start shipping later in November. It's unclear
whether we will have enough for the quarter or not. We know how many we will have, but you really don't know the
demand until after you start shipping it. And so we'll see how that goes, but I think we'll do fairly well with iPad, as I
had mentioned before. We feel like it's going to be a really great holiday season.
In terms of component costs, both DRAM and NAND were up last quarter from the previous quarter. DRAM we
believe will continue to be up in this quarter. We think NAND will be flat, and other commodities will fall sequentially.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. And then, Peter, about a year ago you indicated that the December quarter would
benefit by about 200 basis points in gross margin due to a combination of mix shift toward phones and higher volume.
Is that the sort of uplift you would expect from those factors this December quarter?

<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Steve, I don't want to put a precise amount on it. But I see us benefiting from a couple of
things in the quarter, the leverage on the higher revenue by far being the biggest. As Tim mentioned, we expect to have
a positive commodity environment, and selling iPhones is never a bad thing from a margin perspective.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thanks.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?

We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, thanks, good afternoon. The first question here for Tim, just regarding the channel
inventory levels of 14.3 million for the iPhone, much higher than we've seen in quarters past. Is there some sort of
message there in terms of you now having much broader coverage in terms of incremental coverage, or is there a much
bigger incremental upgrade cycle from your installed base, or both?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think the number one thing to note on the channel inventory is that our range, as you know,
for iPhone is four to six weeks, and we were at the low end of our range. And so that to me is the most important thing
I'd look at anyway. I should say, you can choose to look at the thing that's most important to you.
In terms of it changing from where it has been in the past, the things that you should consider are that China was in
wave one this year, so there was a lot more point of sales there. We added DOCOMO in Japan, and so that's a large
carrier to add. And what probably were not in the opening comments was that of the 14 million, 1.8 million of those
were iPhones that were in transit and therefore not available to sale in the channel. And we always count those in
channel inventory because they're in our sales line. And so that's how I'd look at the iPhone inventory.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. And then just to follow up, if I could, a year ago you had a very ambitious
multi-product ramp in terms of new products coming out at the same time. You have some impacts related to supply
constraints. Just to follow up on Steve's question, do you feel that 12 months later and fast-forward to the future now
that you're in a much better shape to avert or navigate some of these big supply constraints that inflicted some problems
on you last year, or can we see a similar situation as we move through the quarter?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: As I mentioned on the iPhone 5S, I feel like we're doing really well on supply. The demand
is very robust. And so we are in backlog right now. But I feel confident about us continuing to ramp and do quite well
for the quarter.
On the iPad mini, we'll start shipping later this month, and it's very difficult to forecast exactly when supply and
demand will balance there. And we'll also see about the iPad Air as we go out this week. I think we'll have a really
good weekend, but it may be that not everyone can find one that wants one.
I think versus last year, I think one key difference is we announced one of our key Macs, the iMac, but we didn't begin
shipping it until the end of December. And so we went for more than two months with minimal iMac sales. And
therefore from a Mac point of view, year over year last year we had our only down quarter, down versus the market that
is, in the last 30 quarters. And so I don't envision that happening this year. I feel really good about the way that the
MacBook Pros have gotten off last week. They've gotten off to a huge start. I feel great about Mac growing year over
year this quarter. I feel great about iPad growing year over year this quarter as well, and you can tell that from the
strong guidance numbers that Peter gave earlier.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question, please?

<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about iPhone ASPs. They were down about 7% year
on year in the quarter and down sequentially. Last year they were up sequentially on the launch. Was that a product
supply availability issue, and how do you think about ASPs going forward?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Chris, this is Peter. Sequentially we were relatively flat, so I'll comment on a
year-over-year basis. They were down 7%, as you indicated. And this was primarily due to a significant increase in the
sales of our entry SKUs, where we had made them more affordable to attract more first-time smart buyers. We also
incurred some FX headwinds from the yen, the Australian dollar, and a number of the emerging markets which
impacted us as well. I don't want to forecast ASPs for the December quarter. We'll report to you in January what they
were. But the FX headwinds likely continue given where exchange rates are today.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: And just to follow up on Mark's earlier question around channel inventories, that 14
million unit number was I think higher than a lot of people expected. Was that also geared towards the low end of the
product stack, given the iPhone 5S was short exiting the quarter?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: The iPhone 5S was in huge backlog, and so any kind of iPhone 5S that was in the channel
was a transitionary move, maybe perhaps in transit and so forth. We did have, as I had mentioned before, we had 1.8
million units, total iPhone units in transit at the end of the quarter, so that's a pretty substantial number.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: And just lastly, I wanted to ask about subsidies. That wasn't mentioned as a potential
impact to phone margins. But can you comment on carrier subsidies more generally? How sustainable are they given
the competitive environment, and how are carriers responding to the pricing stack of your phone line? Thanks a lot.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think carriers like to sell as many units as they can and get as many people on their service.
And in most regions want them to be on service contracts, and so they're very predictable and reliable, and I don't really
see that changing. I think some carriers have come up with different sales programs that might appeal to someone who
wants to upgrade their phone annually instead of every other year. I think those programs in general probably reduce
the subsidy somewhat in the aggregate for people that take these up. But customers may view that that's a fair exchange
for getting to upgrade quite often, so there's a customer proposition for it. Other than that, I think we have great
relationships with the carriers, and I think they were, as we were, very happy with the iPhone rollout.
