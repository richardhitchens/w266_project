Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Francis S. Blake
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $22.5 billion, up 9.5% from last
year. Comp sales were positive 10.7%, and our diluted earnings per share were $1.24. Our U.S. stores had a positive
comp of 11.4%.
We expected the second quarter to be our strongest comping quarter of the year. The results exceeded our expectations.
We grew sales by almost $2 billion in the quarter, posted the first double-digit positive comp in our business since
1999, and had the highest quarterly transaction count in the company's history.
From a geographic perspective, sales were strong across the U.S. Two-thirds of our regions posted double-digit comps,
all of our top 40 markets posted positive comps, and 98% of all of our markets were positive. So the strength in the
business was broad-based geographically. This was also true across our merchandising categories. Every one of our
merchandising departments exceeded plan for the quarter.
As Craig will detail, we saw particular strength in our spring seasonal categories. As you know, we had a
weaker-than-expected selling season for outdoor categories in the first quarter because of the late spring, but that was
counterbalanced by strength in this quarter as the weather turned more favorable.
The core categories in our store remain strong, and we were pleased with the growth in our appliance business, where
we've added key brands, and with the growth in décor categories like soft flooring, vanities, and special-order cabinets.
With respect to our customer base, we continued to see strength in our Pro business. In the first quarter, our Pro
customer growth outpaced our Consumer growth. For the second quarter, the growth rates were comparable. This
reflects less a slowdown in Pro than a pickup in our Consumer sales. And as in the first quarter, our larger Pros were
our fastest-growing customer group, but we also saw continued improvement in our smaller, lower-spending Pros.
On the international front, our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter, making it 39 quarters in a row of
positive comps, and our Canadian business had positive comps for the seventh quarter in a row.
This quarter tested our ability to react and be flexible. Significant outperformance to plan obviously presents some
interesting operational and merchandising challenges. On the operational front, Marvin and his team were able to adjust
store staffing and handle unexpected volume and transaction growth while maintaining customer satisfaction levels.
Earlier in the year, Marvin introduced Project Simple into store operations, dramatically reducing the administrative
tasking within the stores. This played an important role in freeing up our store leadership to respond to changed
circumstances.
On the merchandising side, many of the improvements that Craig, our merchants, Mark Holifield, and the supply chain
team have made in our forecasting and replenishment systems have helped the business react to and recover from sales
spikes, while keeping inventory under control.
On Interconnected Retail, we are at the point where almost one out of every three online orders are completed in a
store, either through Buy Online Pick Up in Store or Buy Online Ship to Store. This is important to us because we
believe our more than 2,000 store locations throughout North America are a valuable convenience for customers, and
can and should be a competitive advantage for us. And, of course, customers have the opportunity to buy additional
items when they come into our store to return our pick up a product, as today, one out of five customers do.

We're also pleased with the improvements we're making to the customer experience in our services business, as we
develop new project and communication tools online. In the second quarter, we continued the rollout of a functionality
we call My Install, that will provide customers specific installation information, dynamic tracking to keep them
informed on the status of the installation, e-mail notifications for appointments, and a point of contact to process order
changes and the like. This provides both a better customer experience and a better foundation for us to manage a
business that is growing at a double-digit pace.
As we look towards the back half of the year, consensus GDP forecasts continue to call for only modest growth.
Housing data, however, are encouraging. Private fixed residential investment, or PFRI, as a percent of GDP improved
to 3.1% in the second quarter, but it's worth remembering that prior to the housing crash, this would have been below
the previous 60-year low for PFRI.
As Carol will detail, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. The housing recovery should be a
positive for our market. But we have difficult sales comparisons in the back half of the year as we anniversary
hurricane events from 2012 and 2011 and very strong holiday seasons in both of those years.
Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. It is easy to talk about a flexible business
model, but the execution of that requires people willing to adjust to changed circumstances and deal with business
challenges, while putting the customer first. Our associates did that. Based on this half's results, 100% of our U.S.
stores qualified for Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates, and we will have our
highest-ever Success Sharing payout, and we're very proud of that result.
And with that, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the second quarter, posting
positive comps in all departments. There were four key factors that drove our performance: strong summer events, a
recovering seasonal business, commodity inflation, and strength across the remainder of the store.
The departments that had double-digit positive comps were kitchens, indoor garden, lumber, outdoor garden, lighting,
tools, electrical, and flooring. Bath, plumbing, décor, building materials, paint, hardware, and millwork performed
passably but were below the company average.
Our seasonal business exceeded our plan, as spring finally kicked into gear in the second quarter. We were able to
recover all the lost sales we projected from exterior project categories in the first quarter, and then some. In indoor and
outdoor garden, our second-quarter success resulted in positive comps in both departments for the first half of the year.
The core of the store delivered solid sales growth throughout the second quarter. In maintenance and repair categories,
we saw continued comp performance in light bulbs, wiring devices, cleaning, plumbing repair, fasteners, builders'
hardware, caulk, and adhesives. We also saw traction in décor categories, where comps above the company average in
special-order carpet, special-order cabinets, floor tile, and lighting, as well as strong comps in faucets.
Our store associates did a great job executing our summer events and creating excitement. Our Memorial Day, Father's
Day, and Fourth of July special buys and great values were well-received by our customers, and drove double-digit
comps in categories like appliances and riding mowers.
Our results were achieved through a coordinated effort between our supply chain, our merchants, our stores, and our
vendors. The investments we've made over the past several years gave us the flexibility and capability to respond
quickly and meet spikes in demand.
Total comp transactions rebounded from the first quarter, and grew by 5.7% for the second quarter, driven by traffic
related to our seasonal business. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of U.S. sales,
were up 3.8% for the second quarter, principally due to our garden business.

Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 15.5% in the
second quarter, driven by the strength in appliances, riding mowers, flooring, as well as continued improvement from
our Pro business.
Average ticket increased 4.3% in the second quarter. Our average ticket increase was impacted by commodity price
inflation, mainly from lumber and copper, which contributed approximately 70 basis points to comp.
As Frank mentioned, we had one of the best quarters in our recent history. As we look forward to the back half of the
year, we're projecting solid sales growth, but we do have several factors to overcome. First, we will face tough sales
comparisons resulting from impacts of consecutive years of autumn storms. Second, commodity inflation is on track to
no longer be a tailwind, as lumber and copper prices have begun to moderate.
Third, we begin to lap excellent response to our rollout of our expanded appliance business. And as we get to the fourth
quarter, the holiday shopping season will be a week shorter due to the date on which Thanksgiving falls this year.
Now let me talk specifically about the third quarter. We continue to focus on innovation as a key part of our leadership
strategy. In stores now, Behr Premium DeckOver wood and concrete coatings brings new life to old wood and concrete
surfaces. This 100% acrylic formula, available in 54 colors, conceals splinters and cracks and creates a slip-resistant
finish.
We continue to be innovative in lighting technology. As an example, we are introducing an LED 90-watt-equivalent
flood light from Cree, now giving us a full range of assortment for the top three most popular bulbs at market-leading
values.
For our Pro customers, we are introducing DAP SmartBond adhesive foam gel that is faster and easier to use than
traditional cartridge adhesives, helping our Pro customers be more efficient. One cartridge of SmartBond provides eight
times the coverage of traditional adhesives.
Also, new through homedepot.com, for our Pro customers, we are offering a line of fully-welded steel cabinets from
Husky, which feature a variety of door and interior configurations. This allows a customer to customize their cabinets
exactly the way they want them.
For our Labor Day and fall cleanup events, we have an extensive lineup of great values and special buys. These events,
along with our superior execution in store, will generate a lot of excitement in the third quarter.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone. In the second quarter, sales were $22.5 billion. On a like-for-like basis, comps
or same-store sales were positive 10.7% for the quarter, with positive comps of 10.2% in May, 11.5% in June, and
10.5% in July. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 11.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 11.5% in May, 11.7%
in June, and 11% in July.
Total sales grew 9.5% from last year, reflecting the impact of the calendar shift. As you will recall, fiscal 2012 had a
53rd week, which shifted our fiscal 2013 calendar. By starting fiscal 2013 one week later than last year, we had one
less week of spring sales in the second quarter when compared to the same period in 2012, which negatively impacted
total sales growth by approximately $249 million, or 120 basis points.
As Frank and Craig mentioned, our second quarter sales performance exceeded our expectations, due in part to strong
demand for appliances and recovery in our garden department. Further, sales related to Hurricane Sandy were
approximately $47 million in the second quarter. We expect to see some benefit from storm-related sales in the second
half of the year, but the year-over-year benefit will diminish as we begin lapping hurricane sales in the third quarter.

Our total company gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year, of which 13
basis points came from our U.S. business. We saw a considerable amount of movement in our gross margin during the
quarter, as explained by the following.
First, we experienced approximately 22 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the impact of
gross-margin-accretive businesses that were acquired in the back half of last year. Second, we had 13 basis points of
gross margin expansion due to expense leverage within our supply chain. Third, our shrink efforts continued to gain
traction, as we realized 10 basis points of gross margin expansion due to better shrink performance than one year ago.
And finally, we experienced approximately 32 basis points of gross margin contraction, due primarily to a change in
mix of products sold. To put this contraction into perspective, over 50%, or 19 basis points, came from a higher
penetration of appliance sales than one year ago.
For the first six months of the year, our gross margin grew by 16 basis points. As we look to the last six months of the
year, we would expect our gross margin expansion to be about half of what we experienced in the first six months, so
for the year, expect moderate gross margin expansion.
In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 79 basis points, to 20.9%. In the second
quarter, our operating expenses grew at 58% of our sales growth, better than our expectations for the quarter due to
strong sales performance.
For the year, we are expecting our expenses to grow at approximately 30% of our sales growth on a 52-week basis. But
note, like what we experienced in the second quarter, there will be quarterly distortions to that rule of thumb given
year-over-year comparisons and certain expense items like Success Sharing. For example, in the second quarter of
2013, over 300 stores were in higher Success Sharing payout tiers than one year ago. This caused 14 basis points of
expense deleverage in the quarter.
Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $172 million, a 13.9% increase from last year, reflecting
increased interest expense associated with $2 billion of incremental debt issued in April of this year. Our income tax
provision rate was 36.9% in the second quarter, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the
year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.24, an increase of 22.8% from last year.
Moving to our operational metrics, during the second quarter, we opened one new store in Puerto Rico, for an ending
store count of 2,258. At the end of the second quarter, selling square footage was 235 million, and total sales per square
foot were $383.
Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, inventory was $11.1 billion, and inventory turns were 4.9
times, up from 4.7 times last year. We ended the quarter with $42.2 billion in assets, including $3.4 billion in cash.
Moving to our share repurchase program, in the second quarter we received 2.1 million shares related to the true-up of
an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the first quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter,
we repurchased $2.15 billion, or 25.4 million, of our outstanding shares.
This included 5.8 million shares repurchased in the open market and 19.6 million shares repurchased through an ASR
program. For the shares repurchased under the second quarter ASR program, this is an initial calculation, and we
expect to receive an additional 2.4 million shares in August.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on
invested capital was 19.1%, 310 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
We had a solid first half, as evidenced by strong performance across our store. As we look to the back half, we believe
we will continue to report solid sales gains, and that sales will be higher than we originally planned. So, today, we are
lifting our 2013 sales and EPS growth guidance, reflecting our first-half performance and our forecast for the second
half of the year.

We now expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase by approximately 4.5%, with positive comps on a 52-week like-for-like
basis of approximately 6%. We expect the rate of comp growth for the back half of the year to be about 50% of the rate
of comp growth we experienced in the first half of the year. Our second-half forecast is based on our view that we are
in the early stages of housing recovery, that GDP will grow less than 2% for the year, and reflects certain back-half
challenges that Craig detailed.
Finally, we, like others, are watching the interest rate environment, as consumer spending and mortgage availability
could be negatively impacted if interest rates were to rise. In the absence of rising interest rates, however, if there is a
bias in our second-half forecast, today we would say there is more upside opportunity than downside risk.
For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now project fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share to
increase approximately 20%, to $3.60. This earnings-per-share guidance includes the $4.3 billion of share repurchases
completed in the first half of the year and our intent to repurchase an additional $2.2 billion in shares during the second
half of the year.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call, and Marquita, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Hi. Thank you. Carol, just following up on the comments near the end, you sounded more
confident. What causes – obviously, the results should cause that confidence – but what causes that confidence going
forward? And what are you seeing competitively in terms of pricing or anything along those lines, because gross
margin looks solid, but given the shift in mix?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, thank you, Gary. We look at a number of factors, both internal and external, to arrive at a
point of view as to how our sales will perform in the back half of the year, coming off, obviously, a very strong first
half of the year. The best thing we can look at are current trends, and I will tell you the current trend of the business is
good. Sales are quite brisk.
Now, competitively, Craig, you might want to comment.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, Gary, from a competitive standpoint, we saw the last quarter that we just exited here,
pretty comparable. Most folks went hard after the seasonal business, given the late start to the business, and certainly,
in big ticket, it appears you still need to stimulate the customer to buy. But not a radical change, and kind of would
expect that going forward.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: And there's been a lot of talk – and then I'll get off the phone – there's been a lot of talk about
interest rates rising and the impact that could have on housing, and you guys, et cetera. What are your thoughts on
where we are?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, as you know, 30-year mortgage rates are up. They're at the highest rate that they've been
since October of 2011, at about 4.4%. The affordability index is still at a historical high, Gary, so if rates were to move
up, it would impede that affordability index, but we've got a long way to go before it should have a dramatic impact, we
believe, on mortgage availability or the attractiveness to a consumer – or a homeowner to take out a mortgage. All that
being said, however, we're watching it.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on two things – one, on the
bigger-ticket project business, what you're seeing in kitchen and bath, in particular. And then, also, if you could
comment on credit availability – I know you guys had started doing that second look program, any color around that.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Dan, on the big ticket, we did see very nice strength in tickets above $900, growing at 15.5%
in the quarter. That was largely driven with appliances, things like riding mowers, which were strong throughout the
quarter. We saw flooring projects, as well as our kitchen business, all contributed to that. And then, certainly, the
continued strength of our Pro business, which carries a higher average ticket overall helped that as well.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And on the credit front, during the quarter, we opened 1.4 million new private label credit card
accounts, so we were very pleased with that. The penetration of our private label card grew 44 basis points in the
quarter, now standing at 22.6%, so that's good news too. We also saw an increase in bank cards, so it appears that
consumers are willing to use their bank cards, our bank card penetration up 30 basis points year-on-year.
If you look at what's going on within our private label portfolio, we see consumer approval rates hovering around 68%.
That's good news too because, as you know, they were dropping as a result of some of the changes coming out of
Durbin, but now we see it hovering around 68%. The average line approved is $5,800 – that's up $200 year-on-year – at
a FICO at about 716.
On the commercial front, the average approval rate there is 70%. The line approved is $6,800. That's also up $200
year-on-year. We are coming behind our Pro customers because they are so very important, either with second-look
programs, or we work with the underwriter to extend credit lines on a case-by-case basis. So credit, obviously, is an
important part. It's not the entire story here, but it's certainly part of the story.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yep.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks and good morning. Can you talk about – it was very consistent comps throughout
the quarter. Is there a way to think about what the seasonal business actually lifted – perhaps July, which was later in
the quarter, but obviously you have these record moisture levels out there, and mowing and cutting bushes and so forth,
so is there a way to peel that back and think about what July is, ex-seasonal?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, Chris, the seasonal business obviously carried strong throughout the quarter. We saw,
for example, in sales in things like power equipment, remained very solid throughout the quarter, including July. As
you mentioned, due to the fact that we had a moist July, that obviously kept the grass growing as well. And when we
looked at the seasonal business in total, one of the risk factors coming off of the first quarter was whether or not you'd
be able to recover the full live goods and fertilizer business, and because of the moisture, we actually were able to get
all that business back, carrying through June and July, and then actually, some, we went above what we thought.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, and July was our easiest compare...
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: ...as you know, so that's another way to parse it out, if you think about it, the recovery of garden
sort of evened out the monthly performance.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes.

<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Okay. And then on the – so I guess you would say, like, obviously guiding about a 4%
comp in the back half, August is very strong, but maybe the ex-seasonal or core underlying growth rate in the business
is somewhere between that 4% and the 10% that you posted in July?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, here's the way I'd like you to think about the back half of the year, and I'll walk you down
from what we posted in the first half to the second half, and I'm going to round. So, the first half, our comp was 8%-ish
– I'm rounding down. I'm going to walk you down to the guidance that we're giving you, which is about 4%-ish. First,
we're up against some very tough hurricane sales, and I'd like you to think about this, really, on a two-year basis. So,
we forget sometimes that we had a hurricane in 2011, Hurricane Irene, and we had $360 million of hurricane-related
sales in 2011.
Then if you move to 2012, we all know we had Hurricane Sandy, but we also had Hurricane Isaac, so when you add up
those sales, that's about $377 million of hurricane sales, so on a two-year basis, we're up against more than $730
million of sales coming off of hurricanes. So one of the walk-downs obviously would be we're not anticipating
hurricanes. Now, if we get a hurricane, it's a different story. But right now, we're not anticipating a hurricane. So knock
maybe a point-and-a-half of growth off of just hurricane-related sales.
Then, as Craig pointed out, commodity prices are starting to moderate. If you remember, the back half of last year,
structural panel pricing took off. It's now coming down. So we would knock off maybe a little, maybe a point, call it
130 basis points, for commodity price inflation. And then, while we will have growth in categories like appliances, we
don't anticipate the explosive growth that we had in the first half, just because we're anniversary new brands, so knock
off another 120 basis points, something like that, and you get to the 4%.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Understood. And then one last question: can you talk about what the SG&A impact in
this quarter was – from a leverage perspective, how much the fact that it was driven by traffic versus ticket impacted
leverage overall? Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. Well, first, let me say Marvin and our operations team did a fantastic job of managing
payroll in our stores, given the spike that we saw in our sales growth. We leveraged hourly payroll in the quarter; we
leveraged hourly payroll by 38 basis points, so really excellent work there. There's just some year-over-year
comparisons, Chris, that are kind of distorting the performance in the second quarter, and let me just give you some of
that color. It might help you better understand the shape of the year.
First of all, if you recall, last year we had a good guy coming from workers' comp in the amount of about $42 million.
This was an actuarial reserve adjustment that we had last year. That did not repeat this year, so it gave us some pressure
on a year-over-year basis. Secondly, I called out the gross margin benefit of our newly acquired businesses. Well, they
come with expenses too, so on a year-over-year basis, we had $37 million of expenses from our newly acquired
businesses that we didn't have one year ago.
Now, we will start to anniversary the acquisitions, if you will, towards the back half of the year, so our expenses
become much more in line with the guidance that I've given you. The other thing I'd like to call out, because we're just
so really excited about this for our store associates, as Frank pointed out, we will be paying record Success Sharing
checks for our store associates. The year-over-year increase is $46 million, and in fact is twice as much what we paid in
2011.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: Chris?
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Okay.

<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, guys. Thank you. Carol, quickly, just on D&A, it's flat to down the last few years, but
it's up, I think, about 5% year-over-year in the first half, so just a modeling question: What's driving that, and how
should we be thinking about the growth in D&A going forward?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, it's really a change in the mix of our capital spending. We used to spend most of our
capital on new stores that had long lives. We're now shifting our capital to shorter-lived assets, including IT. So this
year we'll spend about $435 million in IT. The longest life we've got there is six years. Most of it is writing off over
three.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. And so if we think about the 6% comp view you guys have for this year, and let's
assume that persists for the next couple years going forward, is – the OpEx growing 30% of sales, is that kind of a good
benchmark to use, or does it start to evolve as we look out – again, assuming a 6% type comp view?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, for modeling purposes, I would think 30 basis points expense growth is the right number.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, perfect. And then just for Craig, you talked about some of the décor categories. Can
you maybe talk about some of the real remodel categories? I'm thinking things like windows and things like that. Are
you starting to see evidence of that kind of activity starting to pick up in the stores?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, we are. We're starting to see – for example, in lumber, not only did we have some
inflation year-over-year, with about 70 basis points of our comp coming as a result of that, but we also saw unit
productivity, which is our Pro customers starting to come back, solid growth in things like fasteners and pneumatics.
All those are heavy Pro-dominated categories.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, great. Thanks very much, guys.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yep.

We'll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. First, within the product mix, are you
seeing any shift around from opening price points to better and best price points? And then I have a follow-up question.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Not a lot of change, Michael, in the line structure. The only thing I'd point out on that is
where we've had some really nice innovation in things like LED, which carry a higher ticket. Certainly, within the light
bulb category, we're seeing customers step up. The Behr Premium DeckOver is a great product. So we're seeing
customers willing to spend, really, in every segment of the category within a category, whether that be opening price
point, mid, or high.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: And is that because you're seeing customers across all price points come back, which may be
obscuring some of the trade-up, or is there just not really that willingness to trade up at this point?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No, again, I think the innovation in many categories is what's driving the trade-up.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Oh, okay.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: And so customers are willing to step up and spend money when they see great innovation
that either makes a project easier and/or, like in the case of LED, saves them energy cost around the home. They're
definitely willing to step up.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Got it. Sorry, I was confused. The second question I had is, if you look, on a like-for-like basis,
within products, how – and I recognize that you've got 70 basis points of inflation from commodity price increases –
but how are prices trending on like-for-like non-commodity-oriented products, if you look back, say, a year ago?

<A - Craig A. Menear>: I would say that our focus is a relentless focus on driving value for the customer, and we're
always looking to provide a better value. So we're working hard to drive unnecessary cost out, whether that be working
with our suppliers on how we can drive out cost. Our, obviously, supply chain is allowing us to leverage cost, and we're
looking to bring better value to our customer and reduce prices wherever we can.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: If I could just jump in, because Craig mentioned it, but I just want to re-emphasize the point.
We saw an increase in items in the basket this quarter. It contributed 20 basis points of growth to our ticket in the
quarter. It has been a drag since the housing crisis, so we can't overstate the importance of what that means in terms of
recovery, both for our Pros, of course, but as well as our DIY customers.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.

We'll go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: Thanks a lot. My primary question – and then I have a quick follow-up – is just if you could
talk about the evolution of your expanded appliance assortment, talk about the pace of the rollout, just to put it in
context, and compare the rollout in store to the rollout in penetration online, and how far along do you think you are in
realizing the benefits of this rollout process? Thanks?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Okay, Matt, at the end of last year, we had rolled out about 120 stores with an expanded
appliance program. We added brands in the fall season, we added Samsung around the December timeframe, which got
us to the full offering of brands that we have right now. We're in the process right now of expanding another 120 stores
for an expanded showroom experience, and all of those brands are available on homedepot.com, and have been since
last December. And we're seeing a very nice response from the customer.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: So to the extent that you guys cited this as a headwind for the year, it sounds like the rollout
is not yet done, so do you think there could be some ongoing gains from incremental penetration to offset the fact that
you had this in the base a year ago?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, I think we went at the 120 stores last fall. Obviously, we're overlapping that. We
started with some of our best stores where we felt we had the greatest opportunity. So we'll see how that plays out.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: Got it. And then my second question – I think we've come at this maybe a couple different
ways – is it possible to put a number on the comp benefit that you think you captured just in terms of the shift in
volume from Q1 to Q2?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah, we outperformed the guidance that we gave you by about $800 million. And as we look
at that outperformance, the combination of appliances and garden made up 50% of that, and garden would have been
about $200 million of that.
<Q - Matthew Fassler>: And you're talking about – Carol, when you talk about guidance, you're talking about for the
first half of the year or for the second quarter per se?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: For the second quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Second quarter, right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: For the second quarter.

We'll go next to Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. Carol, I wanted to ask on the SG&A, to make sure I got this right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Okay.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: The second quarter, you grew operating expenses over 50% of sales.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: But do you still expect for the year that it'll grow the 30%, or do you think, in the second half,
it'll get back to that 30% level, so that the full year is still running above?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Our guidance is that the full year, expenses will grow at 30% of our sales growth rate.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Now, let's just think about it on a quarterly basis so we can get our models right. If we guide off
of GAAP, in the third quarter of last year, we had expenses associated with our China store closing, so in the third
quarter of this year, our expenses will be under last year. Then in the fourth quarter it'll return to more normal, be more
in the 30% range, so when you add it up for the year, it'll be 30%.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: All right, that's helpful, thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And then I have a bigger-picture question. I think, Frank, it was in your prepared comments,
you talked about getting one of every three online orders now done now through the stores, and that one out of five buy
something else. Could you give us a benchmark of where that was a year ago and where you'd like it to be, or where
you expect it to trend over the next year or two if you do things right?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Greg, we've just started this year with the rollout of Buy Online Ship to Store. Last year
we had Buy Online Pick Up in Store. So there's been a substantial increase in the penetration because of the addition of
Buy Online Ship to Store and the improvement of Buy Online Pick Up in Store. And I would say we don't have a
specific target on what we'd like to see. The customer is going to tell us.
But we think, as I said, that our stores – we want our stores to be a competitive advantage, and we want the
convenience of our stores to be something that our customers see as a value. And we're seeing that now. We're really
pleased with it. It puts a lot of pressure on Marvin and his team because we've got new product rolling into the stores
that they have to be able to respond quickly to the customer desire to pick it up, but that's really one of our long-term
sustaining competitive advantages, we believe.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And if I could, if Marvin's there, just of the added labor hours that you ended up having to put
in this quarter, was it all just related to just overall sales, or was this a particular driver of it?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Overall sales, but we have a very detailed analysis that we conducted at the beginning of the
year, trying to understand where Craig was investing in new merchandising categories, innovation, new products, as
well as where we were forecasting sales. So, to be specific, we made labor investments in Pro in two areas. Speed of
checkout, so we invested in our cashiering. We also invested in loading. Pros want to get in and out fast, so we've made
investments there.
We made investments, obviously, in garden because of just the overall sales trend. And, believe it or not, we made
other investments just in the lot, because the transactions were at a record pace, and we wanted to just provide
assistance with loading and other departments throughout the store. So the overall business drove a lot of the
investment, but also just a penetration of businesses like Pro allowed us to make incremental investments over and
above just the overall business trends.

And we'll go next to Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on another very good
quarter, great performance.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thanks, Budd.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: My question, Carol, for you is, help us walk through the third and fourth quarter sales guidance,
or how you would look at that. I know you walked us through the second half, but maybe you could go and parse some
of those hurdles that you're facing, by quarter, during the second half.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I'd be happy to. On the sales front, you should expect our comps to be in a fairly narrow range,
so as we're guiding to, let's say, 4% for the back half of the year, that gives you an idea. We're going to be in a fairly
narrow range. I've already talked about expenses. Expenses should be lower in the third quarter and then trending more
at our guidance of 30% of sales growth in the fourth quarter. I do want to pause and make sure everyone remembers
that we had that extra week, so you've got to back that extra week out when I talk about guidance here.
The other thing I should comment on is our gross margin performance. As we've looked at our gross margin rate up 16
basis points before the half, and I guided that for the back half of the year it would be about half of that rate, or call it 8
basis points, which translates to 12 basis points for the year; that's actually slightly under what we had planned at the
beginning of the year. But it's purely a reflection of what our consumers are buying in our stores. We are doing a great
job of managing what we control – supply chain leverage, shrink leverage, cost-out – but when a customer comes in
and buys a lower-margin product, we're going to take that sale all day long, and if it impacts our rate performance, it
impacts our rate performance.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. And my follow-up question goes to appliances and cabinets. Do you have a market share
number now for appliances that you could share with us? And I know kitchen was up double-digits, as were appliances.
I don't know if I heard about cabinets in that. I just...
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, Budd, on the appliance side, as reported by independent third parties, on a rolling 12,
we're at about 11.8% in the industry, so we're still a distant third.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: And that's versus about 10% last year, Craig? Is that what I recall?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: 10% and change, yeah...
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: ...so up slightly, yep.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: And cabinets, how are they performing?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Cabinets continue to do well. We had strong growth in our overall kitchen business. We offer
a wide variety of options for our customers, whether that be in-stock cabinets, some custom, fully-assembled, and we
did well in the quarter.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay, and if I could just sneak one other quick one in, supply chain, Carol, you noticed that as a
benefit. We haven't talked about that as much in recent quarters. What do you see going forward for that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We expect to drive continued leverage in our supply chain. Mark Holifield and team continue
to drive productivity improvements. [indiscernible] (45:36) our RDC network is becoming a mature network. But it
doesn't stop there. As you know, we're investing in direct fulfillment facilities. [indiscernible] (45:45) transportation

play will help lower our transportation costs. Our biggest costs have been supply chain transportation. With everything
that Mark and team are doing, not just running better facilities, but managing the optimization of transportation should
help us grow. And as you know, when we set out our roadmap to a 12% operating margin by 2015, supply chain was in
that roadmap, looking at a 20-basis-points benefit.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: And it would seem to be outperforming that now.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, with a double-digit positive comp, we sure hope so.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: But, in 2012, we picked up 3% of that, so there's about 17% to go between now and 2015.

We'll go next to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Hi. Thank you. Carol, could you just detail what the appliance benefit was to comps, both in
the quarter and the first half of the year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, the appliance benefit to the quarter was 80 basis points. Year-on-year, Craig, do you have
that number? I know that appliances are up $307 million year-on-year for the half, but I don't know what the comp is.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah, it was...
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You can back into it.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yeah.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay, got it. And then, Frank, I guess just big-picture, when you see double-digit comps
come through the store, and even if you think about 8% for the first half of the year being much stronger than probably
what anyone would have thought a year ago, does it change the way that you think about the recovery and what the
stores can handle and what this recovery could look like if the housing market keeps unfolding?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: I'll split that into two parts – first, what our stores can handle; and then, second, the broader
comment on the market recovery. In terms of what our stores can handle, as I said in my comments, really an
extraordinary job done by our store associates, our supply chain team, our merchants, and our vendors to respond to a
much sharper increase in sales than we expected. And as I said, again, in my comments, it's easy to say you have a
flexible business model. That puts a lot of pressure on you, and when you just look at the inventory performance, the
leverage in payroll, as well as the sales, we're really pleased with our ability to respond flexibly.
In terms of the overall market recovery, as Carol said, in terms of what's underneath our guidance for the year is the
housing market is clearly an assist to us, and that was something we saw in the second quarter and we saw through the
first half. We expect that to continue in the back half. There are some things we're watchful of, but we expect it to
continue. And then we have some specific things within our business that moderate that, and both Carol and Craig
detailed those.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: And on the front part of that, as far as how the business responded to the strong comps,
would you say that's better than you expected it to be or it met your expectations?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yes, better.

<A - Francis S. Blake>: And I would welcome my colleagues here to speak, because I think it was a difficult quarter.
It's the kind of difficulty that you want to have. You want to be challenged by sales, but it required a lot of flexibility
and responsiveness.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, some of us were here the last time we did a double-digit positive comp, and our execution
was not like it is today.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: And, Dennis, this is Marvin. And Frank said it well. I would just remind people, we don't
increase dock doors or receiving space, and we had record transactions, and the associates, the merchants, the supply
chain deserves a lot of credit. Managing payroll in the environment was tricky, but we have a new payroll system that
Matt Carey and the IT team helped us design about 18 months ago, and it worked perfectly. And so we're very proud.
And we kept our Net Promoter Score year-over-year relatively flat over 70, which any other time we wouldn't be
pleased with flat, but in a record transaction quarter, we feel pretty good about the service levels for all of the
transactions and customers and freight that we had to deal with, so are very pleased.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Dennis, I'd also be remiss if I didn't call out the fact that, between our inventory plan and
replenishment team, our merchants working with our suppliers, our suppliers did an awesome job of working with us to
make sure that product was flowing and be able to take care of the demand spikes. We couldn't have done it without
them.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: So can you handle a 20% comp?

We'll go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Big-picture question, Carol, I wanted to go back – you commented at the end of your prepared
remarks about interest rates is a factor you're watching. I think now in the retail community, higher interest rates are the
latest boogeyman which could derail spending here. The question I have for you is, as you think of Home Depot, if
interest rates started to have an impact on the business, where would you see it? And then the follow-up to that is, and
just to be clear, with interest rates having already ticked up a bit here, have you seen any indications thus far of
skittishness on the part of your consumers as a result of that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, let me answer the latter part of your question first. As we look at the housing drivers that
impact our business, really looking at turnover and home prices, and as you've known, we've seen a nice increase
year-on-year in both of those. And we think, based on forecasts for both housing and turnover, that that'll drive about
250 basis points of our overall growth this year. Now, how do interest rates come into play for prices or turnover? Well,
if you can't get financing, then you can't get things to move. So it could have an impact, but we certainly haven't seen
that to date.
So we've tried to do a lot of modeling and correlations to say, well, what would happen if rates went up another 100
basis points, another 200 basis points? We're not seeing any "thing" that we can point out to as, aha, here's a big

learning, but just our intuition would tell us consumer psyche can change in a higher interest rate environment, so we
want to be cautious.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: And is there any – just a follow-up, is there any historical precedent, if you look at Home Depot
through various interest rate cycles, as to what point higher interest rates could actually impact the business?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: If you go back through time and higher interest rate cycles, we oftentimes powered through
those cycles, so no.

We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citigroup.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered, so this is a little
bit more – smaller question. But I wondered if you could go into a little bit more detail about what you're seeing from
the smaller Pro customer. You highlighted you'd seen an improvement, but have we seen an inflection with this group,
and are they comping positively?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: First, Kate – and I'll turn it to Marvin to respond more fully – but yes, they are positively
comping, and the rate of growth is improving. It's not at the same rate of growth as our larger-spending Pros, but that is
actually consistent with how we thought this would develop. But, yes, it's positive and strong.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: And, Kate, the point I'll add to that is when we dissect the data, understanding why the
larger Pro is growing at a more robust rate, a lot of times it comes down to liquidity and just access to capital. These
smaller Pros are gaining steam. We were very pleased with their performance in the quarter, and just pleased with all of
the partnership with the merchants and getting the products and the prices that they want. And as I mentioned earlier,
we made payroll investments on that side of the building, because they've told us for years, they want to get in and out
fast and they want us to help them grow their business. And we think, because of the investment in payroll, from a
loading, from a service, and some of the customer service initiatives we've put in place, and things as simple as
dedicated parking, which doesn't appear to be important, but to a customer, where time is money, those things are very
critical; we're pleased with the growth and we hope that we continue to see it.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: Marquita, we have time for one more question.

We'll take our last question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Thanks, two questions. One, following up on the appliances, you have it in 120 stores, and you
said you'd do another 120; that still only puts it in a little more than 10% of the store base. Is that the right number
longer-term, or is there something that you'll continue to put that jumbo set in more and more stores over time?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Our intent will be to continue to evaluate the opportunity as we go forward.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Okay. So, again, is there something – I assume these are just better stores, but is there
something specific about these 240-or-so stores that make the appliance work there that wouldn't work elsewhere?

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, as you can appreciate, when we went into this, we looked at some of our highest-volume
stores and those who were closest to our appliance competitors. As we look ahead, we want to make sure that any
incremental investment that we make will be value-creating.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Okay, fair enough. One more, just on leverage and where you are now, I think you're just under
your benchmark of 2.0 times. Earlier in the year, you had talked about potentially taking on more leverage – I think
you'd said in December, if memory serves – later in the year. Where do you stand right now with your outlook on debt?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, our adjusted-debt-to-EBITDAR ratio stands at 1.7 times against a cap, if you will, at 2
times. That gives us about $3.4 billion of borrowing capacity as we stand today. We do have $1.25 billion that comes
due in December, and so we'll take a look at whether or not we want to raise incremental financing at that time.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Above and beyond what's due?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, right.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Right. Okay. Thank you very much.
Diane Dayhoff
