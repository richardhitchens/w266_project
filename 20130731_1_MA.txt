from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are
summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filing.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
Good morning, everybody.
We are very pleased to report EPS growth of 23% for the second quarter. Our net revenue growth was 15%. Operating
expenses grew 5%, and we continued to execute on our global strategy and navigate through what we all know is a
somewhat uncertain economic environment.
So let's take a look first at the U.S. Consumer spending was up last quarter. Retail sales growth was better than
expected. Housing indicators continued to show signs of recovery. Our SpendingPulse data for the second quarter
showed that growth in U.S. retail sales ex-auto was 4%. That is over the same quarter of the prior year. And that is up
from 2.6% as the same number for the first quarter. So contributing to the growth was a steady improvement in
consumer confidence and some stabilization in the employment levels in the country. Our own U.S. business reflected
these improving trends, with 6% volume growth, up from last quarter's 4% growth.
Moving on to Europe, the environment is somewhat similar to what we saw over the last several quarters. There are a
few upbeat notes there. Economic trends were similar for the UK and for parts of continental Europe during the second
quarter. Consumer confidence increased there. Business sentiment was a little weak in the second quarter there,
although recent PMI [Purchasing Managers Index] surveys indicate that business sentiment now may also be turning
up. In spite of those mixed economic signals, we're still seeing opportunities to expand our business and take advantage
of that secular shift from cash to electronic, and that shows up in our solid second quarter volume growth of 14% in
Europe.
In Asia, consumer spending in the second quarter was on the rise. In the majority of markets, consumer confidence
levels are doing well across the region, with key markets like Korea and Japan seeing marked improvement. Business
sentiment across the region was mixed, and that's due to the lingering concerns about the effect of the sluggish Chinese
and European markets may have on the broader Asian export dependent economy. Our business in the region has and
continues to do well. We had volume growth of 21% in Asia.
In Latin America, consumer confidence in both Brazil and Mexico is somewhat challenged, for all the reasons you read
about. And expectations for GDP growth in Mexico have recently been lowered. We're still growing our volume in
Latin America at almost 17%, but clearly we are watching the wider economic trends there very carefully.
So before we go on to some recent business highlights, I thought I'd spend a minute on the legal and regulatory front,
particularly with regard to the U.S. merchant litigation. The merchant opt-out period ended in late May. And as most of
you already know, about 8,000 merchants decided to opt out of the cash settlement. That represents just marginally
over 25% of the total purchase volume over the settlement's timeframe. The defendants as a group had the right to
terminate the settlement agreement because the volume threshold of 25% was exceeded, but elected not to do so. We
expect most of the larger merchants who opted out will file separate actions to recover damages, and many of them
have already started to do so. The final approval hearing is scheduled to begin on September 12. We remain confident
that the settlement will be approved.

We are also pleased that the Canadian Competition Tribunal recently upheld our no-surcharge on all cards and no
discrimination rules in Canada. And in Europe, I know that Javier [Perez] and Noah were on the call with most you last
Thursday to discuss the EC's proposed legislation. So I'm going to spend less time on that, but I do want to offer a
couple of thoughts that I had on my mind on the topic.
We partner with governments around the world in many areas related to electronic payments, but there will be times
when the interests of some of our stakeholders require us to raise concerns about proposed actions. This is one of those
times. We support the European Commission's goals of a secure, efficient, competitive, innovative European payments
industry. We believe that they've made a good start towards recognizing the importance of a level playing field.
It also appears that there's actually potential to further open up and get competition in place for domestic processing.
However, we remain concerned that some of the proposed legislation could have unintended consequences of hindering
competition and innovation. And we remain concerned that this could be harmful to consumers and small merchants in
Europe.
And so in the upcoming debate as this legislation, the proposed legislation winds its way through the process, we're
going to engage with all participants in the process. We will try and ensure the best possible outcome in the best
possible way.
Finally, I want to reiterate Javier's confidence that our model, our business model will adapt as necessary to allow us to
compete effectively and continue to provide innovative payment products and services that our customers want to offer,
consumers want to use, and merchants want to accept, and that's what we are focused on.
So moving from there to some recent business activity, you will get a chance to see a lot of things at our Investor Day
in September, so I'm going to focus our progress here around a few key themes and keep it short. During the quarter,
we continued to sign new agreements supporting the expansion of our credit and debit business. That's the first theme,
including the following examples. In Europe, Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark, will be issuing MasterCard
consumer debit, credit, and commercial cards in ten countries. And together with what we did with Swedbank and
Nordea in the wins there, we expect to grow our total market share by 50% in the Nordic and Baltic regions over the
next five years.
In Korea, we have two new debit wins to help lock in our debit market position. First is the Woori Card, a recent
spinoff of the card division of one of Korea's largest retail banks, and they're now issuing Platinum debit cards with us.
We also recently signed an agreement with Hana SK that will further increase our dominant share of their debit
portfolio.
In the U.S., we continued to aggressively pursue all opportunities in the consumer credit and co-branded space as they
arise. We're pretty confident we're showing regular progress as they come up and we can announce them.
Moving to cross-border, which as you know is an important part of our business, that's the second theme. Let me give
you a flavor of some of our new travel and affluent programs around the world. In the UK, our Access prepaid business
recently launched four new multi-currency Cash Passport programs, all of which are available online. One example is
British Airways launching their Executive Club Cash Passport card with us, which is capable of having up to seven
currencies loaded on the card. In South Africa, Absa Bank, the Barclays Bank in South Africa, launched the country's
first reloadable prepaid travel multi-currency card, which allows for four currencies to be loaded onto the card. And one
of the largest financial institutions the Middle East, Riyad Bank in Saudi Arabia, just launched a gold-plated World
Elite card for their private banking clients. And the benefits include everything from unlimited lounge access and their
cross-border rewards program and the like.
So the third theme, leading the transition to digital payments; we are focused on creating better shopping experiences
for the consumer and more value for the merchants. And let me give you a couple of examples.
First, MasterPass Digital Wallet; that rollout has now expanded to four countries. Canada launched the past quarter.
The UK is launching, as you read in the media, as we speak. With the addition of Web.com – that's a provider of
Internet services for small businesses in the U.S. and Canada, this wallet is now accepted at more than 20,000

merchants globally.
In Singapore, with the addition of Singtel's recent launch of their mCash program, all three telcos in Singapore, Singtel,
StarHub, and M1 now have wallets from MasterCard as the only open-loop payment card option.
Last theme, IPS [Integrated Processing Solutions], our issuer processing platform for debit, ATM, and prepaid; IPS
enables our consumers – our customers rather – to decrease their reliance on their legacy systems, increase their ability
to drive innovation, get to market quicker, reduces some of their costs of complying with some of the increasingly
complex regulatory requirements. In the U.S., KeyBank, Huntington, and USAA all recently completed conversions to
IPS. Wells Fargo is completing a conversion later this year for a commercial prepaid offering. IPS also partners with
Access Prepaid, which is our prepaid program manager, to support global travel programs such as the Qantas
multi-currency card, which I talked about last quarter.
So just to give you a headline on this, in the last couple of years, we have increased our IPS customer base from five to
16. We are now in 23 countries and 17 languages. We can scale and we will scale and we will expand this platform.
So now let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics.
Martina?
Martina Hund-Mejean
Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.
Let me begin on page three of our slide deck, where you can see this quarter the as-reported as well as the FX-adjusted
growth rates are essentially the same. As Ajay, said we are very pleased with our performance this quarter given the
continued slow-growth economic environment. Net revenue growth of 15% combined with operating expense growth
of 5% supported our net income growth of 19%. And EPS growth of 23% also benefited from our share repurchase
programs.
Cash flow from operation was $742 million. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and other liquid
investments of about $5.1 billion.
During the quarter we repurchased almost 1.1 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $580
million. Through July 25, we repurchased almost 300,000 shares at a cost of $174 million. And we now have $1.1
billion remaining under the current board authorization. We will continue to look to repurchase shares on an
opportunistic basis.
So let me turn to page four, and here you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. Our worldwide gross
dollar volume, or GDV, was up 13% on a local currency basis to just over $1 trillion. U.S. GDV grew 6%, with credit
volumes growing 3%. And U.S. commercial credit growth was in the low teens, similar to last quarter. U.S. consumer
credit growth was slightly positive, also an improvement from last quarter.
Our U.S. debit growth was 9%, driven by higher growth across all of our consumer and commercial debit as well as
prepaid programs. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 17% on a local currency basis. This continues to be
driven by APMEA [Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa] with more than 20% growth, and solid 14% and 17% growth in
Europe and LAC [Latin America/Caribbean] respectively. Cross-border volume grew 17% on a local currency basis,
including more than 20% in LAC and APMEA, and growth in the high teens in Europe.
So turning to page five, processed transactions grew over 11% globally. In the U.S., we saw growth of 5%, which was
lower than last quarter as we anniversaried our PIN debit processing wins. As you know, we are managing PIN debit
transactions to optimize our revenue, and our transaction level has remained about the same over the past several
quarters.
Outside the U.S., processed transactions grew 20%. We saw increased growth in all regions, with particular strength in
Brazil, Russia, Australia, the Netherlands, and South Africa. Globally, the number of cards grew 8% to 1.9 billion

MasterCard and Maestro branded cards.
Let me now turn to page six for some insights on our revenue. Within our net revenue growth of 15%, gross revenue
grew 12%, in line with volume and transaction drivers as well as some pricing. Rebates and incentives only increased
by 2%. As you know, the rebates and incentive line can move around on a quarter-to-quarter basis depending on the
timing of deals.
Specifically in the second quarter, we had two factors that contributed to this relatively low growth rate. First, some
contracts were not yet signed by quarter close. And second, we had some lumpiness due to the performance of a few
contracts. Overall, these factors represented about 2.5 percentage points of our total 15% net revenue growth.
Similar to the prior quarter, growth in domestic assessment was again driven by strong growth outside of the U.S.,
which comes at a lower yield. And the gap between the growth in cross-border volume and revenue continued to be due
to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity excluding the impact of pricing.
So let's look at the components of total operating expenses, which you see on page seven. The increase in G&A
expense was primarily driven by the impact of higher compensation costs as a result of the increase in the number of
employees compared to the same time last year to support our growth initiatives. The slight increase in advertising and
marketing expense was mainly due to the impact of new and renewed sponsorships.
Turning to slide eight, let's discuss what we have seen for the third quarter through July 28. Globally, our cross-border
volumes grew about 15%, so that's just slightly below of what we saw in the second quarter. And this was primarily
driven by slower growth outside the U.S. due to the timing of Ramadan. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 9%,
up from our second quarter growth due to improvements in both credit and debit.
Processed volume growth outside of the U.S. grew 16%. That's about equal to what we saw in the second quarter. And
in particular, our European processed volume growth was in the mid-teens, very similar to what we saw in the second
quarter. Globally, processed transaction growth was 14%, so up from the 11% that we saw in the second quarter, driven
by higher growth in the U.S. for both credit and debit.
Looking forward, let me start with our long-term performance objectives, which have not changed. We remain
confident that our business can deliver an 11% to 14% net revenue CAGR and at least 20% EPS CAGR over the 2013
to 2015 period. And these growth rates are on a constant currency basis and they exclude any new acquisitions. We also
remain committed to our annual operating margin target of at least 50%. However, assuming that the economic
environment remains similar to where it is today, we now expect that net revenue and EPS growth in the early part of
this three-year period will likely be at the low end of our stated ranges for net revenue growth and EPS growth, and that
is slightly better than we previously anticipated.
Now I'd like to share with you a few specific thoughts about 2013. So given our stronger than expected second quarter
net revenue growth and what we see for rebates and incentives for the balance of the year, we now believe that second
half net revenue growth will be similar to what we saw in the first half. We continue to anticipate total 2013 operating
expenses to grow a bit below the 8% currency adjusted growth rate that we saw in 2012, as we continue to spend on the
right things to support our growth initiatives while keeping an eye on more discretionary spending.
We also continue to foresee some operating margin expansion in 2013. The amount of any improvement, as you know,
will depend on both top line growth and the investment opportunities that may surface during the year. And for your
modeling purposes, we now think that you could see a full-year tax rate of about 31%.
With respect to FX, if rates remain the same as they are today, so that is the euro continues to trade at the $1.33 level
and the Brazilian real at the BRL2.26 level for the rest of the year, the impact of the euro and the real will essentially
offset each other for full-year 2013.
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?

Thanks, Martina. We're now ready to begin the Q&A period. In order to get to as many people as possible, we ask that
you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Maurer from CLSA. You may go ahead.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yes, good morning. I'd wanted to ask a follow-up to the European discussion. In terms of EU
assessment revenue, what percentage of that is earned on a per volume, on a volume basis versus a card licensing basis,
as it would seem that there might be some rules preventing you from assessing on transactions where your scheme was
not used to process even though your brand was present?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Hey, Craig, this is Martina. I think I'll take that question. First of all, what I presume
that you're actually asking about, Article 8 on co-batching and the EC proposed legislation. Look, we obviously know
the number when you just strictly look at volume-based assessment fees that we earn in Europe on domestic
transactions that we do not process. And by the way, it's not material to our overall MasterCard numbers. But I'm a
little bit reluctant to put out this number here at this point in time and really for a couple of reasons. One, this is one of
the sections of the proposal where the language is actually unclear. And second, there are a number of puts and takes in
the entire legislation, which makes it clearly difficult for us at this point to estimate what part of this revenue figure
might actually be subject to this potential provision.
It all is basically wrapped up in terms of for us being difficult to understand the intent of this co-batching provision. So
imagine, when an issuer elects to put our brand on a card, they must have a reason for doing so, presumably because
their consumer recognizes and values our brand and therefore uses his or her card with the MasterCard brand on it.
That brings value to our stakeholders in the system. Of course, we are not going to provide our brand for free, and we
don't believe that that could be the intention of the EC. On the other hand, there are also some other provisions in the
proposal which could, as you know, allow for more competition in domestic processing, which we would certainly
welcome. So once we get more clarification from the EC, we think that we still have quite a bit of work to do to get our
hands around the provision and how that could impact us, if at all.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. You may go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I think I had a question about the rebates and incentives line. It looks like there
was some kind of restatement as well. It was about $21 million or so for last year's number. I was wondering if,
Martina, you could just talk about that a little bit. And then just as far as the assumption going forward on rebates,
should we expect that those levels remain fairly low, consistent with the second quarter? Thanks.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Sanjay, let me take the first one, which is really a reclassification. So we had some of
our advisory services both reflected in the gross revenue line and in the contra line. All we did is we collapsed them in
the gross revenue line. But from a net revenue point of view, there's absolutely no difference. And all we did is we
reclassed the numbers for 2012 so that as the accounting change came in on January 2013, you were looking at apples
to apples. Okay, so that's on the reclass.
In terms of the rebates and incentives, what you saw in Q2 was really a much lower growth rate on the rebates and
incentives than you would normally see, and I said there are two factors. One is we didn't get to sign all of the contracts

that we thought we would sign by the end of the quarter. Those contracts will be showing up either in the third quarter
or in the fourth quarter, so you cannot assume this level of rebates and incentives going forward. It will go back to what
you normally see with the lumpiness. This is a little bit more lumpy, of course, in the second quarter than we normally
have. And then secondly, I think I did explain that we had a couple of performances on a number of contracts where we
paid out lower incentives than otherwise anticipated.
So do not take this increase in rebates and incentives for Q2 and apply it for the rest of the year. You really need to go
back to my comment where I said that net revenues for the second half of the year will probably come in similar to
what we saw in the first half of the year and that bakes in our assumptions for rebates and incentives.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Perfect, thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. You may go ahead.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask on the revenue side of things. It looked like both the
purchase volume yield on domestic assessments as well as the revenue per processed transaction, or I should say the TP
rev per processed transaction, were both down year over year. I think on the purchase volume yield on the domestic
assessments, it was the lowest we've seen in a while. And on the transaction processing rev per processed transaction, it
was down year over year in Q2, I think almost as much as in Q1 despite the Durbin routing dynamics anniversary. Can
you just comment on those metrics, if there were any anomalies in those numbers, or how we might think about them
for the second half?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Yes, Jason, first of all, this trend we have now for a number of quarters. First of all,
let's talk about the domestic assessment. What we have, we have particular growth coming in terms of jurisdictions
outside of the United States. Often enough, we have to obviously compete with what's going on from a domestic
pricing point of view. So where we have the growth, they do come at a lower yield. That's number one. Number two,
you also see when you look at our statistics that we put out that we have relatively larger growth on cash transactions in
those jurisdictions versus POS transactions, and those do impact the yield too. So by the way, this is nothing different.
As we're going to grow in those kinds of jurisdictions and really expand our business outside of the United States even
more, you will see these trends continuing.
From a transaction point of view, I think I said something as part of the transaction volume that we're seeing. We saw
particular growth in Brazil, in Russia, in actually Poland, Netherlands still, some Australia. And those actually do drive
also that differential between what you see on transaction growth versus what you see from a transaction yield point of
view; again, nothing different than what we've had before.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Jason, this is Ajay. Just think about what will add to the first part of the question. Think
about things like what we're doing in Nigeria and South Africa with Social Security payments. What tends to happen is
the consumer who gets an electronic card for the first time tends to in the beginning go even more for cash than the
average consumer in our portfolio. So if we keep doing this well and we keep trying to intervene in the cash flow
between governments and consumers, which is a large part of where the cash comes from, you will first find them
going to cash. Then all the efforts kick in around what we call the five-step program to take people from using cash at
an ATM to eventually going more and more to delivering at a point of sale. And that five-step program takes a certain
number of years and a certain set of events to happen. So you're going to see this build and develop. That's an important
part of the nature of what we're trying to drive.
<Q - Jason A. Kupferberg>: All right, so it's a mix shift during the transition. Okay, thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yes, absolutely. Jason, it's not even a transition that will happen in a year or two. This
theme, as you can imagine, with 85% of the world's transactions in cash, there's a whole game to be played out here. So
you're going to get this mix of cash and POS. And then in some countries, the POS picks up. In others, cash remains
strong, and it takes a certain time for that mix to go the right way.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. I guess as we've discussed on previous calls, U.S. credit you had said was
slightly positive and slightly better than the first quarter. But obviously, the first quarter was a weak quarter because of
comparison. And it seems like it accelerated somewhat less even than what you had cited as overall retail spending and
as your debit spending. We've seen a little bit of success in what you've done with BankAmericard on the credit side;
anything else that you can point to in terms of strategies and tactics? And can you also give us an update on the
American Airlines contract?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So no update on American Airlines because I can't anywhere where I can tell you
anything about it. If I knew anything, you can appreciate I wouldn't tell you on a call like this. So that one wouldn't
happen; we're in negotiations with them, as is everybody else. So there's a lot going on there. But we're all in
negotiation.
The first part, nothing has changed. We know that U.S. consumer credit is what we have to work on. We've got a series
of things that we've been doing over the last period of time to try and improve the trajectory of our U.S. consumer
credit spend growth. Some of it is caused by deals we're winning, whether it be all the things we've announced over
time. You've talked to Bank of America doing things with us, but there's a series of other deals from Bass Pro and
Intercontinental Hotel Group to other banks like KeyBank and [ph] Suffrington (31:15) and Huntington and SunTrust
and all that that's going on. So all those things take a certain time to begin accumulating in the book, just as losses take
a certain time to reflect in the book, as you know, in the past; so we're working our way through it.
There are a number of opportunities around co-branding. There are a number of opportunities around things like we're
doing with Bank of America, where it's not wholesale flips but it's the opportunity to work together in specific areas
that we are working with. Some of those deals couldn't get announced because they weren't signed. Some of those got
signed. And so that's one of the lumpiness in our numbers in Q2. So stuff is going on. And we will have ups and downs
as we go along, but we've got a pretty clear pathway to working on both co-brands and the effort to win business with
banks that are currently higher market share with other competitors. That's the work.
The third aspect is that the nature of our book and its performance depends a little bit on the nature of our customers'
books and their performance. And as the banking industry, more and more of the banking industry comes back to a
more normal keel on the credit book as the economy improves, I think we are the net beneficiary of that as well. I don't
think that has shown up adequately as yet in our book. So we've got these three things going on.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. You may go ahead.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks, guys. You beat across a number of metrics clearly in the quarter, including
incentives. And also your cross-border yield came in pretty strong. When you say you now raised expectations,
obviously, versus the low end – or to the low end of your range versus, obviously, in the early years being below that
previously, could you just give us a sense specifically which metrics are coming in now better than you initially
anticipated at the beginning of the year to drive that?

And then maybe more specifically on cross-border, the second part of the question, the volume growth of 17% versus
revenues of 20%, how much of that is actually pricing versus mix, just because we want to – especially since we've
seen volume growth exceeding revenue growth over the last several quarters? Thanks a lot.
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Darrin, on the metrics, first of all what we're seeing is that from a domestic volume
point of view, we see improvements in a number of regions versus what we have seen before. To see what's going on in
the U.S., even though we would still think this is a pretty slow growth environment, it is feeling a little bit better than
earlier this year and certainly than late last year. Look at all of the press that is coming out of Europe. It's starting to
feel better. In fact, all of our European countries grew except for Spain. Spain, there's a little bit of an issue, but you
read the recent articles, it seems like that even that country starts to feel a little bit better going forward. So I think we're
just seeing a little bit more robustness coming in than what we assumed before.
In terms of your question on the cross-border volume versus the revenue side, so what you really have to contrast is our
cross-border volumes grew 17%, and you saw that our revenues grew 19%. Really, what we have in there is we had
this quarter, the U.S. acquirer support fee coming in; that's the first quarter that's coming in. It will be with us for
another three quarters. That would reflect about eight percentage points of that 19%. So if you take that out, you
compare 11% revenue growth to the 17% volume. And that difference, that six percentage points difference is exactly
what we had before in all of our prior quarters in terms of what's happening from the intra-Europe mix on cross-border
versus inter-Europe mix.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Right
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Remember intra-Europe mix comes with a lower yield than inter. And so that's, again,
nothing new, a continuing trend, and that's what we're seeing.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So the only thing I'd add to that, Darrin, is remember I've been saying for a while that I
expected the second half in the U.S. to be better than the first half. I've said that now for three quarters. I still believe
that. The difference is the second quarter came in better in U.S. spending than we thought it would when we first made
that statement. So what's happening is a little bit of that improvement that we thought we'd get in the U.S. in the second
half feels like it's come a couple of months before what we've already factored in for our thinking when we spoke to
you about our estimates of how this year will go sometime back. But that little extra is what you're seeing show up in
the second quarter results, one of the things that's driving it. There are lots of others. There's cross-border. There's stuff
in other countries and all that. But the U.S. is at the end of the day 40% of our revenue give or take. And so that number
still drives a change in what we think, and that's an important part of the context.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.
<Q - Smittipon Srethapramote>: Yes, hi. I was wondering if you can give us an update on what you expect to see
happen in China. Our understanding was that the government over there was supposed to respond to the WTO by
actually today.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Yes, so I think the way they're looking at it, my sense is that they are supposed to clarify
certain things with their actual policy. I think they believe they still have a month or two to respond in. We're waiting
for that come out. They're periodically talking to us as well as other players and clarifying that they have certain parts
around how to open up. But in truth, we don't have enough of a picture to be able to give you a better answer, just we're
there talking to them all the time and they're working their way through their path.

<Q - Smittipon Srethapramote>: Right.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: There's the normal issuance of co-brand cards going on. And as I've been telling you,
we've been winning most of the deals. We're still in that same position. We just got a couple of approvals for
co-branded cards there. We issued those. Work has started on those. We've got the deal with Alibaba moving in the
direction we wanted it to go. We've had that whole report about one cross-border e-commerce player who used to do
clearing in renminbi in Hong Kong, which the CBRC [China Banking Regulatory Commission] felt wasn't quite within
what they want to do going forward. That one held up. But everything else is carrying on. So China is going along
where it is today, but everybody is waiting for the new policy.

Our next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stifel. You may go ahead.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about – I know there's a lot on processed
transaction growth and transaction growth, but the numbers in Europe particularly look really strong, especially on a
core basis, accelerating sequentially. Is it macro, or are you still seeing the benefit of deals like the Netherlands and
Italy? Are there new deals that you potentially are signing in Europe? It's just that the European transaction and core
members look very strong.
And just one additional question, if I could; I just see a Bloomberg headline about a judge rejecting the debit fee
regulation from the Fed. Any color there would be helpful, thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So the Bloomberg headline, we're talking to you, so we don't have access to Bloomberg
terminals here, so I have no idea what that one is about. Noah, do you know anything about it?
<A - Noah J. Hanft>: No.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: I don't know about it. That's a separate conversation. The Europe one, the best way to
answer is both. You are getting some improvement in macro. But we continue, as we've been telling you in our
conversations, we continue to win deals and win share both with institutions in Europe. But also remember, we
continue to get some transactions out of different places as the SEPA [Single Euro Payments Area] migration allows us
to win some domestic processing across the country – across the countries in Europe. Martina?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Let me just add something to that, Chris, because Javier actually mentioned at last
Thursday's conference call that we process well below 50% of the POS transactions done on our cards in the EEA
[European Economic Area]. And actually when we put all the numbers properly together, and it's actually just below
40%; and by the way, if you include both POS and cash transactions, we only process about 25% of the transactions
done on our cards. And so that's why we're saying there is just absolutely plenty of opportunity for us to compete in
domestic processing. We've done that over the last four or five years as SEPA came in, and hopefully with some of the
changes in the regulation we might be able to do even more there.
<Q - Christopher C. Brendler>: Can I ask real quickly your thoughts on whether or not the regulation in Europe
would slow the progress on MasterCard's ability to gain processing share or somehow increase it, or is it about the
same?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So what Martina was saying just now would indicate that I don't believe it's going to
slow it down, and that's where we both are. As you can imagine, we've had a fair series of discussions in the company
around this. The fact is that until everything becomes really clear, until it goes through the next – it could take a year, it
could take two years for this to become really implemented. So I don't know how to answer that any better because
that's just the way the European legislative process will work. In the meantime, we're counting on winning domestic
processing business because there's so much space for us to win in. We were a very small portion of domestic
processing until a few years ago. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Glenn Fodor from Autonomous Research. You may go ahead.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into your financial goals
just a little bit. You've made it very clear you're aggressively focusing on energizing the U.S. credit portfolio, but that
takes time, investment, and obviously incentives. So can you just give a sense of how much improvement here, such as
new customer wins and such, you have baked into these three-year financial goals?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Look, Glenn, you just have to go back to what we have put up at the last Investor Day.
There's this one chart which clearly shows you the three drivers of our growth. One is PCE [Personal Consumption
Expenditure] growth, and we assume 4% to 5% per year on average over the long term. The second one is the secular
growth, which is basically the conversion from cash to check to electronic forms of payment. That's 4% to 6% per
annum roughly over a longer term. And then in addition to that, you saw two, three, four percentage points on top of it
in terms of strategic investment. And strategic investment actually includes a number of things. It includes things that
we're doing in the digital space. It includes things that we might be doing from a market share point of view. Those are
all of the things that were baked in, and that's out there and we haven't changed our view on that one iota.
<Q - Glenn T. Fodor>: Thanks, Martina.

Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but I'm just curious. Going back to the
big news of last quarter on this Visa-Chase deal, has there been any new perspective you guys have gotten from other
bank participants and how you guys are thinking about that relationship as, with other potential banks, how MasterCard
works with? That's question A. Then question B, I'm still curious to know if you guys have any idea if Chase is going
to move some volume off of MasterCard over to Visa as a result of this deal. Thanks.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Hi, Bryan. So, Bryan, I wonder what the other questions were. So the first one,
Visa-Chase, no, nothing new, there's actually the same series of conversations that are going on. A number of the other
banks are obviously concerned about what this means longer term, but everybody is waiting and watching to see how
this gets implemented. And I know we're in those dialogues with a number of them. It does help to help open doors for
us, without a doubt. But beyond that, I've got no new perspective for you there.
Will Chase move volume over to Visa? We've also got volume coming to us from Chase. The Intercontinental Hotel
Group co-brand is a Chase co-brand which we just won. So will they move volume? I assume they would move some.
I'm not inside of Chase discussing this. But as being a banker in my previous life, I would still like to keep doors open
with more than one of my foot because it suits me when I'm a banker. Does that mean that the shares will not change
and the proportions will not change? I would assume that the proportions will move towards the one you've chosen to
put more investment with. And so I actually believe that to be the case. I just don't know factually what they'll do.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks so much.

<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Great. Ajay, when we were at the last Investor Day together, you had mentioned that once
you show us margin above 55%, it was going to be hard to go backwards. We're running two quarters into the year at
north of 58%. The full-year guidance suggests something around 50%. What's the delta there for the rest of the year as
you guys think about the margin profile? And why should your margin step back here from the 58% level or so?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Good question. I don't think it's going to go back to 50%. We never set 50% as the
guidance. We just said a minimum of 50%. As I told you, I did that when I came in because I found that at that time we
were out there saying we're going to continuously increase our margin by a few hundred basis points every year. And I
didn't feel that was a strategic goal for the company compared to growing our franchise, growing our revenue, and
converting cash. I just thought that's a much better way of thinking about what the company is trying to do than trying
to put a margin growth target where you already have a relatively attractive margin in the company. Having said that,
our margins tend to be a little variable by quarter. So the fact that we've got 58% right now, from what I recollect
normally the fourth quarter has a relatively low margin. And I think that's been the case for the three or four years – I've
been here four years now. It's been the case for these three or four years that I've seen it. So I think the annual margin
tends to settle at a different number. But it's really since the fourth quarter also is a relatively large quarter in many
other ways.
So I don't know that you would assume that 58% is [ph] a measuring stick (46:26). I will tell you this. We're very
focused on not going and throwing away money just because the margin is higher. We're also focused, as I said, on
taking away pricing as the only way to grow, although as I said many times, we work on many lines of pricing every
quarter, and the results show up. This quarter there is a certain amount of pricing. This pricing will give us some benefit
for a couple of more quarters to come. We tinker around with pricing every quarter. There are thousands of lines in 200
countries, and that's a fair opportunity.
So will it be a high increase in pricing, low increase in pricing? Remember this; I'm not into pricing as a way to grow
revenue. I'm going to try to fight that 85%. But we will do what we can at the right time with pricing and with margin.
So I'll still stick around that 50% minimum. That's to reassure investors that we're not going to throw the money away.
But we are not going to give you a estimate that it will go down or up just because we have quarterly variances. And all
we have to do is put some more money into a series of investments and we'll take a couple of quarters where the margin
will be lower than it is today. It will still be for the year above 50%; that I promise you.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Got it, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. You may go ahead.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Yes, so I guess on a related note on the margin front, it's encouraging to hear that macro is
starting to improve some in certain parts of your business, particularly in the U.S., and maybe even some early signs in
Europe. Does that at all change your view on margins going forward? In other words, in years where the revenue
growth is weak, you seem to give some margin expansion to help with the earnings growth. But if the macro continues
to get better, how does that affect the outlook on the margin front?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Rod, let me just jump in here. First of all, we are not running the business based on a
particular margin. As Ajay just said, we put a margin minimum in place to make absolutely sure that our investors
understand that we look at every investment that we do in the company critically, and that we do it in such a way that
we get returns from it. That's how we look investments. And really how we run the company is looking at these
investments, making these investments every year, every quarter as we see fit. And we think that based on our current
business trajectory, the way the business that we have today that we will be at a minimum 50% margin. We do not run
the business for margin expansion per se.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: That cuts across whether the economy is doing better or worse. That's not what we're
doing, and so I wouldn't assume any change based on the U.S. economy looking better or not better. Nothing changes

in our strategy.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Just to clarify, does that mean as we move into 2014, your view on margins is still keeping
margins in the around 50% range?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Absolutely, Rod. Our annual operating margin minimum that we put out for three
years is 50%, and it's the minimum. That doesn't mean that it couldn't go higher, and it's mostly because of revenue
growth. But it's a combination of where the revenue growth comes in and the investments we decide to make in the
company.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Understood. And then on the pricing front, you mentioned that pricing was somewhat of a
benefit. Can you quantify? Was it a 1% benefit?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Rod, it was 4% in total on the revenue line.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: 4% in total. And then that benefit, does it taper off in the next couple of quarters?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: So there are a couple of pricing in there. One I already mentioned, which was the U.S.
acquiring support fee, which just started this quarter. That's going to be with us for the next three quarters, and that was
probably about half of the price changes. And then we had a couple of other small ones. One anniversaried this quarter,
which was the acquirer license fee, which we have talked about. And then there's a very small one, which you know
that we've been starting to put through, which is pricing related to the Digital Wallet operators, but we're talking about
smaller numbers going forward.

Our next question comes from Bill Carcache from Nomura Securities. You may go ahead.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks, good morning. Ajay, I was hoping you could give us a sense of whether in your
conversations you see any indication of certain groups in the industry moving closer to thinking of debit as just being
debit, with the distinction between PIN and signature just not being as important. For example, in your discussions with
issuers just given that their economics are identical for both now, do you see the distinction continuing to be drawn?
And then I guess for the industry as a whole, I guess ex-market share shifts, do you have a sense for whether there has
been any notable shift in the mix of signature versus PIN transactions post all the Durbin regulation?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Both great questions, Bill. So the second one, about the industry as a whole, has there
been a move from signature to PIN, actually not identifiably so. Has there been a move from debit to credit, not
identifiably so. Do people talk about in the banking industry and the merchant business, do they talk about expecting
changes? Yes, but it's been about a year now and it hasn't really delivered great change. And I think finally it's not
about the bank and the merchant. It's about the consumer and what they want to do. I think the consumer is unimpacted
by this dialogue in most ways other than seeing indirect impact caused by an increase in checking fees or a drop in free
checking accounts and so on. They don't in their minds necessarily connect one to the other. And I think they're still
behaving the way they choose to behave, which is to use their debit when they want and their credit when they want.
They're impacted more by overall trends in the economy. So I think as the U.S. economy continues to recover, generate
jobs and the like, you will probably see an increase in credit spending that may be faster than debit, but that still is out
there to be seen. This is past cycles I'm talking about. So I'd say nothing much right now.
<Q - William Carcache>: Okay, that's really helpful, Ajay; if I may, one last follow-up here. Can you comment on the
Isis announcement of its national rollout? We've seen a number of reports suggesting that the rollout of NFC is just
pretty unexciting. But can you share your thoughts on the growth outlook for NFC as you see it over the course of the
next say 12 to 18 months? Thanks.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: NFC to me has opportunities because it is a technology that is applicable not just to
payments, but also delivering things around security and things around loyalty and so on and so forth. I think anything
that goes beyond just payments to the whole shopping experience to the whole consumer experience, to the merchant's
experience is an important aspect in the upcoming transition that's going on between physical and digital. That's how I
think about it. I don't think these are 12 and 18-month things, Bill, because just think of the ecosystem and the
infrastructure that needs to be built for any of these to happen. And so I tend to look on it as a longer-term effort.
And I think that most people would say if you look at contactless payments in Australia, as an example, I was looking
at data the other day. Something like 25% or 30% of all transactions in Australia under Australian $100 comes out of
contactless. That's a big number compared to where they used to be two years ago. Now will it go even higher,
probably. Will it take years to happen, probably. So some countries like Australia, Canada, and Turkey are further
ahead in NFC than others. Remember, we run a business in so many countries, it's a mixed bag, and it's tough to
generalize across all of them. But in general I think NFC has got opportunity. I'm not sure that I can tell it to you in 12
to 18 months.

Our next question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. You may go ahead.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Thanks, I wonder. Can you give us an update on your joint venture with Telefónica in Latin
America, and what's happening there, and what you've learned so far?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Sure, so we've got two different JVs with them. We've got the one that's in 12 countries
excluding Brazil, what we call Wanda. And then you've got Zuum, which is in Brazil because of the way Telefónica
was constructed when these JVs were signed. So in the first one, Argentina was the first one to go out. And they
actually used the mobile wallet that exists in the joint venture we have with SMART Telecom in the Philippines, called
MPS [Mobile Payments Solution], so that's the first one out there.
The second one, Zuum, was just launched in April actually, I think just around the time of our first quarter earnings call
or just after or just before; I'm forgetting. That's the first mobile program in the region that has a MasterCard prepaid
companion card in addition to the mobile wallet, so two different kinds of flavors. My sense is the concept of having a
prepaid card as a companion card attached to the mobile payment will probably drive this faster than just the mobile
payment by itself only because of my answer to Bill's question. Building ecosystems around new things takes time. The
card acceptance system, even if it's not completely built out in Brazil, is way more built out than a mobile-only
payment system. So that's the first learning we've got. I think we've got a lot of learnings about working with
Telefónica. We've now actually in the last three, four months, I forget when, we've launched two more initiatives with
them, both in Europe. I think there's something in the Czech Republic, and there's something with them in Germany
that we are doing. So the relationship has expanded a little bit beyond the original construct in Latin America.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Okay, thanks.

Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan from Janney. You may go ahead.
<Q - Thomas C. McCrohan>: Hi, Ajay. Most of the questions in the quarter were answered. I'll ask a bigger picture
question. When you joined MasterCard three years ago, you talked about innovation and the importance of that. I was
wondering if there's any way you can speak to how you're tracking to creating that culture in terms of financials? How
much of your revenue, for example, revenue growth the last few years was a function of new product introductions or

new innovations? And as you look forward into your three-year financial outlook, how much of that is going to be –
how much of the growth is going to be attributable to some innovations that MasterCard is developing today?
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: So we don't put out a measure of any innovation index, which is what you're referring to.
But as Martina just explained in an answer to Rod a little while ago, if you think about our three-year projection on
revenue growth, those two, three, four percentage points at the end that she was talking about are from innovation in
new product, from things like data analytics, which to me is a relatively new product, all the way to changes in market
share and growth, whether it be U.S. credit or, frankly, U.S. debit or all the things we're doing overseas as well. So you
can see it's in that ballpark, in that block of 2%, 3%, 4%.
My whole attempt around innovation was to change the way we went to market, so that we didn't just sell credit, debit,
prepaid, and commercial, but we looked at diversifying that growth from the core product, both in terms of geographies
and in terms of the kind of clients we worked in. So there you can see 30-odd deals with mobile telecom operators in
the last two years. We had none three or four years ago. In fact, the dialogue used to be how they wouldn't need the
banks and the networks to be able to grow. I think that demonstrates clearly that we have been able to show that our
product set and technologies adapted to mobile payments can work with them. I was just talking about Telefónica, but
there are examples like that and a number of others. I talked about Singtel and the other telcos in my call as well. So
that's the first part.
The second part around innovation has to do with mobile payments, e-commerce, and the whole aspect of information
services. We're making a lot of progress on all three. Mobile I just talked about. We've done a lot of work in
information services and data analytics. So that's where we are. I don't have an innovation index that I'm going to give
you publicly because the issue is what's a new product. In a consumer product company, you can evaluate it in different
ways. What's the new product for us? Is a credit card with a new set of features a new product, or is a new product only
that which comes in a new delivery channel? And then you get into endless discussions about that.
I'm much more focused on measuring our ability to generate new ideas in the company, do solution-based selling to our
clients, and see the impact on our brand. And our brand has gone from being number 87 in the Brand Index, evaluated
by clients, to number 20 in four years, and we spent about the same or a little less money than we used to. That's all
part. If you look at that Brand Index, it talks about innovation as being a big driver of the change. So that's how I
measure it right now. Maybe a few years down the road, Martina will actually allow me to talk about an innovation
index and I'll let you deal to her on that one.
<Q - Thomas C. McCrohan>: Thank you.
<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: Okay.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator
Our final question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi. Thanks, good morning, good quarter. I just want to ask a couple follow-ups. I guess on
product innovation, at Visa's Investor Day, they talked about – I was trying to look up the number, something like $200
million in the last two years in product innovation. I'm curious. How does that compare roughly to what MasterCard
spent in product innovation?
And then my follow-up, I just wanted to clarify it from Martina. The other line was a little bit better than we had
modeled. Does that capture the pricing you referred to beyond the cross-border change?
<A - Martina Hund-Mejean>: Tien-tsin, let me just take other revenues first. So in other revenues, actually what
you're seeing showing up is some really nice growth in our Access Prepaid business as well as in our advisors business.
Ajay already talked about some of the proof points, such as in Australia et cetera that we're doing with both of those
businesses, in addition to a couple of the price increases that I talked about which are reflected in other revenues.

<A - Ajaypal Singh Banga>: For the most part, Tien-tsin, I don't know how Charlie [Scharf] measured the numbers. I
haven't had a chance to understand what's inside that number. Investor Day is not that far away, so we'll chat with you
then on that topic. But the issue is what's inside of that, answering to the earlier question, makes all the difference. For
example, all the work we're doing on fraud tools, is that innovation? In a sense it probably is because it's developing
entire new forms of technology. All the work we're doing on tokenization, is that innovation? It probably is if it
delivers a new way of dealing with safety. All the work we're doing with true access to drive merchant funded loyalty
programs around the world, is that innovation and R&D? Probably, we've got MasterCard Labs. We've got different
portions that are delivering this answer.
I actually don't look at it that way. I look at it, as I said in the earlier question, of funding this in many different ways,
but most importantly in changing the way we talk to merchants and banks and governments about relating with them in
a most solution-based selling way. So the example with Nigeria where they were trying to do an ID scheme, which
ended up being not just that, but also a payment scheme with a card that's two-sided with a chip, we spent money on
that. Is that innovation? We spent money on biometric identification for the UID in India. So I don't want to get into
I've counted this and not counted that and create some new metric that everybody will try and track, but you should
know that there are a ton of people in this company whose only job is they if want to come to work on January 1, 2014,
they better have new ideas or they won't be around; that I can promise you.
<A - Barbara L. Gasper>: Ajay, do you have so closing comments?
Ajaypal Singh Banga
I do, after all that. Okay, so how do I think about this? We delivered pretty solid results for the first half of this year,
driven off, as we've talked about, a little bit of volume and transaction growth around the world. Worldwide GDV
crossed the $1 trillion level for the first time in the quarter. When Martina was reading aloud, I was looking at that as a
milestone in some ways, but on to the next $1 trillion already. And our first half net revenue growth was a bit better
than forecasted for all the reasons we talked about.
We remain confident about the three-year performance objective that we've got out there. And we're working hard to
deliver on another good year, in spite what I consider to be somewhat unpredictable economic conditions. My view is
that the secular trends in our industry are of great interest to me. They are strong drivers for top line growth, even in
slower economic environments.
So I'm looking forward to seeing most of you at Investor Day in September. I think you'll get a chance to hear about
our strategic focus areas, the experiences that we've done for the last couple of years. We've got some really innovative
products and services. We've got really cool ones lined up for you this year, so hopefully that will be fun. In the
meantime, thank you for your support and thank you for being on the call with us today.
