Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Fourth quarter EPS was $0.55 or $690 million and
that includes $0.04 of primarily M&I expense.
Total revenue grew 14% year-over-year and 9% versus the third quarter. Significantly, 38% of all our revenue came
from outside the U.S., which is a new record for us. And to put that into perspective, in 2007 that number was 32%. So
we continue to become a more global company.
NII was stable. Our growth came from fee revenue, which was 11% during the quarter, our best quarter since the
financial crisis began back in 2008. In the 11% growth, there's virtually no impact from acquisitions because they had
essentially started at the beginning of the third quarter. So it's organic.
Securities servicing fees were up 8% sequentially. Depositary receipts and clearing had a very strong quarter. Asset
servicing continued to benefit from new business and assets under custody reached $25 trillion, a new record, and up
12% year-over-year.
Asset and Wealth Management fees were up 14% over Q3 due to stronger markets, performance fees and long-term
flow growth. AUM was up 3% in the quarter to a new high of $1.17 trillion. Foreign exchange trading revenue
bounded up 29% sequentially due to high volumes and volatility. And on the new business front, in Asset and Wealth
Management we had our fifth consecutive quarter of positive long-term asset inflows, which was up $9 billion for the
quarter for a total of $48 billion in 2010.
We had new asset servicing wins of $350 billion in assets under custody. We're seeing a lot of new business
opportunities from our acquisitions last year, frankly, better than we expected. In fact, a lot of the deals in asset
servicing and their pipelines are with our GIS acquisition and our new asset-servicing clients in Germany, which is
really encouraging.
Our balance sheet has remained what I'd characterize as pristine all year. Provision in the quarter was negative $22
million, identical to the third quarter. Criticized assets were down 32% in the quarter and down 66% for the full year.
Our provision for the full year was only $11 million and we had security gains of $27 million, a significant
improvement compared to 2009. I'd like to think we're returning to normal levels here.
Expenses were up 8%, a little higher than we'd like, driven by growth, some seasonality and some costs above our
typical run rate. Two benefits that were modeled that provide us with strong capital ratios are, of course, firstly,
earnings. They generate us 20% to 25% of our equity base annually and that would be higher than most financial
institutions we would expect. And we also have a low level of risk-weighted assets.
This quarter we generated $576 million of new Tier 1 common, up 5% from the last quarter, and we continue to invest
our assets in high quality securities and central bank deposits. Tier 1 and Tier 1 common both strengthened over 100
basis points during the quarter. Our priority on the capital front remains to return capital to our shareholders through
dividends and stock buybacks.
As you would expect, we submitted our capital plans to our regulators a few weeks ago and we hope to know within
the next few months how we did on the latest stress test and whether we'll get the go ahead to start executing on it.
Given all of the capital we generate, the quality of our assets and the fact that we finished number one in the 2009 stress
test, we expect we'll do fine.
So to sum up, the story of the quarter is positive momentum that we're carrying into 2011. The markets are stronger.
We certainly recorded encouraging revenue growth. We had good growth in our core businesses and new business
trends are improving. Our acquisitions are adding to growth in our pipeline. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong.
We continue to generate significant levels of capital and we're looking forward to returning some of it to our
shareholders this year.
And with that, why don't we turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers and then we'll open it up for questions.
Todd?

Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I'll take a deeper dive into the numbers. My comments, as in the
past, will follow the quarterly earnings review beginning on Page 2.
On a GAAP basis, earnings for the quarter were $0.55, up 8% versus the third quarter and down 7% versus the
year-ago quarter. On an operating basis, after adjusting for $0.04 of M&I and restructuring expense, we get to $0.59
and that's up 7% versus both the year ago and the prior quarters. Intangible amortization, which I think is pretty
important when you consider the capital generation here, added an additional $0.06.
Some highlights on a sequential basis, total revenue was up 9% on an operating basis. Fee revenue was up 11%, also on
an operating basis, reflecting a strong quarter across our servicing businesses and the largest increase in Asset and
Wealth Management fees that we've seen since the merger.
Net interest revenue was up slightly, reflecting a temporary spike in client deposits during the quarter. Non-interest
expenses, including intangible amortization, restructuring charges and M&I, were up 8%, largely a function of higher
volume driven costs and some seasonality.
Fourth quarter also included expenses of approximately $50 million that I would characterize as outside our typical run
rate. They included the full year impact of adjusting compensation to market levels, equipment write-offs and the
anticipated settlement of a withholding tax matter with the IRS.
Turning to Page 4 of the review, AUM and AUC reflect higher equity values in new business, offset by a decline in
fixed income and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar. Assets Under Management was up 5% year-over-year, 3%
sequentially to a record level of $1.17 trillion with fourth quarter long-term inflows of $9 billion and short-term inflows
of $6 billion, as well as higher market values.
In 2010 we had a record $48 billion in long-term flows. Long-term inflows benefited from strength in institutional
fixed income and global equity products and a record level of flows in retail funds in the fourth quarter. AUC was up
12% year-over-year to a record level of $25 trillion, driven by the acquisitions, higher market values and new business.
Turning to Page 5 of the earnings review, which shows fee growth, Securities servicing fees were up 8% quarter over
quarter and up 29% year-over-year. Asset servicing fees were up 5% sequentially, reflecting higher market values, new
business and asset inflows from existing clients. Fees were up 41% year-over-year, driven by the impact of the
acquisitions, as well as the factors I just noted.
During the quarter, we won an incremental $350 billion in new Asset servicing business and the acquisitions are adding
significantly to our new business pipelines. Issuer service fees benefited from more typical seasonal pattern. Fee
revenue increased 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. DR issuances have exceeded cancellations for seven
consecutive quarters and we saw particular strength in corporate actions during the fourth quarter.
Corporate Trust fee revenue was virtually flat sequentially and it declined relative to last year. While the structured
debt market remains weak, an increased note of debt issuance and continuing debt restructuring have increased our
pipeline for new business in Corporate Trust.
Clearing fees were up 10% sequentially, due to increased daily average revenue trades, higher market values, and new
business. Fees were up 25% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the GIS acquisition, growth in mutual fund assets
and positions, higher market values and new business. I should add that you'll see we had some outsized expense
growth in clearing. We've been converting some significant business wins where the expenses are front-loaded. We
should start seeing a positive impact to our pre-tax earnings from these wins in the second quarter.
Asset and Wealth Management fees, adjusting for performance fees and income from consolidated Asset Management
funds, were up 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher period end market values and the impact of
net new business. In addition, performance fees were strong at $75 million, compared to $59 million in the fourth
quarter of last year.

FX and other trading was up 77% sequentially. FX revenue totaled $206 million, up 29% compared to the third quarter,
on higher volumes, new business and a little higher volatility. Other trading revenue returned to profitability,
generating $52 million versus the negative $14 million last quarter. The increase was largely due to an improvement
relative to the past two quarters in fixed income and derivatives trading. Investment income, investment and other
income was down $17 million sequentially driven primarily by lower foreign currency translation and GE capital
revenue.
Turning to Page 6 of the earnings review, NIR and the related margin continued to be impacted by low short-term
interest rates globally and our risk reduction strategy. The risk reduction strategy is hitting NII but it is paying
dividends as you can see in lower credit charges. NIR was up a bit due to the spike in short-term client deposits. The
net interest margin for the quarter was 1.54% compared with 1.67% in the prior quarter. That spike in deposits
negatively impacted the margin by approximately 10 basis points.
We remain asset sensitive, though slightly less so than in prior quarters. We currently estimate an immediate 100 basis
points move in the funds rate is worth a little less than $500 million on a pre-tax basis.
Going forward, we expect the net interest margin to be in the range of 1.60% to 1.75%. If rates move up, it should be at
the upper end of the range. And if the fund rates continues near zero, it will be at the lower end. In addition, if the
balance sheet grows, it will add to NIR, but will negatively the net interest margin in the short run.
The net unrealized gain in our securities portfolio declined by $267 million, reflecting the higher long-term rates on the
agency and Treasury securities. On Page 10, you can see that during the quarter we continued to generate significant
capital, with Tier 1 common up $576 million or, as Bob indicated, 5% over the third quarter. As a result of capital
growth and lower risk-weighted assets, our key regulatory ratios increased significantly. Tier 1 was up 120 basis points
to 13.4%. Tier 1 common increased 110 basis points to 11.8% and TCE increased 60 basis points to 5.8%.
The capital generation and strength of our ratios highlight the way our business model is supposed to work. We benefit
from our fee-based revenue and a low-risk asset mix, which is primarily comprised of high-grade securities, central
bank deposits, liquid placements and predominantly investment-grade loans.
We are also very comfortable with our ability to comply with BASEL III. We currently expect our BASEL III Tier 1
common equity ratio to exceed 7% by year-end. The difference here versus BASEL I is largely driven by $4 billion of
sub-investment grade securitizations, which we marked last year and we now have a $500 million unrealized gain on
them. If we sold those securities, the ratio would be approximately 250 basis points higher. But, frankly, we don't need
or want to do anything uneconomic. Given our capital generation and the limited need for risk-weighted assets in our
business model, we are confident we will be able to increase our dividend and do buybacks without taking any
additional actions.
Looking at our loan portfolio, the provision for credit losses was a credit of $22 million, identical to last quarter, which
compares to a charge of $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Criticized assets decreased by 32% during the
quarter, and 66% over the full year. Going forward, we expect the quarterly provision to be in the range of $0 to $20
million.
The effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.3%, which compares to 26.4% last quarter and 28.3% for the full year.
Our current estimate for the 2011 tax rate is in the range of 30% to 31%. Looking ahead to 2011, let me touch on four
key areas: seasonality, revenue, expense and capital. Typically, our second and fourth quarters are sequentially
stronger, and we expect this pattern to hold true in 2011. Near-term, let me remind you that performance fees and
corporate action fees and depositary receipts are seasonally highest in the fourth quarter. Looking at the big picture, we
carry into the year the momentum of solid improvement in our core businesses.
While we're absorbing last year's acquisitions, we'll focus primarily on organic growth, a large percentage of which
comes from cross selling to our existing clients. Over the last three years since our merger, we've had great success in
increasing the business line penetration of our top clients through cross sell, but there's still plenty more for us to do
with those relationships.

The acquisitions are providing the revenue synergies we anticipated. We are successfully cross selling the other
capabilities -- our other capabilities to the acquired clients, and we've also gained a number of new capabilities and
we're making nice progress in selling them to the rest of our clients. In addition, we continue to expand our client base
globally. Since our merger in 2007, we have increased annual revenue generated from clients out the U.S. to 36% from
32%, and we expect this trend to continue.
We believe we can do better on the expense front by working to bring down the cost of delivering our services while
maintaining our high quality. Actions that we are currently taking include process re-engineering and automation,
rationalizing our systems, reducing occupancy costs, maximizing our purchasing power through supplier consolidation,
and continuing to shift positions to our lower cost global growth centers. In just two years, we've gone from having
25% of our head count in growth centers to 30% today, and we'd expect to get one-third by the end of next year. As we
start realizing these savings, we'll likely reinvest some of it into additional reengineering efforts. Importantly, we are
currently absorbing the upfront cost of these efforts in our current expense base.
On the capital front, we look for less M&A activity this year because we expect to have the opportunity to return
capital to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.
Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Todd. Why don't we open it up for Q&A right away?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is
now open.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Okay, Thanks. Good morning, everybody. A couple of quick questions, maybe just to start
off with expenses, seems like the fee businesses are clearly having a pretty nice momentum here, but the expenses are
trickling up with it. So can you maybe talk about ex the $50 million one time number this quarter, do you think this is a
decent base we should think about going into next year or there's a little bit more you could do to reduce the overall
expense number just in terms of dollar amount?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Alex, I'll take that. This is Todd. I
think if you look at the volume-related expenses with the business in the fourth quarter and you adjust that accordingly
to what you would expect in the first quarter and knock the $50 million out, that's probably a reasonable base for us to
get started. We do think there are some things in addition to that. I mean, there are some seasonality to our business
development expenses. We tend to have conferences in the fourth quarter. There tends to be a little more traveling that
comes on, donations and some of our marketing expenses. But I think that's probably a pretty good basis for us to start.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Okay.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Some of our other revenues are somewhat seasonal
in that. Depositary receipts tend to be strong in the fourth quarter as are performance fees as well in Asset Management.
That's another consideration.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got you. And then maybe shifting over to the balance sheet for a second, it looks like the
cost of your deposits has been coming up throughout the year, I guess closer to 22 bps at the end of the quarter. It was
16 and earlier in the year, yet the rates stay low. So can you just give us a little bit more color, I guess, what is going on
there? Is there just more competition for deposits? And do you expect that number to continue to go up and that's baked

in your $1.60 to $1.65 guidance?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, that's more mix, Alex, than it is -- so
we're seeing an increase in sterling and euro, and sterling and euro rates are a little higher than the dollar rates.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: All of that move I would attribute to just a
mix of deposits.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Okay. Makes sense and then just maybe one more, could you just – a numbers question,
discount increasing in the quarter benefit to PS? And what was the impact from the fee waivers in the money market
business?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay. A few questions there, let me start
with the accretion. The way we've been looking at a net, when we started this, net of the assets that we sold back in the
third quarter of 2009, the impact is probably in the ballpark of about $70 million, Alex, in the quarter. And your second
question on fee waivers, the net impact to them for the fourth quarter was about flat to the third quarter. So we've seen
– we saw it peak in the first two quarters and we've seen it come down, but if the Fed keeps rates where they are now, I
don't think we're going to see any improvement from the waivers where they currently exist.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Great. Thanks very much, guys.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Thanks a lot. Bob, a couple of questions on capital, your common Tier 1 and TC to TA
went up nicely in the quarter. Could you talk about what kind of capital level you think you need to run the business
and how you think about excess capital? Which measure is more relevant for you?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, that's a good question, Betsy. I don't see – I
don't see a lot of complexity to it, other than there's some moving parts as we slowly shift in – around the world from
BASEL I to BASEL III. So given the quality of the assets we have, we don't have to hold much capital for credit risk,
but we do have operational risk and we do have a little bit of market risk, because of the nature of the businesses we're
in. So we are increasingly thinking about where we're heading from a BASEL III standpoint and it looks like the world
is going to, if you read the BASEL III doc, you're looking at a minimum 7% ratio for BASEL III and Tier 1 common,
in theory, by the end of 2019.
But I'm increasingly seeing a widening gap on how American financial institutions and banks think about that versus
the Europeans, whereas the Europeans want to do it through retained earnings and do it a little bit slower, it feels like
the American banks want to do it a little bit faster. There's negative implications where we understand that going below
7%, although all the rules aren't written yet. So I think most of the banks are going to have to think about a ratio where
they can get comfortable where it's somewhat higher than the 7% ratio that you start to drive some problems for
yourselves potentially in terms of dividends and buybacks.
So I don't know where that's heading yet, Betsy, because we have a lot to learn yet. Is it an 8% number? Maybe. And
it's going to take us, I'm guessing, a year or two before we really know all of the rules. There's a ton of moving parts.
What I do know is that if we're above 7% by the end of this year, we're going to be in – well, we already are in very
good shape going into this new capital regime. I wish I could be more definitive for you, but I can't but I would just
focus on BASEL III increasingly and ask a lot of questions about what are all of the ins and outs on those rules over the
next year or two.

<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Where do you think you are on BASEL III right now?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I would say we're a little under 6% and if we sold
that $4 billion in assets, we'd be 8%. And but again, it doesn't make economic sense the way BASEL works for that and
we don't need the additional capital, so we're going to hold that portfolio because we like it and it's really in the money.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Okay. And when you said be at around 7% by year-end, you're talking 4Q '11?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Okay. And even with that...
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And there is going to be a transition period, and my
understanding is that, that's the way that Washington and the regulators are thinking about BASEL III versus BASEL I.
My impression is that the greatest emphasis is on Tier 1 under BASEL I and Tier 1 common, but they'll be at least
looking at BASEL III as part of this process through the spring.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Sure. And then, you -- I would have expected you submitted your capital plan to the
regulators. I know we haven't heard back yet, so hard to say, but can you give us a sense as to what you did ask for?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I'm sorry. No.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Okay. And then...
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Todd would love to tell you that but I'm not letting
him.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: As you know, Betsy, one thing I would
add, all these numbers that we're quoting you include actions.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Yeah, so you expect to take some actions this year to move you up from under 6% to 7%?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: No, no, no, no. We would expect to be
able to take some capital actions and that's reflected in our estimate to be above 7%.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Okay. Got it. Capital actions meaning...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Raise the dividend or do anything else...
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Okay. I got it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: All right? So in other words, we would be
above 7% otherwise, so we're saying including our anticipated actions, if they're approved, we'd be in the 7% range by
the end of 2011.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Got it. And then one separate question on the expenses, you know the $50 million that you
talked about that was a little bit of a one-timer in the quarter. Can you tell us how much of that was the comp? Because
one of the questions I get from people is, well, shouldn't that be in our run rate going forward, even if it is a true-up in
the quarter? On an annualized basis, should I keep that in the run rate? So I'm unclear how much of that $50 million I
should put in the run rate?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, about half of that impact, Betsy, was related
to comp.

<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Got it. Okay. But it should be – it's catch up to a new level going forward?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Correct. But it's the previous three quarters impact,
if you will, not the fourth quarter impact.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Right. Got it. So you got to divide by four, not divide by one.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: And I want to make sure that we're crystal clear on
that capital discussion. We had assumed we'll be over 7%. That is with an increase in – assuming that the Fed approves
our increase in dividend and buybacks.
<Q - Elizabeth Graseck>: Yeah. Got that. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Mike.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: You had good revenue growth for the quarter but assets under custody were only up 2%, despite
the big market moves and that's not so different than your peers, but I'm just wondering, shouldn't assets under custody
be up more given the appreciation in the markets?
<A - Gerald Hassell>: Hi, Mike, it's Gerald Hassell. You have to remember about 60% of our assets under custody are
fixed income, and with the loan rates changing during the quarter, the value of those fixed income securities actually
declined. So versus some of our peers may have a higher mix in equities, which would benefit from the equity market
rise. So when you factor that in, we think we're right on line.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And then as far as the linked quarter revenue growth, you talked about a lot of ins and outs.
Just conceptually of the linked quarter revenue growth, the 9%, how much would you consider seasonal versus a more
permanent cyclical pick up versus organic permanent customer improvement?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll take a stab at that, Mike. I would say
that a fair amount of the performance fees are obviously seasonal. So they were $77 million for the quarter and you
might – we typically get some but not at that level in other quarters during the course of the year. DRs were up quite a
bit. So I would say those were probably the two heaviest seasonal actions that we saw. So I think you can put it into
$100 million to $150 million.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And then lastly, the mortgage put back issue where you guys are somewhat in the middle,
the Kathy Patrick group with all the investors that are trying to get you, the trustee, to potentially take some action, can
you give us an update on that, and what are the possible scenarios after this current period runs its course, I guess, the
end of this month?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, sure. I don't think anything has changed from
what we have indicated previously, Mike. I think the good news is that the parties there are talking to each other on a
direct basis, and I would suspect they'll work something out. But once again, if they don't, the role that we play here is

basically ministerial. So right now we're very comfortable with our position, and we don't really see this as being an
issue.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So I guess I have two questions from that. You think they might work it out? I don't know if you
can give any color on that. And then if they don't work it out, my understanding, and correct me if I'm wrong, there
could be a scenario where the servicer is fired and you become the servicer? This is not something we see too often, but
can you simply elaborate on that?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think in terms of working – I can't really
speculate on how those negotiations are going because we're really not a party to them. In terms of how it ultimately
could play out, there is an extremely unlikely probability that we would ever end up in the servicing position. We do, in
the case of a default, we do take on a prudent man role, but we think that there are other much more reasonable
outcomes than that.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: We have the two extremes and either they work it out, or you just said extremely unlikely you
become the servicer. What are some middle ground possibilities?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, most likely, it wouldn't be in the interest of
the – of the holders of the bonds to try to move the servicer midstream like this, and most likely we would probably
increase our oversight of the servicer.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And when you say increase oversight of the servicer, what does that mean?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We would review a little more carefully what
they're doing.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: And we're paid for that incrementally.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: So, Mike, we just don't see this as a significant risk
at this time.

Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Howard.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Thanks for all the detail on your BASEL III expectations. How much risk-weighted asset
inflation and mitigating actions are you embedding specifically in your assumptions?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: We're embedding zero mitigating actions
in those assumptions. If you think through it, the biggest driver is that, like we said, is that $4 billion of securities, but
we see about a 20% to 25% pay down annually in those securities anyway, so they naturally burn off. If we wanted to
take some other actions, there's a lot of other things that we could do, Howard. We just don't feel compelled to do it at
this point.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Right. Okay. Thanks, Todd. And then I know there a lot of ebbs and flows and we still don't
have full clarity on BASEL III, but I guess I'm a little surprised that you seem really comfortable in restoring the
dividend and buying back stock with where the pro forma ratios are now. I mean, I don't know if I'm getting the right
impression or if you have any thoughts in terms of just what's giving you that confidence level?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it would be a couple of things. First of all, the
test is a BASEL I test, and as you can see where we are, we perform extremely well. Number two, our business model

is not – does not rely on risk-weighted assets to generate income. So we can demonstrate a plan to have a very high
BASEL III ratio well before it goes into implementation comfortably while taking actions.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: The other thing I would add to it, Howard,
is there aren't a lot of balance sheets out there that you could stress and see essentially almost no impact from a stress
scenario. And when you're generating 20% to 25% of new equity every year, that's a lot of capital generation, unlike
most of our peers, because we are a capital lite model. It's just fundamentally a different model than most banks that
rely upon their balance sheets.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Understood. Thank you. Okay, thanks, Bob and Todd. I know, I guess, in my mind, one of the
worries would be that BASEL III or whatever the new regulation is, it's a bit more of a blunt instrument, right? But
that's good to hear that there is differentiation in terms of your mind and the – and that's resonating with regulators. I
guess my last question, I know you had a bankruptcy recovery this quarter, but just wondering how you're thinking in
general about asset quality and the loan portfolio. Do you see more opportunities to bleed reserves or is it something
that you'd like to grow into from here? Thanks.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're very comfortable with our loan
portfolio. I mean, we'd indicated that we would expect the provision to be $0 to $20 million and we've seen a very large
decline in criticized assets over the course of the year. The team has done a great job cleaning it up, and we think we're
in a very good position, the best we've been in many, many years.
<Q - Howard Chen>: Perfect. Thanks so much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group. Your line is now open.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Hey. Just to go back to the BASEL III announcement, so if you had a 9.5% pro forma with the
securities sale, I guess, wouldn't that extra 2.5% give you a great deal of extra buyback capacity, and maybe just talk
about how you think about 7% versus the 9.5% and the extra buyback capacity that you would have if you sold those
securities?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Brian, I think that's a great way of looking
at it. You can think we're warehousing a lot of capital in that portfolio, and if it makes more sense for us to do
something with that capital versus holding it, we will. And that's exactly how we would look at it.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay. You prefer to play it flexibly if the Feds want you to raise that, you could just hold
securities and then you could create more flexibility?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, we don't want to be forced to do
something uneconomic. The portfolio does a nice job of hedging our interest rate risk, as we've indicated in the past. It's
got a high yield on it. And it's relatively safe because we've marked it well below its current market value at this point
in time. So if it makes more sense for us, like with anything, if we can deploy our capital more efficiently elsewhere,
we'll do it.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Right. Right. Great. And then what is the operational component increased to the risk-weighted
assets pro forma with BASEL III?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, the way I look at that, Brian, is there
are two components. In the core, if you shift the investment portfolio or the sub-investment grade securities out, there's
a benefit to the credit side that's reasonably meaningful, and it offsets about two-thirds of the impact of operational risk,

so the net-net, that's probably about 10% or 15%.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Operational?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: The increased impact under BASEL III
versus BASEL I. Operational risk for us will be higher than 15% total. It'll probably be in the 20% to 25%, maybe even
30%.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Got it. Got it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: So the net change is just weighted out to
us. Credit versus operational.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yep.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Okay. Great. Great. And then just let's just talk about the expense structure. Obviously, you guys
have been pretty advanced in reengineering for a long time. When do you think we get to a state where the
re-engineering savings and other cost initiatives will accrue more to the bottom line so that you won't be – you'll be at a
point where you're not reinvesting in those new initiatives?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I guess I'll take that one too.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Although I'd like to add to it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Go ahead.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: No, no, you go right ahead.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm actually going to back up to the last
point too, Brian, I just do want to make one comment here. We're talking about the BASEL III capital models and
frankly, the Fed needs to approve your capital models, and none of these models have yet been approved for us or for
anybody else that I'm aware of, so there's a lot of assumptions that are going into these. We think they are reasonable
estimates but there are a lot of assumptions.
<Q - Brian Bedell>: Right.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: In terms of the run rate, this would be the
first year if we didn't reinvest that I think we could go into a positive run rate on the – especially on the global footprint.
So we are starting to see, could be as high as, say, 1% of our expenses that we could reduce if we didn't reinvest some
of that in our re-engineering efforts. It is our intent to reinvest a meaningful amount of that in our reengineering efforts
and, Bob, I don't know if...
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, what I'd add to that, Brian, is we've been
doing this for three or four years. We're constantly re-engineering how we conduct our business to drive efficiencies.
To date, our re-engineering costs are higher than the savings, but of course, every year the savings get higher so the run
rate is higher. Frankly, we're going to continue to invest in re-engineering, and I think that's the right thing to do for our
businesses and for the shareholders.
We have some big buckets that we have opportunities in, whether it's in our IT platforms or operational platforms in
terms of reducing the number of systems we have. We still have too many locations around the world and we tend to be
in fairly expensive locations in some cases. Our procurement costs are too high. I could go on. But we're going to
continue investing. I think there are more expense opportunities in our company to not only run more efficiently, but it
also reduces risk and reduces complexity in our company. And all of those things I think are attractive and important.
And frankly, I look to each one of our businesses, as well as staff areas, to think every year about incrementally what
are they going to be doing to become more efficient than the prior year. And we don't just look at it in terms of the next
quarter or the rest of the year, we look at it as a multi-year program. And we're becoming very disciplined about this,
and we're going to continue this process.

<Q - Brian Bedell>: No, that's great. That's very, very helpful. And just one last one, maybe on the PNC GIS platform.
Maybe if you could talk about what you're thinking to what degree you'll migrate clients to that platform or actually
reconstruct your mutual fund servicing platform between like DBK and the GIS?
<A - Gerald Hassell>: Sure. Brian, it's Gerald. We're going through that process right now. There's certain elements
that came with the acquisition that, for example, on the transfer agency we're going to continue to use the existing
transfer agency platform that PNC built out. We're winning some new business on that platform. Many parts of the
acquisition have already been split into our three business units: Asset Servicing; our AIS, Alternative Investment
Services, and the third part went over to Pershing.
We're going through the rationalization process of those platforms, and it's well under way and we feel very good about
how the integration is going. In fact, about 10% of the new business that we've won in Asset Servicing came because of
the fact that we had those increased capabilities from the GIS and BHS acquisitions so we feel very good about how
this is integrating.

Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, Bob. Good morning, Todd.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Gerard.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Question coming back to the stress test that you have submitted your data for. I just wanted to
make sure I heard you correctly. You said that the stress test will be using BASEL I numbers to determine whether you
can increase your dividend or do a buyback?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, the stress test was presented and it
was tested around BASEL I, and we also would have presented a plan on how we're going to meet ultimately BASEL
III, but all of the information that I have received, the regulators have been unequivocal that this test is a BASEL I test.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And if I recall correctly, would you say that the Tier 1 common ratio under BASEL I, though,
it was never officially determined, is about 4%? Is that right?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: No, no, no, no, no. What we said earlier on
the call?
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: No, no, under BASEL I, we never really had a Tier 1 common ratio officially defined. We had
Tier 1 of 6% but we all imputed it was a 4% Tier 1 common ratio under BASEL I. Is that a fair statement to say that's
the numbers they are using under BASEL I?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's fair to consider it to be a bit of a discount. I think
that's a little more than what they're actually looking at, though.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. In terms of a dividend payout ratio, where do you guys – where would you like to see
your dividend payout ratio? Not necessarily suggesting it's going to get there in the first announcement, but where is
the ultimate dividend payout ratio that you guys would like to get to?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Historically, we've probably been in the 30% to
40% range, Gerard. That's probably a little bit high for a company like ours with some continued growth prospects and
also the desire to do some buybacks as well. So I would suspect we'll move in the 20% to 30% range.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. And do you know with your conversations with the regulators, are they going to be
looking at current level of earnings for, let's say, 2011 versus maybe more normalized earnings in '12 or '13 for
determining where dividend payout ratios can go?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I don't think – this is a confidential exam.
We're really not privy to disclose some of that information, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. In regards to BASEL III where you guys pointed out that if you were to sell the
securities that bring down that ratio it would boost the ratio by about 250 basis points, what's the bleed rate, if you will,
where those securities will eventually just pay off so that you will capture that 250 basis points? Is that over a
three-year period or a five-year period?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think the way to look at it is it's about 20%
to 25% per annum.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: All right, so if you get 25% you can figure we get
50 basis points or 50 – 50 to 60 basis points...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Per annum, roughly, per annum.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Right.

Thank you. Our next question is from Tom McCrohan with Janney. Your line is now open.
<Q - Thomas McCrohan>: Hi, everyone. Do you expect to hear from the Fed on this current stress test by the end of
March because that's the expectation I'm hearing?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Tom, we don't know and I would hope to
hear sometime this spring.
<Q - Thomas McCrohan>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: It's a complicated process. It was in '09.
I'm sure it's still complicated. And we have a lot of regulators and I'm sure it won't just be one that will have input,
there will be multiple inputs. So we may get fortunate, but I'll think of it in terms of a first half type event.
<Q - Thomas McCrohan>: Okay. On net interest margins, you didn't give specific guidance but it sounded like you
were guiding us to adjust to 1.54% by ten basis points. So should we be thinking about a run rate of about 1.64%?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, let me explain to you what we did
there. If you looked at the quarter, we had a pop for a good part of the quarter of about $15 billion, Tom, in
interest-earning assets. It was really driven by our deposit base. There wasn't much we could do with that but leave it in
very short-term instruments or even at the Fed. That earned, on our $720 million that earned us about $6 million. So we
would have been at $714 million. And if you net that out, you're right, the net interest margin would have been about

1.64% and that's probably a pretty good basis to start going into next year.
<Q - Thomas McCrohan>: This pop in deposits, Todd, that was interest bearing, I assume?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: It was a mix.
<Q - Thomas McCrohan>: A mix. Got it. And the new business pipeline, could you just give us a feel for the $350
billion of assets in the custody that was won during the quarter, geographies, the type of firms, what kind of revenue
yield, any type of color on that would be helpful?
<A - Gerald Hassell>: Sure, Tom, it's Gerald again. The pipeline certainly in Asset Servicing has grown quite
significantly from quarter to quarter, mainly from financial institutions looking to lower their cost base and outsource
services. More than 50% of it comes from outside the U.S. The vast majority is financial institutions of one sort or
another, including asset managers. So the pipeline has grown quite significantly. Time will tell how long it will take for
them to make decisions. We still have about $500 billion of assets under custody to convert from prior wins. So we see
some good momentum going into this year from both the pipeline and the conversions of business won.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. To a little more flesh out on the net interest income and net
interest margin, Todd, you mentioned that the approximate accretion in the quarter was $70 million net. I was
wondering if first you could just give us the gross number?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, Ken, I think it's a little over $90
million.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: So that compares to the $112 million from last quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: And then can you also just level set us then on what the expectation is for 2011?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: I think it will continue to ease – in terms of
the accretion?
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Yes.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I would expect to see it kind of at a
10% type of decreasing.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: On a – from the $90 million run rated or from the...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, yes. So if we're in $90 – I think we
might even be in mid $90s, if we're off of that run rate, it would probably come off about 10% of that.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. And then how much is left in that – like so how many years of re-accretion is there left, and
then does it – and then, well, I'll let you answer that and then I'll come back.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, it can go on. Most of it is going to
go away in three or four years, but it really depends on the performance of the underlying securities. So if they continue
to do well, there could be more there.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Sure. And then would you expect in the out years it also continues to – like is it kind of a
descending amortization schedule that if it's down 10%-ish off of the current run rate in '11, then it kind of also drips in

the future? Or is it more steady state until it...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. No, it's going to – just as the
prepayments come – as the maturities come down, we get prepayments and we get actual payments of principle, we
will see the accretion come down as well.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. Perfect. And my second question, Bob, you mentioned at a couple of recent conferences that
you thought that M&A might be a lesser priority in 2011, and I was just wondering if you can flesh out that thought
process. Is it either because are there fewer opportunities, is it because you're focused on integrating, is it because of
your capital plan? What are you seeing as far as that interest level and also landscape?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, it's a good point. Last year was quite
exceptional, in that we did four acquisitions, really. And three of them had to do with sellers who were either distressed
or wanted to raise capital reasonably quickly in our space. We have a lot of integration activity to get done this year,
and we're going to be focused on that because we were pretty busy last year. The other reason was, and over the last
year or two, we never really had an opportunity to raise the dividend or buy back stock.
So I would say that the combination of integration activity that we have underway, and now the new capital opportunity
this year, has changed our priority year-over-year. And I, frankly, am not seeing any noticeable activity on the M&A
front. Maybe others are, but certainly our team is not.
<A - Gerald Hassell>: Ken, I might add that we feel very positive about our own organic growth capabilities, and not
just in Asset Servicing but in our Asset Management and our other business units. And so I think it's – we feel very
good about the core organic growth and feel less of a need to turn to M&A.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Right.
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: It's interesting, Ken, you did ask about Gerald's
custody and the pipeline activity. Maybe we'll just have Curtis just talk to Asset Management and Wealth in terms of
pipeline just for a second.
<A - Curtis Arledge>: Sure, Bob. We already mentioned that we had our fifth consecutive quarter of long-term
positive inflows, and we continue to see our pipelines being very robust. We put them at just over $70 billion today,
with about $8 billion of that being high probability. And what is encouraging is that those pipelines are also geared
towards products where we generally have higher fee realization. We've clearly seen, as the market has, a shift towards
equity products. We don't do a pipeline, necessarily, for retail flows. But our retail flows have been robust and we have
every reason to believe that they will continue to be. So I would tell you that generally our pipelines are quite healthy in
Asset Management, as well.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Andy Clark, Investor Relations>: Wendy, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from John Stilmar with SunTrust. Your line is now open.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Yeah, good morning, gentlemen. I guess following up on Ken's previous question with regards to
M&A activity, I think you guys have done a really nice job of laying out the transition with capital management at least
in the near-term, but as we start looking out longer term, three to five years past the capital management, could you see
another round of M&A that -- M&A potential, and is that something that you guys have baked into your long-term
business plans just as you do have capital management, you still are going to be in somewhat of an excess capital
position. How do you think about that?

<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: John, it's always difficult to predict the future, and it
usually is about people who want to divest versus people like us who occasionally want to buy. And I'm not, again, if
you look out five years, I am extremely confident that we can gain market share around the world. We just want to
continue adding product in geography as we become more and more global, and we're very focused on that. Most of
that activity is organic. In Asia-Pacific, it's really all of our opportunities were organic and we did a number of things
that you're probably aware of last year in multiple countries in Asia-Pacific to put in the seed capital required to start up
businesses that I think long-term are going to be huge winners for our businesses and our shareholders.
In Europe, I'm not getting any sense at this point that the bank managements are thinking about our space, even getting
bigger in our space or even divesting. I think they are more focused on their core activities than the outlook for the
European economy. We continue to invest in Brazil, but again that's all organic. Long, long-term, you can continue to
think that this base will continue to consolidate around the world and the players with scale and multi-currency wide
platforms, with multi-product that can produce a lot of solutions for clients as the world gets more complicated and
more global and global financial assets go up. But it's hard to predict the timing of it, John, quite frankly.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Perfect. And then we have talked, obviously, a lot and seen your actions in Asia and you've
highlighted an interest, at least, in the growth markets in South America. So as we look back on 2010 and as you look
forward to 2011, one, the relative importance that we should think in immediate term for those markets? And then, two,
how would you characterize those markets today relative to your expectations going into 2010? Were they better than
expected, as expected or worse than expected?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I continue to be pleasantly, pleasantly shocked at
how well the BRICs are doing, and particularly the BIC. And you know, Asia-Pacific and Brazil are just amazing
stories and the outlook, in spite of – you would expect some volatility at some point in those economies, but it
continues to be an astonishingly good story. We're just going to continue to invest as long-term contributors to their
societies and their financial markets.
It sure feels like Asia-Pacific and Brazil are going to grow at twice the rate, at least, of the U.S. economy and it kind of
feels, at least at this point, that at least in the next few years, that the U.S. economy will probably outperform the
European economy by a bit. I love our business model and the opportunities around the world, and there's a few places
that – a few locations around the world where we don't have all our businesses on the ground yet and our distribution
channels I think could be more effective over time as well. Working together and just having better relationships with
major retailers and institutional players in some of these other countries.
I have been pleasantly surprised over the last two years at how quickly the U.S. financial institutions have returned to
health, wrote down assets on their balance sheets, built up their capital very rapidly. We are seeing some signs of that in
Europe as well. And I certainly feel more optimistic going into 2011 than I did in 2010. I do worry about sovereign risk
issues in Europe and I do worry about state and local governments here in the U.S. and I do worry about deficits, but
slowly, slowly, slowly and steadily the economy is improving around the world, which I think is great.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Perfect. And my final question, as you look at your diverse platform, what footprint or
competency would you – that you look on with envy that it probably is not a part of Bank of New York today but you'd
like to have as a part of that product suite in the future?
<A - Robert P. Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We have talked about that a lot, John, and we at
BNY Mellon, we love our platform, and it's basically two businesses: Asset Management and Security Servicing.
There's lot of synergies between them. There's lots of growth opportunities around the world and it really does play to
the long-term secular trends of a lot more financial assets around the planet and greater globalization as the economies
continue to interlink with each other. This is a great play. And I can't think of easily of a platform of our scale that can
outperform us over time.
<Q - John Stilmar>: Thank you, guys.
