With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael.
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Steve. As we've done in prior quarters, today, we're going to cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, our funding and liquidity highlights, automotive cash, debt and liquidity, and then we'll wrap things up
with a summary of the quarter.
Let's turn to Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide one. Ford Credit is a strategic asset to Ford that provides
world-class financial services to our dealers and customers and is an integral part of Ford's global growth and value
creation strategy.
We maintain a strong balance sheet that provides solid profits and distributions.
Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $483 million and net income of $306 million. Managed
receivables were $113 billion at the end of the quarter, up $7 billion from a year ago. Receivables were unchanged
from year-end 2014, reflecting growth in all products and all geographic segments, offset by the exchange rate impact
of a strong U.S. dollar.
We launched dealer financing in India in March, with retail financing to come later this year. The first quarter loss
receivables ratio was 22 basis points, up 2 basis points from a year ago, while charge-offs were $62 million, up $10
million from a year ago.
At March 31, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $355 million or 31 basis points of managed receivables.
Managed leverage was 8.8 to 1 at March 31, compared with 8.7 to 1 at December 31. At the end of the first quarter, our
equity was $11.2 billion.
Looking at slide two, in the first quarter, Ford Credit continued to demonstrate solid growth supporting Ford including
the launch of operations in India, as I just mentioned. Origination practices continue to be consistent and costs remain
well controlled and in line with our expectations. Beginning this quarter, we've made two changes to this slide in order
to better explain our performance. We've added mix to the volume category, and we created an exchange category to
isolate the impacts of exchange rate movements. You can find more info on these changes in our 2015 Ford Credit
University presentation, which is available on our Investor Center website.
Our pre-tax profit this quarter was largely unchanged from a year ago. Favorable volume and mix primarily reflects
higher consumer finance receivables in all geographic segments and an increase in leasing in North America. Lower
portfolio pricing in all geographic segments drove the lower financing margin.
The higher credit losses primarily reflect the non-repeat of reserve releases in all geographic segments that occurred in
the first quarter of last year. As shown below the chart, favorable lease residual performance due to higher auction
values in North America contributed to the higher pre-tax profit compared with the fourth quarter. For the full year
Ford Credit continues to expect pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014, year-end managed receivables of $123
billion to $128 billion and distributions to our parent of about $250 million. We now expect managed leverage at the
upper end of our range of 8 to 1, to 9 to 1 in the near-term because of translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar.
Slide three shows our quarterly trend of charge-offs, loss receivables ratio and credit loss reserve. We continue to
experience historically low levels of credit losses. The first quarter LTR of 22 basis points is well below the 10-year
average of 46 basis points. Year-over-year charge-offs were up $10 million and LTR was up 2 basis points.
Quarter-over-quarter charge-offs and LTR were down, primarily reflecting the non-repeat of an incremental loss
recognized on previously impaired receivables in Europe. And the credit loss reserve at $355 million is largely
unchanged.
Slide four shows the primary credit loss drivers in our U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail and lease portfolio, which
comprised 74% of our worldwide consumer portfolio at March 31, 2015. Over 60-day delinquencies remain

consistently low at 13 basis points, down 3 basis points from a year ago and down 1 basis point from the fourth quarter.
Repossessions in the first quarter were 7,000 units or 1% of average accounts outstanding, down 12 basis points from a
year ago and down 6 basis points from the fourth quarter. The repo ratio of 1% represents our lowest first quarter result
on record. Severity of $8,300 in the first quarter was $600 higher than the same period a year ago, $400 of the increase
reflects a change to include certain repossession expenses in charge-offs that were previously recorded as operating
costs. Excluding this change, severity was $200 higher than a year ago.
Quarter-over-quarter severity declined $300. Excluding the repossession expenses that I just mentioned, severity
declined $700, primarily reflecting improved auction values. The impact on credit losses of this repossession expense
change will continue throughout the year. First-quarter charge-offs were up $2 million and LTR was down 2 basis
points from the prior year, and both charge-offs and LTR were down from the fourth quarter.
Slide five shows the quarterly trends of the lease residual performance for our U.S. Ford and Lincoln brands. In the first
quarter, lease return volume was lower than the same period a year ago, reflecting fewer 24-month lease placements in
2013 relative to 2012. Return rates have generally been consistent over the period.
In the first quarter, our auction values for 24-month contracts increased by $915 and 36-month auction values increased
by $515 compared with the same period last year. This trend compares very well with available industry data. Both our
24-month and 36-month auction values increased from the fourth quarter, consistent with normal seasonality.
Our worldwide net investment and operating leases was $22 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $0.5 billion from
year-end 2014. And with that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike. Turning to slide six, we are on track to achieve our 2015 funding plans. In the first quarter, we
completed about $10 billion of funding in the public term markets, split about equally between unsecured debt and
asset-backed transactions. We completed our second ABS transaction in China of RMB 3 billion. This transaction is
another step in our continued progress of implementing our funding strategy to be more capital markets focused.
We ended the quarter with net liquidity of about $28 billion. Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification,
and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and investors. We remain focused on maintaining a
strong investment grade balance sheet.
Slide seven shows our projected 2015 global public funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term programs.
For 2015, the forecasted ranges are unchanged from our prior guidance.
Slide eight shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the first quarter, managed receivables
were $113 billion, and we ended the quarter with about $13 billion in cash. Securitized funding was 40% of managed
receivables. We are projecting 2015 year-end managed receivables in the range of $123 billion to $128 billion and
securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables in the range of 37% to 39%. We continue to expect this
percentage to decline over time.
Turning to slide nine, we highlight Ford Credit's 2015 first quarter liquidity. Our liquidity remains strong at $27.9
billion, an increase of $1.4 billion from year-end 2014. Ford Credit's sources of liquidity include cash, committed
asset-backed lines, unsecured credit facilities and the corporate revolver allocation.
As of March 31, our liquidity sources including cash totaled $48.5 billion, up $2.3 billion from year-end, reflecting
higher cash balances to meet near-term debt maturities. We are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position to
meet our business and funding requirements through economic cycles.
Slide 10 shows Ford's automotive debt at $13.4 billion at the end of the quarter, $400 million lower than the fourth
quarter. Ford had maturities in Europe and Asia Pacific, and we continue to pay down our U.S. Department of Energy
loans. These reductions were offset partially by the consolidation of Ford Solar's external debt.

We ended the quarter with net cash of $6.1 billion and automotive liquidity of $30.2 billion. Although not yet included
in Ford's total liquidity, Ford is in the process of amending and extending its corporate revolving credit facility. The
facility which is presently $12.2 billion is expected to grow to $13.4 billion. The increase in the facility will be almost
entirely allocated to Ford Credit to support our growth and liquidity plans.
Now let's close with a summary of the first quarter. The first quarter was a good start to a year in which Ford's results
will grow progressively stronger as the new products Ford has been launching continue to build momentum. It was
Ford's 23rd consecutive profitable quarter, with positive operating related cash flow. Ford grew its global market share
and achieved profitability in four of its six business units.
At quarter-end, automotive gross cash was $19.5 billion and liquidity was about $30.2 billion, in line with Ford's target
levels. Ford also reconfirmed company guidance for the full year 2015. Ford Credit had another strong quarter. With
our consistent purchase policy and world-class servicing, our Ford Credit portfolio continues to perform well. We have
a diversified funding plan and ample liquidity, in line with our long-term goals. Ford Credit is a strategic asset and
integral to Ford's business. It supports Ford and Lincoln sales and dealers, builds customer satisfaction and loyalty and
delivers consistent profits from its strong business.
And now that ends the presentation, and I'll turn it back to Steve to begin the Q&A session.
Steve Dahle
Thanks, Neil. And with that, we'll start the question-and-answer session. Katina, may we have the first caller, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Karson, representing Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Steve Dahle>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: (13:24) [ph] of the quarter (13:30). Good morning. I've got a quick industry question on
subprime. I've had so much kind of incoming dialogue from investors on like the worries around subprime, and I'm
certainly not seeing it at any of the companies that I cover. Would you just maybe give us a little bit of your opinion on
what you see in the subprime market? I know that it's not a very big part of Ford Credit, but just what you're seeing
kind of out there in the field.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Sure, Doug. It's Mike. Really, from our opinion, we don't think there's much of a story in
subprime. If you look at the subprime industry, it's actually flat year-over-year for the new business, and it's actually
down year-over-year for the used business. We've seen a lot of third-party reports like Experian and Moody's and
others, and they've all stated that they believe subprime originations are under control, as well as the performance of the
portfolio and as it relates to delinquencies. So I think overall from the way that subprime is developing, there are no
issues.
I would say that we are seeing increased competition in the subprime business and it's getting more intense as we see
banks and other players try their hand in this area. I'll also say that we've seen that in the past and it tends to play out
the way it plays out. So competition is getting a little greater, but not from a customer standpoint.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: And the percentage of your portfolio dedicated to subprime is quite low. From my memory it
was like below 10%. Is that correct?

<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, a couple of different things, Doug. Remember, we look at our portfolio in terms of
what we deem as higher risk, and we have consistently said that about 5% to 6% of our portfolio is higher risk. If you
look at our ABS transactions, it's been really consistent over time. In there, there's an actual chart, but it shows that the
percent under 650 FICO has been remarkably consistent between like 17% and 19% for years.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. And a question about the kind of cash balance. Ford had a little bit of a weaker cash
quarter kind of seasonally and then had some kind of one-time items kind of below the line. What is the current Ford
Credit dividend policy to the parent company, just to make sure I've got refreshed on that?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, as you know, we set our leverage to be between 8 to 1 and 9 to 1, and we've said that
we expect – and right now we're going to be at the higher end of that range because of translation. And we said our
receivables are going to be in the range of $123 billion to $128 billion. So we're going to hold equity consistent with
that. All equity that we don't need consistent with that would be remitted to the parent.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Perfect. And then finally kind of for model purposes, this kind of relates to the North
American margin. Margin was increased from I think 8% to 9%, to 8.5% to 9.5%. I couldn't remember from the call,
but was there any kind of cadence given? I know that it could be much stronger in the second half, but could we start
seeing some meaningful improvement in that margin in 2Q? Because if not then we'd have to have like 13% margins in
the backend of the year?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Doug, this is Stuart. So we didn't provide it on a quarterly basis. But we did say that
Kansas City is at full speed during the second quarter. So it's not quite there yet, but it's going to full speed during the
quarter. And we also then of course said the second half is clearly going to be stronger as we have Edge also in full
production, and so that implies closer to the 10% top end of the target in the second half, with the 6%, 7% in Q1.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: And how about the Explorer, when is that going to be kind at full run rate?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Explorer changes over in the second quarter. The Explorer changeover is what we call a
mid-cycle action. So in terms of their degree of change and therefore the impact on production, it's a much lesser
change than we've seen on the F-150 and the Edge.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Perfect. All right. Thanks for the answers and that's it for me.
<A - Steve Dahle>: Thanks, Doug.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, representing Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Yes. Just following up on the prior question about the broader subprime environment, I
know that you don't exclusively use FICO scores. And in fact, with loyal Ford customers – well, I guess a couple of
questions. With loyal Ford customers, do you have a history of credit performance at least on the Ford loans that
extends well prior to the seven-year look-back for FICO scores? And do you use that?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah. Hey, Brian, we look at a variety of different details when we're evaluating a
customer, not the least of which is their prior experience with us. And we also subdivide FICO. We look at the structure
of the deal. There are a number of factors that go into our modeling. And that whole modeling, when we add it all up
that's where we come out with and say 5% to 6% of the portfolio is higher risk.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Second question would be that the Wall Street Journal noted earlier this year that with
FICO scores the look-back for foreclosure were quickly getting to the point where 2007 foreclosures are apparently
erased from the credit scoring. We're just starting to go through 2008 foreclosures. Can you just a) comment on that
technically if that's true; and then b) what impact do you think that will have? Will we actually be seeing the sort of

near-prime borrowing pool in effect increasing because people will be graduating out of subprime?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, again, as it relates to us, our models subdivide the FICO score into housing and
others, and so we're able to actually critique each component individually. I think in total, if you look at our average
FICO scores, they've been remarkably consistent over the last number of years. So again, if it starts to marginally
increase from where it's at today, our model should pick that up and we wouldn't see an undue impact on our portfolio.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: I guess final question, any impact yet from peer-to-peer, either in the news or in the
lending market in any time that peer-to-peer industry could develop some sort of collateralization, Lean-taking
capability?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I'm staring at Neil and...
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: I'm not sure we've seen...
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I'm not sure that we've seen anything.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: ...in near term anyway.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. Just one of the competitors actually says a common use of their admittedly
unsecured, therefore higher cost of loans is for [ph] cars (21:03), but you haven't seen it. Thanks.
