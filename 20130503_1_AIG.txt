MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the American International Group's First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Today's
conference is being recorded.
And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Liz Werner, Head of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, ma'am.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Good morning and thank you and for joining us, everyone. Welcome to AIG's discussion of our first quarter 2013
results. Speaking today will be Bob Benmosche, our President and CEO; David Herzog, our Chief Financial Officer;

Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of such measures to the most

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and good morning, everybody. And as I've said, since mid-2011, the focus of our company and all the
people of AIG has been fix the foundation and get the fundamentals right. And while we see noise as we dealt with
some of our non-core assets and so on, mark-to-markets of ML II/III and so on, AIA, we've been focusing on the core.
And I think what you see is this is – in the first quarter, is another strong quarter of the fundamentals. This is a quarter
we had some positives. Last quarter, we had Sandy, which was a negative. But if you look at the core, and we're going
to talk about that this morning, we continue to fundamentally do very well here.
Now you look at our liquidity at the end of the quarter, we're at $15 billion. That includes dividends from Life and
Retirement and also liability management, which included some of the cash from the prior quarter. Peter is going to
talk to you about our Property Casualty business that we've seen good improvement in the underwriting, good returns
from the investment side as well. But what's most important, if you look at the trend over this period of time from
mid-2011, you can see that there's a gradual improvement of the current accident year loss ratio, which is now down to
63.2, again strong improvement.
And if you look at the growth of the top line, we continued to grow that this quarter. It's growing nicely at about 4% if
you take out some of the accounting charges and the yen issue that we're dealing with in terms of conversion there, so
strong performance at Property Casualty.
The Mortgage Guarantee business, we've said, we've seen that business turn about two years ago. We're working
through the legacy book. Again, a strong quarter for that business and about half of their premiums are now coming
from our new underwriting model, which is much – performing much better than we had in the past. And our Life and
Retirement business, again, great distribution numbers in a very tough climate. We're continuing to hold the line on our
ability to get the returns we need for that business, and so a success for us as well and Jay will take you through that.
So I don't want to belabor at this point. I look forward to taking your questions at the end of our comments. What I'd
like to do now is turn it over to David who will highlight some of the financials for you this quarter. David?
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our core operations delivered strong operating
results this quarter, up 28% over a year ago. And we executed on $2.1 billion in liability management actions during
the quarter. We remain committed to our aspirational goals including $25 billion to $30 billion in capital management
and a 10% ROE by 2015.
Turning to slide four, first quarter operating earnings per share was $1.34. As you might recall, first quarter of 2012 had
over $3 billion in pre-tax gains related to non-core holdings in AIA in ML III. So the quarter-over-quarter EPS
comparison isn't straightforward.
Operating ROE, which excludes AOCI from equity, was 9.2% for the quarter. On a basis consistent with our long-term
aspirational goals, which excluded the deferred tax asset from equity for purposes of calculating ROE, ROE would
have been roughly 200 basis points higher this quarter. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $59.39, up 12%
from a year ago and 3% from year end.

Operating results begin on slide five. Property Casualty delivered an underwriting profit in the quarter driven by
continued improvement in the accident year loss ratio. Both our Property Casualty and Life and Retirement businesses
benefited from stronger alternative investment returns than we expected. Property Casualty had modest cat losses of
around $40 million, less than we expected in the quarter.
We realigned our Life and Retirement segment presentation this quarter to provide product segments consistent with
our new management structure, which Jay will discuss in more detail in his remarks. The Direct Investment Book and
Global Capital Markets benefited from positive marks in the quarter, driven largely by tighter credit spreads.
Operating income from the wind-down legacy multi-sector CDS book, which is reported in Global Capital Markets,
improved by roughly $150 million from market appreciation of the underlying covered securities, which then reduces
the liability we carry on the related CDS. The direct investment book also benefited from asset appreciation consistent
with our objective to capture the pull to intrinsic over time. These market movements will vary from period to period
and could be negative in a reporting period.
Interest expense increased modestly from prior year and reflected only a partial quarter of interest savings from our
liability management actions that we completed in March. Corporate expenses, including the impact of costs incurred
during the quarter for continued infrastructure build-out, were in line with our near term expected run rate of about
$225 million per quarter. There is roughly $35 million or so per quarter of corporate expenses related to our data center
consolidation, which begins to wind down going into 2014.
The effective operating tax rate came in at almost 30%. Looking ahead, for the rest of the year we continue to expect
the operating tax rate to be roughly in this range. As you may recall, we will not be paying any U.S. income taxes for
some time, given our NOLs. We also had a couple of largely offsetting tax adjustments that are not reported as part of
operating income. We increased our reserve for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 by approximately $600 million
related to some legacy matters as a result of current period developments. We're also determined that recently identified
tax planning strategies met the prudent and feasible criteria, and we released through income a little over $750 million
of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carry-forwards.
Our capital position remains solid. And on slide six, you can see our current debt levels reflect over $2 billion in parent
company debt that we called and repurchased in cash tender offers this quarter. In March we called our $1.1 billion
7.7% hybrids at par, and we purchased $1 billion in debt in cash tender offers, with an average coupon of around 7.8%.
Annualized interest savings on this retired debt is about $165 million. We also have $750 million in callable hybrids
with a coupon of 6.45%. Exercising that call would further reduce annual interest expense by almost $50 million.
At this time we do not have any plans in place for further 2013 liability management outside exercising the hybrid call
that is available to us. If we do exercise that call, then between our maturities, the debt we have already retired
proactively, we could pare our annual interest expense run rate by roughly $290 million.
Our year-end RBC ratios are also presented on slide six, and were 443% for Property Casualty and 532% for Life and
Retirement. These are higher than the preliminary estimates that we reported last quarter. Our insurance subsidiaries
remain capitalized well above their CMA thresholds and are positioned to deliver sustained dividends and distributions
to the holding company. We received distributions from Life and Retirement of over $1.3 billion during the quarter, as
shown on slide seven.
Property Casualty is on track to deliver its full-year targeted dividend payments later this year. We continue to expect
$4 billion to $5 billion in total in annual dividends and distributions from our insurance companies. Parent company
available liquidity is over $15 billion at the end of the quarter, reflecting these distributions and the liability
management actions that I mentioned earlier. The parent liquidity balance includes $5.5 billion related to the Direct
Investment book and Global Capital Markets, which is currently allocated towards future maturities of liabilities and
contingent liquidity stress needs. Nearly 60% of the DIB's debt matures over the next five years.
During the quarter, we initiated an investment program at the holding company whereby we invested $2.3 billion of
available cash into high quality fixed maturity securities with a duration of just over three years and a yield rate of just
over 1%. We expect this portfolio to grow to around $3 billion this year. Additionally, the ILFC divestiture continues

through the regulatory approval process as expected. Upon closing the net proceeds that we receive on that transaction
will be unencumbered at the holding company.
And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter for greater detail on the Property Casualty results. Peter?
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. During the quarter, AIG Property Casualty made good progress towards
achieving our goals. We improved our underwriting results and experienced strong investment performance, while
expenses remained largely stable.
Turning to slide eight, operating income was nearly $1.6 billion, which included moderate catastrophe losses of $41
million, favorable net prior year reserve development of $52 million and better than expected net investment income.
Continued enhanced risk selection, technical pricing, shifts in our business mix and advances in claims practices
contributed to that profitability. Our accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, of 63.2% is slightly better than trend, which
has been improving at an average three points annually. We expect to continue to see a decline in the accident year loss
ratio as a result of our continued underwriting improvements.
This quarter, we began recognizing premiums on excess of loss reinsurance at contract inception rather than ratably
over the contract term, which will have no effect on full-year net premiums written or net premiums earned, but does
impact first quarter comparisons. Changes in foreign exchange driven by the weakening of the yen and a first quarter
catastrophe bond issuance also reduced reported net premiums. Excluding these effects top line growth was 4%.
We continue to expect modest net premium growth in 2013 as our underwriting actions take hold and we write
profitable new business. General operating expenses were up slightly on a gross basis and included moderate severance
and other personnel charges.
Turning to slide nine, Commercial's net premium written were up 4% excluding the effect of the immediate recognition
of ceded premiums on excess of loss reinsurance and the catastrophe bond issuance that I mentioned earlier. In
addition, last quarter we entered into a new reinsurance program in U.S. Excess Casualty that reduced Commercial's
first quarter premium by about 1%. That will improve overall profitability.
Maximizing risk-adjusted profitability through optimization of business mix and underwriting excellence remains a
focus of AIG Property Casualty. The results of these initiatives are most evident in Commercial's accident year loss
ratio as adjusted, which improved approximately five points compared to the prior year.
An increase in new business and positive rate changes contributed significantly to growth in Property, which improved
20%, excluding the items mentioned above, and in Financial Lines. In the U.S., we saw pricing continue to climb,
particularly in Property and Workers' Compensation, where rates increased over 8%. Partially offsetting this was
continued pressure in certain lines within Specialty and in Europe's Commercial business. Overall, retentions remain
strong in those lines of business we wish to grow.
Turning to slide 10, Consumer net premiums written increased over 4% excluding foreign exchange and the other items
mentioned earlier. Accident & Health experienced growth outside the U.S., particularly in individual A&H in Asia
Pacific.
Personal lines benefited from Auto's market share gains in EMEA and expansion in high value non-Auto lines.
Consumer's accident year loss ratio was up slightly from the prior year, as 2012 included a $45 million benefit related
to changes in actuarial assumptions in Accident & Health.
Acquisition ratios reflected our investment in the profitable Direct Marketing channel, which grew approximately 8%
and accounted for 16% of total Consumer premiums.
Slide 11 illustrates our investment portfolio mix. First quarter net investment income increased 11%, reflecting strong
alternative investment returns, increased mark-to-market gains on structured securities and redeployment of excess cash

held at year-end. Alternative Investment income was almost $120 million above our expected return.
The first quarter marked another step on our path to increasing the intrinsic value of AIG Property Casualty. Our shift
to high value business, combined with underwriting and claims practice improvements, exemplified how our focus on
balancing growth, profitability and risk is helping to produce better margins. We maintain our commitment to capital
efficiency and optimizing our risk profile.
In Japan, for example, we recently integrated the majority of our operations under one holding company, which will
enable greater capital flexibility and create operating efficiencies. We look forward to contributing our planned full
year dividends to the holding company during the remainder of the year.
In closing, I'm satisfied with our positive momentum. I'm confident that this quarter is only the beginning of a
successful year.
Turning to slide 12, I'd like to comment on Mortgage Guaranty's performance and our outlook for this core insurance
holding. The first quarter was another quarter of improving profitability and growth in new business. Delinquency
counts continued to fall and Mortgage Guaranty continues to see a growing portion of earned premiums, now almost
50% from high quality business written since 2009, and declining losses from legacy run-off exposure.
We expect UGC is very well positioned to take advantage of an expanding private mortgage insurance market.
Profitability is expected to grow over the course of the year and we'll continue to capitalize on our unique underwriting
approach and strong capital position.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jay.
Jay Wintrob
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 13, as you can see, this was another strong quarter for
AIG's Life and Retirement business with a 6% increase in operating income from a year ago to $1.4 billion. The
year-ago quarter included a $246 million gain on the final Maiden Lane II distribution.
First quarter operating income growth was driven by the robust equity markets, which contributed to strong investment
returns on our portfolios of Alternative Investments and mark-to-market securities. Combined with another positive
quarter for our investment in PICC common stock, these portfolios contributed approximately $320 million in
investment income above our expected returns.
Strong equity markets also contributed to our growth in assets under management, driving increased fee income. The
quarter also benefited from lower mortality costs and our continued active management of crediting rates, which
dampened the impact of the low interest rate environment.
In addition to strong earnings, as David mentioned, AIG Life and Retirement provided $1.3 billion of liquidity to the
holding company through dividends and note repayments from our operating Life companies. And we're on target to
deliver on our expected dividends to the holding company for 2013.
Total premiums and deposits this quarter were $5.6 billion, roughly flat with the year-ago quarter and 7% higher than
the fourth quarter of 2012. Net outflows, the sum of sales less all surrenders, death claims, and other benefit payments,
related to our Retail Investment products and Group Retirement businesses were $244 million, a marked improvement
from the previous year, with each of our business lines contributing to this favorable trend.
Variable annuities were the leading driver of inflows, while fixed annuities showed the greatest incremental
improvement in net outflows due to improvement in sales and a decline in surrenders.
We continue to see strong variable annuity sales growth and remain comfortable with our product offering, risk
management and the overall environment with respect to the VA business. We also remain disciplined in managing our
fixed annuity sales and in-force block. Our cost-efficient, flexible annuity platform, based here in Amarillo, Texas, and

deep relationships with banks in particular, have allowed us to remain the number one provider of fixed annuities
through the bank channel.
The low interest rate environment, however, obviously continues to negatively impact product demand across the
industry. We are now reporting under our new segment presentation and our new segments and the underlying lines of
businesses, which we illustrate on slide 14, reflect recent organizational changes and how we manage the business and
allocate resources.
Our results are now broadly reported in two segments, Retail and Institutional. And we also provide profitability and
additional supplemental information for certain key businesses. The Retail segment includes our Individual Life and
A&H business, Fixed Annuities, Retirement Income Solutions, and Retail Mutual Funds and Broker-Dealer Services.
Our Retirement Income Solutions business line now includes both variable and indexed annuities, reflecting the fact
that [indiscernible] (21:29) of these products, rather than focusing only on asset accumulation, are increasingly
interested in guaranteed income. And today the vast majority of each of these products now includes a guaranteed
lifetime withdrawal benefit rider option.
The Institutional segment includes our Group Retirement business, which was previously reported as VALIC,
Institutional Markets, and AIG Benefit Solutions, our Group Benefits joint venture with AIG Property Casualty, under
which AIG Life and Retirement reports 50% of the results.
Our Institutional Markets business represents opportunistic offerings, including stable value wrap contracts, structured
settlements, and pension buyouts. Given our opportunistic approach to the institutional marketplace, [indiscernible]
(22:20) results will fluctuate from period to period.
Slide 15 highlights the product diversity across our segments. The contribution of strong Alternative Investment returns
benefited all product lines this quarter. In addition, active spread management benefited both our Retail and
Institutional segments.
Total base portfolio yields, shown on slide 16, remained under pressure due to the continued low interest rate
environment, and total yield or reported yield reflects the strength of Alternative Investments and the gain on our
investment in PICC stock. We expect that base yields could see pressure for the rest of this year as we continue to take
gains on certain portfolios of securities in order to utilize capital loss carry-forwards that are available to us, and due to
prevailing low interest rates.
Turning to slide 17, you can see the trend in base yields and net investment spreads in each of our leading spread-based
businesses, Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement. Fixed Annuities have benefited from our active management of
crediting rates, and net investment spreads increased this quarter. Approximately 73% of our Fixed Annuity and
Universal Life account values now are at minimum guaranteed crediting rates and we would expect to continue to
actively manage spreads.
Group Retirement also benefited from reductions in crediting rates, which offset the impact of shifting into certain
lower yielding, higher credit quality invested assets, which we mentioned we began last quarter. With considering our
fixed product flows, it is important to note that close to half of our sales in deposits were into products with guaranteed
minimum interest rates of 1%, while the majority of surrenders, death claims and other benefits were paid from
products with a guaranteed minimum interest rate of 3% or above.
In sum, we're off to a good start to the year with solid earnings and distributions to parent. We plan to continue to
execute on our growth strategies by leveraging our strong relationships with distribution partners to increase sales of
our broad product portfolio across all channels while continuing to look for opportunities to run our businesses in the
most effective and efficient manner possible.
And now, I'll turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.

Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you. Operator, could we open up the lines now for Q&A?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you and good morning. There's been a significant amount of news around the lift-out of the
team from AIG Property Casualty to Berkshire Hathaway. Could you address that and also give us a sense of whether
we should anticipate that more of the leadership could depart? Thank you.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Well, I guess I can only tell you that of the top 3,300 executives of AIG, during 2012 of
the top 30% performers of that group we retained 94% of those people. So I know you want to focus on four people in
the Property Casualty business. It's a very big and successful business. We're going to lose people to competitors from
time to time. We have an outstanding team that's still here. You saw how quickly Peter was able to put new executives
in charge. I think the reaction to the staff has been very positive.
So turnover occurs but if you can retain 94% of your top 3,300 people running this company – and by the way, 45% of
that group had been with AIG more than 10 years, 15% of that group more than 20 years. So we have experience, we
have a deep bench, we have a talented group of people. Not everybody's going to be happy with the company as we go
forward and I can see that our competition is struggling a little bit with their flows and so they have to get in businesses
they weren't in traditionally. So I think we're fine and we're moving on. So I think that's the only way I can answer the
question.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay, thank you. And then switching gears, could you provide some insight as to when AIG could
reinstate its common shareholder dividend and also resume the share buyback?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: What we said is that we're going to focus on our coverage ratio. We're going to continue
to focus on liability management. We also want to make sure that we have completed the sale of ILFC, so that non-core
asset is now completed in terms of the sale, so that we reduce our debt, for example, even though it's not direct, but
about $25 billion. That's a key milestone we have to reach. We're continuing to look at our capital plan and doing our
stress testing. And we're meeting with the rating agencies to make sure that whatever we do does not cause them any
concern.
And then our second priority after liability management we said would be a dividend. And after that, we would still like
to do stock buybacks but we're going to do it in a very slow and cautious way to make sure that we do nothing to affect
our current ratings, and that the rating agencies are satisfied with what we're doing, because the most important thing
for AIG right now is to maintain and build on the confidence that we can make guarantees sometimes for people's
lifetimes and we'll be here to live up to those guarantees. So that's our highest priority as we go forward.
And so as the year progresses, you can see our numbers, you can see our performance. When we think it's prudent and
everyone else feels it's prudent we'll make those decisions.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Good morning, thanks. I just wanted to clarify the ROE goal. It's not inclusive of FAS 115
and the DTA, is that correct from a book value perspective?

<A - David L. Herzog>: That's correct.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay, so just to be clear, you take current stated book value of $67, subtract $20 a share and
so we're really at a $47 book value number and then we sort of grow off of that and we want to earn a 10% ROE
against it?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I'm not quite sure I follow your math. Maybe we could do that offline. I think that's probably
the best way to handle that.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Okay, it's just – I mean, it's just FAS 115 and DTA subtracted from current GAAP book
value, but okay. So it's – the goal is 10% ROE ex-FAS 115, ex DTA in 2015, great. And then the other is just on the
capital deployment side. You mentioned $25 billion to $30 billion, can you update us on how much you have left to do
to get to that goal? Like how much has been completed and how much more can you do to meet that?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, sure. We've – this is David. We did, through 2012, we did $13 billion of common equity
share repurchase and thus far this year, we've done a little over $2 billion of debt capital management. Again, you've – I
gave you the interest savings on that. We don't view maturities that are being funded through cash as part of that capital
management. That's just part of the ongoing management of the company. So the calls – early calls on the hybrids, we
do consider that part of our capital management goal.
So if you think about it, we – through the end of this year, we'll have done, with what we've already done plus the
planned call on the hybrid, we will have done close to $16 billion against that $25 billion to $30 billion. And so that's
how – I mean that's where we are to date. And then the company continues to generate deployable capital and we said
the $4 billion to $5 billion per year of dividends and distributions from our operating companies.
We have interest expense and some parent company expenses of roughly $2 billion or so a year and so therein lies the
generation of deployable capital. And as Bob referenced earlier, the unencumbered proceeds from ILFC which will be
available at the holding company for consideration.
<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Perfect, great. That's very clear, thank you. And then last, is just any update on the non-bank
SIFI process, the timing. I'm wondering if that's slipping at all and when we might get clarity, and I know that's a bit
unfair but just any help there would be great. Thanks again and good quarter.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think on the SIFI part of it, you remember we are now being regulated by the Federal
Reserve. We've been working through a lot of things with them since they arrived in September. We have a very good
working relationship. They have dug in to understand a lot about our businesses. They are now in the process of fully
examining the way we stress test this organization.
So the SIFI process is going to be something we'll have to go through. But I think the biggest issue there'll probably be
what amounts of additional cushion you may have to have. But as far as the basics, you've got to make sure that you're
running these companies, insurance companies, the banks and so on, in a sound way. I mean there's a huge public
outcry of making sure that these institutions don't need taxpayer money.
And unfortunately, we've not done a very good job as an industry explaining how much has been done in the last four
years, with over $400 billion of additional capital being raised to strengthen these institutions so it's very difficult for
them to fail based upon the stress tests that everyone is going through today.
So a lot of progress has been made. People have still not declared victory unfortunately. So I think that's the bigger
cloud but I'm pretty confident that, SIFI or not SIFI, at the end we're going to be able to demonstrate the financial
strength of this company, that our stress tests are very well done, that we understand risk management, that we've dealt
with the non-core assets and that AIG has the financial strength to do its capital management on a go-forward basis in a
prudent way.
So that's pretty much where we're at, and when SIFI comes, it comes, but it will be more about the ratios than the
quality of our numbers.

<Q - Greg W. Locraft>: Thanks, makes sense, and nice job on the core operations this quarter.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from John Nadel with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess either for Bob or for David. You opened
the call with commentary about focusing on the core and my question is when, on an internal basis when you strip out
some of the noise in the quarter, obviously very favorable overall, I'm hoping you can help us discern what you'd view
as the true core underlying earnings in ROE. Yes, I know David mentioned ROE on a reported basis was about 11% on
equity excluding the DTA but I'm interested in your view as to the core results.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think I'll let David answer. We normalize for things that are pluses and minuses and
we've gone through some of that and you got to decide, all of you, I can't give you the answer, John. You've got to
think about how you want to deal with partnerships and we may want to budget it at 8% or 10%. You've got to decide if
getting to 11% to 12% is still core.
But I would say that if you look at our accident year information, that's a key indicator. You look at the flows in Jay's
business, net flows, and understand that our losses in terms of surrenders in the fixed annuity block are at minimums.
So therefore, that's actually improving the spread. So all of that's – I don't know how you would do that, but you have
to look at, I would say just his flows, his spread, and looking at the Mortgage Guaranty and the new book of business
coming in. And I think in Property Casualty, the accident year combined ratio is a hell of an indicator. So those are
some of the things I would suggest you want to think about as you examine our ability going forward. David?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Bob, I think you laid that out very well. The items that give rise to variability, things like the
Alternative Investments or the Direct Investment book that will again over time pull to a level of intrinsic value that
will ultimately be monetized. Again, the path from here to there is not a straight line. So again – and we give you some
broad parameters around what's on the balance sheet vis-à-vis the Direct Investment book in terms of the total assets
and total liabilities. We also in the financial supplement give you some parameters around what the alternative
investments are for each of our core businesses that, again, you can make some reasonable assumptions based upon the
prior performance and your expectations about what equity markets and the like will do over time.
So what we try to do for you is give you a sense of what those underlying variable items are so that you can make your
own determination and assessment about them. Again, we're making risk/return tradeoffs in terms of maintaining and
holding those assets as we did with, for example, the Global Capital Markets and some of the wind-down portfolios in
the legacy financial products book. Again, over time, we believe there is intrinsic value that's appropriate for us to hang
on to given the risk/return and it will pull to intrinsic, again over time. So there are some pages in the supplement that
give you the underlying balance sheet so you can make those assumptions.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: And I guess, maybe suffice to ask it this way. I assume you believe that the core underlying
results are right on track or on track with your overall objective, looking out the next couple of years.
<A - David L. Herzog>: I think we remain committed to our long-term aspirational goals. And the results of the
company, the progress that Peter and Jay are making are the basis that give us confidence to remain committed to those
goals.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thank you, and just a quick follow-up on Peter's comments. I may have missed it. He made a
comment about Commercial Property. And I wasn't clear on whether it was a 20-point improvement in the accident
year loss ratio, which seems like too much, or maybe it was a comment on pricing. Could you just clarify that?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Hey, John. It's John Doyle.

And we'll take our next question from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Hi, good morning. You gave some new disclosures on the cash committed to the DIB
at the holding company, which was very helpful. If you work back from on balance sheet resources, add in the
unencumbered fixed-income investments, you get to a number of around $6 billion, which obviously excludes the
future proceeds from ILFC or the MetLife escrow, et cetera, but the number is around $6 billion if my math is right. I'm
just curious. If you put SIFI to the side, what is the right number to hold at the holding company in terms of cash and
investment resources, knowing you've got CMAs and the way the whole structure works?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. Hi, Mark. It's David, and thank you. Yes, your math is correct. If you look at page seven
of the call deck, you get to in that zip code. It's $5.96 billion as of the end of the quarter. And then again, what I said
earlier was that, again, at the holding company we have at the end of the – when we exit 2013, the run rate interest
expense will reflect our cash funded maturities and the active or proactive debt capital management that we have
undertaken this year. So the interest expense will come down accordingly, but nonetheless we'll have roughly $2
billion-plus, $2.2 billion, $2 billion, something like that in terms of annual expenses at the holding company to be
funded.
And again, from that, again, we've not given a specific amount or an algorithm or a formula or a stated amount to hold,
but that gives you a sense of what prudent financial management would call for. So in any event, then you can go from
there in terms of how we're generating deployable capital for consideration once the SIFI designations are known and
we understand the requirements of the stress tests, et cetera.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. And then I think you emphasized the $750 million hybrid as the liability
management through 2013, but you emphasized through 2013 and you emphasized liability management generally in
talking about the capital position. How should we think about liability management beyond 2013?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I think you should think about it as opportunistic and we will assess the progress that we've
made vis-à-vis our coverage ratios that Bob spoke about earlier. And we'll evaluate, again, all facts and circumstances
at the time. So again, we've made very good progress in 2013 on the goals we set out to improve our coverage ratio.
And again, I think that, as we have done in the past, we will look to optimize returns for all the various stakeholders,
and obviously capital management is an important part of that.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, and then just one quick final question, please. I don't know if Brian is there. I
assume he is. But how much is the remaining – what's the update on the remaining pull to intrinsic in the DIB that you
estimate currently?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: As we've said in prior quarters, the pull to intrinsic is holding strong. It's approximately $5
billion, consistent with what we had talked about last quarter. That will obviously be realized over a longer period of
time. Again, you're seeing the results coming through in the earnings. As David mentioned, the DIB reaches its half-life
in 2017. There's another big slug of maturity in 2018. So it would be after that point that we'd see a fair amount of that
pulled to intrinsic as well as, at that point, some release of the capital in that business.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: So $5 billion from this point?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: That is correct.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Hey, thank you. So I have a question about the yen. I think about 20% of the P&C consolidated
premiums come in the form of yen premiums, and I don't believe that it's hedged from an earnings perspective. So I
understand the callouts that you gave on how that affected the top line in production, but it didn't seem like there was
much bottom line impact this quarter. And so I guess, one, I wanted to clarify that there was not a lot of impact from
the yen, and that may be related to the fact that the combined ratio is relatively close to 100%. But then also, to ask if
you have plans to potentially hedge that more actively going forward if you plan to have profitability improvement.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: This is Peter. The issue is that Japan, unlike the U.S., is heavily a consumer business and it's
our largest direct marketing operation, which has substantial upfront marketing costs which are expensed in the current
period. So from a GAAP net income point of view, you're absolutely right. The bottom line in yen is actually quite
small. But the value of new business that we originate, if you were to capitalize that acquisition cost over the expected
life of the persistency of these policies, which are annual policies but have a very high renewal percentage, makes it a
very attractive business from a lifetime customer value perspective.
So from a value point of view, we are hurt by the weaker yen because that value of new business is reduced. But from a
GAAP reported bottom line, we're pretty indifferent. So that does present some hedging dilemmas in terms of GAAP
reported volatility. But I think that your way of observing that the top line impact is where the visible effect of the yen
is most notable, but that the GAAP volatility as a result of yen volatility is negligible. But from a value point of view,
that franchise is valuable, but it will be realized over the life of these customer relationships.
<Q - Randy Binner>: So I guess is it correct, though, that there's not an active hedging program on that value, I guess?
And is there anything about what's going on with the movement in the yen that would make you rethink that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: We have currency exposures in all 90 countries we operate in. We manage our currency
exposures in a top-down way because we have positives and negatives all over the place. We do not do micro hedging
of each line item. So that's all I think I would say about the hedging approach.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Okay. And there's one more, if I could, just on the very good underlying combined ratio on
Property Casualty. Is there more business mix and higher value business, or phrases that you'd use to describe the result
– and I think like John Nadel, I'm just wondering what we can run rate going forward. Is there more property business
being written here and so it over-earns a little bit in a quarter like the first quarter but it could get hit if there's higher cat
activity as the year goes on? Is that a major feature of what we saw on an underlying basis in the first quarter?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'll have John elaborate. But I think we made it very clear that we think that the first quarter
was a light cat quarter. So yes, the cat quarter needs to be normalized for the normal run rate of cats. We have seen a
growth in our Property business, especially International Property, especially our Large Limit Property, but our
aggregate PMLs have been coming down steadily as we manage our aggregations more and more. So I think that it's an
inherently volatile line and so you need to normalize for cat activity. But, John, do you want to elaborate on that?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: I would just add that the exposure growth in Property, I mentioned to John that the premium
growth, net written growth in the quarter was about 20%. But the exposure growth was less than that. We saw about
8% – 9% of price improvement in our portfolio, in our Property portfolio. And as Peter mentioned, our PMLs are on a
now modest decline year over year, so the exposure growth has come outside of cat and really outside of our peak
zones in the United States.
<Q - Randy Binner>: All right, that's helpful. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes, thank you. On the Alternatives, I know some of these are reported with a one quarter lag.
Based on the movements in the markets in the first quarter, do you have any visibility into the 2Q reported numbers? It
seems like it's setting up to be a better than expected quarter again. Can you just talk about that?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Bill Dooley?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Jay, you see the same results for the quarter as I do as far as the general market is
concerned, and the one quarter lag has only to do with the Private Equity portfolio. The other one is just a one-month
lag on the hedge funds. So I don't want to assume where the market is going to go, but I'm not going to agree or
disagree with what you just said.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Fair enough. And I guess a follow-up to the last question. Peter, you mentioned obviously we
need to adjust for catastrophe losses. Do you have a sense that, excluding catastrophe losses, if loss activity in general
was in line or lighter than normal?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Jay, it's John. Our Property losses were in line with what we expect, including shock losses in
the quarter. I would say that the shock losses, so the more than $10 million losses in Property, were in line with what
our expectations were but higher than a year ago and higher than the fourth quarter.
<Q - Randy Binner>: That's great feedback, John. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Yes. Thank you, first, a numbers question. I wanted to know if you could walk through how
much of the DTA was used during the quarter and how much the valuation allowance came off?
<A - David L. Herzog>: On the valuation allowance, Josh, we took, on the DTA, on the capital loss carry-forwards,
took down about $750 million. That was through income, and there was about another $50 million or so that came off
through OCI. So in total, strategies that produced prudent and feasible transactions were about $800 million or so. And
then on the DTA utilization, Jeff Farber?
<A - Jeffrey M. Farber>: It's essentially the same thing, right? So we only do our tax return once a year. So when we
do the tax return – but you could think about the earnings for the quarter as a surrogate for usage. So we continue to use
the NOLs actively and we continue to utilize the Life Capital loss carry forwards as we have disclosed in the quarter.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you. And I'm not trying to begrudge Peter or John or Jay anything. I'm trying to
understand the long-term compensation plan a little bit and some of the specific targets. And when it says in the
long-term comp plan there are specific targets to receive 50% of the bonus, how do those specific targets in the P&C
division relate to the aspirational goal of 90% to 95% in 2015?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: This is Peter. The aspirational goals are laid out in different components. There's a combined
number. There's an ROE number. And the one that, if you want to pick any one of them that is the most important one
that we focus on is the ROE one. So we, as you know, gave a range for the combined. And you want to be at the lower
end of that range if interest rates are high and you're getting your results flattered by high investment income. And so I
think that what we view as the alignment between the compensation plan is effectively an ROE goal. And so if we are
on the ROE walk that delivers the 2015 goal, then people will feel pleased.
So it's I think a very strong alignment. We set fairly broad goals. We don't break up the company into little silos. And
that's a big change and I think culturally, has people working together across boundaries, whether they're geographic

boundaries or business line boundaries, so that everybody wins if we all win as a team. And I think that that's really
showing up in the culture of the company, and our customers are giving us feedback on that. So I think we want to
align interests with the shareholders as well as making sure that our units work together across boundaries well. So it is
a pool approach of how the Property Casualty business as a whole achieves its ROE goal, which then drives the ROE
goal of AIG.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Peter, do you think it's feasible? I'd like you to get paid and make a lot of money. But if you
don't hit that 95% or below target, do you think it's feasible that the ROE goal will be achieved?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, absolutely.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Absolutely, it could. It's a question of capital intense products. It's a whole other series
of factors that go on here. And what's important is that it's the quality of what we do. Peter has said numerous times that
the combined ratio is a consequence of what we do. It's not what we manage. And when you get involved in managing
that combined ratio, you could do some dumb things. And there are things you could do to reduce your expense ratio,
which is reducing your expenses, and there are other techniques you could do in financial engineering.
We want people to focus on the fundamentals, focus on accident year loss ratios, run this thing the right way. And in
the end, we believe the combined will get into that range of 90% – 95%. But most important is you want to continue to
grow the quality of your earnings and you want to have a better ROE. And if you continue to grow earnings and
improve your ROE and shareholder return continues to get better, and total shareholder return plus earnings per share,
those are the key indicators for us, and if that all moves in the right direction, then I think people should be paid, and
they will be paid. So I think their incentives are very aligned to doing what's right for the shareholders, and they're in
there with the shareholders because of stock based compensation part of long term.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think I mentioned earlier in the context of discussing our yen exposure, Direct Marketing
hurts our combined ratio but creates extremely good value. And we've talked many times about the marginal ROE over
the lifetime of those customer relationships as being in the 20%s, 20% based on very reliable actuarial histories. And so
we wouldn't want to underspend on Direct Marketing simply to get under the wire on a combined target. We want to do
good valuable business and build long-term customer relationships that make sense. And for the skeptics, we will
publish greater and greater detail about those actuarial assumptions so that you don't think that we are foolishly wasting
money on growth.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Thank you for all your answers.

And our next question comes from Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Yes, thank you. Hey, Jay, you mentioned monetizing some capital gains in the Life sub. I'm
just curious. How much of the $25 billion in gross unrealized gains is there, and how much do you think you can
monetize? And I don't know, David, if you can remind us what the timeline for expiration is on those capital losses,
thanks.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. Hey, Jay, I'll go first and then maybe you comment, and Bill, if you want to add to it. A
very substantial portion, Mike, of the capital loss carry-forward DTA expires at the end of 2013. There's about $1
billion or so that spills over into 2014, but the bulk of the carry-forward expires at the end of this year. Now the NOLs,
just to be clear, the NOLs go out through 2028 and 2029, so there's a very ample time there. And then the foreign tax
credits are more in the 2020, 2021, 2022 range, so that gives you a sense of the expiries.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Right, yes. No, this is unrelated to the NOL, DTA, but just be purely the capital gains that
you have.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, right, and that's why the focus is on 2013. So the harvesting, et cetera, again, will be
more opportunistic beyond 2013 and 2014. Bill, do you want to comment?

<A - William N. Dooley>: Sure. When you look at just the capital gains by itself, there are other programs that we look
at too on harvesting gains for tax reasons. And the gain process itself has been going on now over the last year and it
was restarted in the month of March, and it will continue for the next couple of months. But we're using the gain
mechanism also to readjust and reposition the portfolio. So the portfolio from a duration standpoint is probably short
duration at this time. And we're using this as an opportunity to lengthen the portfolio a little bit and also better balance
against some of the products that are in the Life companies.
And then another example of this is that we're looking at ways to raise liquidity over the period of time for the Life
companies and for the other companies at AIG. And one of the strategies we've employed is a modified securities
lending program. And that gives liquidity to the underlying insurance companies, but at the same time it generates
certain types of tax benefits to us on a simultaneous basis. And there are other transactions and structures that we're
using. But the bottom line of everything is it's repositioning some of these portfolios that really haven't been
repositioned in many, many years.
<A - Jay Wintrob>: Yes, Mike, this is – I guess I'd just add one comment to what's already been said, which is
obviously it's very economically efficient for us to realize capital gains given the tax loss carry-forward position, but
we also very carefully focus on what we can do in terms of reinvestment at any given point in time and what the
friction costs are, including lost investment income if you're not able to reinvest promptly the proceeds of any sales.
And so we've targeted certain assets for potential sale, but it's all subject to what we see in the market in terms of
potential purchases and as a practical matter how quickly we can make those purchases.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Just to add to that. Thanks, Jay. The amount that we have actually utilized is actually ahead of
what we thought we would do originally when we first set forth our aspirational goals back in early 2011. So we will
have utilized about half of the amount in, which exceeded the sort of the 20% to 25% level we were expecting that we
could at the time. So Liz, back to you.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Can I ask one quick follow-up to Peter? Peter, I guess the – you guys had mentioned before
a $1 billion run rate or a $1 billion shaving on expenses and some investments as well. I'm just trying to understand, I
mean, we saw the expense ratio fall in U.S. Commercial, we saw it rise a bit in International Consumer, and then
Consumer in North America was a bit lower than we had. I'm just trying to reconcile those movements, in particular the
G&A expense ratio in U.S. Commercial, or North American Commercial, was really low. Any – can you help me kind
of line those dots up a little bit? Thanks.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'll help you out. I think the basic comment we've made is we have $1 billion of savings
for all of AIG. We have said a good piece of it comes from the fact that we're doing this whole technology
improvement, rebuilding our platforms. We've gone from 28 data centers down to two. We're moving from 12,500
servers to roughly 2,000 to 3,000, all moved into high secure locations.
All of that will give us a lot more cost savings and benefit. We're rolling out a new one-claim system, for example,
throughout the Property Casualty business. That's a huge investment. Our Financial Architecture, where we have
almost 6,000 people at AIG today working in various aspects of finance, we're rolling out common ledgers and so on,
building new processes around that. So this is a fundamental change in how we do business. And it's at the highest
level. We keep track of those benefits. We're well on our way to achieve that $1 billion goal, so it's not just a focus on
Property Casualty. It's really about the overall of AIG. And at this point I think we're out of time.
