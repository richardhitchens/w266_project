MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is
scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask
questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communication.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2015 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will
be talking about results for the first quarter of 2015 and comparing to them to the same period in 2014, unless otherwise
stated.
A glossary of terms. Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset
impairment, exit and other costs, and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP
measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs, is
the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to
smoking combustible cigarettes.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release, for a variety of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
Now, my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?

Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to report that PMI is off to an excellent start in
2015, with robust fundamentals driving a strong business performance that is benefiting from our investments last year.
As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are raising our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing
exchange rates by $0.05 to a range of $4.32 to $4.42. This increase reflects the better-than-expected volume and share
performance in the first quarter, and an improved outlook for the balance of the year.
Our guidance continues to include approximately $1.15 per share of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates.
Excluding the impact of currency, our 2015 guidance represents a growth rate of 9% to 11% compared to our adjusted
diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014.
Although the total estimated unfavorable currency impact on our revised guidance remains unchanged versus our
February guidance, there has been a shift since then in its composition. The positive impact of the appreciation of the
Russian ruble and the depreciation of the Swiss franc have been offset by the unfavorable impact of a further
strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus most other currencies, particularly the euro. As exchange rates remain volatile,
we do not foresee any share repurchases in 2015, and this is reflected in today's guidance.
Let me now take you through our first quarter results. Organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4%, driven by market share
gains across all four Regions and favorable inventory movements, notably in Italy, Spain and other markets supplied by
manufacturing facilities in the EU Region. This growth was partly offset by lower cigarette industry volume,
principally in Japan, Korea and Russia. Excluding inventory movement, organic cigarette volume declined by an
estimated 0.5%.
Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 9.1% and 16.3%, respectively, driven
by strong pricing across all Regions and favorable volume/mix in the EU and EEMA Regions. Adjusted diluted EPS of
$1.16 in the quarter grew by 23.5%, excluding currency.
Our performance in the quarter was flattered by a favorable comparison versus the challenging first quarter of 2014. As
we have mentioned previously, the second half of the year will include incremental spending, primarily behind the
deployment of iQOS.
Strong pricing was the key driver of our financial performance. Our quarterly pricing variance reached $552 million,
and included a gain from inventories that we're able to build in Korea prior to the recent tax change. Importantly, our
first quarter pricing was strong across all four Regions. We are well-positioned to achieve a full-year pricing variance,
broadly in line with our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion.
Our results were supported by solid market share gains. We performed very well in our top 30 OCI markets, increasing
share by 1.2 percentage points to 38.1%. Share grew or was flat in 22 of these markets. Our share gains were
geographically broad-based and driven by range of brands, including Marlboro. The brand share grew by 0.1 point in
the EU, 0.4 points in EEMA, and 0.5 points in Latin America and Canada.
Turning now to our Regions. We continue to perform extremely well in EEMA, which was the largest contributor to
our strong currency-neutral results in the quarter. Regional market share increased by 0.7 points, driven by the success
of Parliament, Marlboro and L&M. We gained share in the key geographies of North Africa, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.
Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI grew by 13.9% and 24.2%, respectively. This
growth was driven by higher pricing, notably in Russia, Egypt and the Middle East, and a favorable volume/mix in
nearly all of our markets outside Eastern Europe.
In Russia our performance was outstanding. We achieved double-digit OCI growth, excluding currency, despite the
9.3% decline in cigarette industry volume. Our strong brand portfolio helped drive market share gains and higher local
currency unit margins for net pricing. February quarter-to-date market share reached 27.7%, an increase of 0.9 share
points versus the same period last year. Parliament grew by 0.5 points, which drove an increase in our premium
segment share of 3.5%. Low-priced Bond Street grew by 0.9 points.

Despite significant excise tax-driven price increases and the weakening of consumer purchasing power, we have not
observed any material shift in price segment trends. However, as I mentioned at the CAGNY conference in February,
the macroeconomic environment in Russia continues to be fragile. We recently announced a further increase in the
retail selling prices of RUB 4 per pack across the majority of our portfolio, although, this will not be reflected in the
market until later this quarter.
In the EU Region, first quarter cigarette industry volume declined by 1.6%, or an estimated 2.7% after adjusting for
favorable trade inventory movement. For the year, we forecast a cigarette industry decline of approximately 4%, as we
expect the recently implemented price increases to impact adult smoker demand over the balance of the year.
We maintained our regional cigarette share momentum in the first quarter with a gain of 0.4 points to 39.6%. This
increase reflected share growth in the five largest markets by cigarette industry volume, as well as the positive
performance of our three largest brands in the Region, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, which all gained share.
We achieved adjusted OCI growth in the EU region of 12.9%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by higher
pricing across most markets, as well as favorable volume mix, notably in Southern Europe. On the same basis, we
expect the region to be a positive contributor to PMI's adjusted OCI growth this year.
I will now cover our Asia Region, beginning with Japan. Cigarette industry volume declined by 13.9% in the first
quarter, due mainly to the impact of retail trade and consumer purchases last year in anticipation of the consumption
tax-driven retail price increases effective April 1, 2014. After adjusting for these distortions, the decline was an
estimated 3.5%. We forecast an industry decline for the year in the range of 2.5% to 3%, as the trend should improve
now that we have lapped the April 2014 price increases. Our market share increased by 0.1 point in the quarter.
However, after adjusting for the aforementioned distortions, it declined moderately due mainly to the timing of
competitive brand launches. We expect our full-year share to benefit from the recent rollout of the Marlboro 2.0
Architecture across all three pillars and strong pipeline of innovation.
In the Philippines we witnessed further retail price increases at the low end of the market in the first quarter. [ph] These
have (11:16) restored positive unit margins in the super-low price segment, while price gaps have narrowed and driven
Marlboro's share growth. We believe that the competitive environment is being improved by the recent introduction of
tax stamps. Despite significant price increases in this important market, smoking prevalence has remained stable. The
reduction in average daily consumption has been due mainly to adult smokers of brands at the low-end of the market.
We attribute the decrease, in large part, to sticker shock following price increases for super-low priced brands of
approximately 27% on average since October of last year. We expect average daily consumption to largely recover as
the year unfolds and adult smokers adjust to new price levels. We are pleased by our positive momentum in the first
quarter, and are optimistic about the improving OCI outlook in the Philippines.
In Indonesia, first quarter cigarette industry volume grew by 5.9%. Quarterly volume result in the market can be
volatile, and thus, may not be representative of the annual trend. For the year, we forecast growth of approximately 2%.
Our market share grew by 0.8 points to 35.4%, mainly due to strong performances in the growing machine-made kretek
segment by Dji Sam Soe Magnum and Magnum Blue, as well as our flagship brand in the segment, Sampoerna A.
However, our hand-rolled kretek brands remained under pressure, as adult smokers continued to switch to machine
made product. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential share growth and we are well-positioned for
further gains.
We recently announced U Bold in the rapidly growing full-flavor machine made kretek segment, where we are
currently underrepresented but are gaining share. The Indonesian market offers exceptional long-term prospects, thanks
to its growing adult population and a favorable economic environment. We believe that we are best positioned within
our industry to benefit from these trends.
In the Latin America & Canada Region, adjusted OCI grew by 35.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by
pricing in Argentina, Canada and Mexico. This impressive OCI growth enabled the region to be an important
contributor to PMI's results despite its small relative base. Our share in the region grew by 0.9 points to 38.3% driven
mainly by Marlboro. Argentina and Brazil recorded strong share performances, with growth of 1.4 points and 2.4

points, respectively.
Turning now to our RRP portfolio, the performance of our iQOS pilot launches is in line with or exceeds our
expectation. In both Nagoya and Milan, sales of HeatSticks are growing sequentially. More importantly, the launches
have provided valuable learnings that are being incorporated into our plans for future rollouts and cover areas such as
the flagship store concept, the logistics chain, after-sales support, channel strategy, as well was consumer
communication and engagement. We remain on track to commence national expansion in Japan and Italy, as well as
pilot or national launches in additional markets later this year. Let me also quickly highlight, that we announced the
e-vapor product Solaris, last month in Spain.
We remain steadfast in our determination to offer an attractive dividend to our shareholders. At the close last Friday our
dividend yield was 5.1%. This was significantly above that of our proxy peer group and 10-year U.S. treasury notes. It
was also well-above the dividend yield of our main international tobacco competitors.
In conclusion we achieved strong currency-neutral results in the first quarter, driven by robust business fundamentals
that are underpinned by our investments last year. Our superior brand portfolio, supported by a superb commercial
organization, is driving positive market share momentum and strong pricing. We continue to focus vigorously on our
costs, and for 2015, anticipate the total company cost base increase, excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately
1%.
The iQOS pilot launches are performing well, and we are on track with our plans for national expansion and additional
launches later this year. We are managing our cash flow prudently in order to provide a generous dividend and an
attractive yield. Despite our free cash flow decline in the first quarter, due mainly to currency and temporary working
capital movement, we forecast 2015 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year's level.
Overall, we are off to an excellent start in 2015, and are optimistic about our business outlook. We are raising our 2015
reported diluted EPS guidance, which on a currency-neutral basis, reflects a growth rate of 9% to 11% versus 2014
adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02.
Thank you, and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Good morning. Thank you. I just had two questions for you. I'm going to ask the first
one, as you saw these better volume performance here in the first quarter, even excluding the inventory movements, it
was much better than what I expected, do you think this is going to hold for the year? Do you have an updated, perhaps,
the forecast for the industry overall? Are there areas of certain regions, where you're seeing this improvement, maybe
more than others? I'm just curious on how much that can hold for the year.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, we said in our remarks that we expect EU to be in about the 4%. There were very
strong volumes in the EU in the first quarter. There obviously, as you have noticed, also in our remarks, we said there is
some movement, helped by some inventory movement associated with the last quarter closure of the [ph] Bergen
(18:28) factory in Holland, which is the main supplier. But still, excluding for those movements, I think you had a
strong start.

I think in a view of the pricing, which we're taking in EU, I think it's prudent at this stage to hold it [ph] for (18:42) 4%.
But we see a good volume momentum in a number of markets, so it's not very important in Southern Europe, but also
other market. In the rest of the world, I think in general, for the full-year, I mean that the outlook is that the industry
volume should be better than the last year. Okay. I mean to say, difficult very precisely to quantify now, but I mean, we
also feel it that, that volumes in the EEMA Region, also Asia, Latin America, I mean, there is more of the structural
improvement going forward. So, I think we will remain optimistic about the volume outlook for the full year, for the
industry, and obviously, for us.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just if I could just – a follow-on question in relation to your earnings
guidance for the year. You had a much stronger first quarter performance that I think what a lot of us had modeled, and
I'm sure what you have modeled as well. So, I'm just curious with the increase in guidance for the year, being less than
the first quarter earnings be, I'm just wondering if there is an incremental level of reinvestment, if there's this
conservatism built in, just how you look at the rest of the year in some of the areas you could use this flexibility to
reinvest?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think that the investment plan, in terms of the cost which we plan to spend for this year, I mean
of the pricing, et cetera, is that it's part of the plan. And so, I don't think at this stage, that we need to go back and then
reinvest. I mean that the brand and commercial organization is well-invested, and the proper resource is allocated
behind [ph] the high costs. (20:09) That obviously is going to be on second part of the year, end of the Q3, more of Q4
type of expense, so this will impact obviously our results in the quarters.
As I said, I mean, I guess the first quarter was somehow helped by the inventory, and as I mentioned, Korea pricing, so
this boosted a bit of performance. But even if I would exclude these inventory movements and the Korea one-off
pricing, we would have a very strong double-digit, very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. So we don't see at
this stage that we need to go in and to change our investment plan. As you noticed, we reconfirmed that we expect the
total cost base, ex-RRP, to stay in the range of 1%, ex-currency obviously. So, we're pretty confident that we will fund
it.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you for that color.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. I just have – my first question is on your Q1, it was clearly very strong. But I guess, I
was hoping you can maybe summarize what are the key items that give you the confidence to raise your full-year
guidance so early in the year.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think, the confidence is coming – I mean, the one-off switch took place in the Q1. I mean, that
they were all well-estimated by us, so the way in the original guidance. I think this underlying momentum continuing
from the last year, which gives you more confidence that you can raise the guidance. So, even as I said before, even
when I exclude the Korean from inventory distortion, the underlying business in the Europe but also in EEMA very
much, I mean that they give you that support that in your thinking, in your estimate for the full year, which prompted us
to increase the guidance by $0.05. [ph] Nothing – (22:07) what we have been working on very hard last year, seems
that this was a temporary type of a solution. I mean, it's a permanent improvement in the Philippines, we hold the share
in Japan despite some blips in the quarter, EU is continuously delivering. So, I mean, it seems that we spent our time
and the all effort in the organization last year properly, so I think we'll build a solid base for this year, this is what it is.

<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, in terms of Marlboro, your volume has rebounded and was
strong in the quarter, so I was hoping you could drill down a little more on this, especially in light of your Marlboro 2.0
rollout. And then, I'd like to hear from you how sustainable you think this is.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, Marlboro, as I said it on a number of occasions, I think at CAGNY, at CAGE most
recently, I mean, Marlboro is in a good shape. I mean, I think the way we improve [ph] an equity (23:02) of the brand
over last two or so years, [ph] helped by the commercial, helped for the (23:05) first the revamp of Marlboro Gold, now
going to Marlboro 2.0 Architecture, I mean, all these components are [ph] the same, they start getting things (23:15)
together, and Marlboro is responding in a number of geographies. It's not just one or two places where we see the
Marlboro uptick. The Marlboro 2.0 is just at this stage rolled out in about 48 markets, and we foresee that by the
year-end we should be in about 100, could be more than 100 markets. So, that's an effort which we will continue. So, I
think Marlboro is receiving continued support in terms of Marlboro 2.0, plus market-by-market, there is a pipeline of
innovation, which are going to hit also later in the year in the market. So, I think I'm confident about the Marlboro
performance this year.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Now that sounds really good. Thank you. And then just my final question is on your RRP
portfolio. First on iQOS, I was hoping you could talk further about some of the learnings you mentioned? And then
second, on Solaris, given the vapor slowdown, why was the timing right to roll out Solaris?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Maybe I'll start with Solaris. I think I mentioned this before, I mean, the reason we went with
Solaris into the market first, I think you that the Altria product is, compared to what you have available in the market, a
very good product. And more importantly for us, is also to go and test and to learn how you're selling e-cigarettes, how
your commercial organization should be adjusted, how you handle the trade, the supply change, the communications
with customers, et cetera. I think before you start engaging larger geographies, it's just simply smart to go and test the
waters in a more contained geographies, in this case, Spain. And apply this learning, which should greatly help us with
our results management going forward.
Now, coming back to the iQOS, look, as I said, whatever we see – there obviously there are differences between in
Milan and Nagoya, and the differences are driven by the distribution spread. It's a much less outlet handling iQOS in
Milan than in Nagoya. There was a difference in, a big difference, in the communication possibilities, the marketing
possibilities, much more open and broader reach, which we can't get in Japan. As obviously, this is reflected with their
awareness levels to start with, which are about twice as high in Nagoya, than in Milan. But if I drill it down to the
number of consumers who have already purchased iQOS, and the acceptance levels, how many have already adopted
iQOS as their permanent product, as a main product, how many still are in between, i.e., using about a half of an iQOS,
half of a combustible cigarette.
And obviously there is a group, which using iQOS very rarely, occasionally, and still stays with the combustible
cigarette, these results are at least at par, if not better, which we had in the whole of our test. So, if you go back to our
test results, which I think we shared with investors during the Investor Day last year, you're shooting at well above the
30%, or above 30% adoption, I mean the full adoption of iQOS today among those who have purchased it, okay?
And as I indicated, the shipment – sorry the offtake volume of the HeatSticks continues, is in a continuous growth. By
week, by week, I can't remember how many weeks essentially since the launch, we can observe the sequential growth
in the HeatStick. But obviously adoption takes time. This is a new technology. Heat, not burn, is not something which
the consumers are so broadly familiar, so it's a lot of work to be done. But we're very enthusiastic and optimistic based
on the results, which we see in this [ph] type of (27:06) market.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. That was great. Thank you so much, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Two. First, I just wanted to clarify two things you said earlier. You mentioned that if
you were to exclude the Korea pricing benefit and the inventory timing issues in the EU, you still would've had
double-digit constant currency growth? That's in EPS not operating income, correct?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. That's correct. This is on EPS.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And the volume impact should be, to whatever extent there is a reversal of that,
that should be concentrated in the second quarter?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I – from the volumes actually, as much as they're related to the typical timing differences
between the Q1 and Q2, which is mainly associated with the timing of the Easter holiday in various geographies. I
think, most of that volume are locked in Q1 and they will not have, we shouldn't have an impact of those volumes
going to Q2.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: And then, just two market-specific questions on Asia. First, could you just give us an
update on market and competitive conditions in Australia? I know you called out positive share, but what are you
seeing in terms of the industry volume reaction to the latest excise tax increases and the pricing headwinds that you
faced in the market there?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: There was the excise tax increase. The industry, we increased the prices, so there was a net
pricing, a net price increase. Maybe it's too early to call it, but I think what we can see in Australia, at least for the first
two months, the current trading conditions, is that the dynamics of the segment growth, mainly the discount segment,
have somehow slowed down. I wouldn't trumpet a success, but if I compared sequential quarter development last year,
versus if I take Q3, very much Q4, and the beginning of the year, you could see some stabilization or signs of
stabilizations in terms of the growth of the discount segment.
So that's obviously very helpful. I think this is the result of maybe a different pricing, maybe for discounting strategies
adopted by the players, et cetera. So, yes, I think we're growing our share. Okay, share in the quarter was somehow
flatter by the comps, because we had a pretty lousy opening of the last year. But I think that Australia for the 2015, I
mean, it clearly is less of the size of a drag which we had last year, if a drag at all. So, I think we slowly, month by
month, we're moving there in the right direction.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks. And then, sorry, one last question, just on Japan. I mean, this is, lots of
areas of strength in the quarter, this is one where performance still seems a bit soft. And I guess, I was just surprised to
see your volumes still down double digits, since you didn't seemingly have the same inventory benefit last year that
your competitors did. How does the double-digit decline compare to how you see consumption on your brands during
the quarter? And is it just the rollout of 2.0 that gave you confidence that things improved through the year?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: First on inventory, I think that our shipments in the first quarter were just – were better than the
total market. So, I think we, you could see these distortions which we had in the Q1 last year. And made somehow
clearing in the – was cleared in the Q1 of this year. Now share, frankly speaking, that the marginal share movement in
Japan, knowing that the market were sensitive on a short-term basis, like quarterly basis, to the pipelining of the
product for the competition launch, for the new product introductions, I wouldn't pay it that much attention. I'll be
watching, obviously, the situation closely, but I think that Japan has enough of the initiatives, including Marlboro 2.0,
but also a pipeline of our new products to the market that we should see the share coming strong during the outer part
of the years. So, I'm personally, we don't think that this quarterly reading from Japan is a red flag which we should be
worried about.

Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, I guess, a few questions on Russia. Number one, just in terms of clarification on the
inventory movement, is it your expectation that, that was really – and I think, you maybe you talked about this in the
context of the total company impact, but in 2Q, does the inventory movement in Q1 come out in Q2 for Russia?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. No. I think that the inventory adjustment in Russia, I think they just corrected the inventories
at the distributor level to which is more corresponding to the outlook for the total market, and more importantly, for the
share which we have in Russia. So, that maybe there are some smaller disruptions of distributor shipment, but I don't
think it's anything what the market is doing, which we should expect the paybacks, nor this was a payback from the last
year. I think, it's just the normal course of the business, however, this was more connected with the recovering or to
recouping the inventories to the right level.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just maybe, underlying trend in Russia, just what are you seeing in terms of the
elasticity to the price increases that happened in December. The fact that you're taking on other pricing, does that imply
that the impact on volume has been more favorable? And in the context of just in a competitive environment,
obviously, you're gaining a lot of market share, what do you anticipate in terms of how the competitive dynamics play
out in that market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, I think that so far, if you look at the current performance of the business and the way we
look at the industry, I think the market holds very well. I mean, obviously, you have a [ph] – have (33:54) 9% sort of
the volume declines for the total industry, but these has to be read in comparisons to the very high pricing that the
industry is taking, so we take it. So, I mean, elasticity is up, so far, okay. We have this disconnect in terms of a macros
reading from Russia, but as I mentioned, we looked very carefully into the price segments' development over the very
recent period, and you would essentially have to have split the hair into two, to start to concluding that you have
acceleration of growth of the bottom of the market or down trading, et cetera. Not at this stage, but as I said, I mean,
Russia is something which presumably will remain on the watch list for the full year.
Coming to our share growth and the pricing, we grew also the share for Parliament, so clearly, this is not just a – not
only is a share in the premium or about premium segment, other brands obviously contributed as well. We just
announced another price increase. As you know, Russia, ex-currency, looks very good. Obviously, currency has put a
dent on the results, that's very clear. And inflation is high, and I think that this was the reason why we decided to go
now where we think is the price. But so far, elasticities are working as per the expectations, if I can point 3.4 times of
the elasticities, you could take the price increases versus the market decline.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Helpful. And then, just lastly on the yen hedging, can you just update on where you are
today versus the last guidance you've given?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, Judy, we usually don't update what we do with regards to the hedging during the year. I
can just maybe help you that if I take the $1.15 impact on our results with the previous guidance, we confirmed today
in the $1.15, yen just moved in that guidance by $0.01. So, I said the $0.13 impact last guidance and I have now $0.14
impact this guidance. So, this is not the end clearly. I think hedging plays a role in [ph] the same, (36:19) but also, I
have to admit volatility on the yen is lower than we used to have it at the beginning of the period.

Ruble, which I listed in my remarks, improved a lot, because the ruble is just $0.13 now in my guidance and it used to
be $0.48. So, this is a big improvement. Swiss francs was negative, and it turned positive in the guidance to $0.10, and
there is a whole list of the other currencies. Obviously, euro plays the role, but the yen played just the one role. So,
ruble was $0.35 in the guidance or 30% of the entire guidance, is the major contributor to balancing and us holding the
$1.15 guidance.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Good morning or good afternoon, I guess, for you. Just wanted to come back to Korea. You
talked about the benefit from the inventory. I assume by that, you mean that you were able to pull inventory ahead of
January 1, so that you could sell product in this quarter with last year's lower tax, is that correct?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: That's correct. [indiscernible] (37:46).
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: And how long does that benefit last? Is the shelf life typically it's close to six months
maybe, will that benefit continue in 2Q, or have you exhausted that inventory yet?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's very much a function of how big, how long your inventories you manage to build. There
obviously are some limitations, some restrictions in the market, how much you can be, so you don't have a free ride on
this one. But I think mostly that benefit, at least in our case is, should be attributed to the Q1, mostly. There might be
some slip-overs flowing to the Q2, but it's mostly the Q1 event.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just looking at your guidance, obviously, you're much more
confident and it is early. How much – volumes are far less predictable, but how much of the pricing that you're
expecting that's reflected in your guidance have you already realized or been able to take?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, because we're deeper in the year, we usually at this year, don't give a number how much
pricing we have realized, but as you might remember in the initial guidance in February, when we were announcing
full-year results we have said that for the current 2015 year we've had a 70% pricing realization, and there were a
number of markets which we have taken the pricing since then. So, clearly, we are higher than 70%.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: So, you can't say by how much?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. For competitive reasons, et cetera, I can't.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. That's fine. And then, just on Egypt, you called out higher manufacturing costs that
came from the new business structure, but you also talk about favorable impacts from the new business structure as
well. Can you just give a little summary of the puts and takes there, and how that sort of nets out?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: That's the impact which we are carrying from our Q2 last year, or – sorry, actually from the
middle of Q1 last year, so this is a quarter when we're lapping such things, so it's very marginally, but still has an
impact in Q1 comps. It doesn't impact your bottom line that much, other than organic growth in the business, it just
impacts with your revenues are slightly up and your costs are slightly up, versus how we were reporting, reflecting our
business structure in Egypt in 2013. So, we are comparing 100% apples-to-apples.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Hi. Thank you very much.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: My first question has to do with EU profitability. You guys have previously indicated that
you expect to generate local currency profit growth in the EU, given the strong start to the year, and I recognize you
have the offset later on, on the national launch of iQOS, but can you give us a better sense of how strongly profits
might inflect in the EU?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean, clearly, EU had a good start of the year, so that obviously, at a different pace,
going to continue for the Q2, Q3 because there was an underlying strength coming from the top line. I think initially for
the year, I think we said that we expect EU to contribute in the low-single digit. I think – well, I'm definitely confident
that they can achieve this one. So, let me maybe stay with this statement at this stage.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That's helpful. Thank you. In terms of the rollout of iQOS later on in the year, you noted
the potential for other pilots and/or national launches. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're looking for
in order to make a determination around that? Is it an accommodative regulatory landscape from a tax perspective? Is it
supply chain? Just any other color around that would be helpful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Clearly we're looking into the market, which give us the portfolio many margin opportunities.
So, for obvious reasons, I can't share with you today the details. But as I said, it's a consumer base, it's our positions in
the market, it's the margin structure, it's – these are the key components which we're looking into. Which I've said from
the very beginning that initially we'll go to the markets where the margins will be rather accretive to the rest of our [ph]
portfolio – (42:22) to our business.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: That's terrific. And my last question, any comment or update on Platform 2, please?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Platform 2, we start stocking up at the trades in Spain – sorry, Platform 2 [ph] we mean with
(42:35) Solaris, Platform 2 grows on plan. So, it's nothing really to update versus what we had said before.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Sure. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.
<Q - William Marshall>: Thank you. Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Marshall>: I just have one quick question for you. So, I believe on earlier calls, you guys have kind of
left the door open for share repurchases this year. It sounds like from your comments earlier, that's probably off the
table for 2015. So, I was just kind of wondering in the context of your very strong quarter, what kind of milestones
could you point to maybe, that would make you feel more comfortable about buying back stock as we look forward,
maybe past 2015 into 2016?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Look, I mean, we have not updated. Unfortunately, we're not in the positions to update the
currency guidance. And this is the component element, which impacts our reported numbers and cash flow very much,
okay. So, buyback or suspension of the buyback for this year is the outcome of that. I mean, we would have to see the
improvement in the currency outlook. It's very much the dollar strength versus all others, to be able to go back to the
share buyback. So, I mean, yes, obviously, the guidance increase, the outlook for the year increase helps, but this is
still, I have to admit, overshadowed by the strong negative currency, which we are confronted this year. So we need to
