MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Sara Lee's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal 2010. Your lines have
been placed on a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this
time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations for Sara Lee
Corporation. Thank you, Aaron. You may begin.
Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations

available competitive, financial, and economic data, as well as managements' views and assumptions regarding future
events. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that actual results may
differ from those expressed or implied in these statements.
Consequently, I need to caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We've provided
additional information in our current press release and fiscal 2009 Form 10-K that I encourage you to review
concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
This morning, we are providing slides to go with our prepaid remarks. You can find the slides on the webcast portion of
our website in the Investor Relations section. And as a reminder, all adjusted numbers we discuss on today's call
exclude the impact of significant items, contingent sale proceeds, acquisitions, divestitures, the effects of currency
changes and the impact of the 53rd week that occurred in 2010. The release contains a reconciliation of reported to
adjusted numbers.
Now let me turn the time over to Marcel.
Marcel H. M. Smits, Interim Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Aaron, and good morning to everybody joining us today. We appreciate your interest and your time. Let me
start by reflecting for a moment on the announcement earlier this week that Brenda will not be coming back to Sara
Lee.
I'd like to thank many of you for reaching out to Brenda or for writing nice things about her tenure at Sara Lee, and that
really resonates with everything that we hear from our staff, our suppliers, our customers. We're all very sorry to see
her go. That said, we're optimistic that she will recover quite well over time and I guess that's the merrier note. Brenda
has made enormous progress with Sara Lee and we're saddened to see her leave, just as everything she tirelessly
worked for started to bear fruit.
Looking to the future, as the senior management team, we continue to focus on what we've done since May. We have a
plan, agreed with our board in April, and we have alignment with our board on the strategic steps we would want to
pursue. And you'll be pleased to hear that we work well together, complementing each other where required.
Sara Lee board has now turned the page and is currently thinking about an appropriate successor. And this will be done
in a timely matter. Whatever the outcome will be, it will be for the greater good of Sara Lee and we all feel a personal
commitment to make it a success. I trust that you'll understand and respect that at this point this is all we have to say
about this subject.
With that said, I'd like to take a moment and look back on a very good year for Sara Lee. We delivered strong bottom
line improvements, generally grew our market shares, reinvested in our brands and innovation to drive future results.
And we did all of that in the face of recessions in most of our largest markets.
As a reminder, we increased our earnings per share guidance three times since initially providing it about one year ago.
And in the end, we exceeded the top end of our most recent adjusted EPS range. In line with what we told you three
months ago, the fourth quarter came in with adjusted operating income below the prior year. The primary reason for
this decline was a reinvestment that we had planned for and that we communicated.
Marketing spend was up 75% in the quarter, and for the full year we're showing a robust 20% MAP increase with every
segment up. In each of the last three quarters of the year, MAP was up. Hence, we're confident that we're well
positioned to deliver further meaningful growth in fiscal 2011 and beyond.
In fiscal 2010, we also made a giant leap in portfolio management. We're well on our way to divesting our Household
and Body Care segments. To date, we've announced four transactions. As you can see, the sale of our share of the
Indian Insecticides joint venture and the sales of Air Care have both been closed.

Meanwhile, we're working through the regulatory approvals for a binding offer to sell Body Care to Unilever for
€1.275 billion or about $1.7 billion at our hedged euro/dollar rate of 1.35. We expect the review of this transaction by
the EU to be completed later this year in time for a closing prior to calendar year end.
The fourth announced transaction is the sale of our Non-Indian Insecticides business to SC Johnson for €153 million,
which is also expected to close by the end of the calendar year. We're actively negotiating to sell the remaining
businesses, which include Shoe Care and our Asia Pacific cleaning products business. We're pleased with how the
process is progressing.
Now let me just remind you what we have said about the use of proceeds. At the CAGNY Conference in February, we
talked about buying back 2.5 billion to 3 billion of stock over a two to three year time horizon. Of that, we committed
to repurchase between 1 billion and 1.3 billion by the end of calendar 2010. Well, we're well on our way to
accomplishing that goal having repurchased 500 million through an accelerated share repurchase in fiscal '10. The ASR
has been completed and meanwhile we're now back in the market.
Today, we are further specifying our repurchase guidance to cover all of fiscal 2011. We expect to repurchase another 1
billion to 1.5 billion of stock this fiscal year, and the implication is that we buy back between 500 million and 800
million in the first half of fiscal '11 and the remainder in the back half to hit the guidance given at CAGNY and what
we've just announced.
The next item we talked about in February was maintaining our $0.44 per share annual dividend. We can extend that
statement to tell you that we intend to gradually increase our dividend over time and the board is slated to take a
decision in October.
The final capital item was the voluntary funding of 200 million into our U.S. pension funds, which we did late in fiscal
2010. We keep the option open of doing acquisitions meanwhile should they provide better value for our shareholders.
Let's take a look at the fourth quarter. This is the same chart we showed you in the first three quarters of the year.
Looking at the adjusted sales, let me just say that the fourth quarter was in line with the trends that we've seen in earlier
quarters. So we'll look at sales when we get to the full year results.
We had planned for a decline in operating income in Q4 as we reinvested in the business. It was actually down 77
million in the quarter, as shown here on the last line of continuing operations. Now let me put that in perspective.
Marketing investment was up 54 million in the quarter and we had substantial headwind from commodity
mark-to-market setting us back another 32 million compared to the prior year, and that's why we're down 77 million.
Let's now take a look at our full year on the same basis. While we were down 77 million in the fourth quarter, for the
year, we're actually up 156 million, thanks to the first three quarters doing very well. Mark will give you a perspective
on the quarterly split in a minute. But now, let's focus on the figures on the upper right part of this sheet.
Reported sales were down 0.8%, and adjusted sales were down 2.8%. And the bridge between the 0.8% of reported
sales decline and the 2.8% adjusted sales decline is currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures and the 53rd week
shown here.
Let's continue with the negative 2.8%. Of the 2.8%, price mix was positive, continuing the trend that we saw in the
third quarter. And I'd just like to call that out as an important point. You'll appreciate that with commodity costs
coming down, our pricing is also down and it's actually a bit more than negative 1%. So that leaves mix to be positive
by approximately 2%. Now hold that thought of mix being positive by more than 2%.
Let's look at the volume then, which was down 3.7%. Excluding the deliberate exit of commodity meats and kosher
meats businesses, volumes were down 1.5%, primarily driven by the exit of low to no margin businesses. That negative
1.5% should be judged in conjunction with about 2% mix improvement that we just talked about. Taken together, it's
clear that we still have work to do and we will. But we're pleased with the year, where mix and volume together is
about flat while operating margin is up by some 170 basis points despite significant MAP investments.

As we enter fiscal 2011, we believe that we've positioned ourselves well and we've made the right investments to turn
our volume trends into positive territory.
Going back to the overview chart then, moving down the sheet, you can see that the two highlighted figures add up to
228 million of bottom line improvement for the full year.
Let me just walk you through the components of this improvement. You'll see that we delivered an incremental 157
million of adjusted operating income from the year and, excluding 1 million of mark-to-market, that's 156 million. Of
that 156 million, 142 million came from improved results out of our business segments, while corporate expenses,
excluding significant items, were down 14 million.
The final piece is the improvement in Household and Body Care, which was up 72 million on an adjusted basis, of
which 33 million is attributable to the cessation of depreciation and amortization.
A couple of big movements underlying all of this, they're not shown on this sheet but let me just call them out. First,
lower commodity costs net of pricing actions added about 160 million, speaks directly to the strengths of our brands.
Project Accelerate, a company-wide cost savings initiative, contributed 131 million of incremental benefit this year.
Together, that's a plus of some 300 million. Not all of that, of course, shows up in the bottom line, as we increased our
MAP by 62 million and in addition, we had to absorb approximately 50 million of incremental pension expense.
Now that gets me to Project Accelerate. In the quarter and year to date, every one of our segments achieved cost
savings and productivity gains. We're confident that the program will deliver 350 million to 400 million in annualized
savings by the end of fiscal '12, after incurring around 300 million in charges related to the project.
Please keep in mind that these figures relate only to continuing operations. In fiscal 2009, savings from continuing
operations were 49 million, and we've realized an incremental 131 million in fiscal '10. We currently expect fiscal '11
incremental benefits to be something like 90 million to 110 million.
And, as we indicated at the launch of Project Accelerate, the charges would be front-end loaded, and they've so far been
about 250 million or about 85% taken in the first two years. We're very pleased with the significant benefits, as you'll
understand, that we're achieving here and the rapid pace with which they are being realized.
Now, at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to CJ Fraleigh, who is in charge of our entire North American business.
I've asked him to cover the results of all of our continuing segments as well as the discontinued operation. CJ?
Christopher J. (CJ) Fraleigh, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive
Officer – North American Retail & Foodservice
Thanks, Marcel. Good morning, everyone on the call. Let's start with the North American Retail segment. This
business had a great year. Volume, excluding deliberate business exits and the 53rd week, is up almost 3% for the year.
Adjusted sales were flat for the year as prices decreased, but we gained market share in 10 of our 12 core categories, a
strong sign that we're winning in the marketplace in the areas where we're placing our focus and supporting our brands
with strong reinvestment. These increases have been driven by our strategic businesses, specifically Jimmy Dean,
Hillshire Farm and Ball Park, which now represent more than two-thirds of the segment sales.
Let's step back for a minute and reflect on how we look at volume in this segment and really across our entire company.
To be clear, we're in no way side-stepping the issue of volume growth. There are some areas of our business where we
are highly focused on volume growth and believe that it's critical to our future success. The three large brands just
mentioned are great examples of this.
At the same time, there's parts of our business where volume's not a top priority. In fact, there are places where we're
happy to walk away from some businesses, as it helps our margin and simplifies our business. Examples of this would
be the commodity pork, kosher businesses.

So with that said, let's come back to our results for the year. We continue to focus our marketing investments against
these big brands in an array of new product launches. In fact, MAP was up almost 70% in the quarter and 38% for the
full year. And critically, our adjusted operating segment income, or OSI, was up about 34% for the year.
Looking at the drivers of our performance, Jimmy Dean sales grew 13% and Hillshire Farm was up 6%, helping to shift
our mix. We had a very strong supply chain and continuous improvement performance as well.
In fiscal '10 commodity pricing was down. However, as we enter fiscal '11 that trend has shifted meaningfully. We
fully expect to face higher protein and other input costs over the course of the year and we'll work with our retail
partners to take appropriate and necessary pricing actions to help manage through this situation, a process we'd remind
you that we successfully executed over the last few years.
This is a good representation of the model we've built. We're able to consistently expand margins while reinvesting in
our future. It's worth pointing out that as recently as fiscal '08, the Retail business adjusted operating margin was 7%,
meaning we've made a big jump to 12.2% in fiscal '10 and, as we said, we expect another step up in fiscal '11.
North American Foodservice delivered a mixed year. Importantly, adjusted OSI was up 14% as a result of lower
commodity costs, the exit of low margin items and cost savings. On the other hand, sales and volume were down
significantly. In addition to continuing difficult market conditions, as discussed in the second and third quarter, the
segment suffered a non-core business loss where we provided an unbranded ingredient for one of our customers. This
business accounted for 15% of the segment's volume, 4% of sales, and virtually no profit. As expected, this has
impacted volume in the quarter and will continue to do so over the next three quarters. As just mentioned, and this is a
great example, sometimes it's okay for us to let volume decline for the benefit of the business.
We have improved the segment's cost structure as well as our go-to-market strategy. This has allowed us to weather the
recent economic challenges and still produce good operating performance. We're now focused on three core businesses
that are profitable and have real sustainable points of difference: branded meats, frozen bakery and liquid coffee
concentrates.
Like North American Retail, the results of our strategy has been an increase in adjusted operating margin from 5.3% in
fiscal '08 to 8.1% in fiscal '10 and we do expect further growth in adjusted OSI in fiscal '11.
North American Fresh Bakery segment ended the year with a tough quarter, resulting in top and bottom-line declines
for the full year. Sales and volume softness resulted from continuing challenges in the industry, as branded pricing has
been lower than we anticipated. However, in recent months we've seen signs of industry price increases and with wheat
futures and employee costs rising, overall price levels should rise.
Much of the decline in adjusted OSI in the quarter related to the pricing challenges we've previously mentioned. Also, a
bit less than half of the reduction was due to one-time adjustments related to employee benefits and accounting
adjustments related to third-party bread distributors.
One important point to make, for the second consecutive quarter, branded volume rose behind strategic pricing
recalibration in new products. This growth enabled a modest share gain and we've seen that trend continue into fiscal
'11.
Looking ahead, with the largest brand in the industry and a international footprint, we're well positioned to continue to
show improvements in this segment over time. We have operational initiatives that we've been working on for more
than a year and are now rolling out across our system during fiscal year '11. Combined with a more stable pricing
environment, we expect a noticeable improvement in OSI in fiscal '11.
You'll certainly have wheat price on your mind too. Let us note that we're confident we can manage through this
situation with strategic pricing and favorable hedges that will keep us competitive in the market this fiscal year.
International Beverages continues to invest behind emerging markets and innovation. Adjusted OSI rose almost 9% for
the year, while adjusted sales were essentially flat.

The increase in adjusted OSI includes a positive variance of approximately $30 million, largely related to currency
mark-to-market from green coffee procurement. Without this accounting treatment, performance would have looked
less favorable, but adjusted OSI would still have been up.
While both broader market conditions and the growth of private label had an impact on our business, we still saw
volume increases in the first, second and fourth quarters, as well as for the full year, driven in large part by successful
innovations and strong brand support. In fact, during the fourth quarter, we increased MAP investment by more than
80%, or 27 million. We firmly believe that our markets will show growth and that we're well positioned to drive
organic growth with a variety of exciting innovations and reinvestment in brands.
Speaking of which, fiscal '10 has been a good year for innovation at Sara Lee. Pépites D'Arôme, a dosing product for
drip-filter coffee machines has done well and continues to expand into new markets like the Netherlands, Belgium and
Denmark. And as more and more consumers want a great tasting cup of coffee to be enjoyed one at a time, we launched
our exciting L'OR Espresso capsules in France, which can be used in an espresso coffee machine. This breakthrough
product gives consumers delicious espresso coffee of the highest quality. It's conveniently available at retail stores and
it's produced responsibly.
At the same time, new Senseo varieties and a revamped machine continue to drive our leading single serve platform.
We'll meaningfully step up investment behind these and other growth programs in fiscal '11, positioning us for short
and long-term success, driven by our strong innovation and our pipeline of increased brand support.
The International Bakery segment continues to face substantial headwinds in its core Spanish market, and has
implemented numerous actions to deliver improvement. While volumes are still under pressure, the business model has
been improved through cost reductions, restructuring and the right-sizing of the manufacturing footprint.
Earlier this year the segment sold several bakeries to another manufacturer. The production of the two companies has
been combined in order to improve plant utilization and reduce unit costs. These actions have helped mitigate the
impact on profitability. The segment will have a better foundation from which to grow and will benefit when the
Spanish economy recovers. Plus, we continue to implement additional cost savings initiatives.
We'll wrap up with H&BC, which had a very good year. Adjusted sales rose more than 2%, while adjusted OSI was up
26%, driven by strong Body Care, Shoe Care and Insecticide performance. We also benefited by no longer including
depreciation and amortization in our results, which was worth $33 million for the full year.
Operational metrics are all better than the previous year, including better fill and service rates, lower obsolete inventory
and a very impressive 29% reduction in SKUs. We've seen strong performance, while also strategically providing
support for key innovations like Ambi Pur National Geographics, Sanex Naturprotect and Sanex Zero%.
From everyone at Sara Lee, we'd like to acknowledge the commitment of our Household and Body Care employees
during a time of change. Clearly, this has been a turbulent time for them and they've stepped up and delivered a very
nice year.
That wraps up our look at the segment results. Mark is now going to take you through some additional financials and an
outlook for fiscal '11. Mark?
Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, CJ. I'd like to extend my welcome to everyone on the call as well. CJ left us with the summary results slide
where Marcel started and I'm going to take it from there and look at how that translates into the earnings per share
figures.
This sheet reconciles our adjusted EPS and our reported EPS. You may remember the format from our previous
presentations. Starting with the repatriation charges, let me remind you that at CAGNY we announced that in the
second half of this year we were going to take more than $0.5 billion of our provision for repatriation tax. That is
equivalent to $0.80 per share.

Page 7 of 21
As such, it has a major influence on our reported EPS figures. In addition to the $0.80 per share repatriation-related
charges and significant items, there were a number of other items which netted out to a gain.
We recognized a $0.12 gain on the sale of discontinued operations and $0.03 per share gain related to freezing the U.S.
salary pension plan. The rest of the gains related entirely to tax for the fiscal year.
The offsetting charges, all of which are detailed in the press release, included a wide range of items, including Project
Accelerate. And this takes us down to the adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $1.08. Again, the benefits of
strong operating performance are evident in a $0.26 per share increase. As we've already shown you how we achieved
those results, I won't go you through them again. We view the $1.08 of adjusted EPS as being higher than our guidance.
Our guidance included the 53rd week. We never left that in doubt. However, it would have been impossible to precisely
calculate the expected impact of one week as we went through the year. Excluding this 53rd week from fiscal '10 now
makes it easier for you to understand our guidance and results as we move to fiscal '11.
With all that said, our guidance of $1.06 to 1.10 included the 53rd week. The adjusted EPS of 1.08 excludes that week,
so adding the $0.03 to 1.08 gives 1.11, and that's why we view our guidance as having been exceeded.
Let me finish my discussion of this slide with the fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share. As you can see, we did
$0.19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal '10, $0.07 down on the prior year. The primary reasons for the decline are the $54
million increase in MAP investment and the $32 million negative variance for commodity mark-to-market discussed
previously by Marcel.
To round it up then, earnings per share guidance. Let's begin with reported earnings. As you can see, we show a jump
from fiscal '10 to fiscal '11. This is largely related to net negative total significant items in fiscal '10, and you will
remember, for example, the $0.80 of repatriation tax charges. Let me then move to adjusted EPS which provides a
more useful point of comparison.
Keep in mind that this excludes significant items, the contingent sale proceeds and impact of the 53rd week. And in
particular, I think we should focus on continuing operations at this point. With a sizable piece of our discontinued
operations already sold, and transactions agreed to for a very large portion of the remainder, this is really the most
meaningful line item.
To this end, we expect going forward that First Call estimates will reflect EPS from continuing operations only. We are
currently forecasting an increase of 0.12 to $0.19 per share for fiscal '11, or 16 to 25%. Underlying these figures are
anticipated increases in four of our five continuing businesses, North America Retail, Foodservice and Fresh Bakery,
along with International Bakery.
International Beverage is expected to be flat to slightly down as we continue to invest behind important new products
while defending our market positions in many countries. The segment also has a sizable amount of Household and
Body Care-related stranded overhead to work through that will mute results this year.
We have confidence in our fiscal '11 guidance and achieving it would mark another very strong year for Sara Lee, one
that we would be very happy with. Our confidence is supported by a number of factors that you should keep in mind as
the year unfolds. As CJ just discussed, we have operating momentum and, as Marcel discussed, this is supported by
$100 million or so of Project Accelerate benefits. Of these savings, more than 85% relate to projects already initiated,
which means that our confidence level in achieving those savings is very high.
In addition, for pension expense related to our defined benefit plans for fiscal '11, we expect to be – those
approximately 65 million lower than fiscal '10, as a result of freezing the pension benefits related to the U.S. defined
benefit plan for salaried employees and the favorable impact of the additional $200 million contribution made in fiscal
'10.
Please note that of this favorability, $20 million relates to specifically freezing the U.S. pension plan, which is also
included in our Accelerate initiative. So consequently, if you add the 100 million Accelerate benefit to the 65 million
pension favorability, you would have a double count of $20 million.

Lastly, we expect to buy back between 1 billion and $1.5 billion of stock this year. That is largely within our control,
with only the share price subject to variability.
All of that is good news and we need it because, as you know, we have some headwinds to deal with. First, as CJ
mentioned in discussing Retail and Fresh Bakery, protein and wheat are trading higher. We have also seen sharp
increases in both Arabica and Robusta coffee bean prices.
A key question as we move through the year will be our ability to pass along these escalating input costs appropriately.
In most cases, this has to be achieved through constructive fact-based conversations with our customers. In many of our
Foodservice accounts, commodity movements are contractually adjusted. And we recognize that this is a key question
and a substantial challenge for our business. However, I want to stress that based on past years experience with
commodity cost increases, we have confidence that our brands will be able to pass along commodity price increases
during fiscal '11, even though the ride may be a bit bumpy from quarter to quarter.
Let me put this in perspective by looking back seven years at the market prices for the basket of commodities we buy.
To be clear about this chart, these are market price changes, not necessarily what we pay, but they do directionally give
you a good approximation.
Overall, our basket of commodities are up 55% since fiscal '04. And now after two years of modest declines, we expect
to see another sizable increase in fiscal '11. We have been talking to you about the potential for input price increases for
about six months and have prepared well for the headwinds we face today.
Second, the year will likely be back-end loaded as we deal with very strong comparisons in the first and second fiscal
quarters. In fact, we expect that the vast majority of our operating income increase will come in the fourth quarter.
For context, let me lay out the adjusted operating figures on a quarterly basis for the past two years. You can see the big
increases we achieved in the first half of the year, which will be difficult to compare against. You will likely recall that
beginning with our second quarter conference earnings call, we called out that the first half of fiscal '10 was running
meaningfully above the trend line of gradual improvements. We expect to see full year growth in fiscal '11, but the
phasing will be quite different than last year.
Also, as you have seen, we are forecasting about a 6% decline in the euro compared to fiscal '10, which hurts the
translation of our P&L.
And finally, we have to absorb 25 million to $30 million of Household and Body Care stranded overhead in this year's
results. Total expenses not taken by the buyers in these transactions are more than $100 million. We will have to move
aggressively if we want to limit the impact to our fiscal '11 operating income to the aforementioned 25 million to 30
million. We estimate that we will have between 150 million and $200 million of restructuring charges in order to
eliminate all the stranded costs, and most of this will be provided for in fiscal '11.
To wrap up our outlook, there are a few points about fiscal '12 that I want to put on the table also. We're specifically
not giving earnings guidance for fiscal '12, but there are a number of items that will give us tailwinds on which we have
visibility already. They add up to 0.15 to $0.20 benefit to EPS in fiscal '12 from just three items.
First, more than half of the stranded overhead I just discussed should be gone by next fiscal year. Second, we expect a
reduction of approximately $35 million of amortization related to IT software and trademarks from the acquisition of
EarthGrains. At the same time, as Marcel mentioned, we will continue to reduce our shares outstanding through an
aggressive share repurchase plan.
Let me conclude with cash flow. On the surface, we had a nice increase in cash from operations, which was up $52
million to $952 million. This was also higher than our most recent guidance. That's good. But the story is actually quite
a bit better. As the quarter unfolded, we were able to generate sufficient cash flow that we could beat last year and our
guidance while also making the $200 million voluntary pension contribution we had committed to in February. The
primary source of the improvement was better than anticipated working capital movements. This is an area of focus for
the entire organization and we will continue to drive for working capital reductions in future years.

Looking to fiscal '11, we will see cash from operations of around 600 million to $700 million. There are a few reasons
as to why we will be lower than in fiscal '10. We expect to have a significant decline in income from discontinued
operations as we divest the H&BC businesses. We anticipate higher cash restructuring as we eliminate stranded
overhead. We should have higher cash taxes as we realize gains from the various H&BC transactions. And we would
expect more headwinds on working capital than we had in fiscal '10. Fortunately, our pension cash contribution will be
lower, as we have already voluntarily contributed $200 million in fiscal '10, as we already discussed.
Now let me turn the time back to Marcel.
Marcel H. M. Smits, Interim Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Mark, CJ. I think, ladies and gentlemen, we can conclude that Sara Lee is in a very strong position as we
enter fiscal '11. The past two fiscal years produced good results and we showed substantial progress in developing our
capabilities and laying the groundwork for future growth.
Our ongoing commitment to investing in our best brands and best ideas is paying off. We've seen market shares
improve and margins get better. We'll continue to support these initiatives to ensure a consistent stream of innovation
and improved performance. This has helped set up fiscal 2011 as another year of real earnings growth, even as we
worked through further transition issues related to the H&BC disposition.
And we can start to look ahead for fiscal '12 and see there are a number of positive factors that should combine with
our ongoing business performance to give an attractive growth trajectory over a multi-year period. This leaves Sara Lee
in a very strong position with real growth potential and the opportunity to deliver meaningful shareholder value in the
years to come.
Now CJ, Mark, Aaron and I will be very happy to take your questions.

<Q - Chris Growe>: Hi. Just had a couple questions for you. The first one would be in relation to your coffee business
in the year, and I noticed that it looked like pricing may have been down a little bit in the fourth quarter, just based on
pricing to come in 2011, fiscal '11, have you pushed through price increases that you can talk about yet or is this
something we should anticipate throughout the year?
<A - Marcel Smits>: We are – Yeah, CJ, you want to take that?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Yeah. Yes, prices are high. Arabica's at a five year high, but we are confident that we
will pass through all the pricing. We've started to do that. We've completed pricing increases in the U.S. We've done a
large part of our pricing increases overseas as well.

<Q - Chris Growe>: Okay. Those are already in the market. And my question in relation to that would be if you look
at like the meat division, where you've seen significant cost inflation as well, I think you talked more about reducing
promotion there as opposed to list price increases. Is there going to be a balance there of those two items to help
overcome the cost inflation?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: It's a balance of both, Chris, and it's very contingent upon the category. So we look at
each of the different meat categories and look at where commodities are as well as where the competition is. But we
have announced list price increases across a number of meat categories, few other ones we're reducing promotions.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Okay. I just had one final question, I guess maybe for Marcel or for Mark, just regarding share
repurchase. Would you anticipate using accelerated share repurchase programs in the coming year or will it be more of
a in the market, buying the stock on a daily basis?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Chris, I think we will look at that. We haven't made a
determination yet. We have a 10b5-1 plan that we're currently working through. As we see other opportunities, we have
that option also.
<Q - Chris Growe>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Robert Moskow [Credit Suisse]. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. I guess a couple of questions. In the quarter, by our numbers, it seemed like
operating income came in below expectations and maybe you could just give us a sense as to why that was.
And then secondly, when we look at the guidance for fiscal '11, when we strip out this pension expense reduction, it
seems like operating income is coming in maybe a little bit flat. Am I reading that right? And maybe you could help me
through that.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Okay. On the pension question, let me give you an answer. When we said last year that pension
was going to be up, I don't think we excluded that from the operating income trends. So neither are we doing it this
year. We're saying that we want to increase our MAP spend next year. That's what we're driving for, particularly in the
coffee business. So it's a number of things taken together and pension is a bit of tailwind and then we have some
headwinds to deal with. So I don't think it's appropriate to just take a single item out.
On the operating outcome on the fourth quarter below expectation, we don't really recognize that. We have guided for,
off the top of my head, I think we said it was 1.6 to 1.10 and we came in what was ultimately 1.11. Tax rates were a
little bit higher than we anticipated at the end of the third quarter. So the operating income must have been okay.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Well, I'll have to...
<A - Marcel Smits>: I don't know whether you – are you looking at continuing operations or continuing plus
discontinued?
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Frankly, I think I better take it offline. I've got three different operating income lines, but we
try to strip out all the charges and we look at what fourth quarter operating income should have been based on the
guidance and we got to a much higher number for what fourth quarter operating income was implied to be. And,
therefore, Marcel, when you say that the segments are going to have higher operating income, which is what you said
three months ago, I'm unclear as to what the base should have been for fiscal '10. And maybe it's better to take it
offline.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes, let's take that offline because we don't recognize that we would be falling short
significantly.

<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Let me ask one other follow-up. The $0.80 of repatriation taxes in the year, can I
assume that that's about $550 million or so and is that a cash expense?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: No, that's not a cash expense at this point. That obviously will
be cash at the point we pay the tax, but for right now you can assume it's 550 from a P&L perspective.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. So it will be a cash at some point?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: At some point, and as we have to pay those taxes as we
repatriate those funds, they will be, yes.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question, Eric Katzman [Deutsche Bank], your line is open.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning, Eric.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Good morning, Eric.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Eric.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: I think that the difference between what Rob was going for and what you reported, it seems to
me that, at least from my perspective, you should have had EBIT in the fourth quarter stripping out items of about 200
million or so, but you spent about a quarter of that on A&P and so it looks like the most of the difference was due to the
ramp-up in the MAP spend, at least that's what I can see. But, okay. In any case, couple of questions. First, to CJ, on
the market, I guess, Chris asked this a little bit, but are you – it sounds like – has competition, probably more
importantly than just your actions, but has competition in bread, meat and coffee followed your pricing at this point?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Many have. Not everyone yet. And it varies by different subcategory but we have seen
the majority of competitors follow us.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then is the reason why your fourth quarter, why most of the income you expect, most
of the income growth to be in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011, is that because that that's how long it's going to take you
to get the full pricing through? Or is there – or just how the some of the MAP spending flows in the coming year?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Eric, I think primarily – this is Mark here, the first two
quarters of last year were, as we said, not a sustainable trend in terms of how the quarters would look. That is why I
tried to show the last two years so you could see another way of looking at this as commodities are rising. There will be
some lag, I would expect, as we price. As we go through this, our hedging gives us some advantage there, but clearly
the comparators are the primary reason why the growth looks more towards the back-end of the year than the first end.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then just flipping around here, on the Project Accelerate savings being – I guess you
said they were – the incremental was 180 million this year, but that's falling to like 100 million in 2011. Is it that you
just got – that the level of – the amount of savings is now moderating? Is that basically what we should conclude and
that the bulk of the Project Accelerate is already in?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the cumulative is 180 million for fiscal '10 so the
incremental is 130 in fiscal '10. Which I think was ahead of our guidance, what we said at the beginning of the year, so
we still expect a very strong year for Accelerate in '11, 90 million to $110 million of additional benefits and that would
bring the cumulative then up to 270 to 290.

Page 12 of 21
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then I guess maybe my last question, it looks like you also guided to CapEx, I think,
of like 400 million, which is maybe another reason why that the cash flow is moderating this year, 400 to 450 versus
385, and yet the – is that on an apples-to-apples basis? Is the 385 inclusive of the Household and Body Care? Because
if it – like I'm wondering why the CapEx number is moving up so much when assuming that the Household and Body
Care business has gone?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, well, firstly, the CapEx number last year does, of
course, include Household, Body Care. It's a relatively small proportion. They do not have a very high CapEx number,
frankly I think it's 10% or less or something like that. This year's doesn't, but do remember, we are completing our
Kansas City slicing facility in fiscal '11. So that's another reason why we have more of a spike going into this year on
CapEx.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then I'll leave it at that. Maybe I'll get back in the queue if I have another question.
Thanks.

Thank you. Next question, Bryan Spillane [Bank of America]. Your line is open.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Good morning, Bryan.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Good morning.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Couple – first question just on the profit build through the year. It will be gross margins that'll
have the bigger negative year-on-year comp in the first half. Is that the way we should think about it or is it going to be
higher SG&A spending?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yeah, I think the effects of pricing and commodities are going to come through gross margin. We
have a little bit in SG&A, which is energy prices, but the preponderance of what we're talking about is in gross margin.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And then the MAP spending will be up year-over-year in the first half more so than it
will be in the second half?
<A - Marcel Smits>: No, we haven't made any statements about that. We are driving to increase MAP again next year,
in particular in the coffee and tea business and we haven't made any statements about how that pans out over the
different quarters.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay. And then just stepping back, you had a – you've exceeded the guidance that you initially
set for this year and I think if I've done this math right, about 60% of the upside to the $1.11 you add back the 53rd
week really came from the discontinued operations, 40% of the upside comes from the continuing ops. So I guess just
relative to the upside potential or even getting to the high end of your guidance now with continuing ops, how much of
that is dependent upon pricing being successful? How much of it is dependent upon maybe a favorable swing on some
of the non-controllable items like commodities and currencies? Just trying to get a sense for – you had really good
momentum above what you were planning this year and seems like with the headwinds you've got in the continuing
ops, is there maybe less of an upside potential this year?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: I would say, as you look at it for last year, certainly House
and Body Care did very well for us. We're very pleased with their performance. I see on continuing operations, you
know that we increased our MAP 75% in the fourth quarter which, of course, helps us build into next year. Certainly,
pricing is a very important factor for us as we move into the year. We have talked about that. So I think that's going to
be an important thing to get right. We're working it in all of our segments right now. My expectation is that we will get

that price through.
We're very confident in terms of increasing our MAP as well going into next year, that we have the right plan to grow
the business. And if we look at it, our EPS is going 16 to 25% higher from where it was in fiscal '10, so we feel pretty
confident this is a good growth trajectory, particularly for our Beverage, our Retail meats businesses and our other
businesses.

Thank you. Next, Ken Zaslow [BMO Capital Markets], your line is open.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Morning, Ken.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: When I look back a couple years ago when the higher prices came, the higher commodity prices, I
thought you were more – your price increases actually came almost concurrently with the higher commodity prices. I
thought you did a rather good job of that. So I'm just trying to figure out a couple things here.
One is, is my memory right and why, if you had the time to prepare, is there a lag and then which of the commodities
will be the easiest to pass through and which one will take the bigger lags?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Ken, we, I think, maybe were a little further out in front than others, but we did lag the
actual increase in commodities, and so we have a consensus forecast by commodity of where we think things will go
and we price accordingly. When that commodity spikes higher than what we had projected it to be, regardless of how
we've hedged and how quickly we can change pricing, there's going to be a short-term benefit or hit, and Mark
referenced that as there could be some bumpiness quarter-to-quarter and it can go either way. So generally, we think
we're pretty good relative to other competitors, but commodities did accelerate in the last few months, more than we
had even anticipated. Everybody thought they would go up. We thought they would go up a lot and they went up even
more.
In terms of specific commodities, coffee probably has one of the more predictable pass-throughs, and with our meat
and our protein, I think they're becoming more so that way. A lot of this is obviously contingent upon the consumer,
our customers and our competitors. And there's always a negotiation that goes on there. We feel we bring a lot of facts
and insights to the category and that's generally helped us in the past.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Great. And my last question is in terms of the pipeline of acquisitions, again, I know that you're
not going to say which acquisitions, do you find the pipeline to be filled and have you changed the process to which
that you might actually be able to act on the acquisition front more aggressively? A couple companies impact you
would have, changed the process or have become more open about saying that they've become more aggressive with
that. Can you talk about where you were and if anything has changed in terms of either the process, pipeline in that
terms?
<A - Marcel Smits>: No. I'd say no changes, none. We've had a discussion with our board in April about what the
three year plan was. In the context of that board discussion, we always talk about what would be suitable acquisition
targets to pursue and we're just continuing the path that we've been on for a while. We'll be disciplined about it and
really there's no change.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question, Vincent Andrews [Morgan Stanley], your line is open.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Hold on. Thanks. Sorry, on a cell phone in a bad area. Could I just ask, can you give us a
sense of where your inputs came in, and I'm sorry if this is on the slide, I'm just not at my desk. Where your inputs
came in on a percentage basis, increase or decrease in 2010, relative to where you think you are going to be in 2011.
And then as a follow-up to that, related to your guidance, have you assumed that you're able to pass all the pricing
through that you want to or have you given yourself any sort of cushion?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Related to the guidance, we have assumed that we'll be able to pass everything on in the – for the
totality of 2011. We talked already about the timing being different from segment to segment. In some segments you
can actually do that simultaneously, in some segments you lag a little bit. That depends also with your hedging policies.
In terms of the total impact, we have given in when we were in the conference in Paris, we've given people an overview
of what we buy by category. And last year, we've enjoyed approximately 300 million of price benefits. For this year,
we're not disclosing any figures as to what it adds up to. It's just too early to tell. But we'll have a meaningful swing up.
So last year over the total commodity prices, the swing down was approximately 300 million, and this year we'll have a
meaningful swing up.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. What I'd said during the slide presentation, Vincent,
was that our basket of commodities are going up approximately 15% fiscal '11 versus fiscal '10.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yeah, it gives you an idea as to where we are. I don't have the slide here at hand that we showed
in Paris. But it gave a very clear view. We actually filed an 8-K around it, a clear view as to how much we buy per a
commodity. So I think you can work your way through that fairly easily.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Sure.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Let me just...
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Sorry, can you just -
<A - Marcel Smits>: Can I make one more remark because -
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Absolutely.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Ken was just asking about the comparability. The objective, of course, is always to price through
instantaneously so that you don't have a margin hit. And actually in terms of the comparability with the fiscal '10
results, what you'll have to bear in mind is that in fiscal '10 when prices came down, we actually lagged quite
significantly that downward trend, which is why at the end of the second quarter we said margins now are above the
trend line of what we would normally have because we are lagging commodity pricing come down.
So the name of the game, of course, is to be instantaneous if prices go up and to try and lag a bit if prices come down.
And that affected comparability and that's why we had such a bumper profit in the second quarter and that's what we're
up against if we look at our own spread of quarterly profit projections for the year.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thank you. And just the last follow-up would just be if you could make a comment, if
you haven't already, on the hedgeable commodities, how far out you are?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: We don't talk, Vincent, specifically in terms of where we are
commodity by commodity, but I think we feel in pretty good shape as we consider what the industry is doing out there
on our commodities and our procurement department and treasury department are on top of that.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thank you very much for all the answers. Appreciate it.

Thank you. Next, Judy Hong [Goldman Sachs], your line is open.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Morning.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Just looking at your net sales guidance for fiscal '11, it looks like you're basically looking for
flattish sales for your continued operation. I would imagine currency is going to be a drag so maybe up in the low
single digits. If you look at what you did this year, you had adjusted net sales down 2.8%. So I'm just trying to
reconcile what's going to make the net sales improvement. You talked about, obviously, price being maybe more of a
benefit, but if you look at volume, it was down 1.5% in fiscal '10. Are you expecting volume to get better as you enter
2011?
And then somewhat related to that, obviously you've stepped up a lot of spending behind your brands. How do you
think that that has translated into your volume performance and why haven't we seen a better volume performance, I
guess, for some of your core businesses, particularly on the Retail meat side? Is it the category? Is it the competitive
dynamics? Is it the consumer? Maybe just some color on that.
<A - Marcel Smits>: There's two sides of this question. Let's Mark talk first about the guidance on sales because we've
got that well prepared and we can give you some additional highlights and shed some light on the figures that you've
just quoted. And, CJ, I think you can talk about how we view the relationship between investment that we've pushed
through in the last quarter and the volume trends. So, Mark first.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Judy. Yeah, when you look at the sales guidance, we're
saying 10.7 to 10.9 billion for fiscal '11 versus 10.8 for fiscal '10. You are right, currency does have an impact,
approximately $200 million of the impact as you look at a 1.39 rate for average fiscal '10 versus a 1.30 that we have
guided for fiscal '11. The other impact, of course, is the 53rd week. The 10.8 does include the 53rd week. So that's also
about $200 million impact.
And the last impact, I would say, is we are continuing to exit certain commodity businesses that we've talked about.
We've got about another year of that to go or a year and-a-half or so of that to go. That's about a 50 million plus impact
there. So when we include all of that, we're actually comfortable that we're showing pretty good sales growth and there
will, of course, be pricing in there as well, so that gives us some confidence in that. And I'll let CJ talk through the
investment point.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: I think specific to the Retail business, we're actually quite happy with where we're
growing and where we're intentionally declining. As we mentioned, Jimmy Dean was up 13%, Hillshire was up 6%.
Those are both double-digit margin businesses. And businesses that we've left, or are in the process of leaving, like our
commodity pork business where we're just basically passing through contracts that we had as well as our kosher
business, are little to no money at all.
And so that's why we're able to mix in a much higher margin and grow our profit and that mutes our top-line sales and
we refine that down to very specific category levels, selling more Angus Ball Park hot dogs, less meat hot dogs, things
like that.

<A - Marcel Smits>: Judy, if I may round that up, I'm actually quite happy that you asked that question because I think
the figures that Mark has just given, the 450 million that you have to knock off on the comparable for fiscal 2010
actually show a fairly steep increase in our revenue, because it's clear that we've set our eyes on accelerating the
volume lines.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Yeah. And I guess the question is more just why are you expecting that improvement versus fiscal
'10? Is it just now you don't have as much of a drag in terms of some of the business?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yeah. This is where the stories from what Mark has just been telling you and CJ have told you
that comes together. We've had a very good year this year in terms of innovation. We've had a very good year in terms
of profitability. So we've put a lot of money behind the innovation that we had coming through in '10. We're getting
closer to the end of exiting some of the less value-added pieces of our total revenue pie. So we are set to become more
optimistic about volume trends going forward and we have made sure in the fourth quarter of this year that we would
have really positioned ourselves to do well against that mark, because it's clear that the investment community really
looks at how our volume trends are progressing.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. And then just in terms of, again, reconciling your guidance on the operating profit line, so if
I take the mid-point, it's about 70 million improvement versus fiscal '10. You've talked about the 100 million of
incremental savings from Project Accelerate. There's additional 45 million of pension benefits. You've got some of the
headwinds again on the currency and the overhead expenses on the H&BC side. But it seems like there are still some
chunk that's missing in terms of getting to that 70 million. So is it mostly just the MAP spending that's going to go up
again in fiscal '11 versus fiscal '10?
<A - Marcel Smits>: No, I think there's a number of items that you mentioned. There's a couple that are missing. I
think there's the 53rd week, of course, that is in there. So that's a drag. The commodities will be a drag, I guess.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Currency.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Currency is a drag. And then on the pluses, we have Accelerate savings coming through. We
have some pension favorability coming through and then, obviously, hopefully, the growth of the business will also
deliver gross profit contributions. So that's the mix of pluses and minus.
<Q - Judy Hong>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next, John Baumgartner [Telsey Advisory Group]. Your line is open.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Thank you. Good morning. Marcel, a question for you. Looking at International
Beverages, obviously some good momentum there recently, but also thinking about some of the headwinds, higher
coffee cost, obviously, the Nestle infringement against L'OR, some of the aggressive competitive pricing we've seen in
roast and ground in some of the countries there in Europe. Thinking ahead 12 months, so essentially fiscal '11, if there's
any kind of potential negative risk to performance in that segment, I'm just curious how you think about it at the
top-line and margins. Might it be from macro softness weighing on single serve volumes? Might it be continued
competitive pricing? Might it be inflation? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you think of any potential negative risk
to performance in that segment in 2011.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yeah, well, you've mentioned a number of things. I think the key item that we have to get
visibility on the next few months is whether or not we're able to price the coffee price increases through. And I guess
the good news is that coffee price increases are now so visible to everybody that you can't run into a trading partner
who says, well, coffee price increases, I haven't heard of that because everybody is clearly dealing with this. So that's
something that we'll have to work through. But given the visibility, we're reasonably confident that in time we'll be able
to work through that.

In terms of evaluating our coffee guidance for the profitability, here there's a couple of things to be said. First of all,
we're looking to increase the MAP. Secondly, we're absorbing some stranded overhead in the coffee business. And then
thirdly, the $30 million currency movement that we've called out in the press release and in the presentation from Mark
is also to be absorbed. So those things you have to take into consideration when you look at our coffee guidance.
We feel pretty good about the innovation. We feel very confident about the infringement proceedings that you just
alluded to. We've been at that process for three years. So we come extremely well prepared and so we don't count that
as a major risk. But what we're talking about today is commodity prices, very much on the top of everybody's mind. So
we think that's appropriate that we address that and that's clearly the issue that we'll have to overcome.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Thinking about inflation as clearly a potential
negative to margins, a thing that occurs to me is thinking about the Bakery, both in Spain and North America, and even
in coffee here over the past few quarters, one of the drags on the volume has been competitive pricing. And my sense
would be that, as inflation comes back to the space both in wheat and flour and in coffee, I would imagine price gaps
would probably improve relative to your products and improve volumes. Is that a fair way to think about the
competitive environment, that maybe we do see a better volume from improved pricing dynamics across some of these
segments?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: We've seen even prior to the recent run-up in wheat, other bakery competitors take
pricing increases and communicate their intention to take them. So we already had that going and, you're correct, if you
look at past cycles of wheat going up, it's such a large input cost that inevitably prices have to go up. I mean, not
everybody prices exactly to commodities, but you're correct in assuming, if the past is any indication, that would be
another push to see bread prices increase.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Thank you.

Thank you. Next, Alexia Howard [Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.], your line is open.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Hey, Alexia.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Morning.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Hi. Just a quick follow-up, because most of my questions have been answered. The
Foodservice environment, I guess because of the loss of the customers in that segment, we haven't got a direct line of
sight into what that business would have looked like in the absence of the big step-down there. What are you seeing in
Foodservice? Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Do you think the pressures that we've seen over the last couple of
years are beginning to dissipate or is it really too early to tell?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Alexia, I would say the macro environment is not declining but we don't see – maybe we
see a dim light, but we certainly don't see a bright light at the end of the tunnel yet. I think we've got a little more ways
to travel. And then specific within our categories, what we've done is really pretty dramatically focused on those three
categories where we feel we've got a real advantage, either leveraging our global coffee expertise or our branded meat
expertise or our leadership position in frozen bakery. So we're doing a nice job of gaining share and winning business
in those narrowed categories, but the macro environment, I would say, is still very mixed.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Morning.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Andrew, good morning.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: If we listen to a lot of the calendar 2Q results that we've heard from a lot of the packaged goods
companies, if there's one thing that seems to be fairly consistent, is a lot of the management teams have talked about
this being, meaning the calendar second quarter, the most disruptive or competitive promotional environment they've
seen in 30 plus years and those sorts of things. And I guess I'm curious if you would concur with that. And the reason I
ask is because your price mix in the quarter, as you mentioned, was actually up around 2.8%, and I realize a big piece
of that is the mix impact from some of the portfolio change. So perhaps is there a way to give us a sense of what just
the price and promotional impact was to the top-line, separate from mix, to give us a sense of I guess if you'd concur
with the broader industry sentiment and then if we can potentially think that it's possibly peaked this past quarter?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: I think broadly, I'm not sure we would agree that it was the most competitive quarter.
Certainly Bakery was very competitive. We saw some price competition in some coffee markets and on hot dogs and
lunch meat. Whether it was the most competitive or not, I'm not sure I would really go that far.
And given competitors following our price increases and some of them, frankly, going in price increases on their own
in different markets, I would say that that competitive environment is abating, largely because I think it just
economically has to; given that deep, deep, deep discounting in certain categories, we have factual data that says it's not
helping the retailer. It's not helping us. And now with commodities going up, I would think that would have to happen.
So not the worst ever, and, yes, we do see the promotional environment abating.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay. And then is there a way to get a sense – would your price and promotional impact on the
top-line have still been positive even without the impact of mix, or would that have been slightly negative?
<A - Marcel Smits>: If I can add to that, you're asking the split between price mix that we put together, mix – price
was negative by a little over a percent for the full year. And do you want to know that for the quarter? I...
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: If you have it.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: For the quarter, it was about the same. It's almost exactly the same for the
quarter.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes, it is, actually. I have it here in front of me now; it's exactly the same. So it's just over 1%
price. Of course, that's a bit different from one segment to another. What CJ was just saying, price was negative more
than that 1% in the International Bakery business and in the North American Fresh Bakery business and then it was a
bit better in other segments. So – but overall for the company, price was a negative of just over 1%.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next in queue we have Tim Ramey [D.A. Davidson]. Your line is open.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Good morning. Marcel, when we were together in June, you talked about finance and IT savings
of, I think, more than $80 million. I'm trying to get a sense of – is that your goal for achieving that run rate in 2011 or
will that be the 2011 savings per the P&L? I mean, is this something you get to at a run rate by the end of the year or...?

<A - Marcel Smits>: Tim, thank you for asking that question. That's about $80 million that we're trying to take out of
the finance and the IT functions. We're going to take that out in about two years. So we'll have the full benefit of that in
'13. And most of that actually relates to the – we'd include that in the Accelerate savings that we're playing for. So we're
playing for more than 200 million of additional accelerated benefits. And obviously the finance area, the IT area is a
reasonable chunk of that.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Any guess on how much of that falls into 2011 P&L?
<A - Marcel Smits>: No. How much of that specifically? What we have given guidance for today is, as we've said, the
Accelerate savings next year are going to be between 90 million and 110 million. So we've given you a pretty clear
handle on how much the combined effect of all the cost savings initiatives is, and what's going on in the finance area is
just a part of that. My colleagues who are around the table, they all have different initiatives that they're carrying with.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: And, CJ, your indication that meat EBIT margins would be up in '11 is somewhat surprising given
the fourth quarter performance, and I know that there was a big marketing spending number there. But would you argue
with the thought that the underlying business profitability has eroded meaningfully given higher input costs?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Over a full fiscal year, I would say no. And again, in a quarter when we project our meat
costs are going to be X dollars and we're hedged on a lot of that but we're not hedged on all of it and they have a
meaningful run-up, we end up taking a hit. If they go down, we get a benefit. So I would say though, ongoing, we feel
good about the profitability in the segment. It's gone up. We see as we shift the mix, it should continue to go up. I
mean, we're certainly not going to see the huge leaps that we've seen recently, but we feel pretty good about the
continued bottom-line growth of the segment.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: And I assume that this will be one of those segments that's really fourth quarter weighted in '11
versus '10? You've got such a hard comp in at least the second and third quarters.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: It's a big segment of profitability and, yeah, if you did the mix, probably it'd be a fair
assumption.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yeah. Hey, Tim, that's also – the logical outcome of everything that we said at the end of the
second quarter of 2010. You'll remember that we said, look, the meats business is now meaningfully above the trend
line of gradual profit improvement. So CJ has a – it's a courageous statement. Next year we're going to go make another
jump in profits, even though in the first half of 2010, we've been pretty open about the fact that we've been able to hold
on to some favorability as a function of the strength of our brands. So the fact that next year we're going to go up again
is a function of everything coming together. The Kansas City plant is going to come on stream. Some of the projects
costs that relate to that are going to fall out. Cost savings are coming through, further improvements of the portfolio.
So, yeah, that's why I fully concur with what we just said.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Thanks so much.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Eric Katzman [Deutsche Bank], your line is open.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Yeah, thanks for the follow-up. I guess maybe we can cover this with the Meet the Management
Day, but, CJ, back when inflation first moved up a couple of years ago, the company hadn't really put much in terms of
innovation behind the core and MAP spending was a lot lower and you suffered a fair amount of elasticity because you
lacked the brand equity at the time. How much elasticity do you think we're going to get hit by volume-wise given the
pricing that you're going to have to put through, assuming that it does get put through?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Well, let me take that in two parts. First of all, we also will get the benefit with prices
going up. That'll help the top-line. But there is an impact on volume. I would say, Eric, though, the elements of what

happens, maybe you're referring all the way back to 2005, was not just that the brands weren't as strong, but the
sophistication of the analytics on how we price was completely absent, where now I would argue that we are one of the
best, if not the best, in our category.
So we really understand trade-offs among different proteins, price point gaps versus key competitors, frequency of
promotion, level of number of items to put on promotion. So we're able to – and probably most importantly, we're able
to fold that into a total category story.
So we talk a lot on this call about commodities and pricing and we certainly look at that very carefully and it affects it.
But our key prices in the market are set really – this is not just a line we give customers, but are really set towards
helping total category growth. And then all the brand support and the better brand marketing and innovation certainly
help us to limit any effect on price increases.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe it's not something that you can comment on, Marcel,
because it's strategic, but obviously there's been reports out of Crain's and I guess The Wall Street Journal picked it up
regarding the bread business and looking at strategic options. Can you say anything about that at this time?
<A - Marcel Smits>: No, we have said at the time of the Crain's article that we're not going – commenting on market
rumors. We're very focused on driving the Bakery business forward, so that's where we are.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. We'll see you in a couple weeks.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yep.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, Andy Feinman [Iridian Asset Management], your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Feinman>: Thanks. Iridian. So based on what I've learned in this call, it sounds like steady as she goes
as far as your strategy going forward relative to what was in place with Brenda, who I'm sorry to see go. And so given
that – and I'm pretty happy with the interim assignments as they have been made. However, I don't think I can make
any investment decisions, and I'd like to be in a position to buy more stock, but I don't think I can do that until the
board makes its decisions because I really don't know who I'm going to be investing with. So I was wondering if you
could give us a timetable for when we can expect closure on this question.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Well, Andy, we have said what we can say about it. We'll pass your message on to the board with
the promise that you're going to buy a lot more stock if the board manages to appoint a good CEO, if that's the way I
can take it.
<Q - Andrew Feinman>: Yeah, well, my message was that I'm happy with the interim appointments. I just had one
other question. And that is I noticed you talked about in the press release the money you're spending on SAP and
Oracle, and I don't know, I probably heard about this before and forgot, but maybe it's new to me. And so I was
wondering if that's a process that you – a project you've been working on for a while now or if it's something new and
where you are in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning and the cost that you'll incur from it and
when can expect to get the benefits from it.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Andy, it's CJ. The SAP reference that we give is we implemented Order to Cash a few
years ago very successfully and that's helped and we've gotten – it's paid back very handsomely in the front-end of our
business. We're now in the process of implementing an ERP system, largely SAP-based, throughout our entire supply
chain, of which actually just this past weekend we successfully went live in two plants without a hitch.
The other big investment is in an Oracle tool called Demantra and really that is just going live right now. And that's a
tool that will take us one step even further from where we are on our pricing sophistication. We're rolling that out in our
Retail business and as it's successful, we plan to expand it to our Bakery business and others as well.
