refer to our filings at the Securities and Exchange Commission for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties.
Acknowledging the fact that this call may be webcast for some time to come, we believe it's important to note that
today's call includes time sensitive information that may be accurate only as of today's date, July 30, 2010.
During today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC's Regulation G.
Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included within the earnings
release or the company's supplemental information package that was included in this morning's Form 8-K. This
package is also available on the Simon Web site in the Investor section under Financial Information, Quarterly
Supplemental Packages.
Participating in today's call will be David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rick Sokolov, President and
Chief Operating Officer and Steve Sterrett, Chief Financial Officer.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Simon.
David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I'll just give a few minutes of overview and then we'll open it
up for some Q&A.
First, on the financial and operational front, we reported FFO of $1.38 per diluted share for the quarter, which was
$0.04 above first-call consensus estimates, and which was also burdened by over $0.03 of non-recurring transaction
expenses for the quarter.
In addition, we continue to lead our peer group in comparable property net operating income, generating 1.9% growth
in the second quarter of 2010 and 2.3% for the six-month period. Drivers in this leading comparable NOI include
revenue and rent growth, increases in occupancy, higher percentage rents as a result of increasing sales and our
continued and effective cost control and management, as well as a reduction in bad debt compared to the previous
period given the lower bankruptcies.
As of 6/30, comparable sales on a rolling 12-month basis were $474 per square foot as compared to $456 per square
foot last year. Tenant reported sales 4.9% higher during the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2009.
And on a year-to-date basis, recorded sales for the six months ended June 30 were 6.2% higher as compared to same
period in 2009. As of 6/30, our occupancy was 93.1, 90 basis points higher than 3/31 and 80 basis points higher than
one year ago. At June 30, the re-leasing spread for our trailing 12 months was $0.50 per square foot, or 1.2%. Leasing
spreads have been impacted by a number of jewelry store closings, but I also want you to keep in mind that this is just
base rent. We've had an increase in our CAM of at least that number if not more, and also we'd like you to keep in mind
that our increase in occupancy of 90 basis points or 700,000 square feet includes some leasing in some tougher
locations that we were able to accomplish in the second quarter.
Demand for space continues to improve. The ICSC convention was positive. Leasing activity has increased. And we
fully executed 6.3 million square feet of new leases and renewals in the first six months of 2010 in malls and outlets as
compared to 4.7 million square feet in the first six months of 2009.
Finally, in operational, and I just want to say the important point is that our year-to-date comparable NOI is up 2.3%
with higher sales, higher occupancy and positive leasing spreads. Dispositions, let me move to that, in acquisition
activity, as we disclosed in our earning release, we sold one asset in our GCI joint venture property Porta di Roma
where we had a 19.6% interest, and our gain in that was $20 million. Of course, this is not included in FFO, and on July
15 we completed the previously announced sale of Simon Ivanhoe, our 50/50 joint venture – European joint venture
with Ivanhoe Cambridge. We received 715 million euros, and Simon Property Group expects to gain – record a gain of
approximately $280 million on the transaction in the third quarter.
We also entered into a JV with Unibail and Ivanhoe Cambridge to pursue the development of four new retail projects in
France. We'll have a 25% interest in this venture and have the ability to determine on a project-by-project basis whether

to retain our ownership interest.
On May 13, we acquired the 345,000 square foot outlet center from Prime, the Puerto Rico asset. In addition, on May
28, we increased our ownership interest of approximately 19% in Houston, which culminates in over a 50% interest in
this terrific asset. The combined cost of these acquisitions was approximately $385 million and including the
assumption of existing indebtedness.
Let me turn to the capital markets. In the first six months of the year, we paid off 700 million of senior unsecured notes.
We've also unencumbered three malls, paying off approximately 800 million of mortgages in maturity. In July, we
unencumbered two additional malls with $282 million of mortgages. The net result is we reduced our leverage by over
$2 billion in the last seven months. The secured markets continue to improve, both on the life insurance market as well
as with CMBS.
Year-to-date we've closed seven new loans totaling $900 million. 515 was from life companies, 330 million from
CMBS placements and 55 million from bank loan. We've also locked rate in the third quarter of another $500 million
of loans, 375 coming from insurance companies, 125 from CMBS originations. These three loans will have a weighted
average of 5.3% and a term of ten years.
At the end of the quarter, we had 2.6 billion of cash on hand, including our share of JVs and the availability in our
corporate credit facility, including the Simon Ivanhoe sale that occurred in July, which we used the partial proceeds to
pay down our euro tranche of our revolver. We'll have 3.5 billion so a total capital availability of over $6.1 billion.
Development activity, we are higher than our budget, yet in improving economic conditions. We originally budgeted
around 100 million. We think we'll end up spending close to 200 million. We expect to have double-digit returns on
this capital.
We're also excited to announce that we'll start the construction of Merrimack Premium Outlets in Merrimack, New
Hampshire this fall with a projected opening in 2012. And we have two outlet centers undergoing significant
expansions, the Houston Premium Outlets and Las Vegas Outlet centers.
Also we've done a very good job in our tactical projects redevelopment opportunities as we've reclaimed certain
department store locations in big boxes. During the first six months of 2010, we opened 14 new anchors for big boxes,
including Nordstrom, Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, hhgregg. In addition, we have 15 additional stores under
construction and scheduled to open in 2010 and again they include Forever 21, Whole Foods, Crate & Barrel and
Target.
On the international front, there are two new premium outlet centers projected to open in 2010. Paju Premium in South
Korea commenced construction in late March; that's in the northern part of Seoul. And Johor Premium Outlets is going
to break ground in August. That will serve the Singaporean market. We're partnering with Genting Group, a
well-known, well-respected company in Malaysia and throughout the world. And on completion in 2011, we will have
11 Premium Outlet Centers in Asia.
Now let me turn to Prime and then we're prepared to open up for questions. Our acquisition of Prime Retail is still
being reviewed by the FTC and we are fully cooperating in that review. I wanted to give you a couple of updates on the
specifics of the deal. As I mentioned, we closed on the Puerto Rican asset of the outlet, Prime's Outlet Center, and we're
currently in the process of negotiating leases for all of the vacant space. And once those leases are executed we'll be
100% occupied.
We subsequently amended our agreement with Prime so that they will retain its St. Augustine Center as well as its
Livermore and Grand Prairie development projects. And as we noted in our May conference call, U.S. anti-trust
authorities have consistently recognized that the retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Retailers have
many options to choose from when deciding where to sell their merchandise, including both a variety of brick and
mortar locations and of course the internet, where sales growth has exploded in recent years.
We have received an overwhelming show of support from this deal from our retailer and it's – they recognize the highly
competitive nature of this business, that our acquisition will provide a significant amount of new capital to a company

currently in financial distress and put that capital to work to improve the operations of Prime assets and therefore
improve the retailers' performance in those centers. We remain confident that we will close the remainder of the
transaction, and as noted in our release, we have reaffirmed our 2010 guidance. And once precise timing of the closing
of Prime transaction is known, we will provide an upgrade to our guidance upon that conclusion.
So finally, let me just say I am proud of our organization and the quarter that we produced, given all of the continuing
uncertainty in the economic environment. And we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] And this first question will come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, how are you doing?
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Doing well, happy it's Friday, although we have another week of earnings to go.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We don't.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Well then you can enjoy the weekend.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: That's true.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Just going back to Prime, just want to get a little more color here. I mean, United and
Continental only announced a deal a few months ago, EU's already approved that. What are your advisors and what is
the FTC saying is just taking so long on this?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Alexander, I'd love to be able to comment further on
it, but you'll just have to rely on the statements that I have made, and again we remain confident but I really don't have
much to add beyond what I have mentioned.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. And then switching to leasing, just want to get sort of an update on where you
think TIs are going to end up this year. And then as we look at the re-leasing spreads over the next – or the rent roll
over the next few years, if we think about $38 being the sort of market, and sort of $34 rent rolls, should we expect sort
of 12% re-leasing spreads over the next few years?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well look, I think a lot's been – we've read some of
the analytic research today about the rent spreads, and I think we need to hearken back on a couple of things. One is
last year was a tough, tough year, and as you know we did a number of things to help our retailers survive last year, and
as those leases have been executed it has put, undeniably so, pressure on our leasing spreads. So what we're seeing in
our results is exactly what we expected. And in fact I think the guidance that we gave to you early in this year actually
thought – we though we would have comparable NOI down and we're actually performing much better than we
anticipated.
I think as the market stabilizes we're convinced that we've got the ability to continue to generate positive leasing
spreads that we have done historically as a public company for the last 17 years. So we are not immune to the economic
environment that's occurred over the last 18 months. I'm proud of what we've done. The fact that we still have positive
leasing spreads is a testament to the quality of our portfolio, a testament to our positive relationships with our tenants,
and a testament to the organization. And I'd also say we leased, we increased our occupancy and in this market that's
something to be proud of.
So bottom line, long winded, this is – as sales increases, certainly rents are related to the ability to deal with rent
increases. Given that we've seen rents stabilize and sales are moving in the right direction, we feel good that we'll

continue to generate positive leasing spreads.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: And then the TI expectation for the year?
<A>: I have not shown any appreciable change. We're still basically seeing the same amount of TIs that we've had
historically.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. So like 75 or so for this year is fine?
<A>: I believe that's about where our run rate has been for the TIs.
<Q - Alexander Goldfarb>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Alex
Operator
And the next question will come from the line of Jeff Spector, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Actually, it's Craig Schmidt here. Actually I wanted to talk on the, you had a really strong
sequential pickup in occupancy, the 90 bps and I guess in part it sounds like you were able to lease some of the tougher
locations you were saying. But as we look at the third and fourth quarter, should the sequential gains slow, or are there
still more tough locations you think you can get leased up in the last half of the year?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Craig, this is Rick. We are still seeing a good flow of deals. Remains to be seen how much
more we can sequentially increase on a 90 bp gain but we should be able to hold those gains year-over-year.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: And certainly historically there is a pickup in
occupancy as you go into the third and fourth quarter. So I would hope that we continue to do that. Obviously there was
one reasonable-sized bankruptcy, Premier Salon. We don't think there's a lot more, but that's always the unknown. But
we think that'll move in the right direction.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. And do you have a sense of where the occupancy might actually end up end of the year?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I think – again, I think it'll be positive. I wouldn't
want to pinpoint the number at this point. But we were looking – again, looking for flat occupancy compared to last
year but I think we'll – in our guidance, but we'll be able to do better than that.
<Q - Craig Schmidt>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
Operator
And the next question will come from the line Christine McElroy, UBS.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just following up on some of your comments, I know how
much you guys love questions on re-leasing spreads. I realize that the stores that are opening now are still reflective of
some of the tougher leases that were signed last year or over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a sense for
what kind of spreads you're seeing on the small-shop leasing that you're doing today, and is that sort of giving you the
confidence in your forward-looking comments?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Christine, it's Steve. And we are seeing an improvement, not only in deal flow, as David and
Rick have talked about, but also in a strengthening of the quality of the deals. So I do think the trends are positive. I
also think one of the things to think about, and I don't know if other people have talked about it on their calls, but one
of the things that's impacting spreads is we have had a disproportionate amount of jewelry store closings, which are

high rent payers.
David mentioned it in his call. But to the extent that that has run its course, that drag on our spreads will cease to be
there. And because the rest of the activity is getting better, you should see a naturally pickup in the spreads.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Okay. And then Steve, just following up on Prime. Thinking about the timing, can you
remind us, what was expected accretion from the Prime deal in your current guidance range and how much did it
contribute?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, again, this is David. Let me, let me, I'll take the
Prime questions if I could. I think the important point at this point is we're going to update our guidance once we know
the precise timing of the closing of the transaction. The fact that when we gave guidance originally, we had Prime in it
from March 31. Now we have not backed off our guidance, even though we have not had Prime since March 31, and
we have reaffirmed our guidance and we will upgrade it and update it once we know the precise timing. So beyond
that, Christine, I can't really shed any more light on it other than again, we had budgeted that. We told the world that,
that, that was in our guidance from the end of the – or the very – April 1 essentially, in the second quarter. So we
produced the results. We beat our own internal budget even though we had Prime in it for the whole quarter.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Okay. Rick, you've talked in the past about things looking up for the department stores:
performances better, balance sheets are better. But they're still sort of working on making their existing product more
productive. Could that include more department-store closings or maybe even downsizings on the horizon and would
you be willing to modify REAs and other agreements to allow certain underperforming anchors to maybe sublease a
portion of their box?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Well, that covers a lot of ground. First, Dave and I literally last week were with three of our
major department store companies and none of them were talking about store closings. In fact, the emphasis now is
looking for new opportunities and primarily in our existing product. So we expect that to be the trend rather than store
closings.
Secondly, in terms of the modification of subleases, we are in – we are always trying to make our properties better. I
think, as David has pointed out in past calls, that we've been very active with replacing underperforming anchors with
better anchors and we're going to continue to do that. So if there are things that we can do working with existing
department stores that we believe will make the property stronger, we're going to be open to have that conversation.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: And Christine, this is David. Let me just say, as the –
and again, I think we are still in an uncertain economic macro environment. But one of the things – we have a, I'd say
roughly 20 potential transformational redevelopments that we've been working on. We essentially put them on hold,
obviously last year, and we have reinvigorated the company to pursue those.
And I think they're very exciting. It'll add a lot of opportunity for our company and we're going to accelerate that
process. And then you know they go from South Hills in Pittsburgh to Plaza Carolina in Puerto Rico to La Plaza in
McAllen, Texas, Dayland, Phleman Nanuet, Roosevelt Field, Walt Whitman. So there's a lot that we're excited about
internally that we've kind of said let's get started on.
<Q - Christine McElroy>: Great, thanks so much.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

<Q - David Harris>: Good, I'm fine, thank you. I have two quick questions for you. One is upon a detail, and then
another big picture question for you, David.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: You want me to do the detail?
<Q - David Harris>: Why not? Have a go. Real estate taxes were down notably in the quarter. Is that just a sort of
timing issue or are you doing something wonderful to keep your tax liabilities down?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: I think it is more of the latter, but I wouldn't categorize it as wonderful. We have an ongoing,
sophisticated process to make sure we believe we are being fairly assessed reflecting the value of the properties, and
that's – there's a whole group of people that are focused on that and we're yielding some results by engaging with the
taxing authorities on the real estate taxes.
<Q - David Harris>: So the second quarter number is a reasonable run rate, Rick?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: I believe it is.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. Terrific.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: There is David. Here's my detail response. There are –
at times, there are recoveries – it's a little bit lumpy, because at some point you get recoveries and obviously if we do
have those – I don't know on the top of my head if we had that in the – we had some recoveries in the second quarter.
So sometimes it's a little bit lumpy because you do get recoveries that you're allowed to offset against the expenses and
obviously, though Rick's point is right on, I mean we are extremely focused that our properties are appropriately
assessed.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. Stay there, I've got you for the big question. Is it – I think about your company, which has
been public, what, for 16, 17 years? We've been through two recessions now. Can you demonstrate that your
management and ownership of the underlying property performance is demonstrably better than the market?
And if so, how do you use that in your discussions with – in terms of forming potential joint ventures or potentially
talking to pension funds about transfer of assets that have perhaps underperformed under direct ownership and that
could do so much better under your ownership?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well that sounds like I need a whitepaper to respond.
But look, I think our results over the years have clearly spoken for themselves. We've transformed properties. We've
upgraded our portfolio. We've produced terrific operating results in all sorts of different environments. We've made
appropriate strategic decisions like the Outlet business and the like.
From an operating point of view, David, we get solicited all the time to be partners with institutional investors. There's
not a deal that we couldn't have done with an institutional investor, and I think they look and welcome our ability to
partner with us. And I'm sure we could probably back all these statements up with numbers if you give us some time,
and maybe that's a good assignment for us, but there's no question in my mind that over the years our performance and
our results have certainly indicated that we're better than just what the general economic environment could produce. I
don't know if you guys want to add anything to it.
<Q - David Harris>: My thinking is along those lines, David, that clearly your focus has been, from the beginning of
the year; let's look at the opportunities in the U.S. And clearly your pursuit of general growth=> clearly your pursuit of
General Growth ended when it did. And I'm thinking where does Simon go in terms of potentially buying assets in
what is obviously – there aren't that many assets to buy in the marketplace, and some of those have been held for a long
time, but probably with people that have perhaps underperformed in the performance of those assets relative to what
you could do. Is there a line of conversation you can have with those folks and say, look over an extended period of
time we could do much better with this asset. I'm not talking about FFO or earnings per share from the corporate level;
I'm talking about underlying property performance.

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well look, I think that the evidence of our ability to
do that is in a couple of cases. I mean first of all, if you look at what we built in Asia on the Outlet side, we basically
exported our talent there, and we're going to have a portfolio of 11 outlet centers that are producing close to $1,000 a
foot in sales. So also, even though we just recently sold our properties in – the two in Poland and the five in France –
the fact of the matter is we built them, we developed them, we leased them, and we brought an institutional quality
product to those marketplaces with our guidance and our leasing expertise and the like. So I think there's plenty of
evidence of our ability to export our know-how.
Now you don't want to do it in a way that suggests hubris because there's been plenty – certainly plenty of developers
that have tried to do that and have not been able to produce the results that are necessary to be profitable overseas. I'd
also point out that a number of our customer or retail tenants have been successful in exporting their brands, so even
though we have sold seven assets in Europe, the fact of the matter is we are not foreclosing the opportunity to grow our
company globally. I think we've been successful in our efforts thus far there, and I think the ability to demonstrate that
is readily apparent.
<Q - David Harris>: Is one way to summarize what you're saying is that you see limited opportunities to buy
domestically?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I didn't say that, and I don't necessarily believe that.
Look, you can say that in a point in time, but I do think circumstances change and the environment that exists today in
my opinion is not necessarily going to be the environment that exists tomorrow or the next day, and you've got to be in
a position to deal with that.
<Q - David Harris>: Okay. I'll let you answer the next detail question. Thank you.

And the next question will come from the line of Jay Habermann, Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jay Habermann>: Hey, good morning. You know, David, you're still sitting on a pretty strong balance sheet
with as you mentioned lots of cash in current liquidity. I'm just wondering, of the various options you have today, how
you would rank either development, acquisitions or even looking at further paying down debt?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well we're going to continue to de-lever if there's not
the acquisition opportunities to pursue. But like I said, Jay, is that I do think I've given Rick and the team the green
light to go reenergize our redevelopment program. And again, we have 15, 20 really transformational assets that I think
are going to require meaningful capital and produce wonderful results. So there's plenty to do. Obviously we're working
on some interesting opportunities today but, look, our focus clearly has been to – we'll pursue General Growth; we
weren't successful there. I'll leave that for you to judge that whole process. But our focus obviously has been on Prime
and we've been working very hard to get that transaction closed. And so I think once we can get some of that done, then
I think there'll be plenty of opportunities for this company.
<Q - Jay Habermann>: Fair enough. And just going back to leasing spreads and I guess sales, I mean the trend has
clearly been positive this year in terms of sales productivity. I guess when do you start to see that translate into some
pickup and in asking rents, and I guess just balancing that against retailers that continue to be pretty sensitive to
occupancy costs?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think it's – you know look, we're still, we're in
a recovery mode. The mood is much better. I mentioned we increased our occupancy but we're not, it's not in the period
that we were in, in the '06, '07 period. So I think that's still, Jay, going to still take some time to max out on lease
spreads. But look, the mood's better, the demand is better and sales are increasing. So there's a lag in all of that but we
feel we'll get back to kind of the spreads that we would like to see going forward.
<Q - Jay Habermann>: Thanks, David.

And the next question will come from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Good morning. There's been a bit of chat about acquisitions again. I'm just curious whether,
given the demand for mall assets at the moment, is there some kind of opportunity to start sort of recycling capital and
potentially looking at selling some of your middle-market malls?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I think at some point, we still, there is still a – we like
our middle-market malls that dominate a good trade area because they have shown, historically, growth. The stuff that
we'd like to sell really is what I'll call the gum on the shoe. That market is still slow to develop, Quentin, so hopefully
maybe that comes along. There's not that many that have been earmarked for that, but to the extent that, that market
starts to generate, we'll move forward.
Now we do have certain non-strategic assets on the market that have some redevelopment opportunity, so I think – and
they're getting more and more interest. So I think we've demonstrated – we've probably sold 50 assets over the years.
We certainly have recycled some of the European capital. So I think we've shown a pretty good discipline that we're
prepared to recycle capital through asset sales.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. I think I saw that your joint venture partner in the Copley one portfolio is potentially
selling their stake. Is that something that you would have any interest in, and if so, is there a right of first offer or
anything that you have on that?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well there are contractual restrictions, Quentin. It's
not appropriate to get into that, but we're working with our partner in a way – it's been a very good investment. It's been
a very good partnership and obviously institutional investors to some extent need to recycle capital. So there's a lot of
different ways that can go, but it's been a good transaction for all of the folks involved and we'd expect that to continue,
whether they stay a partner or whether they exit.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. And maybe one for Steve. I just noticed in the second quarter that interest and
dividend income jumped by quite a lot. Just wondering why that was and whether that's likely to run into the third
quarter.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Well a couple of things, Quentin. One – and I don't know if you're comparing it to last year or
to the first quarter – but Liberty, or now Capital and Counties and Capital Shopping Centres does pay a semi-annual
dividend. That came in the second quarter, so if you were comparing it to the first quarter, that would be part of the
explanation. And we have seen rates on our short term invested cash get marginally better so we're investing the cash at
a little bit higher rates than we've seen. Those would be the two major reasons.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. And just the other one for the model, in terms of transactions costs, I know you closed
the Simon Ivanhoe sale to Unibail on the 15th of July. Are there going to be any costs that come in, in the third quarter?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: It's, yeah, it's likely, given that obviously some of the transaction costs associated with Prime
will continue in parts of the third quarter, so yes. Hard to pinpoint that number down right now. As you know there –
you have the accounting change. Normally that would capitalized, but Quentin, it will continue, but again it's hard to
pinpoint that number at this point.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Got you. And then just lastly, Liz Claiborne in the Chelsea outlets, they have obviously
announced that they'll be closing some of their outlets. Just wondering if you've had any discussions with them yet and
what your exposure is.

<A - Richard Sokolov>: Well we have had ongoing discussions with them. We've got 16 outlets that are exclusively
Liz and that's about a 190,000 square feet. We've got another 12 outlets that are hybrid where there is a Liz component
along with other brands from Liz Claiborne like Lucky, Kate Spade or Juicy Couture. That's about another 46,000 feet.
We list our top tenants and they're not in our top ten and so their rental contribution to us is substantially below 1% of
our minimum rent, and we're going to approach this like we approach everything else. They have their business
objectives, we have ours, and we're going to work with them to hopefully come up with a mutually acceptable
conclusion.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: And Rick, do you think that those leases are currently paying rent at market or are they below
what you'd expect market rents to be?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: We think that there could be opportunity for both of us if we can come up with a thing that
allows them to satisfy their objectives and us ours.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. All right, thank you.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Thank, Quentin.

Our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan, Morgan Stanley
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: The thinking about the short term leases that you are signing, I know you didn't do maybe quite
as many as some of the peers, but – over the past couple of years. And what's your experience then as those have
started to expire? And are tenants more interested in doing longer term renewals now or are you still kind of rolling
over a year at a time?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: It's a combination of both. I mean again, a lot of it is
retailer-specific, but there is still a level of uncertainty out there. And so – and again, a lot of it's tactical on our side
too, in terms of what we're trying to accomplish with the properties. So I'd say it's marginally better, marginally
probably the ability to get a little longer-term lease, but it's not dramatically different than the beginning of the year,
Paul.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay. And then going to the redevelopments that you mentioned, you characterized those as
transformational. I mean a few years ago, transformational often included some mixed-use component or opening it up
partially. Are these more conservative do you think or is it the same type of project that you were thinking of doing
four years ago?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I mean the good news about our mixed-use stuff, it's
been highly, highly successful, like Domain in the residential market has been terrific, and so we haven't had net-net
mixed-use elements that we've brought in. The Westin Hotel there has been very well received. So I think we've done a
pretty good job in bringing that.
But to us, the number one priority in any retail development is make it a better retail project. And I think generally
speaking, though there may be certain elements, maybe there's a hotel opportunity here or there or a residential
opportunity here or there, the primary focus is on the retail aspect of it. And yeah, I would say generally the scope may
have been narrowed to some extent, so we're trying to figure out how to do it a little bit less grandiose, but not wildly
different.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: And the return hurdles, now that we're seeing it again?

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I think the return hurdles, given the cost of
construction and the demand out there for construction jobs, is actually going to be pretty good, pretty consistent.
Otherwise, look, at the end of the day if it's not, we go on to the next deal.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay. And then just lastly, Rick, you said TIs were kind of no real change there, but at least in
your supplemental what you report is about 75 million year to date, which is quite a bit higher than past years' run rates,
and I was just wondering maybe if some of this is just catch up from having such a low year last year or whether really
it is certain economics of the deal environment right now, or what. But it is higher than what you've reported at least
over the past few years.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Paul, this is Steve. I think Rick's comment was more to the point that on a deal-by-deal basis
we never – per square foot we haven't really seen any change in the bid and the ask on the TI side. Clearly, we've had
more leasing volume this year. You know our leasing volume is up about a million and a half square feet year over
year, and that's driving the size of the number, but the composition of the deals and what deals get TAs and how much
and all that really hasn't changed.
<Q - Paul Morgan>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from the line of Michael Gorman, Cowen & Company.
<Q - Michael Gorman>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. If I could just follow up on that TI question for a second.
Can you just walk through in this environment how you think about the allocation of TAs and the potential return on
those as you sit down with tenants, especially given the strong position on your balance sheet and the cash that you
have to invest? So the trade off between potentially earning a higher rent from a tenant versus having to commit the
capital?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look, I don't think you want to – I don't know,
maybe I'm misunderstanding the question, but I don't think you want to get to the point where you're giving more TA
and buying up rent. I think that creates an unholy alliance. And frankly the retailers, you know, from their standpoint
they're in a good capital position as well. So, you know, they want to pay market rents. Market rents are determined by
sales productivity, so I think that the traditional way that we've done leasing is – still holds.
We never been – as a company, we've always been reluctant to do some of the new fancy under-capitalized retailers
that have a history, not to say that we've been perfect in this area, but we certainly have been, I think at least, from what
I see externally and internally, we've always been relatively conservative in terms of putting capital at risk for tenants
that are under-capitalized. But I'd say generally if you have a healthy retailer, you know, you just don't get in that
scenario. It's not a win-win for either side.
<Q - Michael Gorman>: Got you.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: And the only think I would add is we, when we're doing our lease approvals, we analyze each
lease based on net rent that takes into account the allowance and we also have a very stringent credit process as our
leasing agents will attest. So both of those things tend to limit the allowance in relation to rent.
<Q - Michael Gorman>: Got you. And David, if I could turn for a second to the outlet business, obviously with Prime
going on there's been a lot of discussion about consolidation in the space. But looking at if from another perspective,
you guys have had great success with that property type since 2004. How do you think about the potential risk as the
regional mall property type tightens up, that you see more entrance into the outlet center space, more competition for
land, more competition for deals? And potentially lower return hurdles going forward?

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, look. I, I do think you've put on a – you do
make an excellent point. Forget consolidation. There are a number of new entrants in the outlet sector. Obviously, we
all saw the Taubman announcement. We think there are other mall companies out there that are looking for it. And the
product is in favor, and we expect to see more and more developments. Tanger has announced a number of sites. And
they have a large pipeline.
So it is competitive and it will remain really competitive, if not more competitive, given the new entrants and the
possibilities. So – I mean that's a fact of life. We're – retail real estate is wildly competitive. It's competitive on a local
basis all the time. And so we'll just have to – we'll have to deal with it. It doesn't force us to do bad developments at
low returns. But obviously there's going to be a number of new opportunities out there for the retailers to assess and
participate in.
<Q - Michael Gorman>: Great. And then just one last one, maybe for Rick. Can you just talk for a little bit about the
performance of maybe what you would call non-traditional anchors as they've come onto your malls? Maybe some of
the newer leases, it's too soon to tell. But some of the other atypical anchors, how they've been performing, and maybe
even more so, how the wings that they're on have been performing, as well.
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Well, you look in the, in the 8-K. We are accelerating that activity. And our approach is
there's nothing sacred about our hundred acres. And we want to bring as much quality retailing as we can to our
properties. And they have helped drive traffic. They have helped to create additional internal traffic, and to the extent
that they are adding uses that are not otherwise available in the property, it's all very positive. So it's something that we
have been very good at for a long time, and we're going to continue to do it because we think it adds an additional
dimension to our properties.
<Q - Michael Gorman>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
And the question will come from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeffrey Donnelly>: Good morning, guys. David, I think you guys were fairly successful winding down
developments and other activities ahead of this most recent downturn. And has the specter of a slowing economy that
we continue to hear about lead you to think differently about the tactics that you're employing now on leasing, or
leverage or capital allocation?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well certainly, capital allocation and not getting over
your skis, there's no question about it. And I'd say to you that the re-development – I'll call it the transformational
properties that we'd like to kick-start – is all really led by retail demand. So it's not an issue that we're forcing. I think, if
anything, we don't want to force the issue on redevelopment or new development. We want the demand to be there.
And if you can – if the demand is there today, in a still-uncertain environment, that – obviously these centers have been
around a long time and have proven to withstand a lot of different cycles. And it's infill core real estate. So the answer
is, we think we can make some of this work.
And again, not all of it will work. But there's no question about – the last cycle here has taught us a lot, told us that we
had to have access to a lot of different forms of capital. It told us to – it taught us never to over-promise, to have good
relationships with our shareholders and our institutional partners. And I think we've always been – we've done a lot of
M&A stuff over the years but we've always financed it conservatively, and certainly as that develops we certainly
understand that going forward.
<Q - Jeffrey Donnelly>: And since you mentioned the redevelopment and development, on New England do you think
the Merrimack property that you're looking at starting will pencil to the 12 to 14% yields you traditionally get out of the
ground-up development and outlets? And how do you underwrite cannibalizing the other properties, like such as the
Kittery or Wrentham outlets?

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well we think it's its own separate market. And, look,
I think you bring up a good point. The numbers that we're pro forma-ing now are less rents than we would have thought
two years ago. Because I think we have to be more conservative in underwriting it, but we still see it as an 11% return
on cost, and yeah it's lower than what it was, but it's...
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: But we also carry the land for three years.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. And I think Steve's right. The land's been there
for a while and like I said, the demand is there. If the demand weren't there, we wouldn't force the issue.
<Q - Jeff Donnelly>: And just one last question if I could I guess revisit with Quentin's line of questioning on the New
England assets. Is it fair to say, though, that your chance – that there's a chance that you could increase your ownership
stake in some of your New England assets? And I guess as a follow up, can you give us a little color on the Atrium? Do
you think that property ceases to be a mall in the future?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well, there is a possibility we could increase or
ownership in our Mayflower joint venture, so we can plan a lot of different ways but that's certainly a possibility.
Atrium, in our opinion, probably needs to be redeveloped and there's a great opportunity in doing that. We think we just
have other better uses of our energy in terms of what we're trying to accomplish so that's why us and our partners have
decided to put that on the market. Obviously, we're price-sensitive in terms of it is very good real estate, but ultimately
it's less of a retail development and it's more of an alternative use, which is just – not that we couldn't do it, but it's just
not our core competency. We'd rather focus on retail.
<Q - Jeff Donnelly>: Great. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Hey.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Hey.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: A few quick questions. Just going back to the same store NOI. The original guidance was one to
1.5% positive for the total portfolio. You're tracking 2, 3 through the first six months. Where would you peg that now
for the full year?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well can I just say, Nate, before I answer, I just want
to say I saw Dave is retiring. I want, obviously, everybody from our side wish him well. He's been a – I'm going to miss
his barbs.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: He gave me a long lesson before he left on how to do it.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I get that sense, some of that may have rubbed off, but
hopefully we can handle it. But he's been, obviously, a very well thought of analyst and we just want to pass on our
best wishes to Dave, and we will miss his barbs. But I'm sure you'll pick up on that front.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: I'll do my best.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: In any event, your question on comp NOI; look,
there's still uncertainty with it but if we can maintain that I will be very, very pleased given where we originally
projected.

<Q - Nathan Isbee>: So you're not willing to change that yet?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I'm not willing to change it at this point.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Look, I do think that the fact that we've re-affirmed
our guidance, given what I've described about Prime, indicates to you that you know, look we're doing – I'm pleased
with how we're performing at this point.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay, and as you – moving to Prime for a minute, in the papers here a few weeks ago there was a
little blurb about Prime giving notice to the State of Maryland by September 5th they plan to dial back their home
office significantly. Is there anything to read into that date?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: No, other than what I've described to you, you know,
there's nothing more that I can add.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay, and then just going back to the outlets in general, you had mentioned Tanger's pipeline.
They've mentioned looking at 17 sites currently in addition to three that are more live. When you look at the landscape
over the last 15 to 20 years there's been a net decline in outlet centers in the U.S. How much can this country – how
many more centers can this country absorb in your mind as you look at it?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Look the answer is we're going to find out. I do think
there's going to be a number of centers built, so you know, we'll find out. But you know, there are a number of centers
planned. There is very competent developers that are going to do that. Obviously Tanger's successful in their
developments, Taubman's a very good developer, they'll be very successful. There's a number of potential conversions
that are taking place, like what Vornado did with Bergen. Even though I'd really like to know his returns, he won't tell
me, but – no, I'm kidding. I think he's done a very good job on Bergen Town Center. There's a number of malls that are
looking to merge and sell. It's clear that consumer wants value and it's clear that there's going to be a lot more new and
re-developed centers focused on value for the benefit of the consumers and for the benefit of the retailers.
And whether we'll do too much or not remains to be seen. I think our industry always pushes the envelope. I would
think if you saw some of the developments that occurred and that have stopped over the years, over the last couple
years, you could see that we've pushed the envelope. I would not be surprised if we didn't push the envelope here but
there's a lot of new opportunities out there and they're being pursued by very competent developers, both on new and
redeveloped formats for the outlet sector.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: How many sites is Simon/Chelsea looking at today?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Our focus obviously has just been on Prime, but
besides Merrimack we probably have two or three in the U.S. that we're looking at. And I will tell you this, though:
we're very focused on our Asian outlets, Nate. We've been very successful there. We're very excited about a Singapore
market, Malaysia. We're very excited about what's going on in Korea and Japan. Despite all the macro stuff that our
centers are doing, performing very well there. So our ability and brand might grow reasonably well in the outlet side in
the U.S. -- outside the U.S. And I will mention – Rick's pointing to me, I do think it's important to note that we're also
expanding a few of our outlet centers here in the U.S, and that will also happen, I think, in our industry.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: All right. Thanks.

<Q - Carol Kemple>: What is the reason for that? Is that they feel better capital-wise? Or is that something the FTC is
wanting them to do?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I really can't add more, Carol, than I've already told
you.
<Q - Carol Kemple>: Okay. Can you add or can you say if it's going to change the purchase price?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: There has been a modification to the transaction, and
you know, I can say that the capital that Prime would receive, as part of the transaction will allow Prime to go develop,
and I guess I should have mentioned this in Nate's call or question. It will allow them to go develop their deal in
Livermore and Grand Prairie, and that's their intention to do so.
<Q - Carol Kemple>: Okay. In the quarter, were the leasing spreads positive, both the malls and the outlet centers? Or
just the outlet centers?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We put those statistics together. Obviously the malls
have a significant impact on the results, given that they're in the 75, 80% range of our domestic NOI in that number.
But we don't break that out now, Carol.
<Q - Carol Kemple>: Okay. I knew you didn't break it out percentage, but I didn't know if you could comment in
general. Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.

And the next question will come from the line of Ben Yang, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. I'm just curious how much of the occupancy gain was attributable to
you converting your month-to-month tenants into longer term deals, because it looks like you have about 200 fewer
temp tenants compared to last quarter. I mean, did you just convert up to this 900,000 square feet into longer term
deals? Or did these guys just end up closing their stores?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Interestingly, for the most part, we have been
transitioning to more national tenants as opposed to the month-to-month. And a lot of times, the month-to-month is
because we don't want to go longer term because we want to have a room split. We want to combine rooms for a
different tenant that will pay more rent. So this was not really a process of a lot of month-to-month conversions.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Hey, Ben, this is Steve. I would just add one more thing. Rick and David talked a lot on our
calls over the last four or five quarters about consciously slowing down the leasing activity because of the difficulty in
the environment, so that month-to-month number was, to some degree, the result of a lease expiring where we chose,
and the tenant chose, not to, a year ago or nine months ago, enter into a permanent deal. We are now, if you will,
addressing that given the recovery in the U.S.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: And Steve's right. I mean I don't know what the exact
number is, but certainly some of those month-to-months have gone to longer-term leases.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: That sounds like most of them ended up just closing their stores and maybe just...

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I mean there's...
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Is that fair?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We suffered a lot of store closings, that's for
sure.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. And then you mentioned some actually converting to permanent leases. When you do
make those conversions, does that number show up in your re-leasing spread?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: It does. If a temporary tenant converts to a permanent
deal, then we treat it as a new lease, that's correct.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. So this – okay, great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Ben.

And the next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Yeah, hi. A few quick ones here. On the development JVs in France, can you give us a sense
as to how much Simon capital could potentially go into that? And over what timeframe it will begin to play out?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: We're only laughing because the drilling for answers
is a long, frustrating process. Mike, we don't – it's right now to pursue the development is not going to be a lot of
money for us. And as an example the Toulouse development itself could be north of a couple hundred million euros.
But again it's – the timing and the approvals is really uncertain, so I would hate to venture, but for us to keep our
optionality alive is – will be not a very big number.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay. So it's longer term stuff and...
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. It is. I mean the biggest one of which is on the
potential front burner is the development in Toulouse that all of us are – Unibail, us, as well as Ivanhoe Cambridge are
excited about pursuing, but again that needs to go a through a certain process.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Don't ask me to explain it.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: No problem. And few quick ones for Steve. Steve, going back to the TI question, I previously
had down, I was looking through notes in 2010 maybe 75 million on the low end, 100 million on the high end. I mean
what's the full year expectation now for TIs?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Michael, I mean we've had an increase in velocity, so I wouldn't necessarily expect it to be 2x
of what it was through the first six months, but I think it'll clearly be at that $100 million or a little bit more range.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay.
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: And I think that's just an increase in the leasing velocity.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay. And then when we look at debt maturities over the next year or so, a lot less bonds
maturing in 2011 than we saw in '10 and '09. How should we think or you thinking differently about what a more
normalized cash position is?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Well that's a very good question. The answer is yeah.
Eventually we're going to have kind of a normalized number. I can't – it would be hard for me to pinpoint exactly today

what that is, as we still try to sort through the uncertain economic environment. But today we're over capitalized, not
wildly over capitalized but we've reduced our debt by $2 billion. We're generating cash flow – positive cash flow. Our
dividend is obviously very safe and sound. So at the end of day we want to kind of just still be a little more thoughtful,
a little more cautious as to where the economic environment comes out. Obviously there's the deflation specter out
there. There's a lot to weigh into that, that we've got to continue to be just really extra conservative in our thought
process for the time being.
<Q - Michael Mueller>: Okay. That should be it. Thanks.

And the next question will come from the line of David Wigginton, Macquarie.
<Q - Dave Wigginton>: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Just had a
couple of quick follow ups on lease term fees in the quarter. It kind of spiked up in the quarter. I wasn't sure if that was
a result of the jewelry store closings you had mentioned or if there was something else that had played into that.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: There was a couple of those and then other – we don't
like to name the tenants – but there were a couple of deals that were store closings that were negotiated, and again that's
not in our comparable NOI numbers, but I'd just prefer not to name the tenants. There was one aspect of a jewelry
retailer that exited the business, so that did spike up because of that.
<Q - Dave Wigginton>: Okay. So then just staying with the jewelers, where would you say we are in the shakeout
process among operators at this point of the cycle or what not? Have we worked our way through the majority of
jewelers that need to just shut down and go out of business, or are there more to come?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I would think that a lot has taken place, so I think
we're past for a lot of that, but there's still probably excess capacity in the jewelry retail space overall. So it's like the
restaurants. In a sense, the restaurants get a demand of, I don't know; close 1% of the restaurant space in America. So I
still think there's probably a little bit more to go, but I would say we've gone through a lot of it.
<Q - Dave Wigginton>: I recognize the split among store closings is probably pretty evenly across your portfolio, but
have you noticed any excessive closings say in one segment of your portfolio versus another, maybe like at the higher
end or lower end?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: Not really. I mean I think the regional economies
have a lot of impact, not on – not necessarily the – a particular property size.
<Q - Dave Wigginton>: Okay. And then just last question, and this was touched on a little bit earlier, but with respect
to sales increases leading to rent increases, historically what has been the timeline that you've observed in your
portfolio, if anything? Is it different from what you would expect to see in general in a regular mall portfolio? And do
you feel like you are able to capture pricing power quicker than maybe most mall operators?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: No. I think we're no different than – there's a lag, and
there's also a certain level of certainty that the retailer wants as they see their sales increase. I mean they don't – if they
have a good quarter it doesn't necessarily mean – you know, their open to buys might increase but they're still going to
be pretty conservative on the rent to sales ratio. So there's a lag and it's a macro-impact and we're no better than
anybody else in that category in terms of being able to accelerate that gap.
<Q - Dave Wigginton>: Okay. I mean, is it just a matter of them seeing several quarters, consecutive quarters of sales
increases that gets them going?

<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's also very specific on the retailer and the
position that they're in and what they're trying to do. Are they trying to gain market share? Are they trying to penetrate
a regional market further? So there's a lot that goes into it, but generally the retailers are taking a reasonably
conservative stance and rightfully so, just like we are in a lot of respects.

And we have a question from the line of Rich Moore, RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Hello, guys. On the dividend, David, where do you guys stand on that? It seems to me that
you're at some sort of a minimum payout ratio at this point and you've got to raise the dividend. Does that sound right?
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: You're warm.
<Q - Richard Moore>: So not yet, but getting there.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: You're warm. Yeah, look. I think we're going to have
to assess – obviously, our taxable income is going to be affected by the Simon Ivanhoe sale, so we have to factor that in
and obviously we're going to spend the next four or five months doing that, but in addition to that, Rich, I think as we
look at it, '11, our taxable income, there's a lot of stuff that is going on with us in terms of our taxable income. We had
the share issuance, so we had more shares outstanding. We had the taxable write-off associated with the bond premium
that we paid. Assuming all of that kind of just normalized – we spent this year normalizing all of that, then I look at '11
and again, it's – obviously we're projecting an economic environment, but '11, but let's assume it's consistent with what
we have, I mean we are, I would venture to say, at the bare, bare minimum of what we need to pay given where we are
today. So that will definitely have to be addressed on the more permanent basis in '11, as a lot of the extraordinary
events of the last year have played themselves out.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then, Steve, on the straight line ran item, that seemed to
jump pretty high in the quarter. Is there anything special in there? And then does it go back down from here?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Nothing really special, Rich. And again, we talked about leasing the lock, and it being higher.
That tends to be driven by the square footage of deals you're doing.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay. Got you. And then same kind of thing on the preferred dividends for IA. That was
actually negative. I assume that's some sort of accounting treatment for the retirement of the IA, is that right?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Yeah. It's just a clean up and a true up for the redemption of the IA that we did in the first
quarter.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay, great. And then on the recoveries, the recovery ratio, that was also a bit higher than
usual. Is that going to continue, you think?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: Well, I mean – listen, we're an environment now, Rich, where we're 80% converted to fixed
TM. Most of those have contractual annual increases in the recovery. So to the extent that we're able to manage our
expenses at a rate below that, you should see the recovery continuing to get better.
<Q - Richard Moore>: Okay, excellent. And then the last thing, Rick, the list of retailers that are hot today, or that are
getting hotter in the second quarter, have you got that?
<A - Richard Sokolov>: Well, we always hesitate to do that because everybody else then starts calling them. But we
are doing deals in '10. PF Fiero was rolling out, Sperry and Stride Rite from Collective Brand, Michael Kors, Rue 21,
Francesca. We're doing Microsoft deals. We're doing Pandora deals, Lego, Crazy 8, with Gymboree and as David –

advantage of that.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: And, and on the box side, Rich, look, Target, Kohl's, I

We have a question from the line of Ian Weissman, ISI.
<Q - Ian Weissman>: Yes. Just a housekeeping question for Steve. The $13 million of transaction costs that you had
this quarter, is that related to Prime? And if so, can we expect similar expenses for the balance of the year?
<A - Stephen Sterrett>: No. It's not just Prime, Ian. It's a combination of all – multiple transactions that we were
working on, some of which will occur, some of which didn't occur.
<A - David E. Simon, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer>: I mean, I said, Ian, earlier that we'll continue to have
Prime expenses in the third quarter but that's a higher run rate, and then obviously upon that transaction closing as we
expect that, that number ought to obviously come down.
<Q - Ian Weissman>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - Steve Sterrett>: Okay. Thank you.
