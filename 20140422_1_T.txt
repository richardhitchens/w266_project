MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T First Quarter Earnings Release 2014. At
this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there'll be an opportunity for your questions, and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'll now turn the conference over to Susan Johnson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It's great to have you with us today. I'm Susan Johnson,
head of investor relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.
John will provide an overview with perspective on the quarter; then we'll follow up with questions and answers. Let me
remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's
www.att.com/investor.relations.
Now, before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide
three. We had our best consolidated revenue growth in more than two years, up 3.6%, driven by strong wireless growth,
our best consumer wireline growth since the introduction of U-verse in 2006, and rapid growth in Strategic Business
Services.
EPS for the quarter was $0.71 when adjusting for some transactional expense associated with the Leap acquisition.
When compared on an adjusted basis, that's up nearly 11% over last year's first quarter. Consolidated margins were up
year-over-year due to wireless margin expansion offsetting wireline pressure.
Cash flow started the year strong. In fact, cash from operating activities for the quarter was the highest it's been since
2007, $8.8 billion. Our solid cash flow allowed us to make significant investments in Project VIP and the growth
drivers of our business. Capital spending was $5.8 billion, and that gave us free cash flow of $3.0 billion for the

quarter. We also continue to be opportunistic in buying back shares as part of our repurchase program. In the first
quarter, we bought back about 37 million shares for $1.2 billion.
Now, with that overview, I'll turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?
John J. Stephens
Thanks, Susan, and hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today and for your interest in AT&T. Before I get to our
operational highlights, let me take a moment and give you a broader view of our business strategy, beginning with slide
three.
As you know, we have been working very deliberately on a multiyear plan to transform our business. In the first
quarter, we really began to see the benefits of this transformation effort. You've seen us transform our networks from
legacy services to an all-IP platform and a best-in-class network. Project VIP is accelerating that transformation
through our LTE deployment, U-verse expansion, and fiber build to businesses.
We also reached a significant milestone in the quarter with our Domain 2.0 initiative. We named two leading
companies, Amdocs and Juniper Networks, as primary vendors that will help us achieve our vision of a user-defined
network cloud, a modern cloud-based architecture.
We also made significant strides in transforming the wireless customer value proposition. This transformation began
with the move from feature phones to smartphones. These smartphones soon became the remote control of our lives
and drove significant data usage. In recent years, we began the transition to usage-based pricing and away from device
subsidies. In the first quarter, we accelerated that transformation, thanks to the transparency and simplicity of our
Mobile Share and Next plans.
At the same time, we transformed our wireline business from legacy services, such as DSL, to IP networks and IP
services. In the first quarter, this transformation helped drive our strongest consumer wireline growth in years, and in
business, our Strategic Business Services continued its steady growth.
And our transformation is not slowing down. Yesterday, you saw us announce plans to strategically target 21 new
markets to expand our ultra-fast fiber networks to deliver U-verse with GigaPower. Moves such as this are one more
indicator of our ongoing transformation.
Behind all this is the strength of our balance sheet. Our strong cash from operations allows us to return substantial
value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks while still having the ability to invest in our future. Now
let's get to our highlights for the quarter, which begin on slide five.
We had an impressive start to the year. Let me begin with a quick overview of the quarter. We made major moves in
wireless that are reshaping the way we do business. We completed our Leap transaction and have begun the integration
process. This will accelerate our prepaid initiative as we launch the new Cricket brand in the second quarter.
And we have reached a critical point in our wireline business, where we can clearly see that our Project VIP plans are
working and transforming the business. These efforts resulted in our strongest consolidated revenue growth in more
than two years while also driving double-digit adjusted EPS gains. And we did this while still dealing with a very weak
economy.
To start, wireless execution was superb in the quarter. We had our best postpaid net-add first quarter in five years, and
revenue growth was strong. We also made massive strides in changing the subsidy model, giving customers greater
choice and a more transparent way of choosing their wireless equipment and service plan.
AT&T Next take rates were strong, as more and more customers choose the installment plan method of purchasing
handsets. And the shift to Mobile Share plans was nothing short of incredible. The number of new Mobile Share
accounts and connections tripled year-over-year, with nearly half of our accounts now on 10-gigabyte-or-larger plans.

At the same time, U-verse continued its steady march of transforming our wireline business. In fact, we had our best
consumer wireline revenue growth since the introduction of U-verse about eight years ago. And the outlook for U-verse
continues to be solid as we expand the U-verse footprint and look to increase penetration. The transformation also
continues in business wireline. Strategic Business Services revenues were up more than 16% in the quarter, so a very
solid start with excellent momentum.
Now let me provide more details, starting with our wireless business on slide six. Perhaps the biggest story in the
quarter was the strong growth in total and postpaid subscribers. We added more than 600,000 postpaid subscribers in
the quarter, with smartphones and tablets leading the way. That's more than twice as many as a year ago and the best
first quarter in five years. Overall, we had more than 1 million net adds in the quarter, as we showed year-over-year
improvement in every customer category.
In prepaid, we continue to make progress in adding smartphone subscribers. In the first quarter alone, we added
255,000 prepaid smartphone subscribers to our network. This helped drive year-over-year prepaid revenue growth.
Also during the quarter, we took a major step in transforming prepaid with the close of our Leap transaction, adding 4.5
million prepaid customers, of which nearly 70% are using smartphones. We're really excited about this new
opportunity.
Churn continues to be a solid story for us. Total churn was stable for the quarter, with postpaid churn down sequentially
and up slightly year-over-year. That's a great achievement in what is definitely a noisy competitive environment. We
believe Mobile Share will have a positive long-term impact on churn. In fact, postpaid churn got progressively better
throughout the quarter. As the transition of our customer base to usage-based plans accelerates, so does the shifting of
our handset sales to AT&T Next. Those details, as well as revenue breakouts, are on slide seven.
The transformation of our customer base can be clearly seen this quarter. The combination of AT&T Next and Mobile
Share Value plans has added a level of transparency in the smartphone buying model that customers haven't seen
before. This new model lets customers choose what plan best suits their needs, and many customers have been
choosing to move off the subsidy model for simpler pricing, and for a large number of our customers, that means
AT&T Next. More than 40% of smartphone gross adds and upgrades in the quarter were on AT&T Next. That's up
from 15% in the fourth quarter.
The shift away from the subsidy model has major implications. First, revenue shift to equipment from service as
customers sign up for the next contracts. You see that in our strong equipment growth in the quarter, with slower
service revenue growth. Second, AT&T Next accelerates the move to LTE-capable devices. About 57% of smartphones
on our network are LTE-capable, providing a superior customer experience on a best-in-class network. It also means
they're on our most efficient network.
And, third, we see this as an investment in our high-quality customer base and in customer choice. It peels back the
layers of the subsidy model and allows customers to make clear choices. It also helps build a stronger bond with our
postpaid base in a noisy, competitive environment, and we believe we are well-positioned to use working capital in this
way. With our strong balance sheet, we believe we can do this prudently and effectively.
Another important aspect of Next is that these are our highest-credit-quality customers. That's who Next was designed
for, and that's who is selecting Next. I talked earlier about our transformation. It leads us to a different set of metrics
than what we had used in the past. Next and the shift to equipment revenue changes the way we look at ARPU.
Phone-only ARPU, a metric we have shared for some time and which includes only service revenue, increased by 0.4%
in the quarter. However, phone-only ARPU plus Next monthly billings increased by 2% year-over-year. This move to
Mobile Share plans in the quarter was incredible. More detail is on slide eight.
During the quarter we introduced several new Mobile Share Value pricing plans for both families and individuals to
help customers move off the subsidy model. First, we introduced new attractive pricing for the 10-gig-or-larger plans
for customers who purchase a phone with AT&T Next or bring their own device. Second, we rolled out similar value
pricing for 1-gigabyte and 2-gigabyte plans. At the same time, we made it easier for subscribers to move off the
traditional subsidy model by allowing them to take advantage of these attractive new Mobile Share value pricing

options in advance of upgrading to Next. We see this as another investment in our customer base.
The cumulative impact of these changes was significant. First, the number of Mobile Share accounts and connections
rose sharply in the quarter, increasing by more than 50% since year-end and tripling year-over-year. Second, there was
a major migration of subscribers to Mobile Share plans of 10 gigs or higher. Customers bought up. More than
two-thirds of Mobile Share account activity went to gigabytes-or-higher plans in the quarter, driving overall penetration
to almost 50%. That's up from just 27% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
And, third, these new offerings prompted about 1 million postpaid subscribers who were on unlimited plans to elect to
shift to Mobile Share pricing. This helped drive the overall number of smartphone subscribers on tiered data pricing to
81%. That's a full six-percent-point increase in just one quarter. At the same time, we added more than 1 million new
postpaid smartphone customers. That includes customers who are staying with us and upgrading from feature phones.
Our postpaid smartphone sales continue to run in the 90%-plus range, and our total postpaid smartphone base is at
78%.
Now let's look at margins on slide nine. In the first quarter, wireless EBITDA service margins were 45.4%. That's a
220-basis-point increase from year-ago levels, even though we had a significant increase in postpaid gross adds
year-over-year. The margin expansion was driven by several factors, such as the move to the 24-month upgrades,
network efficiencies, and operational improvements. Next also had a positive impact on margins.
All of these activities more than offset the pressures we saw in the quarter: costs of strong net adds, both postpaid and
total customer growth; additional promotional activity relating to our transformation; additional customer care costs
related to Mobile Share and Next; and increased startup investments in prepaid and Digital Life.
Our actions to improve margins also helped ease the pressure from about 1.1 million accelerated smartphone upgrades
that occurred in the quarter. These are customers who took advantage of new pricing and moved to Mobile Share plans
and upgraded early. Without this boost, Next take rates would have been closer to 35%. In total, we had 2.9 million
AT&T Next sales in the quarter. And now, more than a quarter of our postpaid smartphone base is on a Mobile Share
Value non-subsidy pricing and is no longer tied to the subsidy model. Another margin comparison was total wireless
EBITDA margin. That was stable year-over-year even with all the growth and investment activities we had underway
in the quarter.
There was a lot of moving pieces in our wireless business last quarter – the huge shift to Mobile Share plans, the
tremendous popularity of AT&T Next, the increase in total and postpaid net adds, and the transition away from the
subsidy model – but it all comes down to customer choice. We are making the buying process as open and transparent
as possible and then letting customers manage the process. We believe this is not only best for our customers but best
for our shareholders. Now let me turn to our wireline story, starting on slide 10.
The wireline story continues to be one of transformation. That transformation began first in consumer when we
introduced U-verse. Since that time, we have flipped the revenue model. What once was a declining revenue stream
had a 4.3% growth in the first quarter, accelerating from 2% a year ago. Total U-verse revenues are now a nearly $14
billion annualized revenue stream, and still growing at almost 30%, and U-verse now represents almost 60% of
consumer revenues.
You also see the transformation in our broadband results. More than two-thirds of our total broadband base, or about 11
million subscribers, are now on U-verse broadband, our highest-speed and highest-quality product. These gains drove
total positive broadband net adds in the quarter, and we are positioned to continue that growth as our U-verse footprint
expands and penetration improves. It also helped drive total broadband ARPU, which was up 9% the quarter.
U-verse TV continues to be popular, as we added more than 200,000 subscribers. Churn continues to be low, and
penetration is growing. And U-verse Voice, our voice-over-IP product, just passed 4 million customers. We also
announced an important initiative in the over-the-top space with The Chernin Group. We're excited about the new
venture and believe the combination of our two skill sets can create something truly impressive. We hope to start
rolling out an offering later this year. Now let's move to business wireline, which is on slide 11.

While wireline consumer was the first out of the gates with its move to IP, wireline business started the process a little
later, but you can still see the transformation going on there as well. The clearest way to see it is in the steady,
consistent growth of Strategic Business Services. These are services such as VPN, Ethernet hosting, and other
advanced IP services, and those services now make up more than 26% of total business wireline revenue, and growth is
up more than 16% year-over-year.
Overall, revenues were down year-over-year, in line with the slow economy and recent trends, but there are positive
signs. In Enterprise, our global business services, we actually showed slight service revenue growth year-over-year.
Given recent headwinds, that is seen as very positive. The biggest drag on the quarter was wholesale. It was challenged
by network grooming, as wireless carriers aggressively decommissioned legacy circuits.
However, if you look at our retail business by itself, Enterprise and small and medium-size businesses, total revenue
was down only slightly in the quarter. And when you look at what business customers pay us for their total AT&T bill,
both wireline and wireless, total retail revenue actually grew year-over-year. We expect our transformation to IP will
continue to make headway in the business space. At the same time, we continue to look for signs that the economy will
improve and provide us with additional lift. Now let's look at consolidated wireline margins on slide 12.
You see the impact from our transformation on these consolidated margins. For the quarter, the consolidated margin
was 19.3%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Wireless margin improvement helped offset wireline pressure from
trailing expenses tied to Project VIP. Wireline margins were down from a year ago but essentially flat with fourth
quarter. Declines in legacy services and content and retransmission price increases pressured our results, but this
pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues and gains in Strategic Business Services.
At the same time, Project Agile is gaining steam. Project Agile is our new initiative that is improving efficiency in how
the company organizes and operates to deliver best-in class customer experience as an all-IP, all-mobile, and all-cloud
services company. We are taking our initial cost savings from Agile and reinvesting in the project. We expect run-rate
savings in the $3 billion range by 2017. Now let's move to cash flows. Our summary is on slide 13.
Our ability to generate cash continues to be strong. In the first quarter, cash from operations totaled $8.8 billion, or
about $1.70 a share. That's the highest cash from ops in seven years, and almost four times our quarterly dividend
commitment. Capital expenditures were $5.8 billion, as we took these strong cash flows and invested in Project VIP.
And free cash flow before dividends was $3 billion, on track with our full-year guidance, even as AT&T Next changes
the subsidy model.
In terms of uses of cash, dividend payments for the quarter totaled about $2.4 billion, and we repurchased about 37
million shares for another $1.2 billion. Our board of directors has also approved a fourth 300 million share buyback, as
we continue to be opportunistic in buying back shares. Since we began buying back shares about two years ago, we
have bought back about 13% of the outstanding shares of the company and saved more than $1 billion in cash from
eased dividend requirements.
We also continue to look for opportunities to monetize some of our assets. This included more than $400 million in
sales of América Móvil shares and real estate in the first quarter. We continue to move forward with our plans to sell
our Connecticut wireline properties to Frontier for $2 billion, and we expect that transaction to close by the end of the
year. During the first quarter, we also closed our Leap acquisition. A high-level look at that strategy and integration of
Leap assets is on slide 14.
First and foremost, the acquisition of Leap has clear and immediate benefits in value creation. The value of the
spectrum we received was significant, about $3 billion in value. At the same time, we will be able to get significant
value from Leap's $3 billion tax net operating loss and turn that into real cash for shareholders.
And, finally, we immediately refinanced about 90% of Leap's debt, which will save us $500 million in interest expense
over just the remaining term of that debt. When you add these synergies together, the value of just these items was
greater than the total purchase price of Leap.

From a strategic perspective, the acquisition of the Cricket brand accelerates our move into the prepaid space. We plan
to launch the new Cricket brand in the second quarter, combining with AT&T's existing prepaid operations to create the
new Cricket with a national presence and more than 3,000 distribution points across the country. The focus will be on
simple plans with affordable devices, helping customers take advantage of the smart new choice in no-contract
wireless. And all of this is on a best-in-class network.
We are also integrating Leap customers and its network. The customer transition is expected to take about 18 months,
as we move customers off of the outdated CDMA network onto AT&T's GSM network. We will start deploying
unutilized spectrum immediately, continuing our efforts into 2015. Integration costs are expected to be about $1.2
billion over a two-year period, with about half of that expected in 2014.
CapEx will be in the $1 billion range, but significantly offset by efficiencies with other wireless build plans, and with
the majority of the spend targeted in 2015. Leap operational pressure will drive $0.05 of dilution in EPS this year, with
most of it in the second half of 2014. We're very excited about this new growth opportunity and expect it to really
kick-start our new prepaid strategy. We're also updating our outlook for the full year after the Leap acquisition. Those
details are on slide 15.
We now expect consolidated revenue growth of 4% or greater for the year as we fold in Leap and see continued
strength in wireless and wireline consumer. We continue to expect stable consolidated margins, which includes Leap
operational pressure. And we expect EPS growth in the mid-single-digits even with the dilution from the Leap
operations and continued investment in growth initiatives.
We still expect capital spending to be in the $21 billion range that we gave you in January, with most of Leap's
integration impact in 2015. We also expect free cash flow in the $11 billion range. That's even with expected strong
Next sales and Leap costs. And you can expect us to continue to invest in our business transformation and growth
opportunities.
And now I'll turn it back to Susan for a quick summary of the quarter, and then we can get to your questions.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, John. Our recap of a very solid quarter is on slide 16. We definitely saw the impact of our business
transformation in the first quarter. Revenue growth was strong. That includes the best consolidated revenue growth in
more than two years and the strongest consumer revenue growth since we launched U-verse. That helped drive
double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the quarter.
Wireless was led by the best first-quarter postpaid growth we've seen in five years. And AT&T Next and Mobile Share
are transforming the customer value proposition, and put a large dent in the subsidy model while accelerating the
growth of larger tiered data plans. In wireline, we are seeing the impact of our investments in IP. U-verse continued its
robust growth, and business continues to transform with growth in Strategic Business Services.
I will now close out the call with a quick review of our Safe Harbor statement, and then we are going to open it up for
question and answers. Our Safe Harbor statement is shown on slide 2. This presentation and the comments we're going
through may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are in
our SEC filings and on AT&T's website.
And now, Kathy, let's go ahead, and we'll open up the call to take your questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead,
please.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. John, if we could start with the guidance revision, and
in particular the Next impact, can you just talk about the context of where you are in the middle of April versus where
you were in January when you set the original guidance? Sounds like Next is gaining more momentum than you
expected, so if you can give color around this 35%, 40%, are you expecting that to be 50% next quarter, 60% in the
second half? Some color around what you expect and what we should think about there and how that's changed over
three months. Maybe – you gave the monthly take rates last quarter. You didn't do that this quarter. And then if you
could just touch briefly on Europe, any update to the commentary around perhaps the window closing there. Thank
you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Simon. Thanks for your question. First and foremost, with regard to Europe, I'll
stand by what we've said before. For all the same reasons we said before, the window is closing. But I will say this: as
you can see from these results, and as Randall and I and others have said before, we are focused here on this market,
and you can see why from the success that we've had in this first quarter, see why we have that focus here in the United
States. And it remains there.
With regard to the Next impact from an adoption standpoint, what we wanted to make sure everyone was aware of that
we made a decision in February to allow customers to early-adopt or early-upgrade under Next, and that drove about
1.1 million early adoptions. That drove some margin pressure, quite frankly, in the first quarter. We were able to
overcome it, but those early adoptions did drive some pressure. So the real normal kind of run rate for the group of
customers that were qualified under a normal 24-month process ended up being about 1.8 million, and that's about
35%. So we did grow from that December 20%, or the fourth quarter overall 15%, up to 35%, and we will see how it
goes forward.
I wouldn't expect that same acceleration from the 15% to more than 40% because of that early adoption, and quite
frankly, because of the early adoption, we may have some impact on the customers during the last three quarters of the
year because they moved their adoptions up and caused us that margin pressure in the first quarter. But we are very
pleased with the take rates, customers seem to like it, and we are going to expand some of the channels we have the
sales in, so I do believe that the 35% is going to become a new standard. We may do better than that; we'll see how it
goes as we move forward. We're not giving a specific prediction.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks. Okay. And so there has been a little bit of a change in your expectations, I guess,
versus when you set guidance originally, because I guess you're only changing revenues at this point, and I guess
there's some puts and takes on the other lines?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, so what we're doing on revenues is really off the strength of consumer wireline, what
we saw there – and, quite frankly, off the strength of wireless. As much as Next certainly will have an impact, but
really it was much more about postpaid net adds and total net adds, and as we mentioned earlier, what we've seen in
churn and this improving churn picture that we've seen throughout the quarter giving us optimism about the full year
and an ability to raise that guidance to 4% or greater. But that's what's driving the change in guidance.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Hey, guys. Thanks. John, just thinking about the higher Next uptake, I think, than what
was initially anticipated, and outpacing the impact on the cash flow, obviously, you're not changing your guidance for
that. But are there anticipated levers that you're thinking about pulling there, and is VIP factoring part of that thought

process? And then, thinking about wireline margins, what do we think about the puts and takes there as far as the
ability to increase margin? Does Agile have a positive impact? And thinking about U-verse margins overall, are they
starting to contribute in a more meaningful way?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks for the questions, Mike. Let's make sure I knock them all off here, if you will. First
and foremost, with margins in wireline, with where we're at in our VIP build process, we're going to continue to see
some investments in the customers and the build through 2015. So while we are working very, very hard to improve
margins, as we did sequentially in the first quarter here, we expect real margin – or larger margin improvements in
2016 and forward in wireline. So that's the first point. Agile is definitely generating savings, and we're optimistic about
its impact, but right now, at this time, we're choosing to reinvest the savings wherever we can in a prudent manner to
accelerate the overall growth of the company.
Third, with regard to free cash flow, the real thought process on not changing guidance has a couple of different
factors. One, when we came down with the final Leap business plan, we are focused on getting the unutilized spectrum
into service right away. We have some commitments on a 90-day and a 12-month process. Quite frankly, putting that
spectrum to use, the team's really good at it. They're already well underway on it, but it is not a capital-intensive. It's
adding it to our already existing network. The big piece, the capital, the transformation of the CDMA network to our
GSM network, is going to really have a capital pressure in 2015. So that's the first point.
The second point is our working capital, as evidenced by our cash from operations of $8.8 billion, our working capital
was very strong, and we have efforts across the board – receivables, payables, inventory management, a number of
items. The success the overall team showed at being able to achieve good cash management gives us the confidence to
keep free cash flow guidance at the same level, even with these increasing Next sales, so really that's where that's
going.
With regard to your specific question on financing the VIP, we have a very active process in evaluating that, and we
have not done that. We haven't committed to do that. It all comes down to cost, to whether we can do it in a reasonable
manner from a cost perspective. We're optimistic about the ability to do that, and we are well down the road in talking
to really qualified parties who would be interested in participating with us, but we haven't made that decision yet.
<Q - Mike L. McCormack>: Great. Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Go ahead please.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. John, can you just give us a little more detail on the accelerated upgrades that
you saw in the quarter? Is that going to continue into the second quarter? And if possible – I could probably figure it
out, but if you could quantify the impact on margins? And then as it relates to service revenue growth, we saw a
deceleration there, but then stronger customer adds than we thought. How should we expect that to trend through the
year? It was a big decrease quarter to quarter. Is that going to continue, or is this a new level – or how do those two
variables work out? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: All right, let me make sure I get things knocked out here for you, John. First of all, the 1.1
million, let me give you this impression – or this explanation. First and foremost, with an average unit costing about
$600, those that even are sold on Next would cause us to recognize $600 of equipment expense. On the revenue side,
we would start by measuring those receivables, which will be $600 million, and then basically taking two charges
against those: one for an interest charge for the receivable being payable over 20 months or 26 months, but secondly,
for the forgiveness of the remaining receivables when the phone is traded in.
And while we're not giving specific numbers, I will tell you we have gone model by model and evaluated the trade-in
value, and we take into account all kinds of variables – whether we sold the model the day it was launched, whether we

sold the model six months or eight months after launch, so on and so forth, how other related models have been selling
in the used market, whether there's an overseas market, we take all this into account.
Essentially, though, I can give you this kind of guidance. On the day we issue it, you could have a write-down on the
revenues from the handset from anywhere from 0% to 25%, depending upon the different facts and circumstances. I'll
just give you that as the way to think about it. If you then take that differential, those discounts on interest and those
discounts on the trade-in value, and compare how much of a loss that generates per unit, it'll give you the idea of the
pressure we faced in the first quarter from those accelerated units.
Secondly, I can't give you specific guidance on how that continued upgrade opportunity will impact us in the second,
third, and fourth quarter. The same program is out there. It's the available number of people who take advantage of it
has shrunk, for two reasons: one, because the 1.1 million customers already took it; and two, because we've expanded
time, and some of the people that were covered by it now would have qualified anyway. And so it will work itself out. I
would suggest to you, though, the strongest piece of it may have already occurred just because it was so successful in
the first quarter.
With regard to customer adds, John, we're not giving specific guidance on that. I will tell you we were very pleased that
the strength of the customer adds improved throughout the quarter and that churn improved throughout the quarter. So
we believe that this combination of Mobile Share, of Next, of – quite frankly – transparency in pricing and, if you will,
upfront honesty with customers is working, and we believe that that's going to position us well in this, what I call, noisy
competitive environment. So we're optimistic about going forward with it, but we're not giving any specific guidance.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We have a question from Joseph Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. John, given the growth you're seeing in data,
now with the plan to sell prepaid more aggressively on the LTE network, how comfortable are you with your spectrum
position? And we've seen the comments about potentially reevaluating your participation in the broadcast auctions.
How do you view your need for low-band versus mid-band spectrum?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Good question, Joe. Let me first be clear on something with regard to the broadcast
spectrums. We would like to participate at the auction. We are and have been working with the commission to establish
auction rules that will certainly promote a good result for AT&T, but will also promote a successful result for the
auction. So we are interested in participating. With that being said, I will tell you I'm very pleased. I'm very pleased we
got the Leap transaction done, and that we're able to work through with the FCC and the DoJ to get that completed.
The unutilized spectrum that we have available to us immediately in over 200 markets that our team is putting into
service right now, is actively getting that done, is really helping us and will help us in quality service and in dealing
with the network demands This acceleration through Next and these early upgrades to LTE devices is really helping us
with our network, because our LTE network is our most efficient, so we're moving a lot of customers onto that, and
that's another way we're dealing with our issues. If you will, though, the first and foremost is we feel pretty good with
our spectrum position right now. We feel like we've positioned ourselves well with the transactions and the spectrum
deals we've done over the last few years, and we're optimistic about it. But, as with anybody, we're always looking to
continue to have that available.
Last question I think you had, Joe, was on prepaid, and quite frankly, that's a great opportunity for us, particularly with
the new Cricket brand, that – if you will – platform, that distribution, that customer segment that we haven't necessarily
focused on in the past. Second, we believe the network differentiation will provide a real opportunity there. The third,
as we mentioned, 70% of the new Cricket customers use smartphones. So, over the next 18 months, when we have to

transition them to GSM smartphones, it'll be really – it could be very opportunistic for us if we're able to figure out a
way to take our Next program trade-ins and provide those kind of quality handsets to our prepaid customers, not only
alleviate the cost, but give them a real quality experience. So we're optimistic about all of it. We've got a lot to do, got a
lot of work ahead of us, but we're optimistic about it.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, first, a really quick follow-up. I wanted to make sure that I
understood. When you talk about the revenue guidance increase, does that include the acquisition of Leap? Is that in
there?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, it does.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. And that's about, call it, 100 basis points or a little more? Is that fair?
<A - John J. Stephens>: 100 basis points, that's a fair number, yes.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Okay. And then I guess, second question, as you think about the Next plan and making it
transparent for customers on what the handsets cost, are you seeing a different selection of handsets for Next customers
versus subsidized customers when they walk in and they see what handsets really go for?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Phil, I think it's a little early for us to make any conclusions on that. I say that in suggesting
that I don't know that we've seen anything that is really substantially different, so I wouldn't want to leave you with the
impression that we have and we're not sharing it. It just hasn't happened yet. But it is early in the process. I will tell
you, as much as anything, it's been a great process for us. When we started that trade-in program last year, about the
middle of last year, and learned about how the trade-in process could work and how to utilize it, and then taking those
skills for us through, quite frankly, the first quarter, we're continuing to learn and continuing to refine the process. But I
can't tell you we've seen a dramatic change in purchasing activity.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: And just to follow up there, what is the reverse logistics happening in that trade-in program?
What are you doing with the phones now, and how do you expect to deal with them as the volumes, I would expect,
ramp pretty aggressively in the next couple of years?
<A - John J. Stephens>: And so, as you might expect, from the Next program itself – we don't have very many
trade-ins yet, right? Because we haven't lapped the first year, the first 12-month cycle – but the expectations are a
couple. One, we're seeing great take rates on our insurance program, not only historically but specifically with Next.
And so these trade-in phones we expect will be used in our insurance fulfillment. That's one. Two, we are working hard
to figure out a way to make them cost-efficiently deployable in our prepaid market, and specifically in the new Cricket
brand.
Three, we always have the opportunity to sell them on the wholesale market, which is what we did mainly last year.
With the quality of the handsets our customers use, and with us having the international standard for handset
technology, we were satisfied or pleased with the demand for our handsets that we dealt with last year and feel
optimistic because the handsets we may be dealing with this year might be newer in their lifecycle than the ones we had
to do with last year. So those are the, if you will, mechanisms to make sure we get value out of the process.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Got it. Thanks, John.

Thank you. We now have a question from Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Good afternoon, guys, great quarter. John, I think you blew through – definitely your
estimates, but I think the Street estimates on subscriber adds. Can you maybe give us a little more color what's going
on? Do you think the overall market's just expanding, or are you guys gaining share, and if so, maybe you could talk
about who you're gaining it from? And then I guess we were concerned, and there's been some concern out there, about
the early termination fees that some of your competitors are paying. Can you maybe talk about how that process hit you
throughout the quarter? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, sure, Tim. First of all, I will tell you that a lot of the offers that came out right at the
beginning of the quarter, I won't say that they didn't have any impact, but I will say that the impact of everything we did
changed throughout the quarter, and specifically the biggest impact was the decision to push Mobile Share Value plans
in February and early adoption of Next. And when we did those two things in connection, we saw significant take rates,
and we saw improvements not only in customer growth, customer additions, but we saw churn come down. And we
saw that improve throughout the quarter, so the more customers understood, the better it got in the results.
So I guess, real simply, while it's a very noisy competitive environment, we were able to do well across the board. We
don't give individual porting ratios, but we were certainly positive porting in total and very strong results from all
aspects of our business. We don't have any reason to believe we shouldn't be able to continue it. We need to see how
things play out and how we continue to play in this competitive environment, but we're optimistic about what we can
do going forward.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: And then just maybe a longer-term outlook on Next, have you thought at all about maybe
just phasing out the subsidy programs and moving everyone over to Next in the next couple years? Because it seems
like it would be substantially more profitable. I know you talked about going through some of the economics there, but
your subsidies were in the $400 range before that, and maybe it's $100 upfront here on Next.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, so, Tim, we'll certainly consider those things. I guess the first thing – and this may
sound simplistic, but the first thing is it starts with the customer. And so our customers still – and some of our
customers still choose the subsidy program even in the first quarter. So we want to make sure we stay focused on what
they have and what they want and be responsive to them. So that's the first thing. So I wouldn't suggest that it would be
eliminated as long as there's a significant number of customers who enjoy and prefer it.
I will tell you this, though – as we see the Next program grow, we are expecting to see some changes in pricing and
some ability for the consumer to drive efficiency in the market that maybe the transport companies couldn't drive
themselves, and that'll give us an opportunity to not only give customers a better deal, as they drive efficiency, they'll
get savings. But we believe as they drive efficiency and get savings for themselves, they give us the opportunity to get
the savings on the subsidy model, and that's a long-term optimistic point for us. So that $400 that you referenced, Tim,
we would hope, based on the success of Next and the customers' purchasing activities in Next would help give us an
opportunity to make inroads into that $400.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Great. Thank you. Want to talk a little bit about the fiber builds that you've announced –
you put them out yesterday. I just wanted to see what's the timeframe and the commitment to those markets? And then
talk just a little bit about the economics of deploying the fiber, the GigaPower product, now versus what you saw a
couple years ago. It seems like the economics have improved for you. What are some of the drivers of that that are
making that more of a feasible build than what you saw a few years ago?

<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah. So, first and foremost, right now the four markets that we've announced, and
specifically Austin, where we made the most progress in, we are being able to view this within our scope of our VIP
program and in our scope of U-verse. We're, if you will, able to direct dollars from that effort and move them into this
fiber-focused effort of GigaPower. What we're seeing there is take rates in Austin that surprised us, that exceeded our
expectations. We're seeing customers' quality scores very pleased. And we're seeing being able to sell much more
online and in much more efficient manners than necessarily we've done in the past.
The key to the success there was that we were able to get right of way and permitting and pull rights and other rights to
build in the same manner as other companies, which we haven't had historically, and we were able to focus our build on
the customers that drove demand as opposed to ubiquitous coverage. And so those two things are what's driving the
success. Those two things drive the changes in the financial metrics. When you can build to where the demand is, you
can have much higher penetrations and get much higher returns to support that build.
We will start – in fact, I think there've been discussions today with many of the leaders of the market areas in the cities
that we spelled out. We're very opportunistic and – optimistic, I should say, about those markets, and believe we're
uniquely positioned in many of those markets because of the existing backbone we have in many of those markets to
build off of and to provide that really high-quality service.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
<A - Susan Johnson>: I think I'm going to call for the last question, as we're almost out of time.
Operator
Thank you. That will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Go ahead, please.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. So I guess I got a couple
questions, if I could. So, John, thank you for walking through some of the accounting practices that go along with Next.
I guess my math is that every Next customer is generating something around $500 of upfront equipment revenue,
relative to the traditional subscriber, who might be generating something closer to $200. And that $300 delta, times 2.9
million Next adds, would be about $900 million of incremental equipment revenue relative to the old approach. And
that seems to foot with the year-over-year change in your accounts receivable working capital number.
So I was wondering if we could just go right to the nuts and bolts of it and see what was the Next impact on the quarter,
specifically, from the differences in how you account now versus how you would have accounted if you just used the
subsidy model. And I guess the second question, if I could, was it looks like you changed the definition of ARPU in the
disclosures this quarter. I guess the old numbers look about $2 lower than the new numbers, so I was wondering if you
could talk a little about that change as well. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure. First of all, David, we're not going to give specific details, but let me give you a couple
of points about what you said that I think are may need some refinement. First and foremost, on day one under the old
subsidy model, we got about $240. We got about a $200 copayment, but we had usually had about somewhere between
about a $40 activation fee, so that's the first piece. The second piece is, if you think about an average phone costs about
$600, and you adjust that for an interest charge, and you adjust it from anywhere from 0% to 25% contingency loss for
the trade-in value reduction, you're going to get a much different number than $500. You're going to get a lower
number than $500. Second, if you think about what happened in the quarter, we had 1.1 million accelerated upgrades,
so this Next program generated those. That doesn't generate a benefit. Actually, that generates pressure on the margins.
So I think all of those items have to be taken into account. Specifically, I will tell you, on the change in accounts
receivable, yes, there is some accounts receivable change related to Next. Our total Next accounts receivables are going
to be in the $2 billion range. I think we said at the end of last year it was in the $900 million range. But I want to be
straight with everyone in the sense that the 12-month receivables – the billings for the next 12 months – are in our

accounts receivable line because they're short-term, they're current assets, but those receivables that go out beyond 12
months are our long-term other assets. So the accounting rules don't allow us to have that clarity with regard to it; that's
why we've provided in our quarterly filings the total Next receivable.
With regard to ARPUs, you're right. We are changing it as we're shifting the model, and having people pay for
equipment and choosing – they're electing to pay for the equipment, and in return they're taking a discounted service
product. Our new ARPU metric is service ARPU plus monthly Next billings. And when you add those together, which
we've done on our presentation, you can see our growth rate's still a strong 2% on the ARPU side, so we feel good
about that. But it's, if you will, a view towards what the customer is paying us, writing the check to us for, on a monthly
basis.
<Q - David W. Barden>: So, John, so you're adding service ARPU plus a portion of the equipment revenue back into
the service revenue number for the ARPU calculation?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Just the monthly billings.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay. And then just if I could clarify -
<A - John J. Stephens>: And, David, that won't tie to equipment revenue because the equipment revenue is – you're
right, much of it is recognized upfront. This is the $30 a month we bill a customer who's on a 20-month Next plan for a
phone that costs $600.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Right. And for those advanced upgrade plans, the ones that you allowed to upgrade early,
did you book any revenue for those, or did you just give them the phone?
<A - John J. Stephens>: No, they came in and signed up to pay us, effectively, the $30 a month for 20 straight
months. So, yes, we booked revenue in the same manner as we booked all the others.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Okay, great. Thank, you guys, for helping with...
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
John J. Stephens
Folks, with that, let me take a moment to thank all of you for being on the call today. We have started off the year very
strong and have made major strides in transforming our business. As a result, we saw strong revenue and EPS growth,
along with major gains in our growth drivers. We drove a strategic shift in the subsidy model by changing the way
customers buy their handsets.
It's been an exciting quarter and an exciting start to the year, and we look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.
Thanks again for being on the call, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T, and have a good evening.
