MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Release
Conference Call.
At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and
financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result
of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any
obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call.
On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most
directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings
release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the
most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a
reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and
may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John
Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior
management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself
to one question and one follow up.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Albert Kandarian
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of
$1.28 and net loss of $1.94. Capital market movements during the quarter, primarily the strong rise in interest rates
produced net losses in our derivative portfolio. We own derivatives almost exclusively to protect against market
fluctuations in interest rates, equities, and currencies.
In outsized post-election move in interest rates characterized by the 85-basis-point quarterly increase in the 10-year
U.S. Treasury yield affected the carrying value of our derivative portfolio to a greater degree than typical. Much of this
is due to asymmetrical insurance accounting which marks assets including derivatives to fair value while related
insurance liabilities follow an accrual-based accounting model.
Despite almost all of our derivatives being used for hedging purposes, fewer than 15% qualify for hedge accounting. As
a result, the change in the quarterly value of most of our derivatives flows through our income statement, while changes
in the economically-hedged risk do not. As in past quarters, the vast majority of our after-tax net income impact,
approximately 94% in the fourth quarter, represents asymmetrical and non-economic movement that would reverse
with a decline in interest rates. Despite these accounting-related volatility, rising interest rates remains favorable for
MetLife over the longer term.
Included in our disclosure for the quarter is a slide that offers more detail on the fair value movements of our derivative
portfolio, which John Hele will discuss later in our presentation.
Adjusting for notable items in the quarter, operating earnings were $1.35 per share, which compares to $1.33 per share
on the same basis in the prior-year period. The only notable items in the quarter were $58 million of net insurance
adjustments spread across the MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse segments and $28 million of spending in corporate
and other associated with the unit cost initiative we discussed at Investor Day.
Taking a closer look at operating earnings, we benefited from disciplined expense control, higher variable investment
income, and a lower tax rate. Offsetting these positives were lower underwriting margins in our U.S. businesses and
Brighthouse Financial.
Our full-year 2016 effective tax rate was 21.0%, modestly below the 22.1% estimate we provided on our third quarter
call. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.3%. The reversal of a tax item and the timing of tax credits
account for much of the difference in the quarterly rate.
Our investment portfolio is starting to benefit from higher interest rates. Our new money rate rose from 2.89% in the
third quarter to 3.15% in the fourth quarter.

In absolute terms, recurring investment income was flat compared to a year ago, as higher asset balances served to
offset the roll-off of higher yielding securities. Variable investment income of $301 million came in just above the
low-end of our quarterly guidance range and was aided by another strong quarter of private equity returns. For the full
year, VII totaled $1.16 billion, falling only modestly below our annual range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
Looking back on 2016, MetLife took a number of actions that we believe will enable the company to perform well in a
variety of macroeconomic environments. The year began with the announcement of our plan to separate a substantial
portion of our U.S. retail business. This decision to part with MetLife's original business dating back to 1868 was not
made lightly, and we are confident that the separation will allow both companies to achieve greater success with each
offering a unique value proposition to investors.
In March of 2016, MetLife achieved a significant regulatory victory when the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia rescinded our designation as a systemically important financial institution with Judge Rosemary Collyer
calling the process fatally flawed. When MetLife announced its intention to seek judicial review of FSOC's decision,
few gave us any chance of success. We believe our decision to contest the designation contribute to FSOC reform
emerging as a key focus for policymakers.
After announcing our separation plan in January, we achieved a number of additional milestones throughout the year.
We chose a name for the new company, Brighthouse Financial; we appointed the company's senior leadership team; we
completed the initial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and we began the process of seeking
various state regulatory approvals that will be required.
As you know, the separation of our U.S. retail business is central to a larger refresh at MetLife's enterprise strategy,
which is part of our Accelerating Value initiative. While strategy needs to continually adapt to the external
environment, it is important to put stakes in the ground at key inflection points to show the direction the company is
taking. We did this in May of 2012 and again in November of 2016. We believe the course MetLife is following toward
less capital intensive and less market sensitive businesses is both clear and correct.
As I said at Investor Day, capital is precious. Our enhanced capital budgeting process ensures that we prioritize
businesses with high risk adjusted internal rates of return, lower capital intensity, and maximum cash generation.
Another essential component of our refresh strategy is our commitment to operational excellence. From a cost
perspective, this is driving a cultural shift at MetLife. Our expense targets are no longer absolute; rather, they are
relative. If our revenues drop or our competitors become more efficient, our expense reduction targets will go up. The
$1 billion target we announced in 2016 was a point-in-time estimate. It has already moved higher to ensure we can
deliver $800 million in run rate savings to the bottom-line by 2020, net of stranded overhead.
In conjunction with the rollout of our refresh strategy, we also launched our refresh brand. This was another pivotal
decision that made 2016 one of the most transformative years in MetLife's history. Our new logo is modern, fresh, and
professional, and our new tag line, Navigating life together, embodies the trusted partnership our corporate and
individual customers across the globe tell us they want from MetLife.
MetLife closed out 2016 on a strong note, with the announcement of a $3 billion share buyback program; the largest in
our history. We are confident that our capital return plans will not face regulatory hurdles from the Federal
Government. We repurchased $302 million in shares through the end of 2016 and remain an opportunistic buyer of our
stock. Since year-end, we've acquired another $283 million of our shares.
Looking ahead, we are encouraged the higher interest rates and the prospects for a more favorable regulatory
environment, coupled with internal factors such as our new enterprise strategy, capital management, and expense
discipline will position us for value creation for both our customers and shareholders.
I would like to end this morning by thanking MetLife's employees for their tremendous effort, dedication, and focus
over the past year. We are asking a great deal of them to ensure that MetLife's transformation is successful, and I very
much appreciate their hard work.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our Q4 and full-year 2016 financial results in greater detail.

John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of our
insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some
comments on cash and capital.
Based on your feedback, we released additional disclosure last night labeled 4Q 2016 Supplemental Slides that
addresses the large more complex elements in the quarter, the large derivative loss, and the low fourth quarter tax rate. I
will speak to these slides later in my presentation. In the future, we will release additional supplemental slides when we
have complex elements in a quarter.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.28 per share. This quarter included two notable items
which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segments in the appendix of our quarterly
financial supplement or QFS.
First, changes in DAC associated with the annual fourth quarter approval of an increase in the dividend scale for
traditional life insurance policies, primarily in MetLife Holdings along with other insurance adjustments, decreased
operating earnings by $58 million or $0.05 per share after-tax. Second, severance expenses related to our unit cost
initiative decreased operating earnings by $28 million or $0.03 per share after-tax. Adjusted for all notable items in
both periods, operating earnings were up 1% year over year. On a per share basis, operating earnings adjusted for all
notable items were $1.35, up 2% year over year.
Turning to our bottom-line results, we had a fourth quarter net loss of $2.1 billion or $1.94 per share. Net income was
$3.5 billion lower than the operating earnings primarily because of derivative losses of $3.2 billion after-tax. For more
details about the difference between operating earnings and net income, please reference page 3 in our supplemental
slide disclosure this quarter.
Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after-tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, a significant rise
in U.S. interest rates this quarter primarily drove this result. The interest rate impact in the fourth quarter was a loss of
$2.2 billion after-tax on derivatives outside our VA program, as highlighted in the slide. However, more than this
amount, $2.3 billion is what we consider asymmetrical accounting driven by current U.S. GAAP.
In addition, the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives in our VA program this quarter accounted for a loss of
$854 million after-tax or the vast majority of the remainder. More than half of this total or $467 million after-tax was
due to non-performance risk, also commonly referred to as own credit. We view own credit as noneconomic. In total,
$3 billion out of the $3.2 billion after-tax derivative loss, or approximately 94%, was attributable to asymmetrical and
noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.83 as of December 31,
down 3% year over year, primarily due to the impact of the derivative losses. Tangible book value per share was
$41.14 as of December 31, also down 3% year over year.
With respect to fourth quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.16 per
share versus the prior-year quarter, after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse
accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease, primarily due to the previously disclosed quarterly impact of
the loss of the aggregation benefit in Variable and Universal Life or V&UL as well as unfavorable mortality.
Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.06 per share year over year. This was
primarily due to less favorable mortality experience in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings, as well as a one-time $14
million reserve adjustment in long-term care to update assumptions on 2016 claims.
The Group Life mortality ratio was 88.2%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 86.8%, but within the annual target
range of 85% to 90%. We had a reserve refinement on a small block of claims this quarter. Adjusting for this
refinement, the Group Life mortality ratio was 86.9%, essentially in line with the prior-year quarter.

For full-year 2016, the Group Life mortality ratio was 87.2%, below the midpoint of its targeted range. MetLife
Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 63.5%, higher than the prior-year quarter of 58.7%, due to
claims severity and less favorable reinsurance on some large claims.
Finally, the Group Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 76.2%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of
77.0%, and modestly better than the 2016's annual target range of 77% to 82%. For full-year 2016, the interest-adjusted
loss ratio for Non-Medical Health was 78.3%, below the midpoint of the targeted range.
Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three product spreads in our QFS was 165 basis points in
the quarter, up 11 basis points year over year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads in
our QFS as Retirement and Income Solutions represents roughly 75% of the total asset base for RemainCo.
Pre-tax variable investment income or VII was $301 million, up $192 million versus the prior-year quarter, driven by
strong private equity performance. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 133 basis points this quarter, down 3 basis
points year over year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the
second quarter (sic) [fourth quarter] accounted for approximately $0.05 of EPS improvement year over year.
In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.0% and 22.7% after adjusting for the notable item this
quarter related to company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the prior-year quarter of 24.4%, which
should not include any notable expense items, primarily due to the sale of premier life client group (sic) [Premier Client
Group] and expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.11 of EPS
improvement versus the prior-year quarter.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $174 million,
up 14% and 9% adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. Primary drivers are favorable expense margins
and volume growth. This is partially offset by less favorable mortality experience.
Group Benefits' operating PFOs were $4 billion, up 5% year over year, driven by growth across all markets. Full-year
2016 Group Benefits sales were up 24% over the prior year with strong growth across most products and markets.
In addition, we were pleased with the start of the 2017 sales and renewal season. We are seeing continued strong
persistency and solid sales across our market segments, as well as in both core and voluntary products. As a result, we
expect 2017 PFO growth to be at the higher end of our target range of 3% to 5%, excluding the loss of a large dental
contract as discussed on our outlook call.
Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, reported operating earnings of $299 million, up 27% and 28% after adjusting
for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were higher investment margins and favorable underwriting.
RIS operating PFOs were $895 million, up 5% year over year due to higher pension risk transfers, or PRT, which can
be lumpy. We closed PRT transactions totaling more than $500 million in the quarter. We continue to see a good PRT
pipeline and expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth
with an efficient use of capital.
Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $43 million, down 2% and 23% after adjusting for notable items
in the prior-year quarter. Primary driver was less favorable auto results due to increased loss severity. Our claim
frequency and average premium were close to expectations. We have been taking targeted rate increases over the last
12 months, and the fourth quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately
7%. We continue to take similar rate increases in 2017. We expect these price increases along with other management
actions to move the auto combined ratio toward the upper end of our 2017 guidance range of 95% to 100%.
P&C operating PFOs were $887 million, up 1% year over year. Overall P&C sales were down 9% due to price
increases and management actions to drive value.
Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $354 million, up 22% from the prior-year quarter, and 8% on a constant
currency basis, after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were volume growth,
favorable market impacts, and a tax related item in Japan. The stronger equity market in Japan and stronger dollar
versus the yen helped earnings in the quarter to asset appreciation. Although Asia had a strong quarter, operating

earnings excluding the one-time tax item and the favorable market conditions this quarter were in line with our
guidance of $310 million plus or minus 5%.
Asia operating PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 5% from the prior-year quarter but down 2% on a constant currency basis,
due to the deconsolidation of the company's India operations. Excluding the impact of the India deconsolidation, PFOs
were up 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth in the life and A&H markets in Japan.
Asia sales were essentially unchanged year over year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management
actions to improve value in targeted markets. Sales in emerging markets, were up 13%.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $122 million, down 22%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis, after
adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were favorable one-time tax items in the current
quarter and volume growth.
Latin America operating PFOs were $913 million, down 2%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis. Total sales were
essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as higher group sales were offset by lower Afore sales.
EMEA operating earnings were $72 million, up 33% year over year and 44% on a constant currency basis. The key
drivers were lower expenses through the unit cost initiative, a claims reserve release in the Gulf, and volume growth.
EMEA operating PFOs were $622 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period and 4% on a constant
currency basis, driven by growth in employee benefits. We continue to see a favorable shift toward higher-margin
products. Total EMEA sales increased 5% on a constant currency basis.
MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses, reported
operating earnings of $199 million, down 25% year over year. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating
earnings were down 3%, as unfavorable underwriting and investment margins were partially offset by lower expenses,
including those related to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group in 2016. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were
$1.6 billion, down 9% year over year, mostly due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the
company's affiliated broker dealer unit.
Brighthouse Financial, or BHF, operating earnings were $330 million, down 15% and 32% after adjusting for notable
items in both quarters. The key drivers were unfavorable underwriting and life reserve changes, including $44 million
from the ongoing impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP reserve testing associated with the V&UL
business, as well as lower [ph] separate (27:00) account fees.
The $44 million impact was consistent with our prior guidance discussed on our 3Q earnings call. However, ongoing
higher Universal Life reserves following a previously discussed model change in Q2 were $20 million in the quarter. In
addition to the $10 million guidance, there was a one-time reserve adjustment for another $10 million.
As a reminder, the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match the
financial statements of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse Form
10 filing due to accounting timing differences.
BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 15% year over year. Excluding the impact of single premium income
annuities and reinsurance recaptures, operating PFOs were down 8% due to lower fees for annuities as a result of
continued negative fund flows. BHF continues to see strong sales growth from shield life selector (sic) [Shield Level
Selector] (28:11) which is up 45% year over year.
Next, I would like to discuss the company's low effective tax rate this quarter of 17.3%. As highlighted on page 5 of the
supplemental slides, the key drivers were a revised estimates of the U.S. tax on the dividend from Japan, which
reversed the tax expense taken into 2Q 2016, increased tax credits, and inter-quarter catch-up adjustment and favorable
audit settlements. Excluding these items, the company's effective tax rate was 21.7% for the fourth quarter and full-year
2016. The 21.7% is reasonably close to the prior guidance we provided of 21.1% in the third quarter. Going forward,
the company's tax rate is projected to be approximately 23%, consistent with the outlook call guidance.

I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately
$5.8 billion at December 31, which is up from $5.6 billion at September 30. This increase reflects the net effects of
subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend, share repurchases, and other holding company
expenses. Please note that cash at the holding companies at year-end was roughly $1 billion higher than anticipated.
This was due to higher than projected cash of approximately $625 million, mainly due to lower collateral for
derivatives and taxes, as well as timing of retail separation costs of close to $375 million, which were shifted from 2016
to 2017.
Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from
Brighthouse Financial prior to separation, subject to regulatory approvals. In addition, our 2016 free cash flow ratio
was 48% of reported operating earnings. However, the free cash flow ratio was 77% after adjusting for notable items
and excluding the impact from actions related to the separation of Brighthouse. This was significantly above our 2016
target of 55% to 65%, primarily due to higher subsidiary dividends, as well as lower operating earnings.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based
capital calculation for 2016, we estimate our U.S. combined RBC ratio including Brighthouse, will remain above
400%. Preliminary full-year 2016 statutory operating earnings, including Brighthouse, were approximately $6 billion;
and net earnings, including BHF, were approximately $5.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.4
billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets and certain variable annuities,
partially offset by lower net investment income. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was
approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2016, which was down 14% from December 31, 2015.
Dividends paid to the holding company as well as both realized and unrealized losses, were partially offset by net
earnings. In statutory accounting, there was a balance sheet accounting misalignment between hedge assets and the
associated liabilities. Hedge assets are mark-to-market. However, statutory reserves are less sensitive to interest rate
changes. This asymmetry causes a reduction in statutory capital when interest rates rise. For Japan, our solvency
margin ratio was 991% as of the third quarter of 2016 which is the latest public data.
At the core, MetLife had a solid fourth quarter. Higher investment margins and lower expenses offset underwriting
weakness in the quarter. Our net loss was largely due to significant rise in interest rates in the quarter. In total,
asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting drove approximately 94% of the derivative loss this quarter.
As Steve noted, higher interest rates are an economic benefit for MetLife. In addition, our cash and capital position
remains strong, and we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy, will drive improvement in
free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.
And, with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Suneet Kamath>: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with MetLife Holdings, if I could. I don't know if
you've given guidance on this, but do you have a sense of what the free cash flow conversion is out of that segment?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Suneet. It's John. We haven't given details of – by segment yet, and MetLife Holdings, the
goal of that is to optimize value for the shareholder in MetLife Holdings, including cash flow, so we have work
underway with that. Over time, we'll give you some more guidance on that. But, right now, we give you the overall

<Q - Suneet Kamath>: Okay. And then I guess on the interest rate hedges, obviously some of those hedges are going
to stay with HoldCo or RemainCo, some of it are going to go to Brighthouse. So can you maybe give us a sense of how
much you're benefiting from the interest rate hedges now and then what the trajectory is of that benefit over the next
couple of years?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: I'm just looking it up. So we have about a couple hundred million of benefit right now from
the – and about just under half of that is Brighthouse today, and these hedges stay for long time. So they run well into
2020-plus, 2022.
<Q - Suneet Kamath>: That's a couple hundred million in the quarter?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes, the quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Good morning. Can you comment on the net income sensitivity to interest rates? We had a
pretty big loss here, and I realize your view is it's uneconomical. But just curious would the next 80-basis-point to
100-basis-point increase in rates have a similar GAAP net income loss or does the sensitivity change? Is it not
symmetrical?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Tom. It's John. It depends both on the shape of the curve and how much it moves in the
quarter, how these marks on derivatives move. And we also have currency hedging and some other aspects to it. So it's
a little complex. We have instituted a plan, though. We are relooking at our hedging in total, so we don't want to give
any guidance on it now. And then we haven't decided how we're going to think about it. I mean, it's kind of an
interesting balance. Economically, we're better off even with these hedges from an economic balance sheet point of
view, but you have this noise through the GAAP, so how much do you want to spend money or change your hedging to
protect GAAP. So we are examining various options because we are at these rates and if rates go up further, we will be
moving away from some of the more costly guarantees in our businesses that we may be able to modify our hedging
strategy. But that's still work underway.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay. And then, I guess the way I would think about it is for these types of mark-to-market
losses on derivatives, to truly be uneconomical, I would have to think then it's not affecting your view of
enterprise-wide capital adequacy, despite what sounds like some negative adjustments to statutory surplus. So can you
kind of reconcile those two things and indicate whether there is at least an immediate negative impact on capital and
how you and the rating agencies would view that?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: So from a pure mark-to-market economic balance sheet, MetLife is better off end of the year
than in the third quarter and second quarter. But the accounting does have timing issues sometimes. So there is, as you
can see, there are some FX statutory capital. But we are still – have our guidance and reconfirming our 65 to 75 free
cash flow for 2017 and 2018 for RemainCo on average over 2017 and 2018, so it hasn't changed that amount.
Long-term, it's very good for the business, when you think about the net present value of cash flows.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Got you. And then just one final one related to that. I get the rate hedges related to the
variable annuity business, but can you comment a little more broadly since most of the loss was outside of VA, at least
the accounting loss, is it mainly Universal Life insurance related hedges? Is that related to your pension business? Can
you provide a little more granularity for what exactly it is in terms of the liabilities that you're hedging there?

<A - John C. R. Hele>: These were general interest rate hedges purchased over years to protect against low rates
across the board. In particular, we do have some long liabilities, long-term care, for example, that these protect against
and some other longer liabilities. So that's what it's protecting against, and we've had them for a long time, and they
produced the income for us in a very positive way as rates go up. They produce less income now, and they do have this
the mark-to-market to the balance sheet for this asymmetrical accounting. But that's why it's a big piece of it and less in
the VA look.
<Q - Thomas Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I understand the balance sheet implications of the
accounting asymmetry of the derivative book, but just want to see if you could kind of reiterate your view on the
near-term earnings impact from higher interest rates and just want to double-check that it's necessarily a positive with
rates moving up and maybe more specifically could you categorize what the impact to earning is from what you're
losing of what's being kicked off in the derivative book from higher rates and how that is immediately offset by the
earnings impact of the in-force business and how to think about any timing lag that may exist between those two
forces?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Right. While there is an impact, it depends on how rates go up and how the shorting goes up.
The shorting can affect the derivative income. If we had a 100 basis points increase in rates affecting operating up, right
up from where we are now, you have the positive from rising rates and the reinvestment of the portfolio, and you'd also
have less derivative income. It would be – if it spiked up today, the sensitivity would be kind of a wash in 2017 at about
$100 million in 2018 and $150 million in 2019.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay. Thank you. And then if we think about sort of the book value basis, is there a way to
separate out the value of the derivative portfolio from book value just to get maybe a cleaner sense, a more consistent
sense of what book value is sort of similar to what you do with maybe the FAS 115 adjustment or the FCTA
adjustment?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: That is complex. You'd have to go way back, and where do you start, and how do you do the
calculation? So I think, unfortunately, the answer is you have to wait till the accounting is modified at some point in the
future. It's been about 10 years we've been working on it, but the hope is to have a better balance sheet for insurers and
it's worked by FASB underway to move towards that.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay. Thank you. So you can't give just a per share amount of what those derivatives in that
position is worth today?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, the total values are disclosed in our balance sheet, so you can divide by number of
shares outstanding. But to try to equate to get to the true book value, the true economic value, confirming that for just
the liabilities. That's what I mean. It's not a useful number because you don't know the true economic value after
liabilities to really figure out what is the true economic book value.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Hi. Good morning. First, I had a question just on your Latin America business. And
specifically on Mexico, your sales in the business were pretty weak. I think mostly related to weaker Afore volumes.
But if you can just discuss how economically sensitive the business is and I think a significant portion of it is group

sales and how susceptible are you to potential weakening in the economy in Mexico?
<A>: Hi, Jimmy. So as we disclosed, the quarter in general terms, revenues are 5% are fine. We have weaker Afore
sales in Mexico, which you know is a fee-based business, so impacting in lower sales are not necessarily directly
correlated with the top-line, because it's fee business. In terms of the impact in the economy, obviously, we're closely
monitoring how the situation evolves, including discussions. I have to say that our business volume in Mexico is
thoroughly unrelated to any trade agreements, so it's just to the general economy and the evolution of the market. We
normally grow in similar rate to the market growth rate.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: And then just on the Brighthouse business, if you look at your sales of the two
major products, annuities and individual life insurance, they're both weak a lot, and part of it's distribution, which isn't
going to really change. So how do you think about the growth outlook for that business down the road given that it
seems like annuity flows are going to be negative for a while even with growth in the Shield product and it's just the
individual life book seems to be shrinking?
<A - Eric Thomas Steigerwalt>: Hi, Jimmy. It's Eric. I really can't talk about outlook right now, but I can give you a
little sense. Look, where we are in the fourth quarter is right around where we thought we would be. On what I'd call
the normal variable annuity business, obviously there has been an effect from DOL; you've seen that on other
competitors as well. The life business we kind of expected as we sold off the MPCG field force, and they shifted to
their new company. But the Shield sales are fantastic, up 45% quarter over quarter. So we're seeing some momentum
in, I would say, what I'd call our normal VA business. We continue to see momentum in the Shield business. But the
life business was clearly weak in the fourth quarter, and we'll have to work on that in coming quarters going forward.
<Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar>: Right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I want to follow up on something John mentioned around the
FASB proposals for long-term insurance contracts. So if I understand correctly, insurance liabilities would be fair
valued every quarter. Is that something that MetLife supports?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Sean. We're very active with the FASB on this. The concept makes a lot of sense. The
devil is in the details. The big question is what interest rate do you bring the liabilities back at. There is a lot of
discussion with the FASB on that, and that work is still underway. A lot of the changes, though, would flow through – I
think the proposals flow through AOCI and not give noise to operating earnings. So you'd still be able to see kind of the
operating earnings piece and the noise would flow through the AOCI.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Okay. Thanks. And then I have a question about proposed tax reform. If U.S. corporate taxes get
lowered, how do you think the industry and regulators respond? Do you – would you target an after-tax return and cut
pricing, or do you think the industry would as a whole, or do you think regulators would require pricing cuts?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Sean, it's Steve Kandarian. It's pretty hard to answer a question right now about tax
reform, because it's so early stage. Chairman Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee has a blueprint out.
We'll have to see where that goes. There has been some support for it and other quarters of the economy are concerned
about the border adjustability component. Still a lot of knowledge has to be gained in terms of how that will actually
work and what the details would be. So it's really premature for me right now to say how it would affect those factors.
<Q - Sean Dargan>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Hi. Thank you. Can you comment on the expected earnings run rate for MetLife Holdings and if
there is any residual impact from the items you highlighted this quarter?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Erik, this is John. No, the guidance we gave at our outlook still applies for next year. There is
noise this quarter and some worse mortality than we had thought. We had some couple large claims that flowed
through. But we would stick with the guidance we gave you at our outlook call.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Okay. And then on interest rates, you mentioned the rise of new money rates. How much more
would rates need to rise to sort of get you towards where your portfolio yield is and eliminate the drag from spread
compression?
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: Well, you highlighted one of the sensitivities, Eric. This is Steve Goulart by the way. But the
way we look at it is if you were to hold all spreads constant across asset sectors, what has to happen to the 10-year
Treasury, which is a primary indicator for where we're investing. And it's approximately about a 3% U.S. Treasury rate
at 10 years. And again, it's assuming all spreads stay the same. But that would be about where we would hit our
breakeven on reinvesting.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Got it. Thank you. And I guess when you hit that point, would you expect to get some spread
benefit initially before having to share that with policyholders?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: I think we'll have to wait and see. It will be nice though to not have spread compression that
we've been fighting for years, and we look forward to dealing with that issue going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Hi. Good morning. Just a question. I'm thinking about the 2017 outlook, and taking into
account all the moving parts in the fourth quarter results at the segment levels, are there any segments where you would
say the baseline that you identified six or seven weeks ago that you talked about back in December where the baseline
has changed materially on sort of a core basis where we need to adjust our expectations for 2017?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hey, John. This is John. It's a good question. No, we would not adjust our outlook. And we
would try to tell that to you if we had a change to our outlook. But thanks for the question.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. And then, second one is just, can you give us an update on any asset adequacy reserve
additions of any note for 2016 year-end?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Well, actually with interest rates going up, we've not had to add to asset adequacy reserves.
We have better buffers now with the rise in rates, and look forward to a future of not having to add to those for a while.
So we – this has been a very – as I said, it's economically very favorable to MetLife with the rise in rates.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: And then last one real quick. You didn't give an update. I suppose that means nothing has
changed, but can you still confirm that the spinoff is expected to take place in the first half?
<A - Steven Albert Kandarian>: Hey, John. Steve. Yes, our target is still the first half of 2017 for the Brighthouse
separation.

<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. John, you mentioned $625 million benefit to the holding company
cash position. Is that something that you would view as a permanent benefit, or should we think about that as
potentially reversing?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Some of that was tax, which we have. So we have the cash, and another piece was collateral
for derivatives. So depending upon what happens to currencies and interest rates, the collateral postings can change.
And we'll just have to wait and see. That's on that piece.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Okay. And then on Brighthouse, could you just quantify, I guess for the quarter, how much
weaker were the underwriting results relative to what you would have expected?
<A - Eric Thomas Steigerwalt>: Hi. It's Eric. I would say about $19 million. But I would say this. This comparison,
fourth quarter of 2015 was a very good underwriting quarter for us. Whether you look at what we expected or maybe an
average run rate over eight or nine quarters, it was a very good underwriting quarter. This quarter, fourth quarter 2016,
while it is weaker maybe than we expected, slightly weaker than we expected, over the last eight quarters, it's right on
the average. So similar to what MetLife experienced, a little bit of severity and a little less seeded. But despite the fact
that it cost us some earnings, not that far off of what we expect.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Good morning, everybody. John, I think you reiterated the free cash flow target of 65% to 75%
for the next couple of years. Would it be fair to expect the free cash flow conversion to be a bit on the lower end for
2017 and then maybe more of a catch up in 2018, just given where the statutory capital and earnings are today and then
the separation costs?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: So I think I understand your question, but free cash flow has a lot of moving parts to it, and it
is a bit volatile from year to year. So we give you an average over two years, and we are confident in our range of 65%
to 75%, but I can't give you an individual year target.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Okay. But directionally, would it be fair to expect maybe free cash flows moving up as the
year moves on?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Directionally, I'm reiterating our range.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Okay.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: That's all I can do at this time. It is a bit volatile from time to time.
<Q - Yaron J. Kinar>: Okay. And then in RIS, if one excludes the pension risk transfers, I think PFOs were actually –
came under some considerable pressure this quarter. Could you maybe talk about that a little bit and maybe also had
any color – or any extrapolation that you may see for that into 2017?
<A - Maria R. Morris>: This is Maria Morris. Obviously RIS has a number of different products as part of it. It was
our institutional income annuities block that was down this quarter, quarter over quarter. We are in a process, as you
know, of balancing kind of value and growth in this marketplace, and so we're comfortable with where we ended up.
And going into next year, we have focused plans on each of these markets. In the income annuities business, we are
seeing some increase in different sponsors interested in this product line. So we do believe that we'll go back to
traditional growth in the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to talk about just expenses and confirm that the overall
expense savings initiative of the $800 million is still on track. I think it is, but more specifically, I think that you talked
about in December costs associated with the expense initiative of $300 million pre-tax in 2017, is that still on course
now that we're in 2017? And is there any update or color you can give us on how the timing of that $300 million of
costs associated with the expense initiative is going to come in, in 2017?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Randy. It's John. Yes, we are on track to the outlook we gave you for the cost saves. As
you remember, we spend a lot in 2017 to get the savings later on, a lot of technology investments. It is spread out
throughout the year, perhaps a little more in the second half than the first half. But we will isolate this for you each and
every time so you can see these pieces of what the investments are to create the savings.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick one. I wanted to cover the long-term care. There is a little
bit of an adjustment in Holdings. Can you just give a quick update on what the behavior versus interest rate
assumptions were there that changed, was it mostly interest rates that changed?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: In long-term care, we adjusted the claims we had in 2016. We updated at the end of the year
for those claims. What we were seeing, we were seeing a little less termination of those claims, so we had to adjust the
reserves on that. It's a small amount relative to the total size of our long-term care. Remember, we have about $10
billion of GAAP reserves on this business, about $13 billion stat, and this is a small change within the total and only
affecting the 2016 claims.
