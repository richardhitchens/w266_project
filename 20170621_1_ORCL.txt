remarks.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Hey, thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone.
As you can see, we've had a tremendous quarter in just about every way as cloud revenue, new software license and
earnings were all much better than expected. The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an
all-time high. But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant
improvements in our financial reporting. To align with how we are running the business now, the cloud has become our
predominant growth vehicle.
As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail. We've given you the detail in
our new presentation format, and we've also provided the reporting in our old format, going back through fiscal 2016
and 2017, so you can see the numbers, the new way, the old way, all including history to help your transition this
quarter.
I'll first walk you through the reporting changes, then go over to Q4 results using the new format, and recap Q4 using
the old format for comparability to my previous guidance. Then, I'll sum up fiscal year 2017 results using the new
additional detail before moving onto my guidance for Q1. So please be patient as I'm going to be giving you a lot of
numbers today, but as I said, it's all in the press release tables that are on file, so you don't have to catch every number.
After all that, I'll turn the call over to Larry and then Mark for their comments.
In making these reporting changes, we are now recording SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted
in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency. We've also
combined Platform and Infrastructure as a Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these two businesses is
very high, and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization.
On page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues, and
further down the page, GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is PaaS and IaaS, and on-premise revenues.
For Hardware, we've gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of
hardware, and we've also aligned the expense lines where appropriate.
I'm now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rates unless I
state otherwise. This quarter, by the way, the effects of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total
software revenue, including cloud, as well as total revenue. Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on
non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS.
All right. Clearly, we're absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as software and cloud revenues were 4 points above the
high end of my guidance, and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high end of my guidance. As I mentioned earlier,
Cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year.
Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year. You can see the continuing
revenue momentum of our cloud business in cloud billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is
now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S. dollars. Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S. dollars this quarter, and once again,
we've put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter, and frankly, you probably
don't need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive.
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for
SaaS in the quarter was 65%; up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and remain
committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time.

Now, the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4, as we invested in our geographic
build-out ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross
margins there, too.
Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were
$7.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. And while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down
4%, reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud. Software updates and product support revenues were
$4.9 billion, up 3%, reflecting the continued high attach- and renewal rates that show the stability of our installed base
of on-premise customers.
Total software and cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7% and 4 points above the high end of guidance. In addition,
the total on-premise software and cloud revenues for both our applications and platform and infrastructure businesses
are growing very well now. Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP. And platform
and infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6% both GAAP and non-GAAP. In particular, our database
business grew – in aggregate, grew 8%. Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12%, and services revenue were
$894 million, up 4%.
Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion,
up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some one-time benefits, and EPS was $0.89 in U.S. dollars.
The GAAP tax rate was 14.1%, and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S. dollars. Because of currency movements,
non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01, and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02.
Q4, using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and
above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter. IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29% and at the high end of
my guidance.
Now moving on to the full fiscal year, software and cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant
currency, with $24 billion or 79% of it being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year. Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion,
growing 70%. Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%. Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing
68%.
On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion, as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by
cloud-related declines in new software license, which were down 11%. Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining
10%, and Services revenue were $3.4 billion, up 1%.
Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion, and operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%. Our
non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were
$2.74 in U.S. dollars, up 6%. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower.
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.1 billion, up 3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were
$525 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.1 billion. I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be
about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year's level.
We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is
approximately $8.2 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year over year and up 11%
sequentially.
As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic
acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we always have a
disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuations and that make both strategic
and financial sense. This quarter, we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly $500 million. Over the last 12
months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion. The
Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.

Now to the guidance, I'm going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY 2018. My
guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. But assuming current exchange rates remain the
same as they are now, currency should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS.
So for Q1, cloud revenues including, SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS, are expected to grow between 48% and 52%. Total revenue
growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere
between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, the tax rate
could end up being different. Over the full year of FY 2018, I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues, with
cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues.
Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of
operating margin expansion. Over the last two quarters, we've exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14.
And as we begin FY 2018, our compare is now that much higher. But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS
growth will be double digit next year.
As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansions, but I do expect our
overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Safra.
Last fiscal year we sold more than $2 billion in cloud annually recurring revenue. This is the second year in a row that
we sold more cloud ARR than salesforce.com. We are now well on our way to passing them and becoming number one
in the enterprise SaaS market. Our rapid SaaS growth is the driving force behind Oracle's revenue and earnings growth
in Q4.
The reason we're confident that we'll pass Salesforce is because we have three full SaaS application suites, for ERP, for
HCM, and for CRM, including financials, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, payroll,
marketing, sales and service. salesforce in contrast, only competes in three of these nine market areas. Furthermore,
Oracle is now the clear leader in cloud ERP. And ERP is by far the largest application market, not CRM.
In addition to our demonstrated strength in SaaS, Oracle also competes in Infrastructure-as-a-Service and
Platform-as-a-Service. Here our primary competitor is Amazon AWS. During this new fiscal year, we expect both our
PaaS and IaaS businesses to accelerate into hyper-growth the same kind of growth we're seeing with SaaS. As our
customers begin to migrate their millions of Oracle databases to Generation 2 of the Oracle public cloud. The AT&T
deal is just the beginning. We expect that our Oracle PaaS and IaaS businesses will grow so fast that they will be even
bigger than our SaaS business.
Over to you, Mark.
Mark V. Hurd
Hey, thanks, Larry. First, I'd like to congratulate Safra for getting through all that material. That was a [indiscernible]
(17:20) thing to go through. Listen, thanks, Larry. Good quarter for us. Obviously, we tracked ahead of virtually every
metric that I track. Whether it was cloud bookings, cloud revenue, EPS. Really everything on my KPI list was at a
record level.
Starting with cloud bookings, $855 million, it's the best quarter we have ever had; it's up 43% over what was a very
strong Q4 last year. We had a goal of $2 billion in ARR. We finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year, we will sell
more.

By the way, booking revenue growth rates I give are in CD unless otherwise said.
SaaS bookings were $486 million. PaaS and infrastructure bookings $369 million. As Safra said, cloud revenue growth
at 66%. We're now at a $6 billion annualized run rate. For total software and cloud, to Safra's point, roughly 80% of our
trailing 12 months' revenue is now recurring in nature. SaaS revenue, all up 76%, was an acceleration from 40% growth
last year.
ERP was up 156%, organically. That did not include NetSuite. Overall, ERP is now over a $1.2 billion annualized run
rate. Fusion HCM was up 96%, more than twice the growth rate of Workday. And our Front Office Solutions, sales,
market and service were all up double digits organically.
Our verticals were up 111% and over $140 million in quarterly revenue. Our PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 45%.
Database-as-a-service was up 62%. Our Database business including Database-as-a-Service and our on-premise
licenses and support were up 8%. Cloud billings grew 42%, as Safra said, and deferred revenue up 63%, both of those
are in USD.
I am going to just name a few customers so you get an idea of some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. I'm not
going to hit everything. I'm just going to hit a few representative customers. I'll start with ERP, Allianz, Ball
Corporation, BNP Paribas, GE, the Kraft Heinz Corporation, Juniper, MetLife, Minerals Technology (sic)
[Technologies], Motorola, Mouser Electronics, NCR, Netflix, Newell Rubbermaid, Orange, Pearson, Sinclair
Broadcast Group, Textron, University of Maryland, Vanderbilt University, Volkswagen; and HCM: ABM Industries,
AutoZone, Fannie Mae, Fujitsu, Garden Fresh Restaurants, Landmark, Mary Kay, The National Football League, NTT,
Raymond James Associates, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Staples, University of Pittsburgh, University of Texas System,
Vanderbilt, and a very large investment bank in New York City who switch vendors to our HCM. Those are just a few
representative customers across just a couple of pillars in the quarter.
Lastly, as I mentioned it was an overall very strong quarter. Bookings, billings, and revenue all at record levels. We
announced an exciting deal with AT&T and while it provided no revenue at all in Q4, it's a very strategic win as a
reference to all of our customers about the modernization of databases and the movement of them to the cloud.
Looking forward, just a couple of predictions, FY 2017 bookings were $2.1 billion. Our pipeline is very large and ARR
will be higher in FY 2018. I do expect our application ecosystem of on premises that would include licenses and
support and SaaS, will grow roughly 10% next year. With revenue now at annualized run rate of $6 billion and a
growth rate of 66%, we're clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.
With that rollup, we'll take your questions.

Thank you. Kimberly, please start the Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey. Congrats on a great quarter. Quick question on the Database side. Safra, thanks for the
extra disclosure that's really helpful. I can see the database license numbers are starting to accelerate or – did accelerate
in Q4. Is that already 12c, or how do I have to think about them? Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Larry, maybe Larry might want to talk about 12c a bit.

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, the new version, the new versions of our database are experiencing a very, very
rapid uptick. We have a number of key features. One is in memory. The other is multitenant. And people are moving to
the latest version of our database more rapidly than they traditionally do. And we're seeing – and you saw the evidence
of that in Q4.
Operator
Our next question...
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thank you.
Operator
...comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore.
<Q - Kirk Materne>: Thanks, and my congrats on a great end to the fiscal year. Mark, I was wondering if you could
provide a bit more detail on the strength in ERP business in the cloud, and why that seems to be accelerating? And just
as a quick follow up, I noticed you didn't provide any customer accounts this quarter by pillar, so I was wondering if
you might have those numbers for us as well. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I was trying to save time. But sure, I'm glad to cover it. We had a little less than 1,600 new
SaaS customers; 1,575 in the quarter. We had 1,138 expansions in the quarter. Roughly 400 of those customers who
bought SaaS also bought Platform-as-a-Service. So again, the attach rate between apps and PaaS continues to
strengthen.
ERP, we had 868 new customers. Now by the way, Kirk, that doesn't include NetSuite, so that's just inside the
traditional Oracle ERP business. We had almost 200 expansions. That's a big deal because as we start to sell in many
cases financials, we're now being able to sell supply chain, procurement and manufacturing into that base as well.
Another good thing for us in the quarter is roughly two-thirds of the new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before.
So again, this is, again, 66%, 65% brand-new logos to Oracle. So HCM, we had about 325, 326 new customers and 300
expansions; a little over 600 in marketing, sales and service, and about 670 expansions. So sort of all-in, we have now
about 13,550 customers in our SaaS active base. If you do include NetSuite, that number gets to 25,000. About 75% of
everything we did in the quarter was Fusion. Again, that would not include NetSuite. So that's roughly speaking how
the metrics worked out in the quarter. I hope that helps.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.
<Q - Sarah Hindlian>: All right. Thank you. I'd like to add congratulations, too. That's a really phenomenal quarter
around this aggressive cloud transition. And I just had a couple questions I wanted to address for the team. Safra, I want
to start with you. You just reiterated the fiscal 2018 double-digit earnings growth. And I guess I think what's becoming
more relevant is, do we think about this as a one-year phenom bouncing off of this difficult transition? Or how can we
really be thinking about earnings growth beyond fiscal 2018 into 2019 in 2020?
And then, Mark, my second question is for you. Really interested in hearing some of these larger logo wins you cited in
SaaS and ERP and HCM in particular, and yet you're still seeing and we're still continuing to hear about a lot of traction
for you in the mid-market reflected in some of your other comments. So I'm trying to wrap my head around some of
these larger logos, because we're hearing pick-up especially on the ERP vertical given its sheer size. And I'm hoping
you can guide us as to where we are with some of those large logos in terms of go-live, pipeline, et cetera. That would

be really tremendously helpful.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. So this is absolutely not a one-year phenomena. In fact, what you should see as this goes
on is we will have less drag from the transition and the base will continue to grow. And so this should really accelerate.
And understand that in our PaaS IaaS business, we're not even at scale. So as we really scale that up, profitability is
going to increase more quickly. And revenues would be built on the base of another recurring revenue – off the
recurring revenue business. So we've been basically turning and we've had the drag of the move away from our historic
business to some extent. And revenue recognition that's not upfront but ratable.
Then all of a sudden you're going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud
business. So we're obviously very optimistically indicated to you all during last year – this past year, that this thing was
coming, and it has clearly come in Q4. And this next year and years after that are now going be building on that base.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: To your other question, yes, we've got some very large active HCM customers. Today we've got
Airtel, I don't know, they're probably 30,000 users, American Eagle, 40,000 users; Fairmont Raffles Hotels, 42,000
users; Siemens, 60,000 users; Wells, 275,000 users; Xerox, 38,000; Schneider Electric, over 100,000. These are big,
big customers. And, Sarah, those are just HCM, so those are obviously very big scale customers.
Now that said, in ERP, Europe, you're right in what you said. we have a lot of mid-market upper mid-market wins and
a lot of new logos to Oracle who were not doing business with Oracle before they made this acquisition. And that's
certainly been a fantastic strength. Our cloud is made up of a lot of new logos in addition to some existing customers.
Now in terms of scaled ERP customers though, Orange is – they're using financials, procurement, projects, supply
chain management; GE Digital, Qualcomm, Hearst, Tesco, Caesars. These are just off the top of my head. So these are
big-scaled ERP customers.
Now to Larry's point, and I'll make it a little bit about HCM and ERP. The TAM in ERP is materially bigger than the
TAM in HCM. So the TAM in ERP is three to four times bigger in ERP. And additionally, ERP drags HCM or can
drag HCM in the transaction. So these big ERP references that we have and obviously with the number we closed in Q4
and are going live now every quarter, more to come. We've seen increasing pull of HCM in these big ERP transactions.
And they are true in the mid-market and in the up market. I hope that helps.
Operator
Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies.
<Q - John DiFucci>: Thank you. These are impressive results, and I'll let others focus on those details.
Mark, I'd like, if you could, talk a little more about the AT&T deal. AT&T as you've pointed out in the press release
when that came out has been a customer of Oracle, and we all know that. So I guess the question is how incremental is
this deal to Oracle? Is it a price uplift because you're providing the entire infrastructure with cloud versus just the
software, or does it also include new workloads? I guess can you give us any idea about how much incremental
business, assuming there is some which I think there obviously is, this means for you versus your previous relationship
with AT&T?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. So first, I'm not going to give you really all that many details from a financial
perspective.
So to your point, was AT&T a good customer before this happened? Yes. Is AT&T going to be an even better customer
going forward? Yes. Is AT&T giving us more revenue than before? Yes. Did AT&T give us any incremental revenue
in Q4? No. So is this deal ratable over time? Yes. Is it a long-term agreement? Yes, it's a very long-term agreement.
Let me try give you a little bit more color. First, it is a long-term deal. AT&T has over 10,000 Oracle databases. They
have several hundred – and you might say, John, that's a small percent of their overall databases, but they have several
hundred large databases that have 70% – 75% of all of their company's data. They badly wanted to get the benefits of

consolidation of that infrastructure.
Yet in many cases, they've got regulatory pressures on what they can put in the public cloud and what they can't. This is
an example where we've talked about this before. We take our Oracle Cloud Machine, and we are able now to do all of
that with them on their premise and give them all the benefits of the cloud. We manage, we patch, we basically run the
cloud for them, and we help them get all of that done.
And so as great a deal as this is, this is even a bigger deal, John, in what it represents for our entire customer base. This
is a bigger deal to us than the transaction. It is the opportunity for us to now do this for hundreds and thousands and
tens of thousands of customers. The opportunity for us in the quarter, and the reason I assume we put the press release
out was AT&T being so effusive about their opportunity now and what it meant for them internal to AT&T. But it's
just, if not more important for us and what we can do for all of our customers.
Just to give you a little bit more data, not in any of our hardware numbers is we did in excess of 100 Oracle Cloud
Machines in the quarter, which are, again, us bringing all of the capabilities of our public cloud to our customers in
their data center. So that's some details, although not the financial details of the deal. But frankly, John, I think it's just
as important what it means to our customers going forward on the bigger-picture level.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: If I could just say one other thing to John, so the issue is really for the folks who have a large
installed basis of Oracle database, and they've done the research of where those workloads should be, they pick Oracle.
That's really what this shows. The folks who could go anywhere and do anything come to us, and that's really the
important message, and we're seeing that throughout the customer base, and you're going to start to see it in revenues.

Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much. This question could be for Mark or Safra. I mean, obviously, the
cloud bookings number was very strong, and I was wondering if you could just share with us any color on the impact
that NetSuite might have had on the growth rate for cloud bookings?
And also, while I know you're not guiding to fiscal 2018, Cloud SaaS PaaS growth, I'm just wondering if you could
share with us – Mark, you commented about doing better – an expectation to do better than $2 billion in new cloud
ARR. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your confidence level there?
And then, just for the sake of clarity since we do get this question from time to time, this $2 billion-plus number that
you mentioned is all new cloud business, and does not include renewal, so if you could just clarify that for people.
Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, it's great. You gave me one question with five parts, so I'm going to try my best to
remember all your questions and answer. First, our bookings, our new and expansion bookings, they do not include
renewals. There are no renewals in the ARR that we report, okay, point one.
Point two, how did NetSuite do? I think they did terrific, I think they just did terrific. I think they're very stable. We've
seen some acceleration in their growth rates from when they were a public company. I think they've just done terrific.
So we're thrilled with the acquisition. We're thrilled with how they're performing. We're thrilled with the synergy inside
Oracle. And I want to make sure I'm clear, that's not rhetoric. I mean, we're really thrilled, but I have no facial
expression I can give you so you can see it.
Our pipeline is big. How confident am I in more cloud bookings than this year? Extremely, put quotes around
extremely, underline it. But, that said, I think we're going to have a terrific year in the context of a terrific pipeline. So I
think I covered all your points.

Our next question is from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: Hey. Thanks, guys. And congrats on really a fabulous fiscal Q4, and thank you for the
increased disclosure in terms of on-premise breakdown of IaaS versus Platform. When I look at your Q4 results in the
context of full year, it's basically almost impossible to argue that Oracle's not at the re-accelerating revenue growth
inflection point in its transition to cloud. Mark, when you talk about apps, obviously, it's been growing mid- to high
single-digits, which is an acceleration from last year, you talked about accelerating 10% this coming fiscal year.
So my question about – to either you or Safra is, when you think about the platform side of the business here at Oracle,
that's been growing in the low single digits. Where does that business sit in terms of its lifecycle transition of the cloud
in terms of just the trajectory of net revenue growth? And I just have one follow-up to that.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Give us the follow-up first, then we can pace ourselves through the answers.
<Q - Philip Winslow>: The idea would be is if the PaaS side continues to take off and I want to put it through then to
context of Safra's comments about CapEx being lower this year, because the question I get is is that hey, if this
transition to the cloud is working, why is Oracle's, call it operating model, different than cloud? Why is Oracle so
efficient in terms of its – call it infrastructure spend in the cloud? Maybe that's a good question for Larry, actually.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah. Great. Okay. Do you want this one?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: All right. Well, let me just talk a little bit about PaaS and IaaS together. The old IaaS was, as
you know, a slower growing business. Our Gen 2 IaaS, much faster; PaaS, much faster. As it completely overwhelms
the base of our old IaaS, you're going to see acceleration. You must see acceleration because it is inevitable as we do
more and more transactions and bookings which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle
workloads to us, so you're going to see that's a very big area.
Now, as far as margins, remember, in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same. However,
what you see though is there's enormous value in both our automation and in our technology, whether it's different
pieces of software that are in there. And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high. We have always –
it's still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here and we all sign off on every data center
expansion and all the hardware that goes in it.
So we really are very, very careful on getting not too far ahead of our revenues but also benefiting from massive
economies of scale. This past year, we did a lot of build-out for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the
financial statements, but it will be. So depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins, by the time it's
the end of the year, we expect even PaaS IaaS margins to be better. And but we do feel we can do it within our CapEx
envelope.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. So let me comment. What is different? Why do we not have these huge build-outs
and then wait for the revenue? We have a just-in – we have a system, we build our own hardware. We build virtually
all of our own hardware. I mean not some of the network switches, we buy those from Arista.
We don't ship computers to any of our data centers until we have pretty firm orders for capacity. We're constantly
measuring how much our data centers are used. As our data centers reach, let's say I'll pick a number, 75% – 80%
utilization, we get to some threshold then we start to replenish and add compute and storage capacity to the data
centers. It's a just-in-time system. Those components that grow and go to Frankfurt or go to London or go to Singapore
or go to any of our data centers around the world. But we do it in such a way that once we ship, we know that we're
going to have a very, very high utilization rate at our data centers. So it's just-in-time shipment and we only ship when
they cause something like a 75% or 80% utilization at that data center.

So we don't have a lot of unused capacity. So if, let's just say, if our CapEx was double what Safra's forecast next year,
that's great news because then our PaaS revenues or – and infrastructure revenues would be much higher and make up
for it with much higher profits. I don't know if that's clear. We don't make it until – in a sense we've already sold it.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Right.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah. Last point, first of all, just to add to everything Larry said, virtually most of the COGS
other than what Larry identified that sits in the data centers is ours. And then all of our R&D is aligned to all of our
COGS and so we have both the advantage of being the major supplier to ourselves in addition to all of the R&D that we
have into our technology. So we get multiple benefits in addition to what Larry described. And Phil, just to be clear, I
just want to make sure I'm clear on my quote. I said roughly double digits on the application ecosystem growth next
year.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: All right. Let me add one more thing. How can we do it for less? So we build the kind of
storage systems that Amazon doesn't have and Microsoft doesn't have. And those storage systems are really a
combination of flash and disk-stored. And we have these huge flash caches in front of the disk. So from the customers'
standpoint, they think almost all the data is coming from flash and it has flash response times and flash performance.
But we can do that, we can deliver that with hard disk costs. So we can deliver that at about, I don't know, 20% the cost
of our competition. So storage is a huge component of what the cloud providers are selling. And we just have the better
mouse trap. We have a better storage hierarchy system than they do. Therefore, we can provide very, very high
performance at a dramatically lower cost to us than our competitors.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America.
<Q - Kash Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much, congratulations. Curious if you could talk about what drove the
strength in license revenue this quarter. It's certainly much better than most people's expectations. Did you have any
products were phased out or were comped out that you had any sort of pull-in, potentially?
And secondarily, Safra, you talked about long-term SaaS gross margins approaching potentially 80%. And if this
AT&T deal is a harbinger of more databases transitioning to a PaaS model, what does the longer term outlook for gross
margins for the entirety of the cloud business look like? And finally, I have to sneak in one for Mark. Any thoughts on
the sales force as you approach fiscal 2018? Any changes, re-org, et cetera? That's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: That has to break every rule in the question etiquette, Kash. I think first off, let me go to license
to quarter. There is no standout event. There is no product that that discontinued. There was no single transaction.
There was no geography. I would say North America, I will say first of all, I'm overall very proud of our sales org in
general, but North America was very strong again. I think they did a great job across both of our teams in North
America. But we were solid really across every geography. There was just no real – Asia was strong for us, Japan. I
could go on. So there was no deal, there was no product, there was no geography. It was just really a broad-based
performance overall. Anyone want to talk about the gross margins?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yeah, okay. So SaaS gross margins will continue to increase all of this coming year. We will
get closer and closer to my 80% goal by the end of the year. We probably won't hit 80%, but we'll be pretty close by Q4
in SaaS margins. So I think that's good news. As a result, margins for the entire cloud business will be up quite a bit by
the end. So I'm very, very upbeat and expect margins to improve a lot.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I forgot your sales re-org question. That's, again, I saw a couple of notes on that. I t's just like
sort of we're laying off salespeople. This is all just not true. So is our sales force shrinking? No. Do we change things in
our sales force? Sure. Is there any major re-org going on? No, but remember, our competitors change. We have some
very simple principles how we run the sales force. We line up our sales force by product. We line them up by buyer and

by competitor. That market tends – those dynamics can change. Our competitors change, as we've noted, over the past
several years. So you'll see some shift in our specialization. That's one point.
Second, we are building out, as we told you over the past couple years, big hubs that are doing a lot of our selling. So
we have the byproduct of that is that our sales force is actually increasing in numbers. But our cost per salesperson is
actually declining. So our overall productivity is actually inclining. Those phenomena occur simultaneously. So
anything that you hear about we're reducing our sales force, again, fake news, nothing that's going on here.
Second, we are increasing our sales force. We continually realign our specializations based on competitor, based on
product, based on buyer, and we continue to build out and are very happy with the continued progress of our hubbing
strategy. So hopefully, that answers your question about the sales force.

Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And also, a very, very nice end to FY
2017. Safra, as we're thinking about FY 2018, I think a big question investors are going to have is on the license
revenue side, the declines that we're expecting, should we be expecting something more in line with what we saw in
Q4, like that 5 percentage range in terms of decline? Or more so, should we be looking at like FY 2017, the full year –
like 10% to 15% decline as our benchmark in terms of how that license revenue decline is going to progress throughout
FY 2018?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Hey, Keith. I think this is quite cute. You know I didn't give guidance on new software license
growth because it's become less and less relevant. So I don't actually intend to give it now. But I'll give you a chance to
ask another question, if you've got one.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Sure. Shifting gears to repurchases.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: Perhaps the levels of repurchases that were done in Q4 have dropped down in terms of what
we've seen in like FY 2016 in the first half of the year, probably having do with where U.S. cash is versus overseas
cash. Can you give us an idea of how you guys are thinking about those repurchases...
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure.
<Q - Keith Eric Weiss>: ...into FY 2018?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Sure, absolutely, love to. So as you guys know, as I told you, we spent quite a bit of money on
NetSuite, and so I needed to pay that back. And I've got a couple quarters of still paying that back. And as a general
matter, we like to buy back quite a lot of our stock, significantly more than at the $500 million a quarter that we've been
on since we bought NetSuite. So once I've paid all that back, assuming that I don't buy anything else big, I expect that
we will do what we always do, which is send the money back to you all because it's your money. And so we will buy
out your partners, and so share repurchases should go up.
However, our stock price is going up also, so we may be spending more. But lucky us, lucky all of us, the stock price is
going up, which means sometimes I will get less shares. So once I've paid back NetSuite, I do expect to spend more
than $500 million a quarter, assuming I don't buy anything else and anything else really significant. But I don't know
how many shares I'll get back because of course I don't know what the stock price will be at that time.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question?

Our final question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. Congratulations on the strong quarter.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Thank you.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: So given software support is continuing to grow, which suggests that the cloud is
predominantly net new workloads from either new or existing customers, we would expect that at some point soon your
customers are going to start moving existing workloads to the cloud. So couple of parts to the question, when do you
expect Oracle apps and Oracle database support revenue to start moving to the cloud? Which moves first? What do you
expect the impact will be? And lastly, what of the migration is baked into your confidence for FY 2018 cloud ARR?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay, all of it's baked into our view, so there's no new news here. So let me flip the metric on
you. If 65%, which is not an uncommon number we've given you over the past several quarters, it is coming from net
new logos, then the flip of that is 35% is coming from our existing base. So we have seen our existing base move, they
just, to your point, move slower than what the new logos have. I actually think this is a good thing because I believe
that we will get all of our existing customers on-prem, roughly speaking, moving to our cloud infrastructure over time.
Now, in addition, when we do move, and I want to make sure I'm clear and say it again, as we now have a lot more data
than I would have had two years ago. When a customer who's on-prem paying us support moves to the cloud, they pay
us more money. They don't pay us 1:1. They don't pay us 2:1. They pay us more like 3:1. In some cases, more than 3:1.
In some cases, we also get the attach of Platform to the SaaS that we get as well, and that is not included in the 3:1 that
I'm giving you. So we are actually very positive about the fact that if people move from our application support to our
SaaS revenue, we get more money.
And to Safra's point about what's going on with our gross margins, we now produce better performance at the bottom
line, because we get more revenue at a very high margin rate. So I expect that to continue as we get more references,
Mark, in ERP, et cetera. You're going to see that accelerate. We want that to accelerate, and that acceleration is a good
thing for our customers, and it's a good thing for Oracle's shareholders.
Now, the reason we made the deal that we made, a big deal we made, over AT&T is because of the implication that has
on our database business, that is a – and Safra couldn't have said it better, but this is now a customer who is now a
reference in the public domain explaining why, and now I think you will see that same migration as time goes on.
We have more customers like them, who are in the middle of the process of moving now. And I gave you an example
of how much infrastructure was bought in Q4 of Oracle Cloud Machines just as a – that is one surrogate for what's
happening. And if that occurs, we will get more revenue as well, and I predict that we'll be able to deliver higher levels
of service, more functionality, more capability, more modernization as we do it. So I think you've begun to see it in the
application business. We love what we see in the applications business so far, and I think you're at the beginning of
seeing it in the Database business as well.
