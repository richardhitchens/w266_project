MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Charter Communications Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Jo Moehle, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications.
Ma'am you may begin.
Mary Jo Moehle, Investor Relations
Thank you, Carmen. Good morning. And thank you for joining our conference call, as we report Charter's earnings for
the third quarter of 2010. The results we're reporting this morning are included in a news release we issued over PR
Newswire at 8 AM Eastern Time and posted on our Web site, charter.com. The Web site also contains the presentation
that accompanies today's comments.
Before we proceed, I'd like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. We will not review those risk factors and other
cautionary statements on this call; however, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. You are cautioned that any forward-looking statements
reflect management's current view only, and that Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements

or make additional forward-looking statements in the future.
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting as required by GAAP. As a result, our
pre-emergence financial statements are not comparable in some respects to those following our emergence from
bankruptcy. However, the revenue and expense items through adjusted EBITDA that we will discuss this morning were
not impacted by fresh start adjustments.
During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma results for 2009 and
2010. The pro forma results reflect the divestitures of cable systems in 2009 and 2010 as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2009, unless otherwise noted. Also on this morning's call, we'll be referring to pro forma year-over-year
growth rates.
Joining me on today's call are Mike Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Howard, Chief
Accounting Officer, who will be proving an overview of our business, discussing the Company's quarterly performance
and reviewing our capital structure. Additionally, Marwan Fawaz, Executive Vice President of Operations and Chief
Technology Officer; and Ted Schremp, our Chief Marketing Officer, are also here to help answer your questions. As
well as Chris Winfrey, our new CFO.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. We are three quarters through the year, and I am pleased with our results today.
Before I get into the detail on the third quarter, I want to provide a quick update on our leadership team.
With the two recently announced additions, our senior team is complete. Don Detampel joined us last month to head up
Commercial Services. He's an innovative leader with more than three decades of industry experience. I'm also pleased
to introduce Chris Winfrey, our new CFO. Chris brings us substantial experience across different competitive
broadband markets in Europe.
Chris, would you like to say a few words?
Christopher L. Winfrey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. It is great to be here. I came to Charter because I saw the market opportunity in both the Residential and
Commercial businesses. The big attractions are the operating focus of Mike and the team. They embrace the detail of
operational control and the strategic opportunities for our industry. I'm only day three, focused right now on better
learning the business, but look forward to spending more time with our investor community in the coming months.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris. While our strategy has several key areas of focus, the foundation is enhancing the customer experience.
It is more than customer care and technical operations. It's also about enhancing our product portfolio, maintaining that
work performance and providing a winning value proposition. We are broadly launching Switched Digital Video and
DOCSIS 3.0, taking advantage of our platform capabilities, to provide an improved experience through higher Internet
speeds and greater choices.

The Video Entertainment business is changing, and we're embracing that change. The number of connected devices in
the home is growing, as are the sources of content. We believe we are in a unique position to act as a solutions provider
to the consumers we serve, bringing meaningful new content choices and applications to the living room and beyond.
We are pursuing several avenues to provide online content, all with the intent of delivering greater value to our
customers. Our efforts currently underway range from offering exclusive live sports via ESPN3.com; to providing
access to a vast library of movies via the EpixHD.com, along with our current TV Everywhere trials.
We launched the trial this summer, primarily to test the authentication platform and model. And perhaps more
importantly, better understand consumer wants, needs and usage patterns. We see a unique opportunity to leverage our
platform to make content available to our customers wherever and whenever they want it. We intend to embrace and
enable these new technologies, and we're in the final stages of defining our next generation Video platform.
The consumer demand for speed is increasing, and customers that rely on our Home Networking service continue to
grow. With our speed superiority and strong content position, I believe we have the opportunity to further build on our
position as the overall solutions provider for our customers in the evolving IP world.
We continue to improve the many touch points with our customers. As most of you are aware, last year we completed a
billing system conversion, moving to a single platform, which allowed us to streamline our processes and create more
simplicity for our customers. As a result, during the third quarter, we saw an 18% reduction in billing-related costs.
This is just one example of where we're seeing positive impacts.
While we've made progress in enhancing the overall customer experience, there is still much work to be done. And I
am confident we're on the right path to make meaningful improvements across all aspects of the end-to-end experience.
Looking at Slide 4, we're focused on generating profitable revenue growth, and I am pleased with our third quarter and
year to-date results. As well as the progress we're making on our longer-term strategic initiatives.
Third quarter revenue was up 4.6% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.5%. We increased revenues by
about 80 million, and grew adjusted EBITDA by about 30 million, despite a challenging environment. We have
generated consistent revenue growth throughout the year, exercising discipline and effectively balancing price and
volume, as we aim to maximize customer lifetime value.
Margin remained essentially flat with the year-ago quarter. As I've said before, we're making investments in the
Commercial business, and the rollout of SDV and DOCSIS 3.0. Those impacts were offset by benefits of those
investments coming in earlier than anticipated, as well as disciplined and customer care and marketing.
We generated 135 million in free cash flow in the third quarter, and 467 million year-to-date. We're positioned to
continue to generate free cash flow. And given the value of our NOLs, we don't anticipate being a significant income
tax payer for several years.
Approximately two-thirds of total revenue growth in the quarter came from our Residential business, primarily driven
by Internet and The Bundle. As you can see in the chart on Slide 5, we're leveraging the superiority of our DOCSIS 3.0
platform, as we continue to create new relationships, not necessarily tied to video. These are valuable, high-margin
relationships, providing the opportunity to sell in other products over time.
We added nearly 60,000 RGUs during the quarter, led by Internet and Digital. In the Video product line, the 64,000
Video customer loss consisted of basic-only customers, while Digital growth for the quarter was almost double last
year. And growth year-to-date was nearly four times the year-ago period. Our Digital service provides increased value
for our customers, and we continue to increase penetration, as we add more choice and functionality.
Internet additions remained strong at 51,000 for the quarter. With the addition of 30,000 Phone customers, Bundle
penetration increased to 60%. Triple play penetration continues to climb, with triple-play sell-in throughout our call
centers increasing year-over-year. We continue to see significant benefits from bundling, including higher ARPU,
customer satisfaction and retention. And we're leveraging the price guarantee to grow Bundle relationships and further
improve customer lifetime value.

Our total Video, Internet and Phone customer additions for the quarter were 17,000. And for the year, we added
145,000 compared to 166,000 last year. We're especially pleased with the strength in Internet, with the year to-date net
additions up 30% year-over-year.
The Commercial business represents a significant growth opportunity. We're building momentum. With 12% revenue
growth for the third quarter, we increased sequential growth throughout the year, and we're making investments to
serve new segments and extend our reach.
As I mentioned earlier, we've hired Don Detampel to lead the Commercial business. He's an experienced industry
leader in the commercial space with a strong financial, operational and technological background. Commercial
provides opportunity to create an incremental revenue stream on our existing assets; one that requires a focused
approach. I'm excited about the opportunities here, and we're well positioned to capture share.
We also generated 19% growth in Ad sales during the quarter. I am pleased with our overall performance in Ad Sales,
which include benefits from political advertising. The core Ad Sales business is also strong, and we're investing in new
capabilities in interactive advertising to enhance our growth potential.
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin, who will cover the financials in more detail. But first, I want to thank him for
serving as Interim CFO during our search. He's done a great job, and we thank him for all he's done. Thanks, Kevin.
Kevin D. Howard, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President,
Controller and Chief Accounting Officer
Thanks, Mike. Revenues totaled $1.77 billion for the quarter, up 4.6%. Year-to-date, revenues are up 4.7%. Video
revenues were essentially flat in the quarter. Decreases in basic Video customers were offset by strong Digital and
Advanced Services sales.
The Digital platform creates an opportunity for our customers to drive additional value from our services. HD and DVR
penetration is now at 50%, and On Demand usage is up nearly 20% from a year ago. The increase in the Digital
penetration, and use of these advanced services drove a 5% increase in Video ARPU.
Internet revenues were up 8.9% to 404 million. Internet ARPU increased about 1% as a result of our pricing and
packaging strategies, and continued growth in Home Networking. About 19% of our Internet customers now rely on
Charter for their home networking solution, up more than 50% from a year ago.
Phone revenues increased 8.3%, driven by continued bundled growth. Residential Phone ARPU decreased 4.6%
year-over-year, reflecting phones' role in our bundled pricing strategy. In total, Residential revenue was up 3.5%
year-over-year contributing approximately two-thirds of total revenue growth.
Commercial revenue increased 11.5% to 126 million, reflecting increased SMB and Fiber-based sales. As Mike
indicated, we continue to make operating and capital investments to expand our Commercial offerings to generate
future growth.
Advertising revenues increased 19% as a result of improvements across all sectors, primarily in Political and
Automotive.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 4.5% year-over-year. Operating costs and expenses increased 6.6%
for the quarter. Programming increased 5.7%, primarily as a result of contractual increases. Other operating expenses
increased 7.9%, driven by increases in the activities related to strategic investments in SDV, DOCSIS 3.0, and our
Commercial business.
Margin remained relatively flat, as we're beginning to see the early benefits of these investments and are realizing
efficiencies in our care operation and marketing, which offset the increases related to investments and programming
costs.

We will continue these investments to enhance our product platform and service, and we will expect to further realize
the benefits of these investments as we move into 2011.
Capital expenditures totaled 299 million for the quarter, a 20 million increase year-over-year, primarily due to strategic
investments. About 76% of CapEx in the quarter was success base, consistent with prior year. We spent about 34
million in capital on the Commercial business during the quarter.
We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be approximately 1.2 billion. We generated 135 million of free cash flow
in the quarter and 467 million year-to-date, and are positioned to continue generating free cash flow. With 6.3 billion in
NOLs, about 3.5 billion of which are available through 2014, we don't expect to be a significant cash income tax payer
in the near future.
As we continue to evaluate potential uses of our anticipated future free cash flows we will consider all of our options,
including reducing leverage and investing in strategic opportunities, as well as other options.
Moving to the balance sheet and liquidity, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our projected operating cash
needs. In late September we raised 1 billion of 7.25% Senior Notes at CCO Holdings, and used the proceeds to pay
down credit facility debt. While we had 682 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter, the majority of that was
used to fund prepayments of term loans on October 1st. Pro forma for those prepayments, we had about 1.1 billion of
availability under our revolver.
We have been actively extending our debt maturities throughout the year. And we – throughout the year, we extended
more than 6 billion of debt, and we have less than 2 billion of debt maturing in the next three and-a-half years. We'll
continue to be opportunistic in extending and balancing our maturity profile.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kevin. I'm confident we're making the right investments to enhance our products and services, expand our
revenue opportunity and improve the customer experience. We're in a strong competitive position, we're generating free
cash flow and our employees are energized around this new phase for Charter.
We're happy to take your questions now. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instruction] Your first question is from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: Guys, good morning. This is Jeff Wlodarczak. Can you quantify what the effect on EBITDA
was in the third quarter, some of those one-time OpEx investments? And are you still comfortable those investments
are only going to hit in hit 2010?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Jeff, it's a great question. As you recall, we
mentioned that we had about 1.3 points of compression associated with these investments in Q2. We saw that cut in
half in this quarter. And we anticipate that to continue to decline through Q4, and then enter 2011 back to where we
were, and getting the benefit of those investments throughout the year.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: All right. Great. And then Comcast noted on their third quarter call that they saw improving
trends beyond seasonality in September and October. Are you seeing the same thing, and are there any signs the
economy's starting to improve for you guys?

<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think it's a little early for us to claim victory on
the economy improving, but we are seeing improving trends. And I would particularly highlight on our Internet
product, we see continued strength there. As you can see in the results that we just shared, in Q3 we saw a decline in
our other products relative to year-over-year net gain. But we saw strength in our Internet product where we were
relatively flat with prior-year quarter. And we see that continuing.
<Q - Jeff Wlodarczak>: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator
And your next question is from the line of Mike Pace with J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Michael Pace>: Hi. Thank you. Couple questions. Can you give us an update on the timing of your next retrans
agreements – or renewals, when you need to start renegotiating those? And then the bigger-picture questions. Now
with, I guess, Digital penetration approaching 75% and then going higher from there, I guess, can you just remind us
what you're doing on the front of all-digital versus Switch Digital? And whether going all digital makes sense in some
of your markets?
And then for Mike, or maybe Ted on this one. As far as the marketing dollars that you're spending, is there a program
in place where you're going after HSD and telephone-only subscribers, particularly with I guess DOCSIS 3.0
deployments? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, Mike. I'll take the first question on retrans
and then have Ted handle the other two questions that you asked. We have all the O&Os under contract through 2011.
So we feel like we're in a pretty good position relative to retrans negotiations. And there obviously are going to some
small regional players that we'll negotiate with at the local level but don't see any significant challenges with that. Ted?
<A - Ted Schremp>: So on the video question and all-digital versus SDV, as we've shared, we've been focused on
SDV primarily to open up high-definition capacity, and then reclaim bandwidth for other purposes as we go forward.
Mike mentioned that we're in the final stages of defining our next generation television strategy, and certainly not
prepared today to talk about that in any great detail. But certainly see a real opportunity to continue down the path of
sort of aggregating content solutions, whether they be IP-delivered content solutions or more traditionally delivered
content solutions pretty much to every device in the home that, on a long-term basis, will serve as a client for content
consumption. So more to come on that.
From a marketing perspective, the question on non-Video relationships, we have a product in market in today called
DUO, that's actually a bundle of Internet and Phone. It's designed, in large part, for DVS households, we've had some
success with. Generally speaking, we're leading with our Internet product.
Certainly, we see folks that say they choose to make another selection for their video solution provider; certainly
should have a superior broadband product in the home, so – both with DOCSIS 3.0. And more generally, we're finding
a great deal of success. As we look at our market share data, we've been very pleased with the results so far this year,
liked the trends that we saw in Q3 as well.
<Q - Michael Pace>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. This is Ben Swinburne. I wanted to come back to a couple
of questions, maybe revisit the sort of next generation video product. I know it's early on that. But one of things we've
seen out of Comcast and a couple of the other operators is this idea of an online aggregation portal for the customers to

access all this authenticated content. And I think that seems to be where the cable industry is aimed. And I'm
wondering if you guys would be willing to comment on where you think the content owners are on that? It seems to be,
from my perspective, a little bit all over the place. But maybe we're getting to a consensus faster, but I'd love your
thoughts on that front.
And then if I could ask two more. One, you highlighted on the Commercial slide, Mike, the Fiber opportunity, which is
one that I think everyone feels is an important one, but would love some more color on how you get there. Do you have
the people in place today, the product offerings? What's the competitive environment look like?
And then just the housekeeping question maybe for Kevin on working capital. I think you've generated 130 million or
so of positive cash from working capital this year. Is that a good run rate for the full year, or will that reversed out in
4Q?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: So I'll start with the next gen. And, obviously, I
think most of the question that you're asking here, Ben, is probably better answered by the content players. But from
our perspective, we're certainly following Comcast, Time Warner and other industry leaders from a technology
standpoint. I think that is clearly one of the benefits of this industry and the collegial nature of that; that we all have the
benefit of the R&D associated with some of the bigger players. And philosophically, we couldn't be more aligned with
where things are going from an online standpoint.
From a content standpoint, I guess I'd pull it back to 30,000 feet and look at the ecosystem. The business model in the
Subscription business that we have today and the relationship we have with content players today is a healthy one. And
one would think that logic would apply, and we would take that same healthy approach to a successful business model
for all partners into this new endeavor.
Regarding the Commercial Fiber business, we're obviously very excited about this. And again, adding a seasoned
leader like Don Detampel to help us not only drive deeper penetration in the small and medium business base, where
we've had a fair amount of success to-date. But also moving up market into new segments, I think, is a tremendous kind
of value add for Charter to have that type of leadership. In the couple of weeks that Don's been here, we've spent a fair
amount of time looking at where we have opportunities and where we have gaps.
From a people standpoint, I feel like we're in the right place. Product, we feel like we have the roadmap; we're on the
right path and it's really about accelerating down that path from a product development and deployment standpoint.
And competitively, and probably most importantly, this has been somewhat underserved and overpriced for quite some
time. And we feel like the robust pipe that we have allows us to play very successfully there. Kevin?
<A - Kevin D. Howard, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief
Accounting Officer>: On working capital, we don't expect it to – on an annual basis, working capital is basically flat.
But we don't see this trend actually changing in the fourth quarter. The current year was impacted quite a bit. One of
our biggest working capital items is our accrued interest and interest expense. And this year, due to our financing and
timings of those financings, you are seeing some of the benefits associated with that. But we don't see it trending out in
the fourth quarter. But on a annual basis, working capital is mainly a timing item in the cable industry.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks for the color.
<A - Kevin D. Howard, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief
Accounting Officer>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Jason Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just to follow up on a couple questions that
were asked before. You touched on your DUO product that are mainly marketed to your – the DVS household. So I'm
wondering, with the past year or so, how much of your Data and Phone customers' net adds came from households that

do not have a video relationship with you guys?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Jason, I'll have Ted answer that one. I think he's
probably closer to it than any of us.
<A - Ted Schremp>: Yeah. So we have – as we look at the trending schedule, you'll see the data in there on non-Video
relationships. I actually don't have the number right in front of me. I apologize.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Yeah. So I mean, I guess the reason I'm asking the question is because we understand that most of
the basic Video losses are coming from the low end and a single-play customers. But – and also, historically, cable
operators have looked at you cross selling and upselling the existing Video subscriber base to expand the revenue
stream from a particular household. So I'm just wondering how you guys view that going forward, as the basic losses
kind of is maintained at current levels?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Jason, it's a great question. And the way
we're looking at this is not at any specific product level; it's really about customer relationships. And, quite frankly, we
have a superior position with our Internet product, which I think allows us to penetrate households without a video
product.
And then, really, the long-term strategy is to be able to upsell off of that; whether it's Video, whether it's Phone or
additional products and services that we bring downstream. It's really having the relationship. And one thing to
probably highlight is the margin associated with that relationship relative to those lower-end basic Video customers,
significantly higher.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Yeah.
<A - Ted Schremp>: Might just add a bit more color to it, so apologizes for not having the data earlier. So we did see a
nice acceleration in the creation of non-Video relationships; actually contained in the slide deck. You'll see that. We've
talked before about our direct response capabilities and the targeting we have there around – essentially it's
fundamentally propensity models. And there's a number of ways we can tune that platform. One, obviously, against
customer migration and the addition of RGUs.
Mike referenced earlier in the comments, a real focus there on customer lifetime value. So a lot of our traditional
migration activity that you referenced before is very much tuned at this point to both the churn reduction benefit of
triple play; obviously, the additions of RGUs and revenue. But importantly, the churn reduction that we get from price
guarantees; there's been a lot of focus there.
On the non-subscriber acquisition side, to the point you made, there's – both between DUO and other concepts,
certainly many of them built on leading with Internet and leading with Home Networking, we found a number of new
levers that help us focus on penetrating those folks that we haven't traditionally had relationships with. And all of that
shows up in our non-Video acceleration.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay. And then the next question is on the retrans side. You guys recently started passing through
some of the retrans fees customers. I'm just wondering if you've seen any reactions from your subscribers so far?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. We actually – it's interesting you mention that.
When you think about the historic rate adjustments in the cable industry, there's an annual rate card adjustment that has
historically been passed along to the lion's share of the customers.
As we've been marketing our packages, and particularly our Price Guarantee Packages, which are a two-year guarantee.
We're really migrating to, what in essence is similar to any other subscription business, where the individual household
comes up for renewal, and we have a point of contact where we move them into the next package that fits their needs
and desires.
Looking at the adjustment associated with retrans, we thought this was the best way to not go back to historic rate card
rate adjustments but simply pass through the costs associated with carrying those broadcast services. And the reaction

from the customers has been very, very limited. We're very pleased with how this has played out.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Okay. Thank you. And just a quick – and I apologize for somewhat of a technical question. But just
looking at your 10-Q, why would there be a $34 million loss and extinguishment of bank debt for the October
paydown? Is that just a function of you having to think that marked below par in you books, and then the price you paid
to prepay them was just about the marked level, even though you didn't pay par – above par for those prepaid amounts?
<A - Kevin D. Howard, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief
Accounting Officer>: Yeah. What we did with fresh start accounting, we had to mark all that to fair value, and it was
on our books at a discount. And then with the paydown rate that we paid, the difference between that rate and what it
was on our books at produced the loss.
<Q - Jason Kim>: Understood. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of David Joyce with Miller Tabak Company [Miller Tabak and Co., LLC].
<Q - David Joyce>: Thank you. I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on the competition on the
various products that you saw on the third quarter because there was some reneweds – lower-price offers for DSL
offerings. Yet, you continued to grow your Internet product better than expected because of the higher speeds.
Then, and also on the Video side, there were some other – the competitive packages out there. I was just wondering, are
you seeing any win-back opportunities now after customers maybe have switched for promotional reasons?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. David, from a Internet standpoint, I think
you highlight what we're very pleased about regarding some of the deep discounting that we saw some – from some of
our DSL competitors. The continued strength of that product and the value proposition that we've been able to put in
the marketplace, from a speed standpoint, and also the experience the consumer gets along with that speed.
I also think the success we're having with our Home Networking product sets a deeper hook. And I think the fact that
people are hanging multiple devices off of that router in the household puts us in a very unique position because we're
providing speed to multiple devices and multiple users in the household.
From a video standpoint, we did see some additional – not dramatically aggressive, but we did see some additional
push from the satellite players' pricing. And I think that is evidenced in the loss that we have, particularly on the low
end. And as we noted, all of our losses in the quarter were from our basic-only households. So I think that probably
plays to the economy and some of the pricing that's being put in the marketplace from the satellite players. Ted, maybe
you can add a little more color on that on the Internet side.
<A - Ted Schremp>: Yeah. Quick comments on Internet. I mentioned share dynamics earlier. So from a –
year-to-date, we're up 30% year-over-year from an overall volume perspective. And as we look at our actual market
share data, we are getting the dominant share of all new Internet activity that's in – net new Internet activity that's in the
marketplace. So we're very pleased with that.
We think that all of that, again despite very, very aggressive discounting on the part of the DSL providers, really plays
into the value proposition, not just of our standard speed position but that much more so in DOCSIS 3.0 market.
I think we shared on our last quarter conference call that in DOCSIS 3.0 markets, we actually see folks upgrading to the
higher-speed tiers at twice the rate. And tying back to Mike's point on Home Networking, what we're really seeing
driving the demand for speed at this point is not just the applications and video download and gaming, all those sorts of
things. But just the massive proliferation of devices; I think these – all the smartphone coverage lately certainly
highlights the superiority of a WiFi connection. And, obviously, folks are relying on us, in large part, for that.

<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think when you think about Charter in this phase,
obviously, we're accelerating the deployments of Switched Digital Video and DOCSIS 3.0 to help close the gaps
relative to some of our industry peers. We are under penetrated relative to some of our larger industry peers on a
number of our product lines, but probably most importantly on the Internet product line. We've got DOCSIS 3.0 now
deployed to just over 35% of our homes passed. We expect to finish the year at 54%.
In comparison today, I believe Comcast last week talked about being roughly 80% of their homes passed. So we've got
opportunity to close the gaps. We're hitting the gaps fairly hard on those strategic investments to able to bring that
speed benefit to the lion's share of our homes passed between now and the middle part of 2011.
And I think you see the halo benefit of launching speed in the market. We've talked about that before where we see 2x
of the benefit once we launched DOCSIS 3.0. And I think we're starting to see that show up in share flow in a pretty
significant way.
<Q - David Joyce>: And the DOCSIS 3.0 should presumably be helping your effort to continue to grow on the
Commercial Services side. You've been in that market for a long time, and it's fairly sizable. But I was wondering if –
what your philosophy is on starting to break out the Commercial subscribers so we could parse out that portion of your
growth story?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. David, that's actually something that we're
actually debating today, and you may hear more about that in coming quarters. It is a substantial part of our business,
and we do understand the need to see greater detail around it.
<Q - David Joyce>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Hi. Thanks. Just two questions. One, could you provide updated statistics for the U-verse and
FiOS overlaps? And then the other question I had is, can you talk about what you've been seeing in Premium
subscription rates and – penetrations, that is, and also in Video-on-Demand revenue per user trends? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. The overlap for the quarter is roughly 27%
to 30% total RBOC overlap. The lion's share of that is AT&T. We have roughly 2% – 2% to 3% is FiOS. And, as FiOS
has publicly stated, they're not adding any additional markets. Though the lion's share of our RBOC competitive
over-builds is with AT&T U-verse. And I do believe that AT&T has announced that in 2011, they'll be pulling back on
additional deployments as well, and focusing on where they have network in place.
So again, 27% to 31% total Video over-builds from the RBOCs, and the lion's share of that; virtually all of it being
AT&T U-verse. Ted?
<A - Ted Schremp>: So on the Premiums front, just to sort of build up to that a bit, you've seen a pretty significant
acceleration in our Digital penetration on a year-over-year basis. Actually, so far this year we've – our Digital's – 4x –
the pace of growth is four times higher than it was in prior year. And that's been a very concerted effort for two reasons.
One is higher levels of customer satisfaction and, obviously, leveraging that as a platform to pull through Premium tiers
and Video-on-Demand. So we've seen some nice, positive trends in premium, just largely based on improved Digital
penetration, as well as packaging strategies.
The price guarantee that I referenced previously is generally built on triple play product portfolio. And as we get to
higher package price points, we provide more Premium content in those packages. And that activity is having a positive
pull-through benefit on Premium.
Speaking to VOD, our sessions up 20% on a year-over-year basis, as our unique subscribers in the platform continues
to grow as well. So the number of folks in the platform and the number of buys and/or sessions that we see has

improved as well. So we're pleased with the trends in Video-on-Demand as this point.
And, by the way, beyond transactional revenue value, there's quite a bit of retention value to both of those things.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Two follow-ups, if I may. On VOD, are you seeing growth in both free Video-on-Demand and
movie buys?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. We are.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Okay. And then on the Premiums, just a question on the cost structure there. Is it just the one
Premium channel where you're on a variable rate card, with the rest being on fixed – being a fixed-cost package for the
programming rights?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. They're primarily fixed, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you look at TV Everywhere, you started off
talking about it. And it's something that – this was first announced by Comcast and Time Warner, now, call it 15, 16
months ago. And it seems like I think to a lot of investors, at least, that this has proceeded broadly – and not blaming
Charter specifically, but proceeded far more slowly than was expected at a time where lot of the Internet-only, while
their content may be limited. The Internet-only companies are kind of reaching new devices and rolling out new press
releases every day.
And just wondering, from your perspective, what's been the biggest impediment? I mean, Time Warner just launched
an ESPN live stream, but that's really the first one of that form that's gone live. And what's holding this back? And is
there something that, over the next six to nine months, really accelerates this dramatically, where a lot of your
consumers started to have access to some of your best content across devices?
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think – I'd go back to the consumer, Rich. I
think a lot of this is an effort to identify what the needs and desires of the consumer are and their usage patterns. I agree
with you. There seems to be a press release every day about some type of opportunity. Whether or not those
opportunities come to fruition or not, even in the long term, remains to be seen.
I think the focus for us is simply to put together a next-gen product that leverages our existing platform, and then opens
up new capabilities for our customers. And we're looking at this from a product standpoint; that we would not be
rolling this out across the entire enterprise. We'd be selling it as a product to consumers that have a desire for this type
of opportunity.
I also think the focus in the near term for us, and I think for the cable industry, is looking at a set-top device that
improves the user interface, that allows ease of use with the significant amount of opportunity that we have today. Ted
was talking about Video-on-Demand. It's fairly complex to navigate today. With an improved UI, I think the consumer
gets significant benefit from the existing product that we offer today. And then in addition to that, has the online
capability as well.

<Q - Derek Apfel>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. It is actually Derek Apfel in for James. So we saw Video net
losses; they grew quarter-over-quarter, which is kind of contrary to typical seasonal trends. I'm wondering if you could
talk about what drove that in terms of gross adds verse churn. And more specifically, amongst churn, are you seeing
changes in where the customers are churning to? Is that Telco, satellite, over-the-top, et cetera? And if you could just
talk a little bit about what role the lapping of the digital transition played? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I'll take the last question, and then hand over
the other – first two to Ted. We didn't participate at the same level of some of our peers did last year with digital
transition. We weren't as aggressive in pricing promotional offers to that segment. So we don't see the same type of –
and I know that has been mentioned by other cable MSOs – that there was a roll-off of the 12-month promotional
offers. Since we didn't participate as aggressively, that's not driving performance in either Q2 or in this current quarter.
Ted?
<A - Ted Schremp>: And on your question on activity, it was predominantly on the connect side. We just saw lower
levels of activity in the marketplace, which we think is consistent with what we've seen from a housing perspective.
As it relates to competitive losses, haven't seen any specific changes there. But certainly the fact that economic
conditions are what they are, we realize that some folks, again, both based on the number of units contracting in the
marketplace. And then folks, in some cases, doing without or looking for other entertainment substitutes. So primarily
on the connect side.
<A - Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Derek, one of the things that we've done
strategically throughout the year is, we're not chasing volume for volume's sake. So, particularly into lower-end
households, we've seen some significant improvement in overall bad debt to the year. We've got fairly rigid credit
scoring on the front end.
So again, we are not chasing volume for volume's sake. And I think probably the best evidence again on focusing on
customer relationships; we're leveraging the superiority of our Internet product, focusing on growing that without
playing on price, but playing the value proposition on speed, and the experience that comes with it. And then again, on
the Video side, not playing a aggressive discounting game, despite what we see from some of our competitors.
<Q - Derek Apfel>: Great. Thanks a lot.
Michael J. Lovett, President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Well I'd like to thank you all for joining us today. And again, we're very confident as we move into this next
phase for Charter. And we have got a group of enthused employees focusing on improving the customer experience.
Thank you all.
