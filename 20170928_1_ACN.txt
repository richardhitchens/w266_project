MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings
conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Angie Park. Please go ahead.
Angie Park
Thank you, Greg, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2017 Earnings
Announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Angie Park, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On
today's call, you'll hear from Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and David Rowland, our
Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth
quarter and the full fiscal year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides
our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2018. We will then take your questions before Pierre
provides the wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements, or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on the call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as
such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other
SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on this
call.

During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We are very pleased with our excellent financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. For the year,
we clearly strengthened our leadership position in the new digital, cloud and security-related services, and once again
we gained substantial market share. We significantly increased our investments, including record investments in
strategic acquisitions, and I am particularly pleased that we did all of this while continuing to return substantial cash to
shareholders.
Here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered very strong new bookings of $37.4 billion. We generated record
revenues for the year of $34.9 billion, a 7% increase in local currency, with broad-based growth once again across our
business. We delivered earnings per share of $5.91 on an adjusted basis, an 11% increase.
Operating margin was 14.8% on an adjusted basis, an expansion of 20 basis points. We generated excellent free cash
flow of $4.5 billion. We returned $4.2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we
just announced a semiannual cash dividend of $1.33 per share, a 10% increase over our prior dividend.
So we had another very strong year, and I feel very good about our business, the execution of our strategy, and the
momentum we have as we enter the new fiscal year.
Now let me hand over to David who will review the numbers in greater detail. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks, all of you, for joining us on today's call.
Let me start by saying that we were extremely pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completed another
outstanding year for Accenture. Our results continue to provide strong validation of our leadership position in the
marketplace, the relevance of our offerings and capabilities to our clients, and our ability to manage our business in a
dynamic environment to deliver significant value to our clients, our people, and our shareholders.
Once again, our fourth quarter results reflect our ongoing focus to deliver strong and consistent financial results across
our three key imperatives for driving superior shareholder value, so let me summarize a few important highlights before
I get into the details.
Net revenue growth of 8% represented the strongest quarter of the year as we continue to benefit from our diverse and
durable growth model, which is powered by being a market leader in the New. Our digital, cloud, and security-related
services continued to drive very strong double-digit growth and represented over 50% of our total revenues.
Growth continued to be broad-based with positive growth across the vast majority of our industry groups, geographic
markets, and businesses, with many parts of our business delivering double-digit growth. And we estimate that we grew
more than three times the rate of growth of the basket of publicly traded companies as we continue to take share and
strengthen our position as a market leader.
Our operating margin of 14.2% came in as expected and up 10 basis points from last year, resulting in 20 basis points
of expansion on an adjusted basis for the full year. Importantly, we delivered this expansion while investing at record

levels in our business and our people. And with EPS of $1.48 in the fourth quarter, we delivered double-digit EPS
growth in both the quarter and the full year.
And finally, we delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow, $1.8 billion in free cash flow to be specific.
In terms of capital allocation, it's noteworthy that we closed 10 transactions in the quarter, giving us 37 transactions for
the full year, with record invested capital of $1.7 billion, which provided scale and capabilities in key growth areas and
further strengthened our leadership position in the New. So we had a strong close to fiscal 2017, which yielded another
year of broad-based growth and significant market share gains, underpinned by strong profitability and cash flow.
With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were
$10.1 billion for the quarter. Consulting bookings were $5.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings
were $5.0 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Our strong new bookings in the quarter represent 12% growth in local
currency and reflected an all-time high in new bookings in constant currency.
Our bookings were well-balanced, and we achieved our target book-to-bill across each of our five businesses. As you
would expect, the dominant theme driving our bookings in the quarter continued to be high demand for digital, cloud,
and security-related services, which we estimate represented more than 60% of our new bookings. For the full fiscal
year, we delivered $37.4 billion in new bookings, which represent 6% growth in local currency.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $9.1 billion, an 8% increase in both USD and local
currency, reflecting a roughly flat foreign exchange impact. This result was at the top of our FX-adjusted range.
Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.9 billion, up 7% both in USD and local currency. Outsourcing revenues
were $4.2 billion, up 9% in USD and 8% in local currency.
Looking at the trends and estimated revenue growth across our five business dimensions, growth was led by
Application Services and Operations, which both posted double-digit growth. Strategy & Consulting services combined
were flat in the quarter. And the New, including digital, cloud and security-related services, continued to deliver very
strong double-digit growth, as I mentioned earlier.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, products delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue
growth with 10% growth in local currency, led by strong growth across all three industries, especially in Europe and
the growth markets.
Financial Services posted its strongest growth of the year with 9% growth in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in
banking and capital markets as a result of strong demand for our services in both Europe and the growth markets.
Communications, Media & Technology also experienced an uptick in business momentum with 7% growth in the
quarter, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in software and platforms and low single-digit growth in the
other two industries. We were very pleased with our overall growth in CMT in both North America and the growth
markets, and we did see some improvement in Europe following several quarters of contraction.
Resources grew 5% in quarter four, building further on the improved growth rates we saw last quarter. The highlight of
the quarter was double-digit growth in chemicals and natural resources as well as balanced growth across each of the
three geographic areas, each growing 5% in the quarter. We continue to see challenging market conditions in energy.
Finally, H&PS grew 4%, led by strong growth in public services globally. We continue to be pleased with overall
growth in H&PS in both Europe and the growth markets. And while we saw some improvement in North America, our
health business continues to be impacted by uncertainty in U.S. health care legislation.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.5% compared to 31.3% in the same period last
year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11%, compared with 11.1% for the fourth quarter last year.
General and administrative expense was 6.4% compared to 6.1% for the same quarter last year.
Our operating income was $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.2% operating margin, up 10 basis points
compared with quarter four last year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter last year includes gains related primarily to our

Duck Creek transaction. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%, compared with an effective tax rate of 24.3% in the fourth quarter last
year. Our diluted earnings per share were $1.48, compared with EPS of $1.31 in the fourth quarter last year, and this
reflects a 13% year-over-year increase.
Days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter, and 39 days in the fourth quarter of last year.
Our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.9 billion,
net of property and equipment additions of $191 million. And our cash balance at August 31 was $4.1 billion compared
with $4.9 billion at August 31 last year.
With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
5.2 million shares for $657 million at an average price of $127.09 per share. At August 31, we had approximately $3.1
billion of share repurchase authority remaining. As Pierre mentioned, our board of Directors declared a semiannual
cash dividend of $1.33 per share. This dividend will be paid on November 15 and represents a $0.12 per share, or 10%
increase, over the previous semiannual dividend we declared in March.
So, before I turn it back over to Pierre, I want to reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key elements of
our original business outlook provided last September. Of course, I'm pleased that once again, we successfully
managed our business to deliver all aspects of the business outlook we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. Net
revenues grew 7% in local currency for the full year, again, demonstrating the power and durability of our growth
model in a highly dynamic environment. Even with unexpected headwinds in some parts of the U.S. business, we
delivered in the upper end of our guided range and in fact outside of the U.S., we delivered almost all 10% growth in
the rest of our business.
On an adjusted basis, operating margin of 14.8% reflected a 20 basis point expansion over 2016 and was consistent
with our guidance. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share were $5.91, reflecting 11% growth over fiscal 2016
and was at the upper end of our guided range.
Our free cash flow of $4.5 billion was above our original guided range and reflected a free cash flow well in excess of
our net income. And we delivered on the objectives of our capital allocation strategy by investing $1.7 billion in
acquisitions while at the same time returning $4.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
So again, we had a strong year by any measure and certainly as it relates to delivering against the guidance we provided
at the beginning of fiscal 2017.
Now let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
Our very strong performance in fiscal year 2017, on top of our outstanding results for the last two fiscal years,
demonstrate that we are executing our growth strategy very well in a durable and sustained way.
As I reflect on our performance for the last three years, I am very pleased that we delivered compound annual revenue
growth of 9% in local currency as well as 9% compound growth in adjusted earnings per share. And I'm especially
proud of the shareholder returns we generated over the same three-year period. We delivered a compound annual total
return to shareholders of 20%, twice the total return of the S&P 500.
We continue to benefit from the actions we have taken to transform Accenture to rotate our business to new
high-growth areas and to invest ahead of the curve. The breadth and scale of the capabilities we provide end to end
across strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations are absolutely unique in the marketplace, and this is why
Accenture remains the partner of choice for the world's leading companies in executing large-scale transformation

programs.
We are helping a leading global bank with a mission-critical program to meet new regulatory requirements. Leveraging
our global capabilities across consulting, digital, technology and operations, we are delivering significant changes to
the core banking platforms which handles over $100 trillion of transactions per year.
I am especially pleased with the leadership position we have built in the New – digital, cloud and security-related
services – all underpinned by new IT. In fiscal year 2017 The New accounted for about $18 billion or 50% of total
revenues. A very significant increase from roughly 40% of total revenues just one year ago, and 30% of total revenues
the year before.
We have truly transformed Accenture capabilities to help our clients embrace the New, applying innovation and
intelligence at the heart of their organizations. We are collaborating with Roche, the health care company, to develop
an analytics platform that will improve care for millions of patients around the globe. Built on the Accenture Intelligent
Patient Platform, this new solution enables Roche to analyze data in a secure environment and generate insights to
provide patients with more customized care.
The rigor and discipline we use in running our business is key to consistently executing our growth strategy. And we
systematically apply the same discipline to our investments including acquisitions. Acquisitions enhance our
differentiation in the marketplace and are an engine to drive organic growth.
Over the last three years, we deployed $3.4 billion in roughly 70 acquisitions. This includes a record $1.7 billion in
fiscal year 2017 alone. And over the last year, we expanded our relationship with key ecosystem partners, including
Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP. And just last month, we formed a new
partnership with Apple to help businesses transform how they engage with their customers using innovative solutions
built on iOS.
Now turning to the geographic dimension of our business. We continue to rotate to the New consistently and
successfully around the world, especially in our largest markets. We delivered another year of strong and balanced
revenue growth, gaining market share in each of our geographic regions.
In North America, we delivered 4% revenue growth in local currency for the year, driven by the United States. In
Europe, we grew revenues 8% in local currency, with double-digit growth in Germany and Switzerland as well as high
single-digit growth in the UK, France and Spain.
And I am particularly pleased that in growth markets, we delivered 12% growth in local currency, driven primarily by
very strong double-digit growth once again in Japan as well as double-digit growth in Australia, Singapore and China.
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on our commitment to developing talent. As a
professional services company, our people ultimately make the difference in delivering high-quality services to clients.
This is why we are so focused on attracting the best people and investing to further develop their skills.
To ensure we have the most relevant talent at the most senior levels, we promoted 600 new Managing Directors in
fiscal year 2017 and hired more than 300 Managing Directors from outside Accenture. These leaders are bringing
highly differentiated industry expertise and specialized skills, especially in the New.
At the same time, we are making a significant investment in reskilling our people to help them stay relevant in key
areas such as cloud, artificial intelligence and robotics. In just over 18 months, we have trained more than 160,000
people in new IT alone, including automation, Agile development, and intelligent platforms.
And at Accenture, we embrace diversity as a source of creativity and competitive advantage. We bring together people
of different genders, races, cultures and perspectives, which make us smarter, more innovative and more relevant. I am
so privileged to lead our company of 425,000 talented people working in 55 countries around the world, who bring
their unique knowledge and experience to our clients each and every day.
With that, I will turn it over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2018. David, over to you.

David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre.
Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we expect revenues to be in the range of
$9.1 billion to $9.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about positive 2% compared to the first quarter of
fiscal 2017, and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.
For the full fiscal year 2018, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume
the impact of FX on our results in USD will be about positive 3% compared to fiscal year 2017.
For the full fiscal 2018, we expect our net revenue to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal
2017. For operating margin, we expect fiscal 2018 to be 14.9% to 15.1%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over
adjusted fiscal 2017 results.
We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax
rate of 23% in fiscal 2017. For earnings per share, we expect full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to be in
the range of $6.36 to $6.60, or 8% to 12% growth over adjusted fiscal 2017 results.
Now turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2018, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.3
billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of
$4.4 billion to $4.7 billion, generating free cash flow in excess of net income.
We expect to return at least $4.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also expect to reduce the
weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 1%, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of
cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Angie?
Angie Park
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question.
Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Bergin>: Good morning, thank you. Within your revenue guide for fiscal 2018, can you just talk about
what your organic growth assumption is there within the total guide, and then as well as your M&A spend projection
for the year and that contribution? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Bryan. When we look at next year, we expect from an investment standpoint
and acquisitions that we would be in the range of 25% to 30% of our cash flow. If you calculate that in dollar terms, it's
in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. And as we've said many times previously, we certainly have the ability to go
above that range if the opportunities present themselves during the fiscal year. And so our inorganic strategy is an
engine for organic growth and as a means of bringing on critical skills and capabilities in high-growth areas will
continue, it's an important part of our strategy. That assumption combined with what we've just done in fiscal 2017
would translate to inorganic revenue contribution in the range of 2.5% to 3% in fiscal 2018.

<Q - Bryan C. Bergin>: Okay, thank you. The follow-up I have, just on platforms, can you just talk about how much
of your business is derived from your various platforms? It seems like a lot of the award announcements this quarter
involved some sort of a proprietary platform; your cloud, your Insights platform, insurance products. Give us a sense
on what that's doing in changing the model of your business. Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: So if you look at all the platforms and, David, you probably know the number better than me,
it would be, what, in the range of 20%?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, in that range, 20% to 25% if you looked at the major platforms.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, so it is significant, but it is not the majority of what we do. So we like a lot what we are
doing with our platforms because for us it's a source of delivering huge value for our clients, and it's as well the base to
sell our consulting and other businesses on back of this.
Now, as you know, we are leading with SAP. We are leading with Oracle, with Microsoft, with Salesforce, with
Workday. With Microsoft, so we are today their leading partners. And you've seen that we have opened new fronts
with coming leaders such as Google, such as Amazon Web Services, we're going to develop platforms on top of the
cloud. And you've certainly heard about the announcement we made with Apple to develop solution based on iOS. So
we are very active on platform. We are very pleased with what we are doing, and I'm especially pleased that we are
leading with their new platforms.
When we talk about SAP, we're talking about SAP HANA, Oracle in the cloud, the new generation of service with
Microsoft, and you probably have seen an announcement we made between Avanade, Accenture, and Microsoft
recently just last week. And so we're always aiming at leading not with the solution of yesterday, but with the solutions
of tomorrow, and taking a leadership position, which is exactly what we do.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan C. Bergin>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, good morning, Tien-Tsin.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Good morning. It's always good to talk to you guys. I guess I'll ask on organic growth.
Assuming what you did in organic in 2017, it looks like a little bit of deceleration implied at the midpoint in terms of
organic growth. Am I looking at that correctly? Is there anything to explain that assumption?
<A - David P. Rowland>: No, I would say that if – first of all, I would say, Tien-Tsin, as you know, that while our
range reflects what we think is possible across a broad 3-point range, we are always focused on being toward the upper
end of the range. And if you were to look at, let's say, the upper third of the range and if you look at the 2.5% to 3%,
and if you were to then look at that against the market growth for organic market growth, it would continue to reflect us
taking significant share which is our strategic objective. And so it's not intended to imply deceleration. I mean, we still
feel good about the market as we see it.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Yes, fair point.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. Just to add on this and to be very clear, I think what we are planning for next year is
extremely consistent with 2017 and, to be honest, is consistent with 2016. Now it depends on when you land in the
range and as David say, we are targeting to be more on the upper part of the range.
But the contribution of inorganic has always been in the recent past in the range of 2%-plus and anything between the
2% to 3%. And so our organic growth is very consistent with the prior year and, as David said, has been built, if you
will, to grow significantly more than the market. And when I say significantly more, it's probably a minimum of twice

the market. So that's the way we see our organic growth today and potentially, tomorrow. So very consistent.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Right. Yes. For sure at the upper half it would be consistent with what we have organic over
the last actually three years, like you said and no splitting hairs over a percentage point here but that's helpful.
My follow-up, just I guess on geographic growth, both of you called out North America versus the rest. Do you expect
the trends to change between North America and rest of world for Accenture in fiscal 2018?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I'm going to take my non-American hat and I'm feeling confident that my U.S. colleagues and
leaders will drive more growth next year. To be serious again, we shared with you these last few quarters that indeed
the growth in the U.S. didn't come exactly as expected for reasons we shared with you that probably the market was –
markets and our clients expecting some reforms, and these reforms had not come as expected and creating a kind of
wait and see positioning with our clients, especially in health and public sector with all the uncertainties around the
health care reforms.
Now we have a year behind us and I believe that my scenario, if you will, that the business has factored what they
could or could not expect from the administration. So to some extent, there's less uncertainty with what might come.
Now we still believe that we're going to see tax reform or some evolution that's going to be good for the business but on
balance, what we expect is that next year, the contribution of the U.S. and North America will be incrementally better
than this year.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes, absolutely.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great, okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I believe in the U.S., my friend.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hey, Keith.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about the Consulting business to
start off with. If I look at the signings growth, it's a bit of a sine curve where 2013 was a negative year, 2014 was very
good, 2015 was a down year, 2016 was tremendous. This year the signings are, call it, low single-digits. It would seem
that based on that cycle, 2018 should be a pretty good year for signings in the Consulting business. But I just wanted to
hear your feedback on how you're looking at that business in particular.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: So let me, David, take it.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Go ahead.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And then, David, you can add on it. First, let's talk extremely rapidly by positioning what is
the role of consulting at Accenture. As you know, at Accenture we have different – I mean we have not different
businesses. We have synergistic businesses, Strategy/Consulting, where we shape the agenda with the client, advisory
services, if you will; digital and technology where we are building leading-edge solutions; and Operations where we
operate on behalf of the clients. And they are not independent businesses at all. The formula of Accenture is end-to-end
integration of these services to deliver transformation and to commit on an outcome.
The role of the Consulting business in that supply chain, if you will, is to shape the client's agenda, is to work with the
clients and orchestrate the rest of our businesses, and is of course, to sell consulting services in addition of the rest. So
they are for us the business orchestrator, if you will, of the relationship with the clients.

So at the end of the day, when we are looking at the performance of Accenture, indeed we're looking at each part
because we want each part to operate in the best market condition. But no doubt that we are much more focused on the
value that all of this capability brings in driving overall growth faster than the market. Now, so the role of Consulting is
to shape, is to orchestrate the depth and breadth of our services, and when I look at the market conditions, we would
expect to certainly, our Consulting business to be at the mid-single-digit range.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And this is where we believe that the consulting market is all about. But again, I would like
all of you not to take Consulting in isolation because this is not the operating model of Accenture.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Okay. Fair enough then. Thank you for that response. My feedback – or my second
question rather is, David, could you talk a little bit about the puts and takes associated with the operating margin range?
What are the variables that would cause you to be at the lower end of the range and what are the variables that would
cause you to be at the higher end of the range?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. So, I mean, there are a lot of things in the mix when we look at operating margin. I
mean, first of all, just to kind of state the mathematically obvious, 10 basis points is, let's say, just under $40 million for
the year, which on our base of operating expenses is small in the context of the total operating expense of our business.
Of course, it's significant in the context of delivering the year in the quarter, but there are a number of things in the mix.
First of all is an assumption on the level of investments that we will continue to make in our business and our people.
And I can tell you that our intent in fiscal 2018 is to continue to ramp up our investments and to invest at a rate that is
faster than our rate of revenue growth. And so in essence, what that means is that our business model again, as a
reminder, is that we actually strive to have a much higher level of margin improvement underneath our business, if you
will, of which a substantial portion of that margin expansion we invest into the business and our people, within the
range of 10 to 30 basis points of expansion being delivered in our results.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: Right.
<A - David P. Rowland>: And so the things that drive down, I mean first of all, would be the progression of contract
profitability. So that gets to fundamentally the economics of the work that we do for our clients. And in a normal year,
we would expect that our contract profitability would continue to progress in a positive way, and certainly, that's our
assumption next year.
The other big driver of our profitability is the level of payroll efficiency that we have in our business. There are many
things that go into that, including the geographic distribution of our heads, the level of utilization we run at, as well as
the extent to which we're choosing to make talent investments and bring on board critical skills that we think are going
to position us well for the future.
And really, I could stop there. I mean, those are the two biggest drivers. How we manage the overall relationship of
payroll progression to revenue and then also very importantly, what we do with the economics of the portfolio of
contracts that we deliver to our clients each year.
<Q - Keith Frances Bachman>: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. Appreciate the questions.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Hey, thanks, guys. Just to follow up on that point on the margin front. I mean, there's clearly a
very high demand for labor around some of the new opportunities that you guys are doing so well. With that in mind,
can you just give us a little more specifics on what type of wage inflation you'd expect to see, what type of pricing you

can use to offset that? Is there enough talent out there? Are you finding any challenges around that? What's the
environment like right now on those two fronts?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. It's hard to answer the wage inflation and price inflation question in aggregate,
because it means – there are so many components of our business and you really have to get into each component.
Also, I don't like commenting on the wage inflation because it can be misinterpreted, not only externally but sometimes
internally as well by our people. It's just hard to talk about in aggregate.
What I can tell you is that our business discipline is that we work very hard looking at the wage dynamics, if you will,
across each of the markets that we operate in. We have specific targets for where we want to be to market in all of our
workforces. Obviously, our goal is to always be at a level where we can attract the best talent in the market.
We are very, very disciplined in the way we manage the progression of wage inflation and what we are able to do in
our pricing because that fundamentally drives our economics, so that's kind of a foundational element, if you will, of
how we manage the operations of our business. And I would say in general, I don't see anything unusual about 2018,
either from a wage standpoint or a pricing standpoint, let's say, in the round, I don't see anything different in 2018 than
really the last couple of years we have operated in.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Maybe to add three elements on this to your question, are we attracting the people and based
on what condition. I wanted to communicate to the group that we are clearly focusing on attracting the best talent. And
the fact that we've been able in fiscal year 2017 to recruit 300, 300 Managing Directors from the outside is for me just
the illustration that, indeed, we are an attractive company. And we have no issue to hire even what I would call iconic
talent, i.e., some of the best and most differentiated talent in the marketplace. And they're coming to us for, let's say,
three reasons, again, another three.
I mean, first, with $18 billion in the New, 50% of our revenues and double-digit growth year after year, they understand
that we are serious about leading in the New and, of course, it's attractive for that. Second, they're joining us because
we are the only professional services company having end-to-end businesses. And so they know they are joining in
Strategy or in Consulting, they will benefit from the rest of Accenture, or if they are joining technology and operations,
they will benefit from our consulting and advisory services.
And three, we are competitive in the way we compensate and reward these people and certainly, they've been watching
the stock evolution over these last three years and they love that.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay, all right. That helps. Pierre, just one quick follow-up, when thinking about the New, first
of all, what would be the most exciting areas that you're expecting right now for 2018 embedded in that large piece of
revenue that's now 50% that you find is the most exciting and the most innovative right now, the most in demand? And
then did you talk to David about a growth profile of the New for 2018 versus the rest of the business? And thank you
very much, guys.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. I'm excited with everything regarding the New. So by selecting a few, I don't want to
disappoint other parts of the business because, for instance, all what we are doing in Accenture Interactive is absolutely
great, and I'm very excited that we're going to launch next year's new services around some of intimate, intelligent, and
personal marketing services. So I'm very excited with the next generation of marketing services we might launch. I'm
absolutely, of course, excited with all the artificial intelligence, machine learning, and what we have in front of us,
where again, we're going to in 2018 make significant investments.
We are already looking, if we want to look at things which are more pioneering, if you will, at the usage of quantum
computing in the business. And I'm not seeing a lot of our peers or companies already making business cases based on
quantum, which is what we are doing with Biogen, these biogenetic companies, where we are working with them in
using quantum computing to genome analysis and segmentation and other kind of services.
Immersive reality is something we like a lot, how we're going to use virtual and augmented reality in the context of the
business, and maybe finally, data-driven activities and services. Data is the new currency of the world. It's not any more
the dollar, the pound or the euro, it is the data. And all the digital capabilities will reinforce and strengthens the way

you can use the data to deliver value. So we are extraordinarily focused on a data-centric agenda in all the services
we're going to propose. So an exciting agenda in front of us. And stay tuned in 2018, we'll make a few announcements.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Right. And just to close out your question, even as the New has continued to scale so
significantly, we do expect continued strong double-digit growth in the New in fiscal 2018.

Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Eric Friedman>: Hi, thank you. It's Jamie at Susquehanna.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi, Jamie.
<Q - James Eric Friedman>: Hi. I just wanted to – you were going kind of quick there, David. I think there was an
incremental disclosure – at least incremental to me. Did you disclose the New as a percentage of the bookings to? I
thought you said 60%.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I said – right, I did say that. I don't know that I've said that previously. You're right,
good catch on your part. Every once in a while, we sneak things in there, but I did say in the fourth quarter, our new
bookings were about 60% – the New represented about 60% of our new bookings. And I did that as just an illustration
again of the extent to which our businesses continue to rapidly rotate to the New.
<Q - James Eric Friedman>: Okay. And then if I could for my follow-up, I'm not sure if I should go operating group
or business dimension. I'm going to go business dimension. So, Pierre, with your previous comments about
Strategy/Consulting, I'm looking at the fact sheet bottom-left corner, it decelerated to flat growth. You're suggesting –
if I'm hearing you right, you're suggesting that will accelerate now to mid-single digit. Maybe if you could, provide
some of the characterization to that market. Is there any cannibalization going on in that market, like it might move
from Strategy/Consulting, say, to App Services to Operations, and it just doesn't appear in Strategy/Consulting? Some
perspective on the trajectory of Strategy would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Let me just mention a few things, and then Pierre I'm sure will also round it out, but maybe
just to get grounded in the facts a little bit. So first of all, Pierre did say, and so let me just state again that when you
look at Strategy/Consulting combined, we expect that it will be in the mid-single-digit range.
Let me also say that it's true that in 2017, the year we closed, Strategy/Consulting was lower than what we had
expected when we started the year. And I would say that a primary contributor to that was what we've commented on
throughout the year with the dynamic in the United States. And so the fact is if you look across our broad business,
there are many parts of our business, many geographic markets where the Strategy & Consulting growth is very much
aligned with this mid-single-digit expectation. So it's important to note that in the mix in 2017 was the impact of some
of the things that we've talked about in the U.S.
The third thing I would say is that there is some ebb and flow of the revenue growth across our businesses. If you look
at last year, meaning 2016, for example, we had strong double-digit growth in Consulting & Strategy, and certainly the
nature of the work that we were doing in 2016 really contributed to and set the table for the very strong revenue growth
that we had in both Application Services and Operations in fiscal 2017. And so there is some connection between our
businesses that I think is important to point out as well.
The final thing I would say is that if you peel the Consulting & Strategy growth back and look at the growth of
Strategy/Consulting for work that is related to the New, that portion of Strategy/Consulting is growing double digit.
And so the services related to the New continue to grow quite fast. And, Pierre, do you want to add anything? No,

Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa Ellis>: Hi. Good morning, guys. First question is M&A related. I just wanted – David, maybe just a little
color on how we should think about the M&A contribution. I was just looking at you just said you spent $1.7 billion in
fiscal 2017, and that will, roughly speaking, contribute like 2.5 to 3 points of revenue growth in fiscal 2018, which is
roughly the same number or slightly lower. So should we be thinking about it more just as a form of R&D spend
essentially versus a revenue accelerator? Yeah.
<A - David P. Rowland>: So let me just be clear. Maybe I misunderstood what you said. So the inorganic contribution
in fiscal 2017 was in the range of 2%. It was just a tad higher than 2%, it rounds to 2%.
The 2.5% to 3%, Lisa, as you know, we talk about inorganic on a rolling four-quarter basis, and it truly is a pretty
straight mathematical computation. If you look at the timing of when we did our acquisitions throughout fiscal 2017, as
well as – it's hard to predict exactly when acquisitions will occur as we look out over the four quarters of 2018. But if
you make a reasonable assumption about the phasing, all of that in the mix would put us in the 2.5% to 3% range,
which would be a stronger contribution than what we had – incrementally stronger contribution than what we had in
2017.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Maybe, David, just for clarity, I think that would be good you explain. We're tracking these
acquisition on, what, on a 12 to 18 months?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And then it's becoming organic because, otherwise, might be confusing for the audience. So
could you re-explain how we measure this?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes. Our organic revenue is based on a rolling four quarters – trailing four quarters of our
acquisitions. And so in the quarter we acquire a company, it's in our inorganic for four quarters, and then it becomes
part of our organic, because our model, Lisa, as you know, is that we don't buy these companies to have them operate
as an appendage, we rapidly integrate them really as an engine for our organic growth. Did I misunderstand your
question or was that helpful?
<Q - Lisa Ellis>: Yeah, that was helpful. I guess I was clarifying that the expenditure on a lot of how we should think
about the acquisitions, because they're these small tuck-ins, is like an R&D investment, right? And so, yes, you've got
the sort of mathematical addition of the run rate revenue from those companies but then largely they just roll into your
base kind of organic development model after that. Is that right, meaning versus like creating an acceleration in your
underlying organic revenue themselves. More it's just an addition for one year and then, beyond that, it just rolls into
the base.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: It is. I've told you right. And of course, if you would look over five years, the contribution of
our acquisition does represent a significant part of the growth of Accenture, if you look at this on aggregate level year
after year. So you're right, we're acquiring companies for deep capabilities, what before you were referring as R&D,
and then after a period of time, it's becoming organic and is totally absorbed in the organization and in our organic
numbers.

<Q - Lisa Ellis>: Okay. And then if you don't mind as my follow-up, a question on the outsourcing side, a follow-up to
the earlier question around the acceleration in outsourcing, both bookings and book-to-bill are both running very
strong. Are you seeing a continued evolution in demand there for the New into – so should we be interpreting that as
that's now longer duration work related to the New? And in that context, are you also then seeing a shift in the
competitive set that you're competing against for that work?
<A - David P. Rowland>: So let me comment is that when you look at outsourcing as a type of work or if I was to say
if you look at Application Services and Operations, which were big growth contributors in 2017, a high percentage of
those revenue streams are in the New. So it's important to understand that when we talk about Operations, we're not
focused on legacy operations, we're focused on the operations marketplace that we have created and defined, which is
all based around business as a service in the cloud, with security, all powered by the New.
And so yeah, I think you could conclude that there is a cycle, that is the new technologies have matured. It reflects and
they are more in kind of an operations mode, if you will, as opposed to early-stage development, deployment, et cetera,
there's natural cycle and I think that certainly contributes to what we're seeing in Operations and even Application
Services, to some extent.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. And in Application Services, to add on this, because what you said is very important,
David, is indeed, outsourcing is rotating to the New of what we're calling outsourcing. And Application Services, we
are now selling more and more of our services based on automation, robotics, intelligent solutions-based, and again, we
are reinventing Application Services to differentiate.
So when you look at your question from a competitive standpoint, to some extent, you can segregate the market
between the players still trying to sell more or harder of the legacy or the classic IT; and the players, and we are part of
that camp, if you will, who are reinventing this service by providing much more of the new technologies and new
features to capture more growth. And I believe that if our outsourcing business is double-digit and is very vibrant, it's
because it has rotated to the New and not because we are trying to sell more of the legacy. Yeah.
<Q - Lisa Ellis>: Terrific. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right. Thank you, Lisa.

Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Hi. I wanted to come at acquisitions, I guess, slightly differently. How do you manage the
integration of all these businesses and at what point do you think it might start to impact the culture? And is the
pipeline there incredibly fertile?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I love your question.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Because, of course, it doesn't rotate to the New. We have to activate this evolving strategy of
making more acquisitions to get to talent we couldn't develop organic and we had to bring from the market. And the big
question is, how do you integrate and how do you manage the culture? And this is something we communicated, but
I'm pleased to do that, with a larger group, that we developed this concept which might be perceived as extremely
simple, but it's more certainly profound than it sounds like, which is at Accenture, we are developing a culture of
cultures.
Indeed, we're coming from a long tradition, like many global group, of the one, one culture. I mean, everything was
one. You wanted to be one in the world. And I think this cycle is behind many of the big corps, certainly behind us.
You're operating in multiple countries; i.e., multiple cultures, or when you are accommodating multiple services; i.e.,
multiple cultures, you need to create an environment which can celebrate difference of cultures.

And when we think about the one, the glue, if you will, it's more on our values, the kind of intangible things we might
expect from all our practitioners that we're going to keep their cultures. As an illustration, I will take Fjord, because I
think it's making exactly the right illustration of what you're saying.
When we decided to be in the design and experience-led kind of services, quite far from Accenture, we identified a
company called Fjord, 180 people at the time, less than 10 studios around the world. So we're going to keep the Fjord
culture, the studio, the way they work. We're going to keep the Fjord identity and brand, and indeed, we're going to
integrate them in Accenture more from a backbone standpoint, from a value standpoint – but they were sharing our
values anyway – and they will benefit from our distribution channels.
After less than four years, we are celebrating 1,000 people in Fjord. They have a formidable brand in the marketplace,
but if you would talk to the Fjord people, they are an interesting hybrid. They live and breathe the Fjord and they live
and breathe the Accenture. That's what now we want to accommodate with this concept of culture of cultures, which I
think is reasonably a strong evolution for a large big global group who have been developing with the concept of
everything is one. At Accenture, as we said, we love diversity.
<Q - Joseph Foresi>: Got it. And then my follow-up, can you talk about the decline in the half of the business outside
the New? How do you think about it and can it get worse as the IT budgets get reallocated to the New? Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: At the end of the day, our job is to be relevant to the client agenda and to understand at what
speed they're going to evolve the kind of services we could provide. What we do see is, indeed, the overall – if you
look at the overall spend we could address, it's growing. If you add the marketing spend to the IT spend and to the
spend they are allocating to what we're calling more at the heart of the operations, which all the Industrial Internet will
tap on.
So if you look at this from a legacy IT, it's flat or shrinking. If you look at the addressable spend for us, it is growing.
That's why at Accenture we have decided five years ago in our strategy to stretch and to extend our reach from where
we were famous before, support function, finance, HR, supply chain and IT, to be relevant still in that space of support
and IT, stretching to the frontline addressing the marketing spend, and stretching to the operation in the field line
through the Industrial Internet so we could expand the addressable budget we are tapping on, and we benefit of the
stretching the boundaries of our scope. Because should we have stayed in the prior scope, then it would be much
harder. So all the work is to extend your scope to expand the addressable spend.
