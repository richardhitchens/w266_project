MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated First Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's
call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin;
President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade.
All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a
question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.
Christopher J. Meade
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to
remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your
attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.

Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2017. Before I
turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our
earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted
results.
BlackRock's competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and
change our business model always with the goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a
comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client
relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth.
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset
growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments
and the success of our broad-based global technology and investment platform.
Flows were positive across product type, client type and region. First quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher
than a year ago, and despite cost associated with the repositioning of our active equity business, operating income of
$1.2 billion rose 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago, driven also by higher
non-operating results and the lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of
2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First quarter net interest expense included $14 million of call premium
expense associated with the current quarter's successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were
called prior to their September 2017 maturity.
Our issuance of $700 million of 10-year notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest
expense going forward. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8% compared to 29.6% a year ago and
included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting guidance related to
stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a
reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a
consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year.
First quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and
organic growth on our average assets under management. On a constant-currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew
approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential
base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017.
Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and
long-only performance, but declined $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to seasonally higher
fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter. Aladdin revenue of $158
million was up 12% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the
Aladdin platform over the last year.
Internally, we recently realigned Financial Markets Advisory or our FMA business with Client Solutions and the
BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service. To better align
our external reporting in light of this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the BlackRock Solutions and
advisory line item on our income statement, will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our
P&L. Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as
part of an advisory and other revenue line item.
Technology is changing how the world invests and how we interact with clients. We continue to see strong market
demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, FutureAdvisor and other technology solutions
as clients seek sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in
our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus on our technology and risk management businesses
at BlackRock.

Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven by higher compensation and volume-related
expense, lower G&A expense, and $22 million of certain one-time expense associated with the recently announced
strategic repositioning of our active equity platform. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million
or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher
operating income and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with
the repositioning of the active equity platform.
Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%, reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal
payroll taxes, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 grants partially offset by lower
incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter.
G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend.
Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter or 15%, primarily reflecting the seasonal
impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange re-measurement
expense. Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items,
including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017.
Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A expend in 2017 as compared
to 2016.
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued
focus on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense
management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders.
We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business,
and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase
in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock, and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of
shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the
year.
First quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes
and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients
increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns.
Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion, representing 20% annualized organic growth,
driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory and wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares
ETFs as financial instruments by professional money managers.
iShares captured the number one share of first quarter industry flows globally in the U.S., Europe and in equity and
fixed income, with our U.S. iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time.
iShares equity net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market
exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs.
Fixed income iShares net inflows of $20 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate and emerging
market bond funds. Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter, driven
primarily by index inflows. Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows in equity and fixed
income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath
target-date series, which saw $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history.
Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows, reflecting
deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge fund solutions. Momentum in
alternatives is continuing evidenced by yet another strong fund raising quarter for illiquids as we raised more than $2
billion in new commitments.
Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock, as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of
the acquisition of the First Reserve Infrastructure Funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter bringing

total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion.
Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and the index equity products, partially offset by
outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion were diversified across our top
performing platform and included $2 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into
emerging markets and municipals. In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter
as investors continued to target specific income-oriented outcomes.
Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to evolve our global
distribution, investment and technology platforms ahead of evolving client needs and industry trends. Diversification,
whether investment style, distribution channel, product or region and scale create a truly advantaged competitive
position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with the goal of delivering long-term value for
clients and shareholders alike.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock's first quarter results are a
reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment
platform in the asset management industry, complemented by a global distribution network and industry-leading
technology.
Our full range of investment strategies, the strengthened index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental
actives and alternatives uniquely position BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with
our clients.
Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last three months, but really a result of our
long-term strategy. We have always kept our focus on the long-term, working to understand the evolution of the asset
management ecosystem and anticipate changes in our clients' needs so that we can adapt ahead of change and better
meet their needs.
For this reason, clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and
guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape. Over the past year, global events have had a significant
impact on markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, U.S. equity market surged to an all-time
high, driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform, and reflation expectations have been steadily
increasing.
However, there's still uncertainty, uncertainty about our healthcare, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they'll
ultimately be implemented in the United States, and investor confidence has partially changed. There are significant
issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all evolves. We are still optimistic,
but we have to see how these all evolve.
Strong first quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth with the
sharpest recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out,
particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety.
Furthermore, if the dollar remains strong following a period of significant appreciation, we could see further headwinds
for dollar-based investors with global portfolios. Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact of sustained
low rates on our client portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs, and this
will likely to continue and will likely remain a challenge.
As I talk about in my recent Chairman's Letter to our shareholders in our Annual Report at the heart of BlackRock is
the culture that embraces change. We, as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into
opportunities. As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one

of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure.
The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers have not evolved and they're
playing catch up. We built BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture. Throughout our
history, we have focused on identifying critical trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients' needs
and then we pivot our business accordingly.
As a result, we build a firm that is equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to
adapt ahead of change not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes we make a misstep, and
addressing those quickly is just as important. BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies for market cap
weighted index exposures at one end, to illiquid alternatives at the other, and everything in between.
We created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our
clients. And we built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders.
Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment in technology platform is our
greatest durable competitive advantage. And going forward, we will continue to identify opportunities to use our
advantaged market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders.
We're using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock in our U.S.
iShares Core ETFs. We're using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers, and earlier
this year, we announced our plans to move up $1 trillion of custodial assets.
We're using our scale to build industry-leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our
clients. We're using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network. And we're using our scale
to make tactical, filling out acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities, and our
geographic reach. This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistently
strong organic growth. And we're going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward always with the
best interest of our clients and our shareholders.
In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing a 7% annualized organic
growth. Flows are positive across product types, client types, and in all our regions. Record ETF flows are tangible
example of a fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets.
Simple building blocks like iShares Core as a strategic holding for long-term investors; fixed income ETFs alongside
bonds for institutions; large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor-based ETFs, and
more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns.
The investment landscape is changing and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth and evolution.
iShares saw record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients saw ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures
and as building block to deliver alpha.
Last October, we anticipated key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large
pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs, positioning
this business to offer the highest quality product at the best value for our clients.
This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. Since this strategic
re-pricing, we've seen acceleration in growth in our iShares U.S. Core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows,
representing a 50% annualized organic growth. We've experienced the sizable uptick in our core market share and we
have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone.
Several years ago, we anticipated growing interest from our clients and factors and smart beta. Those strategies remain
a significant area of focus for BlackRock, and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into
BlackRock smart beta ETFs in the first quarter, contributing to the total factor-based net inflows of $3 billion in our
first quarter.

The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and
our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. We believe in active management more than
ever before, especially in less efficient markets where returns are less correlated. But we would believe going forward,
clients will be looking for different ways and different things from active equity and alpha will need to be generating in
the new ways.
In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund
platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. Unconstrained product range is also
well-positioned for a rising rate environment and we are beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion of net
inflows in the quarter. As active equity management is being reshaped by massive advancements in technology and
data science and clients are focusing more on outcomes, we recently revitalized our active equity platform so that we
are in a position to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients.
We segmented our product offering into a range of strategies that span different levels of alpha generation and value
with appropriate manufacturing cost for BlackRock. And we are harnessing the power of people and technology as we
lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with a shared data science and
technology capabilities. We believe that levering our global scale and technology we can drive better outcomes for our
clients and future growth for BlackRock.
At the end of the quarter, 65% of our fundamental active equities and 85% of our scientific active equity assets were
above benchmark or peer median for the three-year period. The investments that we made in iShares and our active
fixed income and in active equities are about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reap the benefits
of our competitive advantages to drive growth. And we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strengths. As
we look for other opportunities evolve for our clients, alternatives remain a key area of focus as our clients increasingly
are searching for additional source of income and hopefully uncorrelated returns.
We saw another strong fund raising quarter with $2 billion of commitments, and we now have more than $12 billion of
un-invested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform.
We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing and supportive policies to unlock private capital, which offer
multiple benefits including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity, and
increasing capacity for long-term economic growth. Today, we manage $30 billion in real assets and we expect this to
continue be an area of growth for BlackRock.
As we look to enhance BlackRock's global credit platform, last month, we brought in Tim O'Hara to lead BlackRock's
credit business alongside Jimmy Keenan. We believe that the combination of BlackRock's long established presence
and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid
and illiquid credit, which provides attractive risk-adjusted opportunity for clients who are seeking differentiated sources
of income.
While technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock, it is more essential to our business than ever
before. We believe technology can transform our industry with enhanced technology and risk management helping
investors achieve better outcomes, and we at BlackRock are leading that transformation. Our goal is to be the most
sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform integrate the way
assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction, asset allocation, risk
management and digital distribution.
Our Aladdin technology is being used by more clients than ever before with revenues growing 12% year-over-year and
demand from Aladdin's multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally, especially in Europe and Latin America,
remains strong. We also continue to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin as interest continues to increase for
Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio construction,
modeling and risk management technology.
We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia.
Aladdin remains the only integrated investment risk management system on the market and we believe this

differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value propositions and premium price points.
In line with the commitment to technology, we recently nominated Chuck Robbins to our board of directors. Chuck has
helped global corporations navigate a world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and
consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future, and Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology
promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock.
Building on record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business, to
capture the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth, and to aggressively leverage the benefits of our scale.
We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future, finding new methods to generate
sustainable alpha, using technology in innovative ways, building on a platform to serve our clients' evolving needs,
creating continued opportunities for our employees, and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders.
Now, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Hi, good morning. Larry, in a Bloomberg interview, you stated that Aladdin – you
see Aladdin pushing about $5 billion of revenue in the next five years. Maybe can you talk about what Aladdin would
look like as a $5 billion revenue business? And maybe what might be the greatest risk that could prevent BlackRock
from reaching these targets?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I said that was an aspiration, let's be clear. And it was technology not just Aladdin. So
we believe what we're doing with our FutureAdvisor platform, with our iRetire platform and of course in Aladdin for
wealth management, Aladdin for our institutional clients, Aladdin provider for the custodial banking industry, we
believe we have great growth potentials worldwide.
As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing Aladdin interest in LatAm, in Europe. We have wealth management –
Aladdin for wealth management integration going on right now in Asia. And so, it's continuing to drive our platform,
but where I'm most pleased, and I think has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what its core competency was a few
years back by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical
capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have.
And so, especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II, with a world that is moving more towards advisory, less
brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary, and the Aladdin
platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. And then we will continue to
do acquisitions, we have a few areas that we're looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in
technology.
But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture. And what I do believe
what our clients are finding, when they have the Aladdin platform and you have the singularity of one technology
platform throughout an organization, it's driving our clients' culture. And I do believe this is going to continue to drive
a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin. So, we're quite excited. At times, we're pretty overwhelmed with
the opportunities, but Mr. Goldstein and team have done a very good job in terms of driving those opportunities.

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Craig.
<Q - Craig Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning, Larry. So, if you look at BlackRock's strong AUM growth over the
last three years and contrast it to the slower revenue and EPS growth trends, and I – listen, we know a large component
of the delta is driven by one-time market factors like FX and divergent beta. But when you focus just on the fee rate,
can you provide us a rough estimate of the impact from the market-driven factors and then also the client-driven factors
when you think about negative mix shift towards core series and fee cuts? And I'm just really looking for kind of
ballpark figures here.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Hey, Craig. It's Gary. Good morning. So, maybe I'll take a crack at that for you. I think if we
could start, recall from Investor Day, which was, I guess, about nine months ago, we showed a chart at Investor Day
that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion in our base fees, and I think it was from 2012 to 2015, so that
chart's a little dated now. Despite that growth, our fee rate had actually declined by a little over 1 basis point. I think it
was about 1.3 basis points.
Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time and actually expanded our fee rate by
about 1 basis point. That I would basically refer you to as mix shift and that is a phenomenon where our organic base
fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth, which, frankly with the exception of last year, it
has done pretty continuously.
While beta and FX drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which, again, our element outside of our direct control had
actually caused a 2-basis point decline in the fee rate over that time period, and that is really what we talk about as
being divergent beta and FX. It actually increases our revenue, but it actually decreases our fee rate.
And if you think about it, pretty simply the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets and we've
seen significant dollar strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound and the euro. And what
does that do to us that actually causes our dollar denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products
in Europe and Asia and especially in the emerging markets.
Now, bear in mind, over that time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of, but obviously we did
launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point, despite
another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market and I think we've talked a lot about that where the trends
were generally the same.
But if you look back, whether it was – we really generated organic base fee growth of 6% in 2013, in 2014 and 2015,
and while it dipped to 1% last year, we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter and that's even with
the fee cuts that we have announced both in fixed income and iShares.
So, I think the bottom line, it really is divergent beta and FX in many cases which is re-pricing in some respects $5
trillion of assets every day. But I also think that we are, as Larry mentioned, we really feel that we're as well positioned
as we've ever been to grow not only assets, but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves
in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles.

Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Okay. Good morning, everyone. Thank you so much for taking the question this
morning. Just coming back to the dynamics on fee rates for a moment, I think in that same article that Ken had
mentioned, you sort of reiterated likelihood if fee rates will continue to work lower in the industry, which I think is
pretty widely understood now.

So my question is, when you start thinking about the conversations you're having with the retail distributors around
point of sale economics, what's happening with that dialog? Because the way I see is that that's sort of like a fixed rate,
somewhere 5 basis points to 10 basis points. But as the management fee rate continues to work lower, that economic
model seems to be under a lot of strain in my view, and is technology the answer? And just how do you sort of think
that that plays out?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Look, Bill, I think fee rates going down are – I think is a reality of what's happening. Some of
that is mix shift, some of that is changing regulation in terms of distribution, some of that will ultimately will all accrue
to the benefit obviously of the end client. I think, ultimately, this comes down to our ability to generate sustainable
alpha.
I think if we can generate sustainable alpha in a way that in some ways kind of captures three to four times the fee over
time, I think we'll be fine. If we're in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable alpha, then
obviously, I think fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly.
<A - Robert Steven Kapito>: So, let me just add to that. One of the things that is happening is that the financial
advisors are looking for lower cost products. So, first, there's a shift, and they need to go to a firm that has a wider
range of products, both active and passive. And then secondly, they need to look where they can find the best value at
the best price.
Both of those really bode well for BlackRock and that is why Larry used the words in his brief, deliberate and strategic
investments that we're making. So, we are making those investments in those core type of products that we know the
financial advisors will need to be able to do the appropriate asset allocation they need at the best value and the best
price. So that shift is actually moving in our direction.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let me just put it into a different context too. And I think this is missing in the
narrative. There is a greater belief that long-term returns are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So
if you have an expected long-term return of, let's say, 6%, which many people think that might be high when you look
at a balanced portfolio.
Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low return environment, our
clients are under a lot of pressure, and clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why
I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have this structural problem. Their liability or
their actuarial needs are greater than they can earn with their asset base. And so they're looking either to barbell, they're
looking to have less expensive products, but they're looking for a much more holistic solution.
And I think the era where a manager sold a product, a sole product, that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob
just said, we're in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues. We've had a
couple of state funds announced that they're lowering their actuarial rates. That's very hard to do.
If a state fund lowers their actuarial rate, that means they have to go to their union and say, pay more. That means they
have go to the state and say, contribute more. And so this is one of the real issues that I think has been lost. So, when
we talk about fee pressure, fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expected returns. And I think this is one of
the big issues around hedge funds and why we're constantly reading about some hedge funds closing, some hedge funds
are lowering their fees, because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk-adjusted basis that they
are achieving.
So this is a broad-based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area; it's across the spectrum of clients. I know I'm
belaboring this point, but I think it's a very important point, but this is the environment we all live in, and I think this is
an environment that really positioned BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem, we're
dealing with this issue, and we're taking advantage of it. I'll leave it at that.

Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Hi, there. How are you doing?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Very well.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Yeah. I guess maybe a question just on – you mentioned in the past and more recently
some investments on like the tech side, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and just wanted to get a sense like
when we think about that opportunity, are you looking at it more from like a product, from a – the active teams using
those as tools being able to help clients out? Is it a cost initiative? Just wanted to get some granularity on where do you
see kind of the opportunities around some of these investments?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, let's be quick. Technology creates efficiencies across everything. So, we look at
technology not just for portfolio construction and portfolio management. We're using it for client connectivity; we're
using it for efficiencies within our platform. The technology advancements we made in Aladdin related to dealing with
our custodial bank saves us large sums of money.
So I want to talk about technology is changing every component of our firm. And I think this is one of the reasons why
our margins have been consistently strong by the utilization of technology across all the spectrums.
You asked specifically related to technology, related to investing, because the advancements in technology, because the
utilization of sensor technology, because the Internet playing a role in everything and anything we do, there is
information that we could not search for or find years ago, whether it is communication by employees about their firms
and consumer sentiment about a product.
And so, by having the ability to do deep dives on data, interpreting that data through different algorithms and models,
hopefully, that will be creating excess alpha. So, it creates product, it creates product returns. And so that's where we
look at the greatest amount of advancements.
We're also looking at computers and can computers be learning and adapting end markets. But that's something for the
future. But, importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to
be really the key component of driving, I believe, returns and active investing in the future.
And I do believe, because technology has created the efficiencies, it creates more efficiencies across and we can't pass
on those efficiencies also to our clients and I think this is one thing that's being missed. Here we are, we talked about
some of the fee cuts, and yet, we have an increase of 100 basis points of margins.
So, we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing, for custodial assets, for communicating with our
custodial clients, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element
that is going to transform BlackRock and, I would say, every other financial services company. So, technology is what
is driving the scale at BlackRock, and it's driving hopefully better outcomes for and to our clients.

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Michael.
<A - Michael J. Cyprys>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Larry, you spoke about building
blocks to deliver outcomes and greater use of ETFs to generate value. I guess just few thoughts here. One is, how far do
you see that trend going and, I guess, just second, how do you think about the impact that this has on the value chain
for the industry?

In other words, if this shift toward asset allocation continues and the move towards building blocks and assembly, how
do you see the value shifting here and your ability to charge for manufacturing versus the ability to charge for your
distribution – excuse me – for your ability to charge for assembly and then also the value of distribution here? Where is
it most defensible and how do you think about evolving your positioning from here?
<A - Robert Steven Kapito>: So, it's Rob here. So fees are really just one aspect of the value proposition. And quite
frankly, after many years in the business, I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than the ETFs. So
one is, it's going to be a tool where we're going to use it for a precision type investment, where you can accent one
specific area of the market in your portfolio.
Two is that you can actually make better judgments in the active equity space by using what we would call smart beta
ETFs. So that would be a bit of a derivative to it, but focused on certain factors that you'd want to have. Three is that
it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution, which is a growing area of the market, where you'd have just – you need in
order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in the low interest rate environment. You need to focus on specific
sectors of the market and ETFs allow you to do that at the right value.
And the third thing, which I really like is in the fixed income area, where the exposure to just one particular fixed
income bond is not going to give you the type of return. There's just too much risk for the cost of that. So, by using an
ETF in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion, you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a
much lower cost.
Also, the world is moving more towards portfolio construction capabilities. This is going to be in what we're calling
models that we're going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management and here is where we can
utilize our technology as a differentiator because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution which has the right risk
requirements for that particular client. And we're building technology around that. So you've heard us mention Aladdin
Portfolio Builder, where we're giving financial advisors the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together
using our products, using other people's products to come up with the ultimate solution.
We're using it in a product that we call iRetire where we're trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the
largest problem facing our country and others today, which is the lack of savings for retirement, getting that cash that's
sitting on the sidelines, working for people those – for those people that are going to retire, and being able to illustrate
to financial advisors and their clients better capabilities to achieve those results, and then also expanding into giving
model portfolios to the financial advisors and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology
on the outside. And then, on the inside, we have precision instruments through the ETF business that can help our
clients achieve their financial objectives.

Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Good morning. I just want to maybe ask a little bit about the announcement of repositioning of the
equities business in the U.S. And I guess more specifically, the changes you announced, I believe, relate mainly to the
U.S. business, and you didn't – I don't think you made same kind of changes outside the U.S. Can you maybe talk a
little bit about why you didn't think some of that repositioning was maybe necessary outside the U.S., how that business
or market maybe differs or is different somewhat from what you're experiencing here and maybe compare the two?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Hey, Rob. It's Gary. I'll just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can
jump in as they feel. I think, ultimately, we're looking at those efficiencies and development and maturity of markets.
And when we think here about the repositioning, it really follows much more along the line of how we approached our

product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago at the end of 2012.
And in that case, it was really trying to align who the particular buyers of the product were with the right fees and, in
this case, it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable alpha in certain products with the fee potential.
And so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core alpha and high conviction in some respects, I
think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S. large cap market in particular ability to really
generate sustainable alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad-based portfolios that really tinker
around indexes. I don't want to necessarily say index hugging per se, but your ability to take risk and generate
incremental return needs to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential. And so it was really in that context
that we really try to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable alpha.
Outside of the U.S. market, in lesser developed markets, less efficient markets, more dispersion, less correlation, I think
we still feel very strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that frankly the ability to
generate sustainable alpha can support higher fees and I think our performance has certainly showed that over time.
<A - Robert Steven Kapito>: So let me jump in there. So, this is not just a U.S. announcement that we made. We're
talking about our platform, Rob, and our platform is going forward believing that both human and technology is better
than one or the other. So in the platform that the portfolio managers are going to be using going forward, they're going
to have the ability to tap into both the data that we're getting from our technology, from our scientific active equity
groups, and the fundamental groups, because we believe that those people talking together, using the data, using the
signals that we're getting and the block and tackle fundamental approach together are better than either individually. So
it is a platform change that we made. It did have, because of the reasons Gary cited, more immediate attention on the
U.S., but it's a platform change that we're making globally in our active investment business.

And your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Dan. Good morning.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Fannon>: Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on kind of Aladdin and the technology
business. As more clients adopt the platform, at what point does the platform become too big? Or there's been articles
out there about potentially introducing systematic risk into the system if "everybody is on your platform", that they're
using the same tools, technology that you guys [ph] develop (54:07)?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, that's a pretty complex question, and I don't think there is a risk of it being too
big. So, let me try to deconstruct your question. Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform, it's an enterprise
platform. So, A, there are many companies that provide enterprise platforms for different companies, whether it's
Oracle or SAP or cloud computing. So, an enterprise system, and that's what Aladdin really is, because it's a front,
middle and back office platform, and a component of it is risk management.
I think you're referring to the risk management components of it. It's a service model. We provide with different
models, each individual client can put their own algorithms on to Aladdin that are customized for them, so they can
interpret the models. So it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many
people use it then it becomes systemic is, it is just not a point of understanding what the platform really is.
I think by the clients' interests, the opportunities we have, the opportunities there are as large as ever. And it is because
of its enterprise solution. And as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks, ultimately, it's going
to simplify all trading – trade entry, compliance, working alongside with the custodial bank, it will create so much more
efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system.
So, if we could provide for Aladdin, for other clients, this enterprise system that creates this type efficiencies that make
them in a better position, we're all better off from it. So, once again, Aladdin is a service model, it's not BlackRock's
model. And so I think we're happy to give you a demo on Aladdin, what it is and what it isn't.

Our final question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Patrick.
<Q - Patrick Davitt>: Hey, thanks. Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the active repositioning
and the charges taken there as well as the move of the custody assets to JPMorgan, I'm curious if all these moves are
really about helping pass those savings on to the client and absorb the fee cuts we're talking about or should we start to
see some visible improvement to your operating results because of these moves?
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Well, Patrick, it's Gary. I'm hoping that you'll see both. As Rob said, part of the reposition in
the active portfolio was basically trying to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients, obviously, in terms of better
sustainable alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent at the end of day is to generate incremental
growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of price and performance that we
think ultimately will drive better organic growth.
In terms of some things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers, in many cases – in certain instances,
our clients pay those fees, in which case that will be a direct benefit to them. And in certain cases, as if in our ETF,
which is a unitary price structure, BlackRock itself pays those fees, so our shareholders will clearly benefit. So I think
that in all cases, we're going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth. That growth is ultimately better for both
clients as well as shareholders.
And I think as you look at margin expansion over – whether it's just the last year-over-year where it was 100 basis
points or, frankly, even since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009, and margins are probably up 400 to 500-plus
basis points since then. And I think there is no question that we're using our scale to generate better outcomes for both
clients and shareholders. If it's good for the client at the end of the day, we strongly believe it's going be good for the
BlackRock shareholder.
