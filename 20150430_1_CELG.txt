I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
During the first quarter we made outstanding strategic and operational progress across functions, in major markets and
with key partnerships. Our teams built on the operating momentum from last year and delivered strong financial
performance. We are well positioned to achieve our 2015 goals.
Peter, Jackie and Scott will summarize our excellent year-on-year financial and operating performance and provide
important details about the strength of our business, product and market dynamics and the near term opportunities for
our franchise. Bob will add his perspective on our outlook before we open the call for your questions.
The six regulatory approvals for REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE, and OTEZLA are among the most notable
accomplishments in the first quarter. We've continued to leverage the significant investments in clinical trials made
over many years to enhance the value propositions of our therapies. These approvals provide important new treatment
options for thousands of patients and they created new commercial opportunities that represent some of the most
important drivers of our financial outlook from now until 2020.
The REVLIMID newly diagnosed multiple myeloma approvals in the United States and Europe are, of course, critical,
as they further strengthen the position of REVLIMID as the backbone of treatment for myeloma. We also made
excellent progress in the first quarter building for the future. In addition to advancing the Comprehensive Clinical
Development Program for GED-301 in Crohn's disease, we added exciting new opportunities to our robust internal and
external pipeline that have the potential to make an increasingly meaningful difference in the lives of patients and to
contribute to our long term growth.
Our recently announced strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca strengthens our competitive position in the rapidly
emerging and evolving immuno-oncology market. To date, we have been opportunistic, anchoring the clinical
advantages of ABRAXANE and REVLIMID in combination studies with T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, across tumor
types and with several different partners. This new collaboration with AstraZeneca gives us the unique opportunity to
actively drive the development and commercialization of the anti-PD-L1 access inhibitor MEDI4736 as monotherapy
and with our existing commercial and emerging clinical therapies in Hematology, a core area of strength.
To further advance our leadership in the field of epigenetics we completed a definitive share purchase agreement with
our partner, Quanticel, committing to an acquisition that will bring Quanticel's proprietary platform for single cell
genomic analysis of cancer stem cells and their development programs targeting histone methyltransferase into our
research organization.
We expanded our partnership with Agios by exercising our option to an exclusive license outside of the United States
for AG-120, a drug targeting mutant IDH1 in patients with AML, glioma and selective sarcomas.
We also entered into a new joint Worldwide Development and Commercial Development Program for AG-881, Agios's
IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor that has shown in pre-clinical models to fully penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

In Q1 we advanced our biologics program initiating a Phase I trial in multiple myeloma and solid tumors with
CC-90002, our antibody targeting CD47 receptor on tumor cells. Additional early trials with CC-486 were initiated in
diffuse large B cell lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Taken together our immuno-oncology programs now reflect a comprehensive strategy, testing IMiDS and related
cereblon modulators, rational combinations with T-cell checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors and with MEDI-4736 in
hematology, programs directed at amplifying innate anti-tumor immunity, combinations of CC-486 deploying
epigenetic priming and engineered T-cell.
These and many other developments reflect our commitment to medical innovation and sustaining long-term growth
and are supported by the operational excellence and high-quality financial results that we delivered in the first quarter. I
would like to close my remarks by thanking our global teams for their outstanding work and commitment to patients.
And I'll now turn the call over to Peter who will provide additional details on our financial results. Thank you.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
As Mark mentioned, we are off to a very strong start this year. Our key products are growing significantly and we
added new top line drivers with several global approvals across the portfolio, all of which we expect will sustain our
momentum well into the future. While we are focused on delivering current performance we continue to invest for the
long term.
The deals we announced this month add to the growing pipeline of partnered and internal programs that represent the
next generation of growth drivers at Celgene. Today we have over 50 unique programs advancing through various
stages of pre-clinical and clinical development.
Now investing for the future is a high priority for the company. And given the strength of our financial performance we
are able to strike a balance between making these critical investments for the future and returning capital back to
shareholders through the share repurchase program.
Now turning to the first quarter results, total net product sales grew 20.4% to approximately $2.1 billion. This growth
accelerated from prior periods and was driven by continued strong growth in REVLIMID in addition to the ongoing
launches of POMALYST/IMNOVID, ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer and OTEZLA. Volume accounted for 19.3
percentage points of the growth, while the modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove a negative ForEx impact of approximately $27 million or a 1.6% negative
impact to net product sales growth. $22 million of this $27 million impacted REVLIMID. Yet, despite this headwind,
total net REVLIMID sales grew 17% year over year to $1.34 billion and was primarily driven by impressive growth
within the U.S. POMALYST/IMNOVID, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA combined for net sales of $482 million dollars, a
50% increase compared to Q1 last year. These products are performing strongly in the marketplace and importantly,
they are still in relatively early stages of their global launches.
Now, in looking at the sequential performance, as I mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, REVLIMID and
POMALYST are always impacted in Q1 by higher gross to net adjustments related to early Medicare donut hole and
other ACA payments. It's also worth noting that the ForEx impact on REVLIMID between Q4 and Q1 was a negative
$10 million. In addition, customer buying patterns negatively impacted ABRAXANE by approximately $12 million to
$14 million. Now Jackie and Scott will provide additional color on the underlying product dynamics later in the call.
This robust top line product performance drove an adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, a 29% year-over-year increase
and an acceleration from prior periods as we continue to deliver [audio gap] (9:25) P&L.
Year-over-year the adjusted operating margins improved 190 basis points to 52.4%. The improvement came primarily
through the SG&A line, as strong G&A leverage continues and we are beginning to see sales and marketing leverage

from the investments made in prior years, and we expect that leverage will grow throughout the remainder of the year.
Combined R&D and SG&A expenses grew $119 million or 15% year-over-year reflecting our continued investments
to advance our very strong pipeline and support the global product launches. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin
improved 280 basis points but was favorably impacted by higher spend in Q4 related to collaboration related payments,
increased participation at fourth quarter medical conferences and the timing of clinical trial activity.
Going forward, we expect the pace of R&D spend to increase due to clinical trial activity and collaboration related
expenses. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin for the full year to be approximately 52%. Our adjusted
earnings quality remains strong and operating income accounted for $0.21 per share of the year-over-year increase and
the financial levers modestly contributed the remaining $0.03 per share.
We ended the quarter with $7.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 85% is located
outside the U.S. The cash flow from operations was $858 million. During Q1, we repurchased approximately $1.1
billion in shares. Now the pace of our repurchases can fluctuate throughout the year as we prioritize our capital
allocation across internal investments and external opportunities. However, we do remain committed to returning
excess capital to shareholders through the repurchase program.
To complete the financial picture, we assess return on invested capital both with and without cash in the capital base.
The trend for both metrics shows a competitive return that improves over time. This gives us confidence that we are
making the right strategic investments to generate long-term value for our shareholders.
So, to summarize, the financial and operating momentum in Q1 provides a very strong foundation for the full year. We
are well on track to achieve our net product sales guidance of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, and with the additional new
R&D investments associated with maximizing the opportunities with AstraZeneca, Quanticel and Agios that were
announced just this month, we expect to deliver our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.60 to $4.75.
Thank you. A great first quarter and now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone.
The Hematology & Oncology team delivered stellar results across the franchise in Q1. Our overall net sales grew 18%
year-over-year, excluding the 1 percentage point negative impact of foreign exchange, and REVLIMID grew 19%
year-over-year excluding foreign exchange, driven by volume.
For all of our key products we hit our goals, and the regulatory achievements we landed in Q1 set us up well for strong
growth to come over the remainder of this year and beyond. We made great progress advancing our clinical
development pipeline and are moving forward with a number of collaborations in the immuno-oncology space,
including the very exciting recently announced partnership with AstraZeneca MedImmune that I will speak more about
in a moment.
REVLIMID is off to an outstanding start to the year. Duration of treatment continues to increase across our key
geographies, and our market shares are strong across myeloma overall, and in the relapsed refractory setting. We are in
launch mode for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in both the U.S. and Europe, following regulatory approvals
during Q1. We are on the market in the early access countries in Europe, and our teams are focused on driving to
successful outcomes with our ongoing reimbursement discussions across the other countries in Europe.
It is early days for the launches in both the U.S. and Europe and the initial positive commercial momentum in both
geographies bodes very well for REVLIMID's future growth trajectory in newly diagnosed myeloma.
Across both relapsed refractory and newly diagnosed myeloma we have significant growth still ahead of us in
numerous geographies. We are looking forward to incremental contributions from both Russian and Mexico this year
and will update you on those markets as we roll out our launches in relapsed refractory myeloma there.

We are very happy with progress on our REVLIMID clinical program in lymphoma, with the last two initiates of our
current program of five phase three trials in lymphoma; the ROBUST trial for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma now
enrolling. As we will see when I talk about ASCO in a moment, the FLASH meta-analysis in follicular lymphoma has
been accepted for oral presentations, and we look forward to that.
To put Q1's REVLIMID performance in perspective, we grew sequentially by 2% versus Q4 of last year even with the
foreign exchange headwind. This is our best Q1 over Q4 sequential performance in the past four years. Across all
major geographies our shares are strong and trending upward and duration of treatment continues to increase as well.
In the U.S REVLIMID hit all-time record highs in average daily total Rxs and new Rxs in Q1. We are in the early days
of the newly diagnosed myeloma country launches across Europe and we anticipate significant market share gains in
that largely untapped indication over the coming months and years as we gain reimbursement approvals over time.
We also see incremental share gain opportunities in the U.S now that we have a broad myeloma label from which to
promote the product. We expect an approval for newly diagnosed myeloma in Japan around the end of this year and
then an incremental growth opportunity associated with that indication in Japan starting in 2016 and beyond.
Finally, we believe the ongoing emergence of triplet regimen data in myeloma, some details of which we should see at
ASCO, will further support REVLIMID's backbone position in the treatment paradigms for myeloma and further
solidify the product's market share positions and duration gain trajectory. This summer we could see the first U.S
regulatory approval of one of these triplet regimens with REVLIMID based backbone therapy.
We are extremely pleased with REVLIMID's strong start to the year and now expect REVLIMID revenues at or above
the upper end of our product sales guidance range of $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion.
POMALYST/IMNOVID leading position in third-line and greater myeloma continues to solidify across multiple
geographies. POMALYST share trends in both the U.S. and E.U. are favorable and duration of treatment has been
increasing in the U.S. since launch.
IMNOVID is penetrating rapidly in Europe and we anticipate the same duration trends over time as what we have seen
in the U.S. We recently received final regulatory approval for POMALYST in the U.S. based on the MM-003 trial data,
and we received an update to our label that now includes overall survival data. We also achieved approval for
POMALYST in Japan in February, about 18 months or so ahead of our original plan, and we are now working with the
reimbursement authorities there and expect pricing approval in June.
Clinical data for POMALYST in combination regimens is emerging, and that data will further support the product's
position in the relapsed refractory myeloma segment. We have Phase II combination trials enrolling for POMALYST
with checkpoint inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors, and are excited about the prospects for this
program.
On this slide you can see the growth trajectory for POMALYST since our Q1 2013 launch of the product in the U.S.
Upon U.S. launch we saw very rapid uptake and market share gains over the first four to five quarters post-launch,
driven by the medical need for treatment options in the third line and greater setting. We have since seen more
measured but steady share gains coupled with increasing duration of treatment in the U.S. In the early launch European
markets we are seeing this same pattern as we are just reaching that four-to-five quarter post-launch time point in
markets such as Germany.
In Q1 in Europe we had a bit of headwind for IMNOVID as a result of an increase in the government rebate percentage
in the U.K. that took effect January 1, and a delay in uptake in Spain as the regional reimbursement process has been
slower than expected, though it is now moving along. Our Q1 2015 POMALYST/IMNOVID performance set a new
Q1 baseline for the quarter, and we see a strong future growth trajectory ahead for the product as it approaches
blockbuster status this year.
Most major markets in Europe have not yet reached their full first year of sales, and we expect reimbursement in Italy,
Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands over the coming month. Durations of treatment are also trending up across Europe

and have not yet reached the same levels as in the U.S. Furthermore we are very excited about the contributions to
POMALYST's growth to come from Japan and other markets like Australia and Canada.
Turning to ABRAXANE, overall share trends are positive for ABRAXANE across its indications in the U.S. and
Europe as well as Japan where we are partnered with Taiho. In combination with gemcitabine the product has become
the standard of care for first line metastatic pancreatic cancer in the U.S., and we remain in the early days of that launch
in Europe. We achieved E.U. approval for non-small cell lung cancer in February, and Germany and Austria are
launching in that indication with other markets to come as we receive reimbursement approvals.
We have multiple trials currently enrolling for ABRAXANE, including the Phase II triple-negative breast cancer trial,
the Phase III adjuvant and Phase II locally advanced pancreatic trials, as well as the ABOUND Program of four trials
across various non-small cell lung cancer indications. We're also extremely excited about the future potential use of
ABRAXANE in combination with a variety of checkpoint inhibitor agents and other novel therapies and are working
with a number of other companies on combination trials in the immunotherapy arena.
We're off to a great start to 2015 with ABRAXANE and we finished the quarter well on our plan. While we saw the
usual U.S customer buying patterns in Q1, global product demand was very solid, and our global Q1 2015 result
compares quite favorably to Q1 from past years. We have multiple drivers of growth that give ABRAXANE positive
momentum for the remainder of this year and into 2016.
In the EU we just received reimbursement approval for pancreatic cancer in Spain and Italy during Q1. We still await
approvals in France, Belgium and other EU countries. The contribution to EU ABRAXANE revenues from non-small
cell lung cancer is just beginning and will ramp up over the course of this year and into next. Because some of these
growth drivers are still ahead of us and will impact future years more than this year, we see global ABRAXANE
revenues falling in the lower half of our product guidance range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion, while we are highly
confident of achieving our target of being within this range. And this year, ABRAXANE will reach blockbuster status.
The future for ABRAXANE is bright and the potential positive impact from ongoing trials of ABRAXANE in
combination with immunotherapy agents has not been included in any of our forecasts and represents great optionality
for the product in the medium to long term.
We're excited to give you a preview of some upcoming medical meetings where our hematology and oncology products
and programs will be featured. Starting with ASCO for hematology highlights, we will see updated overall survival
data presented from the MM-020 FIRST trial. The FLASH analysis correlating complete response with progression
free survival will be an oral presentation for first line follicular lymphoma. Finally, there will be significant data
presentations for multiple triplet regimens in myeloma with REVLIMID as the backbone of treatment therapy.
For oncology features we will see Phase I data on demcizumab, the compound for which we are partnered with
OncoMed, and we should see additional program details for immunotherapy combination work being done, including
ABRAXANE as a component of multiple treatment regimens.
The bi-annual MDS Foundation meeting starts today and we are very happy with the expanded presence we have there
covering our Myeloid Disease franchise. We look forward to data presentations for both sotatercept and luspatercept in
MDS, compounds coming from our collaboration with Acceleron. Together with Acceleron we have now chosen
luspatercept to move forward into a pivotal program in MDS.
June's European Hematology Association meeting will again feature a strong Celgene presence, and we expect data
presentations on a number of our products including AG-221 for IDH2 mutations coming from our collaboration with
Agios.
We recently announced an important new immunotherapy strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca MedImmune.
We're extremely excited to partner with AZ MedImmune in this area to aggressively begin our initial focus on a
portfolio of clinical development plans for multiple hematological indications studying AZ MedImmune's PD-L1
inhibitor MEDI4736 in novel combinations.

We believe this collaboration will lead to expanded opportunities to combine novel assets in hematology. Together our
two companies have a unique portfolio of complementary compounds from which to create multiple development path
options to pursue exciting new treatment regimens. Our initial agreement represents a first wave of development
centered on checkpoint inhibition-anchored therapies, and we look forward to expanding into the subsequent waves of
immunotherapy possibilities to come.
After making our upfront payment to access AZ's clinical stage PD-L1 asset, the financial terms of the deal essentially
create a 50/50 sharing by our two companies of the PD-L1 economics in hematology, thus creating a structure under
which both of us are incentivized for maximum success. At Celgene our Hematology Oncology franchise is off to an
excellent start to the year and our continued investments in our pipeline in strategic collaborations like this one with AZ
MedImmune position us for ongoing success and growth over the very long term.
Thank you very much and let me now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Andrew Smith
Thank you, Jackie, and welcome to everybody on the call.
We are off to a very strong start in 2015. Q1 was a quarter full of advancement and accomplishment within the I&I
franchise. During this quarter we saw significant acceleration of prescriptions and revenue for OTEZLA in the U.S.
Revenue was $60 million for Q1 and we are well on track to achieve our goals for the year. Additionally, we received
approvals in Europe and Australia for both PsA and psoriasis. We are also advancing critical aspects of the GED-301
registration program as well as other key pipeline projects.
Turning now to the U.S. OTEZLA launch, we see continuing strong prescription growth that puts us ahead of all recent
launches in this space after 52 weeks of commercialization. The vast majority of use in both PsA and psoriasis is
patients who are coming off non-biologic therapies. Approximately 85% of patients who are initiating on OTEZLA
were pre-biologic and only 15% were coming to OTEZLA from a biologic therapy.
The majority of OTEZLA prescribers have prescribed for multiple patients and despite the highly managed nature of
this category, access continues to be favorable with OTEZLA at 99% formulary coverage and 72% of OTEZLA
prescriptions successfully filled.
If we look specifically at new to brand patient share, you can clearly see that OTEZLA now has the leading share of
new patients, ahead of all other products, branded or unbranded, for both indications. New to brand patients are those
patients who initiate a new therapy in a given month including those who switch, add on, or are naïve to therapy. While
new to brand patients represent only 10% of the market in any one month, market share leadership in this area is a very
strong leading indicator of future growth and also shows the tremendous potential for OTEZLA in PsA and psoriasis.
The early launch dynamics are strong in countries that have launched outside of the U.S. as well. In Canada, after only
four months, OTEZLA leads all promoted brands new to brand share in the private market ahead of public listing and
there are very encouraging early launch metrics in Germany, the U.K. and other European countries.
The data rollout for OTEZLA is expected to continue throughout the rest of the year through publications and at major
medical meetings. The focus of these abstracts and presentations will be mainly on the longer-term data for OTEZLA
which shows a highly differentiated benefit risk profile relative to the other competitive products. Earlier this month,
the New England Journal of Medicine published data from a Phase II proof-of-concept study of OTEZLA in Behçet's
Disease.
Turning our attention to GED-301 we are aggressively moving clinical development plans forward. A registration
enabling endoscopy study is under way. Startup activities for the large Phase III registration trials are ongoing, and
study initiations are expected midyear. A Phase II study in ulcerative colitis will begin in the second half of 2015, and
we are preparing for clinical development in adolescent Crohn's Disease with initiation targeted for Q4.

As many of you know, data from the Phase II IGON 1 study of GED-301 in Crohn's Disease was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine in March. DDW, the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, will provide an
opportunity for further presentation of the IGON 1 data including important subset analyses.
As stated earlier, Q1 was a quarter full of advancements for Celgene I&I. The balance of the year should also be full of
major milestones and accomplishments. We are focused on continuing to build on the strong U.S. OTEZLA launch, the
successful launch of OTEZLA in key geographies outside of the U.S., and also target completing enrollment of the
Phase III study in Behçet's Disease and Phase II studies of OTEZLA in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. We are
aggressively advancing the development of GED-301 and plan on moving other key clinical programs, such as CC-220
and sotatercept forward through important medical milestones in 2015.
We are excited at the momentum that has been created and we look forward to furthering many key aspects of the I&I
franchise throughout 2015. Thank you very much, and I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Scott, and thank you to everyone at Celgene for producing the outstanding results reported this morning,
and for advancing the five strategic imperatives that guide our company. Our commitment to aspirational objectives
combined with our focus on these imperatives strengthen our confidence in the achievement of our near term goals and
positions us for continued long-term growth.
Our sustained investment in our franchise's key programs has contributed to the numerous recent regulatory
accomplishments leading to increasing commercial opportunities. And, as outlined in the earlier presentations, our
commitment to sustaining innovation is being demonstrated by the progress in advancing our internal programs and
accelerating our collaborations with strategic partners. Our most recent investments and partnerships leverage our
leadership and expertise in important areas of research and provide a foundation for future growth in the
transformational areas of immuno-oncology, epigenetics and cellular therapy.
Our first quarter performance was compelling evidence of our team's intense focus on operational excellence, the
foundation of all of our success. As we look to the future we're excited about the numerous near term milestones that
have a potential to fuel significant growth. We expect new data at medical conferences throughout the year, illustrating
the opportunities in our deep and diverse pipeline. All of us at Celgene are energized and committed to delivering
exceptional results and capturing the full potential of our company.
Thank you for joining us this morning and, operator, would you please now open the call to questions?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Geoff Porges of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is
now open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Thank you very much for taking the question. Congratulations on all the progress this
quarter. First, a question for Peter. Just on one-time items, you mentioned the gross to net and presumably there was a
step up in your co-pay assistance contributions in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense of the magnitude of how
much your gross to net went up from Q4 to Q1? And also potentially how much the co-pay assistance went up and any
other one-time items. It was helpful to see currency.
And then just a little bit on the AstraZeneca collaboration, it's certainly interesting, but could you perhaps explain to us,
what are the assets from Celgene that are shared with AstraZeneca that go into the collaboration? It's pretty clear what
happens with their PD-L1 but what are you giving up in return for that access? Thanks.

<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Great. Hey, Geoff, this is Peter. Thank you very much for the questions. So, look, I'm going
to go into reverse sequence, if I can.
Let me just talk about foreign exchange first, because I know foreign exchange is a topic for a lot of multinational
companies like us. And in fact, as I mentioned, at the top line versus prior year, foreign exchange was a net 1.6%
negative impact, or $27 million. Just to break that out for you versus prior quarters, so going from Q4 to Q1 it was a
negative 0.6% impact to our total company growth.
Now we have a very active hedging program, so obviously the foreign exchange impact by itself was much larger, but a
lot of that was offset by the benefits of hedges that we'd rolled in over the last three years, and we have a very active
program of that to manage our exposures. Just to give you a feel for that versus prior year, the foreign exchange impact
on our P&L alone, without the hedges, was 5.8% negative, and we had a 4.2% positive impact from the hedges. That
was very good.
Relative to co-pay and other gross-to-net items, we did have a slightly larger co-pay charge this quarter, and, likewise,
the gross-to-net did increase. What I'd have to do is come back to you a little bit on exactly the details of gross-to-net.
We don't often break that out in lots of detail. But it is true that the first quarter always is a little bit more challenging,
particularly for REVLIMID and POMALYST, because of those ACA payments and the gross-to-net filling the
donut-hole contributions.
That said, I think often that's why it's good to compare Q1 to Q1 prior year, because in fact we have that effect every
year. So, as you can see, in our year-over-year growth rates we've done extremely well, even with the foreign exchange
environment, and it's really a great start to the year. For the AstraZeneca asset sharing maybe I'll turn to Jackie for that.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: All right, Geoff, thanks for your questions. So, I think the gist of your question is related
to whether we would share any of the economics on Celgene assets. The answer is no. So the collaboration includes
just the sharing on the PD-L1 asset in Hematology.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Okay. So there's no – none of the assets in your pipeline would be shared, assuming they're
successful, in those indications?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: That is absolutely correct.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Porges>: Terrific. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. I'll get back in the queue.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Cory Kasimov of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hi. Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the update
this morning with luspatercept in MDS and beta thalassemia. Is there anything that you can say with regard to the
potential proposed trial design and endpoints of those files and where you see this product ultimately best fitting into
the market if successful in Phase III? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks for the question. So I would just say with respect to the specific trial design, I
think you'll see more details on the program as we take that forward over time. You had already heard us indicate that
we would luspatercept forward in beta thalassemia, now we've formally taken a decision to take it forward in MDS as
well, and you'll get more details about that Phase III program as we move along in both of those indications.
Our intentions with our partner Acceleron are to just keep those programs moving as quickly as possible and initiate by
the end of the year. So stay tuned for more in that regard.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. If I may, I think Scott's on, hey, Scott.
Congratulations on the New England Journal publication. I was just wondering if you could comment, maybe, on some
of the points the editorialist made. I think the editorialist said that the efficacy was unprecedented but then basically
tried to make the point that – he also thought there was a lack of congruence between clinical and biological signs of
remission. Just love to hear your commentary on that if you may.
And then my follow-up would just be, there's been a lot of Street focus on the upcoming European patent ruling. Just –
I know there's not a lot you guys can say or are willing to say on IP on calls such as this, but maybe just in general, do
you think there's read across in the situation in the U.S., yes or no? Thanks a lot.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Thank you for the questions. There was actually two articles published in the New
England Journal since we last spoke, one on OTEZLA in Behçet's Disease, one on GED-301 in Crohn's and I assume
you're speaking to the Crohn's publication...?
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Yes...
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: The editorial, we thought, was very positive and balanced. Unprecedented efficacy, the
opportunity to potentially change the face of treatment of Crohn's Disease and maybe the first steps in a cure, and some
very positive things. I think it was balanced with some things that we know and we don't know. One of the good parts
of this is I think a lot of the questions that were raised will be addressed at DDW in the abstract and the presentations
there that are looking at some of the subset analyses, the more severe patients, the relationship between dose and
clinical response and remission.
So we're going to get a chance through DDW to dig into that data more and I think that will answer some of the
questions and most of the questions that came up in the editorial, but overall I thought the editorial was very positive.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question on the E.U. patents situations. So that hearing will take
place on May 7. We do not believe that that case will be a read through to the U.S. Why do we not think that? There's a
couple of things that I think people are pretty well aware of. From a standpoint of the differences between the two
geographies on these issues, there are both substantive as well as procedural differences in terms of how the U.S. and
the E.U. looks at these patents in the U.S. The law looks at polymorphs as very distinct compounds in the E.U. It's a
little bit more specific to the fact around the particular patent being examined. We happen to think that our facts are
very strong and we'll see if the court agrees.
But because of those substantive and procedural differences we don't think there's a read-through from the U.S. case to
the U.S. situation – I mean from the E.U. case to the U.S. situation. Thanks.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: All right. Thanks, Jackie.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask two on OTEZLA, if I could? So,
can you just talk a little bit about the gross to net and stocking and if that had any impact on the revenues for the
quarter? And then something I noticed in the charts that you provided, especially on the new-to-brand. It looks like
methotrexate use is sort of declining relative to OTEZLA share rising. Is that really what's happening that people are
using this instead of methotrexate? Or is that just an aberration in the graphs? Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: So, first – sorry, sorry about that, the first comment being on gross-to-net, you do see
differences as you go through the quarters with gross-to-net and with OTEZLA as well as in the Oncology portfolio
and tends to be high in Q1, and so you will see it go down over the course of the year. So that did have some small
impact on revenues.

Methotrexate, what...
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: What about distribution, inventory I think...
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: We expanded distribution at the end of Q4 to include wholesale distribution. That – probably
that had an effect towards the end of Q4 and we saw that drawing down during the course of Q1. So, overall you get a
steady state there from this point forward and GTN goes down during the course of the year.
In terms of utilization of OTEZLA relative to methotrexate, I think what we're seeing from the data, and particularly in
the last few months you're seeing a dip in methotrexate, you're seeing OTEZLA being used early. In the pre-biologic
space some of that is a substitution from methotrexate or an earlier switch off methotrexate to another oral before going
to a biologic. I think you're also seeing some decline in a couple of the biologics which are used earlier, particularly in
the Enbrel space. So I think we're seeing market share being gained from OTEZLA, both from DMARDs and from
Enbrel and other biologics.
Operator
Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess first question is for Scott. So has there
been any plans yet that have put a step edit in place to use OTEZLA ahead of a TNF, just even one plan? And then the
second question is more on the use of Kyprolis, because I know that ASPIRE is coming up and Kyprolis looks superior
to Velcade. Have you seen any changes in the percentage of people getting REVLIMID Velcade to REVLIMID
Kyprolis yet in the States? Is that starting to happen? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: So this is Scott. On the step edit question. We do see some plans, particularly during the
course of 2015, some smaller plans who have taken that step of putting it preferentially ahead of biologic therapy. It's
certainly not a majority of plans at this point. Our goal for the course of the year in terms of access is to be on
completely equal footing. No additional step edits and then longer term get put in a position of stronger forced
utilization ahead of biologics. But we are starting to see some of that happen in the marketplace today.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi Robyn. It's Jackie. So I think with respect to your question about Kyprolis, I mean the
dissemination of the ASPIRE data is still relatively fresh, I would say. The comment that I made in my prepared
remarks about potentially seeing the first U.S. approval of a triplet regimen for that coming this summer relates to that
culmination. I think it's a little bit early to start to make a call on trends there.
What we like about the evolution of this is the story that's playing out with respect to REVLIMID as a clear backbone
therapy in these triplet combinations and the benefit from patients that we're seeing of the PSS improvements and the
treatment outcome improvements with the triplet regimen.
So I think over the course of the remainder of the year and as we go into ASH we'll have a little bit more data to be able
to have some better ideas of true trends that we would see emerging from these triplet data sets and approvals. Thanks.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. Thanks. And if I could have a follow-up, Scott. A lot of investors are talking now
about biosimilars coming potentially 2017, and I assume that OTEZLA will be much more entrenched by then. So what
are you seeing in the space so far as going into potential competition in the TNF space that makes you feel comfortable
that OTEZLA can be entrenched in front of the TNFs or in front of any price sensitivity in the market in the next few
years? Just help us think a little bit going forward how you're thinking about the space evolving.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: We don't see, necessarily, biosimilars affecting what's going on with OTEZLA in the
marketplace. If you take a look at the early data, 85% of the utilization today of OTEZLA is ahead of biologics. The
profile that we have is highly differentiated versus biologics, whether branded or unbranded, and it really is a unique
value proposition for this marketplace that is completely different than you see from the biologics or from biosimilars.
So we don't see it as competitive in this space at all and we think we – really the value proposition of early use

non-biologic space has really played out in the first year of commercialization, particularly in the first quarter, quarter
and a half of psoriasis, you really see a lot of early utilization there, so...
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And having another two years in advance of biosimilars to really build this marketplace. Just a
couple years ago, people didn't even believe the marketplace existed and now it's quite clear, so that – this two years is
very valuable, even though, as you say, the value proposition is very clear in the product profile. So it's very
encouraging.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from John Newman of Canaccord. Your line is now open.
<Q - John Newman>: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congrats on a tremendous amount of
progress here. I'm just curious, on ABRAXANE, do you think as the year goes on there may be some potential for
revenues to move higher in that range of your guidance? And then also, just a follow-up on biosimilars, given the
guidance that we saw from the agency yesterday, what do you ultimately see playing out in the TNF space since it
seems like interchangeability – even though that's a product that goes through the retail channel, interchangeability
could be a little bit of a tall order at the moment. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, John. Thanks for the question. What I would say about ABRAXANE is, we think that
we're going to see a significant acceleration in the revenue growth trajectory over the remainder of the year for several
reasons. We're still in the very early stages of the pancreatic launch in Europe. So though the early launch countries are
ramping up, we, based on the experience that we've had in the U.S., expect for the product to become standard of care
in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. We're seeing very positive share trends of late in the U.S., and,
again, we expect that same position to be achieved in Europe.
As I mentioned in my remarks, we have a number of countries where we're still awaiting the reimbursement approval.
As those come in, those will positively contribute there as well. We also have just started with the lung launch in
Europe and that's completely incremental for us as well. So we just got that approval in the middle of Q1, just started to
launch in the early access countries like Germany and Austria, and all of the approvals in the other countries across
Europe for pricing are still ahead of us.
And then one more thing that, as we move over time will impact even more the future but is not yet included in our
numbers is any potential for ABRAXANE in combination immunotherapy regimens as that space continues to evolve.
So we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the product, and we believe it will be accelerating pretty significantly in
terms of the revenue growth over the remainder of the year and into 2016 and beyond.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: And the question relative to biosimilar impact on the TNF inhibitors, I'm not really in a
position to say what that's going to look like and how the market's going to transform to what extent post-biosimilar
initiation in the U.S. And again, I just want to – we're focused on a different space. We see a lot of utilization in the
pre-biologics space, a very different value proposition in terms of an oral drug, different benefit risk and other things.
So it's not something that we see fundamentally necessarily changing our business dynamic going forward.
<Q - John Newman>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

Thank you, our next question comes from Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe back to the PD-1 collaboration with AZ. Can

<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Eric. It's Jackie. Thanks for the question. So it's still early days in terms of the
evolution of the data in heme-malignancies, as you know. We did significant diligence with our team and the AZ team
and have looked at all of the data available to us at this time and we're quite excited about the potential for combination
therapies in this space, which is why we wanted to move forward with the collaboration.
AZ has invested quite significantly across their solid tumor clinical development plan for this product and they've
started to generate pre-clinical and early data in the hematological malignancies. We feel like with them and the
complementary nature of the assets in our respective portfolios, that we have an opportunity as the leader in
hematology to take this program, accelerate it, move it very fast and with that, the potential product combinations, seek
some multiple different paths to regulatory approval that could potentially include some accelerated timelines.
We think we're in a really good position with this and we're quite excited about the first wave of this with the
checkpoint inhibitor anchored therapies. And then we've got the opportunity to look at both of our respective pipelines
of earlier stage assets and see what we might be able to do there across, again, a range of hematological indications.

Thank you, and our next question comes from Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks. Good morning. A question for Scott. Following up on GED-301. Of course your
endoscopy study's underway. Maybe you can remind us when you can announce something from that, what you can
actually say, what endpoints, et cetera? How much color could you give to The Street as we discuss, obviously, that
part of the program and get confidence around the endoscopy aspect? Thanks.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: We'll have a deep dive around the specific structure and a lot of detail around the whole
clinical program for GED-301 at DDW next month. What I can say is about the endoscopy study is, it's a 12-week
study. There's a mucosal healing endpoint at 12 weeks, but then there's a 52-week extension on that, to see durability of
remission over time. So the full study to completion is 12 plus 52 weeks getting us to 64 weeks. And as always, we will
make that data available through medical meetings and other sources of appropriate publication when it's completed.
But it's a 12-week study with a 52-week observation period. Again, we'll go through a lot of detail on all those studies
at DDW, but that study is up and going and we're very excited about it. It's enrolling very actively and hopefully that
will get done quickly.

Thank you, and our next question comes from Ian Somaiya of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: Thank you for taking my question. Just as I look at your pipeline you've done a tremendous job of
building a pipeline that should drive growth well into the next decade. What I was hoping for is maybe if you could
provide some color on some line extension strategies specifically for REVLIMID? Despite the breadth of the portfolio
that you've put together, and one can imagine that REVLIMID still would be 40%, 50% of overall sales despite success
for the vast majority of pipeline drugs. I was just hoping you could comment on that.
And just on GED-0301, I was surprised to see a pediatric study in Crohn's. What type of safety work was required to
move forward on that, and I guess how should we think about the overall safety of the drug in light of your decision to
move forward there?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Ian, it's Jackie. Thanks for the question. So let me start with the REVLIMID question.
So I think the most significant program that we would focus on for the moment is the lymphoma program, so we have
five phase 3 trials up and running and rolling in lymphoma. Some of those have already completed across a number of
indications: diffuse large B-cell, follicular you will see, again, the FLASH analysis has been accepted for oral
presentation at ASCO around the surrogate end point of complete response for PFS. And then we will have a better

idea and be able to talk about the potential impact of that on time lines.
So we are very happy with where we are in terms of the momentum in the current commercial business around the
newly diagnosed launch. We're seeing great results from that, already expect acceleration of that over the remainder of
this year. So, for the next few years quite happy with that, with how we think REVLIMID is going to play as backbone
therapy in the myeloma space. And then when we look out a little bit farther, we've got all these potential indications to
come in lymphoma.
It's been also possible that in the first wave of the immuno-therapy regimens that REVLIMID could be an enabling
compound to bring novel therapies to market in combination faster as well. So great place for it in the portfolio and
helping us get on to the next round of things to come even beyond.
<Q - Ian Somaiya>: Yeah, I guess my question is more geared towards how do you ultimately replace REVLIMID
and what's the strategy there?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Well I think it's a little early, but with respect to how we see the market playing out, I
mean I think about it not exactly as quote unquote "Replacing REVLIMID," but it's more about how do we continue to
evolve the treatment paradigm to best impact patients' lives and do that in such a way that the business proposition is
there for us to sustain our growth profile for a long period of time with a portfolio of products that would allow us to
continue to be leaders in multiple myeloma, and become leaders or have leading positions in other indications as well.
So I think as we continue to take things forward and what you are seeing more and more of between the evolution of
biomarker evidence and other things is more targeted therapies where you could continue to see segmentation in the
market and our products taking leading positions in different segments of the market, so you could very much see it
being a portfolio of products that over time comes into sustain our REVLIMID franchise for a very, very long period of
time rather than just one product replacing REVLIMID. So we would see it playing out that way, targeting high risk
and unmet medical need segments and making our way through the process.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: I just want to add a little to that. I think, Ian, this has been clearly a long-term strategy, both as
Jackie points out, to have very fundamental research in the space of the biology that leads to the B-cell malignancies
and the whole protein homeostasis area. That gives us confidence that as the technologies increase and our abilities to
segment patient populations into specific biological responders in targeted areas, we will have the products from our
own internal portfolio and through collaborators that will allow us to have a greater and greater impact on the disease
where REVLIMID exists today in a general way.
So we're very optimistic that our own internal research pipeline's going to do that. And at the same time we have built a
portfolio and a pipeline approach that we believe will have, regardless of what happens, a very strong growth trajectory
in addition to that. So we're not just looking to deal with replacing REVLIMID. We're going to continue to grow
through it. And we're going to provide better alternatives and therapies to patients in those specific areas over the next
decade.

Thank you.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: Specific to adolescent Crohn's, just a couple thoughts on that. First of all, it's an area
tremendously large number of patients suffers from adolescent Crohn's. It's a very difficult disease to treat. There's
tremendous amount of high unmet medical need in the space. The conventional therapies work even less well on this
subset of the population than they do in the adult population. So it's an area of really high unmet medical need.
Given the profile that came out in Phase II that looked about and looked very similar to placebo in terms of all the
different dose cohorts for GED-301 in terms of side effects and severe SAEs, given that side effect profile, when we
had discussions both with both the EMA and with the FDA, they were very encouraging of us to study this particular
patient population. A lot of high unmet need, and there was a lot of – there has been also in the community a lot of

Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thanks for taking the question. It's a question on the cash. I think I heard Peter say about
85% of your cash is ex-U.S. Can you talk a little bit about what the sort of current trajectory is? Is your current free
cash flow rate sort of in line with that ratio? Or is it higher? And sort of coupling with that, I assume the AstraZeneca
deal was paid for with ex U.S. cash, if you can just confirm that? And can you maybe talk about that dynamic of the
relative attractiveness of deals outside the U.S. given your cash base and the U.S. dollar exchange rate, et cetera.
Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Great. Hey, Chris, Thank you. This is Peter. So very appropriate questions. You are right that,
first of all, I'm going in reverse sequence, the AstraZeneca upfront payment was done with offshore cash, and the IP
will be domiciled outside the U.S. so all of those assumptions are correct. I'll come back to that relative to deals and so
forth in a minute.
The one thing I would say, when you look at a cash balance of a company like ours, the cash flow from operations is
actually much stronger in the U.S than you might think relative to where the cash ends up, but what we do is we do a
lot of business development deals in the U.S. and so therefore end up using U.S. cash there, as well as all of our share
repurchase activity is utilizing U.S. cash.
So actually we have very balanced cash flow between the U.S. and the rest of the world. We have very strong cash flow
in the U.S. I just want to make sure you really appreciate that. And it gives us, as I mentioned, ample strength to on the
one hand execute the business development agenda in a robust manner, certainly as Celgene has done over the last few
years and it's been excellent. And yet at the same time really maintain an efficient capital structure and return cash to
shareholders through the share repurchase program.
The cash that's outside the U.S. is deployed on many deals relative to the rights for non-U.S. markets. So even though
some of the deals, for example, may be global in nature, there are some structures where we'll use a certain amount of
U.S. cash and a certain amount of non-U.S. cash to domicile the IP in the relevant markets and the right places. But
overall, we're in very good shape on cash flow. We're very financially strong. We've looked at this going forward and
we're in a very good position to be able to continue our business development agenda and also return cash to
shareholders. So I think we're coming from a position of real financial strength.
<Q - Chris J. Raymond>: Thank you.

Thank you and our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line is now open.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Morning guys, thanks for taking the question. One for Jackie and one for Scott. So Jackie I
know we're early days for the European launch of REV in newly diagnosed, but any color on the experience so far in
Germany with respect to types of patients or new start share? And then when you look to next year what role do you
think budgets will play, budget allocations on demand? And then for Scott real quick on slide 29, it looks like the
positioning of OTEZLA ahead of biologics is working already. Where do you think the next leg of growth is, the bigger
opportunity? Is it naïve patients or is it just expanding the market? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks for the question and hi, Geoff. We just got the approval in the middle of the
quarter and essentially are in launch mode in Europe, what we're seeing in the early access markets and notably
Germany, as it's the largest, is the same trends that we saw in the early days in the U.S. The messaging on the product

is positioning in the front line setting in terms of the target patient profiles and all of those sorts of things are very
consistent. We're seeing quite a nice response there.
Remember, it's quite early, but I think we're going to see extremely strong momentum over the course of this year. We
are in active negotiations with the other countries and it already started quite some time ago working on the modeling
for helping each country appreciate what the budget impact of this approval could be.
There are some offsets when you get a new product approval and it takes a share in certain patient segments and we've
been helping the authorities model those. We've built into our forecast some expectation for the net impact on pricing
associated with coming to market with the newly diagnosed indication and I think we feel good about where we are on
that already and where we're going to end up on it. It's very exciting times for us in Europe with this as we're essentially
going from practically zero market share and now have the ability to drive the product the same way that it has moved
in the U.S.
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: The three major areas that I would see for future OTEZLA growth and we're just at the
very beginning here. So there's a lot of growth ahead of us. There's something like 10,000 to 20,000 patients in the U.S.
who come for treatment, initiate treatment every month in psoriasis and PsA, and so getting a leading share of those
patients and maintaining them for a period of time is a critical area for us. I would also say that there's a component of
this which is market expansion for psoriasis. Of the two million to three million patients that have moderate to severe
psoriasis in the United States, only 10% of them at any one time are being treated with effective therapy.
So expanding that market, providing other options for patients that are easier for them to use, that are oral, that don't
require monitoring, other things, could hopefully expand that marketplace. Then specific to OTEZLA we're just at the
very, very beginning of launch outside of the U.S. We've got Canada, Australia, the European approval and we really
need to get going with the launch of those. We're working very hard. The metrics look really good there, but the
geographic expansion, getting reimbursement and real geographic commercial expansion, something over the next
eight, 10, 12, 14 months I think will have a major impact.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Okay. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Roden of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Matthew M. Roden>: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Your old friends from Abraxis, now at
Sorrento, have a competing paclitaxel nanoparticle that seems that they'd be interested in filing to the FDA and
referencing your ABRAXANE data. So just wanted to see if you could speak to why you think this is or is not a threat
to ABRAXANE, and whether or not this is contemplated in your longer term ABRAXANE targets? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Matt. It's Jackie. Thanks for the question. So yeah, we monitor those developments
very closely. The first thing I would say is that we would not comment on the regulatory filings or potential regulatory
filings or regulatory strategy of other companies. So let's see how that goes.
You have probably seen and had a chance to look into the details of the data and information position that we presented
in our Citizen's Petition. We feel very strongly that PK data alone is not sufficient to evaluate whether a product would
be comparable to ABRAXANE where ABRAXANE's been studied in numerous Phase III clinical trials, and has
demonstrated its efficacy across multiple indications over time. So we'll see how this goes.
We're quite confident in ABRAXANE's future as a chemotherapy agent, nanoparticle technology that does not need
steroid use associated with it and its potential attractiveness, and again with a body of clinical data based on multiple
Phase III trials is supported efficacy that will get used in combination with other therapies in the immuno-oncology
arena as that plays out. So we're standing on the strength of the body of clinical data behind ABRAXANE. And we'll
see how it goes.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mara Goldstein of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Oh. Thanks very much. I know it's early days in psoriasis. But perhaps if you had any
intelligence you could share on OTEZLA and the persistency of the prescriptions? And that is for patients that
discontinue treatment, is that a function of cost/insurance or tolerability? Is there anything you can share with us there?
<A - Scott Andrew Smith>: So the comments I'd like to make on persistency is usually you'd like to have a significant
period of data, 12 months or so. We do have some early six months persistency data. It shows that we are in line with
all analogs in this space. Persistence does not look different than others. I would say I think there is some potential
upside for OTEZLA relative to persistency. If you take a look at this clinical trial program and the first between zero
and 24 months, dropout rates in the clinical trial program, OTEZLA looks very similar to what they do in biologics.
You see a market change after 24 months as you go out to two years and three years where the persistency of patients
maintaining therapy on OTEZLA is much higher than you saw in the clinical trial programs.
So it's early for us. It looks encouraging and in line with what we'd expect. We think there might be some good upside
relative to competitors in this space to keep patients on longer as we start to get one year and two year and three year
data. But there's nothing there outside of anything – outside of the ordinary at all and it's in line with our expectations.
<A - Patrick E. Flanigan>: Great. Thanks for that question. We'll take two more questions if we could, because we're
getting a little late in the time here.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Liang of Leerink. Your line is now open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Great. Thanks very much. Regarding the AstraZeneca deal, is there a scientific reason such as
[ph] REVLIMID's effect on NK cells, and anti-TC (1:08:45) to go with a PD-L1 antibody rather than a PD-1 antibody?
And also, can you give us some color as the mechanism that will be used to distinguishing between heme-malignancy
cells and solid tumor cells?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, Howard. It's Jackie. So again, the data in hematological malignancies is a little bit
early, so we'll have to see how this plays out. You've looked at some of the early science including Nature article and
other things that are out there with respect to that, so as we have the opportunity to work with our partners at AZ with
our early scientists as well as our clinical development team, we'll be able to tease more of that out over time. But we're
very enthusiastic about the possibilities here and let's see how it goes. We look forward to sharing more data with you
as we move along.
So with respect to, I think your question was about the commercial data that we will then eventually have to be able to
split the revenues between solid tumors and hematological malignancies in the U.S., that's pretty straight forward. Also
between numerous data sources and our ability to triangulate across those data sources that are outside the U.S., we
think that that's going to turn out to be relatively straight forward.
And then just to the point on revenues and it links a little bit back to the question that Ian asked, another reason why we
really like this deal on top of the exciting science and everything we think that that holds for us for the future, our share
of the PD-L1 revenues could start to generate revenues for us in as early as 2020. We think it slots in very nicely to the
portfolio in terms of our future revenue generation and diversification of those revenues from the various products in
the portfolio beyond the 2020 timeframe. So thanks for the question.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Mike King of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Mike G. King>: Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. A couple related financial questions. I would note that it
looked like your both R&D and SG&A spend were below consensus. So I guess my question is whether you feel like
you're making the appropriate investments in SG&A against the products. That's the first part. And then the second
part, and I don't know if you can comment on this yet, but it seems like you guys spent a lot of money this quarter: the
AZ upfront, the Quanticel acquisition, the CRISPR investment, Agios, how would we think about that in terms of how
that's going to affect your numbers for the second quarter? Will we expect all of these to be in the non-GAAP P&L, the
GAAP P&L, or some mix of both? Thanks.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hi, Mike. It's Peter. Thanks for the question. First of all for the first quarter as you saw, we
did increase our spending, I think it was 15%, in combination of R&D and SG&A versus prior year. So the first quarter
results do reflect strong investment throughout the world commercially to prepare and actually execute launches for
ABRAXANE, POMALYST/IMNOVID and now even OTEZLA getting ramped up and we're ready to go in many of
the markets in Europe. So we feel like we're making all the investments that are really important and necessary, and
we're driving ahead. Obviously the top-line performance this quarter was very strong, so even sequentially versus Q4.
So we feel all the investments are being made.
I did highlight in my comments going forward that we do expect to see R&D continue to step up, because we have both
internally in our pipeline very exciting programs moving forward, which is really good news and great for the future of
the company. Likewise we have some of the kickoff activity that Scott talked about in GED-301. We will be picking up
some of the AstraZeneca MedImmune clinical activity through 2016. So we will have additional spending areas in
R&D.
On the other hand I mentioned that we continue to get great leverage on our G&A, so as a subset of SG&A, certainly
the G&A infrastructure that's been built is highly leverageable. Our Boudry operation is just fantastic. The teams over
there handle the international arena extremely well and can just work very well with all the launches and expansion of
activity throughout Europe and throughout the world.
We also think that the investments that we have made over the last couple years, quite frankly, are now nicely
leverageable. At this point, quite frankly, the investments we've made have been, let's say, a little bit ahead of the sales
and marketing curve, and now we're starting to see the sales and marketing – the sales curve rather come up the line
really, really nicely.
Now in terms of our handling of different investments that we're making, I would just start by saying really there's
nothing that's going to be any different than has been our practice in the past and be glad to go offline and chat through
each of those components.
Some of the investments we've made are purely equity investments, and so I think that's pretty straightforward. The
upfront buy-in will be handled just like all of our other upfronts for the AstraZeneca-MedImmune immuno-oncology
transaction. So I don't think there's really any change from the standpoint of how we position GAAP to non-GAAP, so I
think we'll continue to roll forward.
I'd just reiterate that it's just great to get off to a strong start in the first quarter with the results that we've posted. I think
that it sets us up extremely well for 2015. Equally importantly we're making investments while we're hitting these
numbers to set up ourselves up to drive right through 2020 and the guidance that we've provided there.
And quite frankly, as Jackie highlighted, a number of the assets that we're investing in, quite frankly, build the potential
of this company in the next decade. So really some of them may not be big factors on a revenue standpoint between
now and 2020 but really start to take off hopefully after 2020. And so I like the way we've got this balanced investment
portfolio of short term and long term as well as strong performance in the top line and delivery of results.

I would just like to wrap up if I could, because that was the last question, I think, and I know we really appreciate
everybody staying with us this long.
I think Celgene is continuing its path of building its future and investing while delivering strong results. The team is
very excited. The number of approvals and new indications that we got this quarter is, I think, probably unprecedented.
We continue to have a very active business development agenda and we're not done at all, so much more to talk about
as we go through this year. I think it's going to be an exciting year and we're really pleased to get your support and talk
about the activities of Celgene going forward. So thank you very much.
