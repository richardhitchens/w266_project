Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of
subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.
Please note that fourth quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales, EPS, and line items of
the P&L will be for continuing operations only.
On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on
our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange
unless otherwise noted.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks Scott and good morning. Today I will discuss our 2016 results as well as our outlook for 2017. For the
full year 2016 we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.20 representing double digit underlying growth.
Continued strong performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion enabled us to deliver
adjusted earnings per share at the upper end of the initial guidance range we set forth at the beginning of last year.
Importantly, 2016 was a year of significant shaping for Abbott. We've aligned our businesses with long-term growth
trends and it's been our intention to build leadership positions in all areas of health care where we compete. This past
year we took multiple strategic steps to ensure we are in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for our
future.
I'll start with the pending sale of the Medical Optics business or AMO. We entered the vision care business several
years ago with the intent that AMO would be a foundational cornerstone for us to build upon. Under Abbott, this
business performed well, gaining share, and improving operating profitability. However, as we looked over the
long-term, we didn't see sufficient opportunities for us to build AMO into a more broad-based leader in vision care. So
strategically the decision was made to strengthen our Medical Device business in a market that offered the greatest
long-term growth and leadership potential, and that market is cardiovascular care, one of the largest and most important
areas of health care.
The recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical creates the kind of market-leading position we seek in all of our businesses.
This includes strong positions in nearly every area of the $30 billion cardiovascular device market, including coronary
stents, cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.
And importantly, Abbott now has one of the strongest product pipelines in the industry. The combined best-in-class
portfolio has the depth, breadth, and innovation to help patients restore their health and deliver greater value to
customers and payers.
So we entered 2017 as a stronger company. The fundamentals of the markets, where we compete, remain strong, and
we had good momentum across our businesses. We're also entering a period where innovation and new product
launches will fortify our leadership positions. I'll touch on some examples of important new products during my
commentary on each of our business in a moment. As we announced this morning, we expect to deliver strong financial
performance in 2017. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 reflects double-digit growth at
the midpoint.

I'll now provide a brief overview of our 2016 results and 2017 outlook for each business. I'll start with Nutrition, where
Abbott is the global leader in the adult market and maintains leadership positions in the pediatric market across several
geographies, including the number one position in the United States.
As expected, fourth quarter sales growth was affected by challenging market conditions in China, including new food
safety regulations that are set to go into effect in January 2018, and a consequent oversupply of product in the market.
Although we expect market conditions will remain challenging in 2017, the longer-term fundamentals of the Chinese
infant formula market remain attractive. With localized R&D in China and a world-class global supply chain, we're
well-equipped to navigate this highly dynamic market with a competitive portfolio of products that are aligned with
evolving customer needs and purchasing channels.
In the U.S., we continue to outperform the pediatric nutrition market, driven by several recently launched new products
and we continue to drive strong growth in both pediatric and adult nutrition in Latin America and Southeast Asia.
Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, which achieved double-digit operational sales growth for both the
fourth quarter and full year 2016, EPD has grown into the business that we envisioned when we created and further
shaped it through a series of strategic actions including the sale of our developed markets business and the acquisitions
of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia.
With leading market positions in several geographies, including India, Russia and Latin America, EPD is
well-positioned for sustained above-market growth in some of the largest and fastest-growing pharmaceutical markets
in the world.
In 2017, we'll continue to execute our unique operating model which focuses on portfolio selling in core therapeutic
areas where we have well-recognized highly trusted brands. This portfolio approach creates unique channel
opportunities and differentiated relationships with physicians, retailers and pharmacies that are looking to offer a
complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions.
We continuously refresh and enhance our localized product offerings through internal development, cross-registration
of brands across geographies, as well as local and regional acquisitions and in-licensing.
In 2017, we'll further strengthen our development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India. In
addition to developing new drug formulations, dosing and other differentiated offerings, the center will act as a hub,
shipping products to over 30 countries that will further develop differentiated products to suit local needs.
In Diagnostics, we achieved another year of above-market sales growth in 2016, and importantly, we initiated the
global launch of Alinity, an integrated family of next-generation diagnostic systems for every area of diagnostics in
which we compete.
The Alinity solutions represent a major leap forward over competitive systems in terms of automation, throughput,
space efficiency and ease-of-use which will help our customers address issues they face every day including higher
testing volumes, constrained staffing and space, and complex disparate processes and instruments.
In the fourth quarter of last year, we obtained CE Mark for our point-of-care, immunoassay, clinical chemistry and
blood screening systems and have initiated the launch of these four systems in Europe. Over the next couple of years
we'll launch the full Alinity suite across Europe and into additional geographies including the U.S. in the 2018
timeframe.
This unprecedented level of innovation is an extremely ambitious undertaking and one that will strengthen our
competitive position tremendously for years to come.
And lastly, I'll cover our Medical Devices business. As I mentioned earlier, 2016 was truly a transformational year for
this business. The acquisition of St. Jude represents a major strategic move that establishes Abbott with a premier
medical device business comprised of cardiovascular, neuromodulation and diabetes care. These represent some of the
largest and fastest-growing areas of health care and we now hold leading positions in each area.

In 2017, our focus will be on integrating the businesses, achieving the projected synergies and financial targets and
successfully delivering on new product launches.
Our integration approach will bring forward the best of both companies with a focus on creating a best-in-class
cross-functional organization. In terms of synergies, we anticipate annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million by 2020,
including revenue expansion opportunities as well as operational and SG&A efficiencies. We've modeled the
progression of these synergies as fairly linear over the next four years.
Lastly, 2017 will be an important year for innovation across our Medical Device business. In our Diabetes Care
business, growth is being driven by FreeStyle Libre, our innovative sensor-based glucose monitoring system that
eliminates routine finger sticks. This system offers convenience, ease-of-use and affordability and is a truly
differentiated solution for the large and growing diabetic population.
In 2017, we'll continue to focus on driving uptake in Europe where we now have over 250,000 users. We received U.S.
approval for the professional use version of Libre in the third quarter of 2016, and we look forward to bringing the
consumer version of Libre to the U.S. market in the second half of this year.
Other areas where the combined Abbott and St. Jude business will drive rapid growth and important new product
innovations include mitral valve disease, where Abbott is the global leader in minimally-invasive repair with MitraClip
and has multiple ongoing development programs in the area of mitral valve replacement. The combination with St.
Jude strengthens our R&D expertise in this area and broadens our commercial presence. Atrial fibrillation, where
Abbott is now the number-two player in this fast-growth market with a broad portfolio of products, including the
recently launched EnSite Precision mapping system; heart failure, where Abbott is now the clear global leader in assist
devices and is developing other important heart failure products with great potential to improve outcomes and reduce
costs; and neuromodulation, a fast-growing device market that addresses pain and movement disorders such as
Parkinson's disease.
The addition of St. Jude adds multiple recently launched products that will drive continued strong growth in this
business.
So in summary, we delivered on our projections in 2016 and expect double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth in
2017. Our portfolio is aligned with favorable demographic trends that are driving growth in health care. Through a
series of organic and inorganic strategic actions, we've built leading positions across all of our businesses. And our
broad-based innovation pipeline has never been stronger than it is today.
With these growth drivers intact, Abbott is well-positioned to deliver significant growth in 2017 and the years beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2016 results and 2017 outlook in more detail. Brian?
Brian B. Yoor
Okay. Thanks, Miles. Today we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of
$0.65, in line with our previous expectations. Sales for the quarter increased 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding an
unfavorable impact of 1% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased 2.8% in the quarter.
Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.4% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment
was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 28.3% of sales, all in line with previous guidance.
Overall, as we look back at 2016 we achieved our financial objectives for the year including mid-single digit
operational sales growth and margin improvement to once again deliver double-digit underlying adjusted earnings
growth.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2017. Today we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $2.40 to
$2.50 which reflects double-digit underlying growth of Abbott's base business, accretion from the acquisition of St.
Jude of $0.21, the pending sale of our Medical Optics business which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017,

and the expected unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on our operating results based on current exchange rates.
In terms of our 2017 sales forecasts, please note that all references to sales growth unless otherwise noted are on a
comparable basis which adjusts the 2016 basis of comparison to include St. Jude's 2016 results adjusted for the recent
sale of its Vascular Closure business and excludes sales of our Medical Optics business.
On this basis, our 2016 sales baseline would be $25.4 billion, and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in
the mid-single digits for the full year 2017. Based on current exchange rates, we expect exchange to have a negative
impact of around 2.5% on our full year comparable reported sales.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 60% of sales for the full year, which reflects the profitability mix
of Abbott and St. Jude as well as underlying gross margin improvement across our integrated business.
We forecast adjusted R&D investment for the combined businesses of somewhat above 7.5% of sales, and adjusted
SG&A expense of approximately 30% of sales, which includes expense synergies associated with the addition of St.
Jude. We forecast net interest expense of around $700 million. The increase over 2016 reflects debt related interest
expense associated with the St. Jude transaction, partially offset by deployment of proceeds from the sale of St. Jude's
Vascular Closure business and the pending sale of our Medical Optics business.
We forecast a loss of approximately $15 million on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L for the full year 2017, and
we forecast around $45 million of non-operating expense.
Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 16.5% for the full year 2017. The 2017 adjusted tax rate is lower than
our historical adjusted tax rate of somewhat above 18.5% which reflects the tax deductibility of the higher interest
expense that I discussed earlier.
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We forecast an adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.44. As
you would expect, synergies associated with the St. Jude acquisition are expected to ramp as we progress through the
year.
We forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low-single digits, and the current exchange rates, we'd expect a
negative impact from exchange of around 1.5% resulting in low-single digit comparable reported sales growth for the
first quarter 2017.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 59.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of somewhat
above 8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of around 33% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of
around $210 million in the first quarter.
Before we open the call for questions, I'll now provide a quick overview of our full year and first quarter operational
sales growth outlook by business.
For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single-digit operational sales growth for the full year 2017, with
balanced above-market growth across our key emerging markets, and we forecast low to mid-single digit growth for the
first quarter.
In Nutrition, we forecast operational sales growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2017 and relatively
flat sales growth for the first quarter, with expected sequential improvement in growth rates as we progress through the
year.
In Diagnostics, we forecast operational sales growth above mid-single digits for the full year 2017, driven by continued
above-market performance in the U.S. and international markets. And we forecast low to mid-single digits growth for
the first quarter.
In Diabetes Care we forecast double-digit operational sales growth for both the full year and first quarter, driven by
continued strong market uptake of FreeStyle Libre. And lastly, Abbott's legacy Vascular business and St. Jude have
been combined into our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation business. Yesterday we issued an 8-K that provides
comparable quarterly unaudited sales for the first nine months of 2016, which assumes that St. Jude was part of Abbott

in 2016. This morning we provided an additional 8-K to update the comparable quarterly unaudited sales to include the
fourth quarter 2016. For the full year 2017 we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low to mid-single
digits for this business, and we forecast comparable operational sales growth in the low single digits for the first
quarter.
With that, we will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now
open.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Thank you. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. Perfect. Good morning, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: A couple of things I want to touch on first. So, one, can you talk about the St. Jude
performance in the fourth quarter? The St. Jude CRM sales coming in below, looks like the Street's expectations, and
the guidance for the first quarter seems to suggest that that business is still struggling from the recalls they had in the
third quarter. So if you could touch on the St. Jude performance and then the outlook there? And then second, the
overall business, the expectation I think that Brian laid out was that the business would grow operationally low single
digits in the first quarter but then get to mid-single digits for the year. So if you could walk us through that that would
be great. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. First comment on St. Jude fourth quarter, yeah, CRM I think has continued to struggle. I
mean we can see that in the sales and the share and so forth. I expect that to be rectified imminently here shortly, and
the good news is we've seen in other markets around the world when they've gotten their MRI claim they have
recovered and restored whatever position they have lost. That's obviously been an overhang for them for this last year,
and fourth quarter was no exception. So, good news is we expect that very shortly but your observation about it was
correct. I will turn to Brian here for a little bit of underlying detail on your second question.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Sure, Mike. A step-up in sales throughout the year is simply what Miles message is, with
stabilization of the CRM that we just talked about on the MRI claim, but also the opportunity to penetrate the accounts
that we have with the combined business together is another contributor as we go to the market with a much broader
presence of products, as we call on the various accounts. And also you'll note that they had some nice approval that we
talked about with EnSite Precision, a key driver of growth in atrial fibrillation, which has been growing in the double
digits. We expect a lot of continued strong growth here, and there's also a couple of key catalysts here that we're
expecting as we move through the year, one being Confirm which is in the heart failure space with atrial fibrillation.
We expect that to be a unique contributor for the patients who have atrial fibrillation. And then also, the continued
contribution of neuromodulation. They recently have the Burst technology which has had a lot of success and we
expect that to continue, and then that for deep brain stimulation as well. And then finally, there's one more catalyst and
that's HeartMate 3. It's been doing really well in Europe. They are the leader there. We do expect an approval of
HeartMate 3 in the U.S. as we move through 2017 and that would be a contributor on the back half.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And then just quickly on your bridge, if you would Brian, the assumed impact from
both FX and from the AMO divestiture for 2017?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yeah, the assumed – again on a comparable reported sales basis, which got – and we filed an
8-K this morning – it's 2.5% of sales on a comparable basis and then the AMO business will likely have sales in the

first quarter of no more than a couple hundred million dollars. But as you recall, the full year was about $1.2 billion.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Sorry, I mean EPS.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: On the earnings per share, de minimis, Mike, on AMO. It typically is not a big earner in the first
quarter just based on the pattern of spending, and again, if there is a little de minimis contribution, that also plays into
the moving parts of where we're offsetting the dilution that we're seeing from the Vascular Closure divestiture.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: I'm sorry, Brian. I was talking about the full year bridge for 2017 to the FX headwind, I
think in our model and we were at about $0.08 for FX for the full year. Is that close to [indiscernible] (24:46)?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: You're in the range. It might be a little bit north of that, Mike, probably closer to $0.10.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay. And the AMO divestiture, is that still about $0.11?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: It is. You're right, Mike. And remember this offset too. The AMO divestiture is $0.11 but we're
deploying proceeds, so the net $0.07 and that is a complete wash with otherwise what we had a long time ago with our
general-purpose financing, which is also negative $0.07.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Understood. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to explore some of the trends in Nutrition
because you talked about improvement throughout the year as well there too. So obviously we know about some of the
challenges that you had in China last quarter and you had some puts and takes in the results this quarter. Can you walk
us through your assumptions for how China fares for the early part of the year until you lap your comps? And then
what else is driving that improvement in Nutrition?
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Yeah, hi, Matt. This is Scott. I'll touch on those very quickly. As you know, market
conditions continue to remain relatively challenging in China for all competitors – it is a market dynamic. We do
expect, as we go through the year, our performance in that business to improve. Certainly, as we start to lap through
some of the impacts that we started to feel in the third and fourth quarter here of 2016, we'll see some natural
improvement, but we also expect our business to improve as well.
If you go outside of China though, really there's been nice performance in Latin America and in Southeast Asia. We
continue to perform very well the U.S. in the pediatric side of the business, and then obviously, as you know, optically
our results have looked a bit suppressed because of our scale-down in Venezuela, so our results and our performance in
2016 actually are a little bit higher than the print would indicate there as well. So we have a number of initiatives in
place in China. We're well prepared and understand the situation on the ground, and we'll work our way through it at
the beginning of this year and we expect our growth rates there to improve throughout the year.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great. And then just one follow-up kind of on that earlier CRM question. Just because MRI is
such a big deal, can you talk about why you have confidence that the pacemaker approval could be imminent? And can
you give us any update on the timeline for your high-power expectation for the time you had approval in the U.S.?
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Yes. So I will touch base on the high-power piece initially. So our updates on that are going
to be later in the year. We are looking at about the fourth quarter there for both of those high-power devices. The
pacemaker piece we think is a little bit more imminent. We've had ongoing discussions with the FDA on that front, and
we feel like that one is right around the corner and should start to contribute here fairly early in the year. But the other
two will be second half of 2017 items.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Great. Thanks for the color.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. your line is open.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Good morning, everybody. Hello, Miles. It's hard to resist asking you a bigger picture question.
Obviously we are witnessing what could be dramatic political policy changes in Washington. If I was convinced, it
seems like a lot could have potentially positive impacts on Abbott, but some worrisome things as well. Hospital capital,
spending uncertainty, post ACA changes, especially with some of the trade agreement changes. It's hard again to resist
asking you how are you thinking about some of these issues. Are you concerned that this is all going to be a net plus or
negative? How are you adapting, et cetera, especially given your significant OUS exposure?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes, it's hard to speculate. I'd say in general I'm optimistic, and I'd say for a number of reasons.
Some of the things that have been talked about won't necessarily directly affect us. They may affect a number of
multinationals, obviously. Our new administration is pro-business but there's a lot of moving parts in that as you know.
The things I look for that might affect us, I think early on I think we are all waiting to see if there's a tax reform
package that would allow us the ability to access overseas cash and repatriate cash et cetera. I think that would make a
big difference for a lot of multinationals.
I don't really expect to see any changes in the Affordable Care Act directly affect us as much as I think they will affect
other segments of the healthcare industry or business. And I think a lot of the effort will be pointed at other segments
more than the spaces we are in. At least as far as that is impacted, we're primarily a diagnostic device company in the
United States, and so I think that to some degree some of that impact could be favorable for us.
The other things that I watch going forward is policies that affect strong dollar, weak dollar, strength of currencies and
so on because we are so geographically diverse internationally. I think one of the benefits, it's not the primary benefit,
but one of the benefits of the St. Jude acquisition is it does spread and balance us into developed market currencies a
little more than we have been. And in general I'd like to see stability in the currency markets for us relative to the dollar
which has been a headwind for us for at least four years now. And I think that will affect all multinationals.
So while there is a lot of uncertainty around the various things that this administration appears to be making priorities
out of, I'd say that there's relative few that would impact us early on, and I think the impact is likely to be favorable,
that being primarily tax and/or cash access.
<Q - Rick Wise>: And turning to a cash flow question. Maybe, Brian, you'd want to talk about the cash flow outlook
post the St. Jude deal and maybe any stepped-up initiatives to focus even more on even better cash generation potential,
and help us think what that might mean for debt pay-down over the next couple of years and your target there.
<A - Miles D. White>: Brian is pointing at me to take that question, Rick. There is a stepped up emphasis on cash
flow, definitely. And I'd say, look, we've always been a pretty strong cash flow generator, and we balance our use of
cash, as you know, among internal CapEx, dividend, share repurchase, M&A activity and so forth. Obviously for the
next little while we're not going to be putting a lot of emphasis into M&A. We're going to hold back on magnitude of
share repurchase et cetera. We're maintaining our dividend, growing it a bit. And a lot of emphasis will be put on, I'd
say, rapid pay-down or reduction of debt. And I think that's kind of a prudent place to be for the nearest-term. So we're
being very, very prudent about cash use, cash flow, et cetera, internally.
I think we can do that for a while here and put ourselves back in a range where I think a conservative financial
company like us would be and get back to kind of the normal balance. We've slowed the growth of the dividend. Will
we restore that? We will, but we want to get to some targets and leverage targets first and we want to get there rapidly.
And so not only in terms of our internal investments and so forth that we've across-the-board got a very heavy
emphasis on freeing and generating cash, and I'd say generally when we've had even a little bit of emphasis on that in
the past, we've done very well. So that definitely is getting a lot of attention right now.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Just one last quick one from me on Libre. Libre is off to a clearly brilliant start in Europe, and you
said I think second half 2017 filing in the U.S. How do we think about growth from here and what kind of label you're

hoping for to drive U.S. adoption of the technology? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, it's already filed, but I have to say to be honest that the FDA has shifted sand on us a
couple times here, and so consequently, we're seeking both claims, replacement claim and adjunctive claim. We're
going parallel path on this. And I think that the performance of the product thus far ex-U.S., Europe and other
countries, has been frankly excellent and does have replacement claim and so forth.
I think the potential for the U.S. is extraordinary, and I think not only is the product itself an extraordinary product, but
I think its value proposition is unparalleled. And I think the reason we've been able to get reimbursement in Europe and
drive uptake as much as we have owes to the fact that governments there recognize the value proposition and the
product as not only impact for patients but impact on the costs in the health care system.
So I'd say at this point I clearly can't predict what the FDA's timelines and so forth are going to be here, but we're
upbeat about the potential for it.
<Q - Rick Wise>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the MRI-safe ICD. Last year, St. Jude was
telling the Street approval I think somewhere around the second quarter of 2017. You're now saying kind of fourth
quarter of 2017. Can you talk to us about what's creating this delay? What's the hold-up at the FDA?
<A - Miles D. White>: I think you're referencing – I think you're confusing two different products possibly here, which
is high-voltage versus low-voltage. In effect, we're telling you, no, we expect the low-voltage, which is the primary
bulk of use, imminently here, which you could read first quarter, not second quarter, and high-voltage later in the year;
two different areas.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Yeah, I'd just add to that as well. Obviously, we've been working with them on the
low-voltage piece. There was a bit of a gating factor and these things generally run in parallel as well. So those
discussions overlap and the process overlaps as well. So there's some sequencing to that.
I will say on all of these timing items that I gave around MRI-safe, all of those were contemplated along those lines in
our [ph] deal (36:41) model, so there's nothing different in our [ph] deal (36:43) model relative to those timelines.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. All right. I guess for some reason I thought they were assuming a 4Q 2016
pacemaker MRI-safe approval and a 2Q 2017 MRI-safe ICD approval. But let me just ask you one other question. The
cash proceeds that you're getting from selling the Medical Optics business to J&J and the cash proceeds that you've
received from the asset sales to Terumo, have you applied that to your 2017 guide? In other words, are the cash
proceeds being used to pay down debt, or is it – are we waiting to get more clarity on Alere? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: No, we're not waiting for more clarity. We've pretty much applied it to our entire borrowing
scheme, et cetera. No surprise. We sort of as we went into this plan for many different paths and outcomes, so it's
contemplated in our financing.
<Q - Glenn John Novarro>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarity, guys.

<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First on EPD and Diagnostics,
the Q4 (sic) [Q1] (38:02) guidance was a little softer than the full year 2017 guidance. Can you talk about what's
driving that? And what drives the acceleration? And just second for me, Brian, can you talk a little bit about the margin
profile of the company beyond 2017? The guidance you gave for this year implied, if my math is right, about a 22%
operating margin and a better gross margin than we expected. Just a little color on how to think about the margins
going forward? Thanks.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Sure. Larry, I'm assuming when you're talking about Established Pharma you're referring to the
Q1 guidance, and it is a little bit low. 2016 was the last, and it was just the timing of when these shipments are received
of some essential medicines into Venezuela, so that's just causing the last of our quarters of comps here.
They'll step up right through the growth rates we've been accustomed to seeing for several quarters now, which has
been high single, even double digits based on the strength of this business. That's with respect to EPD.
With respect to the margin and how to think about it, there definitely is the impact of bringing in St. Jude into the mix,
and that provides some natural accretion there. You're probably in a very tight range there with what you referenced in
terms of a profile of 22%. I think of the expansion over our 2016 being roughly half mix but also synergies.
Keep in mind we're going to improve the profiles that historically St. Jude had had, and those will ramp significantly in
Q2 and even further from there as we move through the year.
And then finally, gross margin as you know and operating margin have always been a focus for us, and if you want to
deliver double digit underlying base earnings growth, you're going to be naturally in that 70 bps to 80 bps of range
based on mid-single digit top line growth.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Brian, thanks for that. On the Diagnostic business, I didn't hear you comment as to why. If
I heard the guidance correctly, you expect low- to mid-single digits in Q1 but greater than mid-single digits for the full
year. If you could just comment on that, that would be great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: What we anticipate in Diagnostics, which as Miles mentioned in his prepared remarks, is
some really strong growth, in particular as we hit the second half of the year, Alinity really starts to gain some traction
and we gain access to some contracts on that front. So there's some natural strength there in the back half of the year.
In the first half of the year, in the first quarter, what you're seeing – to Brian's point on EPD, there was a smidgen of
Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016 in Diagnostics, and you're also seeing some of that last scale down within our
genetics business, which is well known and as expected in our Molecular Diagnostics business as well. So it's more of a
comparable item there. The underlying strength of that business is strong, and it'll actually pick up steam as we head
out through the year.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Hi. Just a modeling question and a big picture question. For the interest expense line item, I
think, you're modeling about $700 million for the full year. That does include, I think, some of the debt that was taken
out for earlier. What are you assuming with that for the balance of the year in terms of redeployment? Is that assuming
going down to pay down debt? Or share repurchase? Or how should we just think about that to the extent where it does
come in, or doesn't come in, in terms of accretion?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yeah. Kris, and the way to think about the build of the $700 million is we took out $15 billion
of debt for the St. Jude transaction. And I think that was somewhere around 3.75%. Keep in mind too we're assuming
some debt from St. Jude as well. That was a contributor to the addition of debt, and we just had our ongoing normal
debt that had interest on it for Abbott.

When you add all those things up, and then, to Miles' point, say that we – we said we contemplated the deployment of
proceeds from the divestitures that we earlier talked about. That's how you net out to the $700 million.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay. Great. And then I guess big picture for Miles, you had mentioned obviously earlier in
the remarks this is a significant year shaping for Abbott. Certainly, I think we can all agree to that. It's been several
years of shaping. As you look over the next three to five years, how do you just think about Abbott overall? Is it likely
that we'll see another, kind of, reshaping of the mix? Any thoughts on further divestitures of the businesses or potential,
I guess, breakups? I know you're obviously putting a lot in, you know, in 2017 here, but, I guess, how do you just think
about the evolving health care environment, and, kind of, macro-environment now, relative to the mix of your
businesses? Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I put this in a little bit of context, when we spun off AbbVie, which has now been four
years ago, there was a lot of, call it, post-separation, call it cleanup to do. We had to take the attendant overhead in the
company down, finish the back office separations and so forth with AbbVie, and as you know, we did want to reshape
some of our portfolio. We sold the developed markets generic drug business to Mylan, and we acquired CFR and
Veropharm. So we made a number of moves that we think positioned the EPD business very strongly. We had great
organic internal investment in Diagnostics and strong business that really wouldn't benefit from a lot of M&A in
Nutrition. And the weaker part of the company that got attention from analyst, investors and others that we believe
needed strengthening as a fourth leg of the company was Medical Devices, and with the St. Jude acquisition we think
we pretty directly addressed that. And having, placed our investment on the cardiovascular health segment, which we
believe is pretty important, we determined we didn't have the same opportunity in Medical Optics to build and add on
and grow on to that like in this case J&J would. So we divested that.
Now, at this point having made all those significant changes, we look at the company and say we got four very strong
sectors that are very well positioned in their respective product markets and their respective geographic markets.
Our challenge, or at least opportunity now, looking forward for the next few years is integrate St. Jude and frankly
focus on the organic pipelines of new products coming and execute so that we can see the growth benefit of the
strength of these four segments around the world in their various segments. Want to see the growth out of [ph] ADG
(45:05) for all these new systems. We want to see the growth out of St. Jude in our Vascular business for their new
products. Obviously, the same with EPD, which has got a very good sustained growth track, and same with our
Nutrition business.
So I'd say we're going to be focused pretty operationally here for the next several years. That's our intent. I think when
you go through a phase where you've made a number of transactions, people get very transaction focused, and we're
still an operating company. And that's what we intend to be here is an operating company, and operate them very well,
and, grow the targets that we've grown. We've always had double-digit earnings targets, and we positioned ourselves in
growth markets both product and geographically for the purpose of sustaining that identity for investors to be, grow,
double-digit earnings growers and so forth. And with new product pipelines and the strategic positioning of the
company, I think, we're extremely well positioned to deliver on that. So that's going to be our focus for the next few
years.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay. And you've certainly made a lot of individual purchases in the stock, so clearly I guess
that expresses your view on what the future holds.
<A - Miles D. White>: I'd say it very much expresses my view on what the future holds. You always hear these
comments about alignment with your shareholder. I am a shareholder, and I believe that the stock represents excellent
value, and that's why I bought the shares.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Perfect. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yep.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Great. Good morning. So first question is, I just want to make sure I understand the fourth quarter
growth rates in a little bit more detail. Would you be willing to give us the, what was the, sort of, core legacy Abbott
growth rate this quarter ex Venezuela? I know it was 3.8% organically, but how much did Venezuela detract from that?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yeah, our core growth rate excluding Venezuela would have been up around 5%.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Okay. And most of that drag goes away in Q1?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: As we discussed earlier, we'll have bits and pieces in EPD mainly, but then we're through it.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Okay. And then two other quick things. I was wondering if you could give us for the fourth
quarter, what was the legacy growth rate of St. Jude's revenue base any kind of ex divestitures, I was just curious what
a clean revenue growth rate was for St. Jude in the fourth quarter?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yes. So the clean growth rate it was in the low-single digits on the upper end of that around
2.5% or so. We expect, obviously as we go through the year with some of the launches, with the approvals on the MRI
side, with EnSite Precision and some of these other innovations that are coming, as well as with some of the modest
revenue synergies that we have baked in initially, that will ramp over time, that the St. Jude combined business with
ours should accelerate growth here in 2017 over 2016.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: And then just lastly really quickly. On 2017, two quick things. One, the EPS guidance for the
first half was a little bit below where the Street was. Can you help us understand the cadence of the earnings power
over the course of the year, like maybe what percentage of the earnings is in the back half, just given that that Q1
number was a little bit below what we were thinking? And then also I was just wondering if you could give us your
view on Abbott's opinion of the outlook for the growth rate of the ICD market as we look forward into 2017 given that
that's been obviously challenged of late. Thank you.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Let me take the first one here, Bob. I think it's safe to assume that you're going to have greater
than 50% on the back half of the year. And also contemplated in that is the benefit of this financing also that we talked
about. The combination of that, the deployment of our proceeds to generate benefit, and synergies ramp is just going to
naturally put you into a stronger second half versus the first half.
The other thing in the first quarter I'd just note is that when you think about the FX impact, it has a modestly heavier
impact on Q1 relative to the other quarters. So we feel comfortable with this ramp. We know the pieces are in place,
some of them are just simply comps.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: And then on ICDs?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yeah. We expect that market to be relatively flat as an overall market which would be a little bit
of price down offset by some modest volume.
<Q - Bob Hopkins>: Thanks very much for taking the questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning. Maybe two quick ones for Brian and then one strategic question for Miles.
Brian, two questions. It's been a long time since we got the first synergy number of almost a year. Any greater clarity
kind of post close of St. Jude how you're thinking about that synergy number, either the mix of revenue or cost
synergies, the absolute size of that number and the cadence over the next couple of years?

<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yeah, David, nothing really. We said it was going to be linear, fairly linear. We talked about the
mix being heavier on the SG&A side initially, and then the revenues ramping over time. I'd say the difference about us
versus just putting a revenue – or excuse me, a full synergy number out there is we go out and identify these relatively
fast as part of our normal acquisition due diligence. So those are well in place. They're in plans to be executed. We
hope to do a little better maybe in the first year than what we said in linear, but we'll see how that plays out over the
year.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. And I know you and Miles both stressed free cash flow earlier on in the call. Is there
any kind of target either in 2017 or 2018 as a percent of net income we should be thinking about in terms of free cash?
That's a question for Brian.
And then, Miles, I just think given what happened earlier this week, it's pretty interesting, the two best consumer
oriented device companies were probably yourselves and J&J, and they're buying one of your consumer based
franchises but they announced they want to get out of their other consumer facing diabetes franchise. Can you just talk
about how you see the diabetes franchise going forward and why you think that's the right consumer franchise for
Abbott to stay in versus ophthalmology where you made a different decision? So those two, and I'll jump back in
queue. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: I would say we're in kind of a unique position relative to a lot of the traditional competitors in
this space in diabetic glucose monitoring. In the past, the four major competitors there, and there's always – there's a lot
of other smaller ones. It's been a finger prick and a little chip business, and we have a unique position here with Libre
that is a completely different product that eliminates the need for that finger stick, and gives a continuous glucose read
that's frankly impactful for the patient, both type 2 and type 1, in a very different way. And I think that puts us in a
unique position to see a transformation of that market and to benefit from it, if not lead it, and others don't have that.
And I think that the competition in what I'll call the traditional part of the market and the commodity nature of it, the
economics of it have clearly changed negatively in the past couple of years. Ironically, J&J kind of led that. And in our
case, we've got a different position with Libre that I think gives us a unique platform to benefit as one of the disruptors.
And going forward, I believe that platform has possible utility for us in other testing segments. So in our case, we see a
growing business that as we replace the traditional finger stick business, not only ours but others, I think there's an
opportunity there that's a real growth opportunity and a very valuable one.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. And then, Brian, just on free cash, is there a decent percentage to think about maybe
this year or next year as a percent of net income that the free cash generation can be?
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Yeah, David, let me provide some context to you. I think you saw our cash flow from 2015. I
think with all the things that Miles mentioned of emphasis, you should expect to see a little bit of a step-up when you
get to the K in 2016 showing the step function of the efforts we're making here on free cash.
It's tough to completely model out what the ongoing sustainable, I'll say, free cash flow conversion is to net income in
the early years with an integration, but if you look at St. Jude, they're a very powerful cash earner. We're excited about
bringing that into the portfolio. If you take away the one-time things that are transitory, David, that go with an
integration, be that expense or capital that bears fruit long term, we'll probably be in that competitive range that you see
others. Probably somewhere in that 70% to 80% range, that's probably what we target.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Great. Thank you so much.

<Q - Matt Miksic>: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just one follow-up here. I know there's been a number of
questions on MRI and St. Jude, but maybe a couple of clarifications if I could. We hear some different expectations in
the field around these low-power pacer leads and if you could just clarify whether this is a new lead system you're
waiting on, which was our original understanding, or whether we should expect the pending approvals to relate to
labeling on existing leads. It's a nuance that obviously could make a difference as we think about the ramp. And I have
one follow-up.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Go ahead.
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay. Our initial expectation will be a new lead, and I think that's a strong position for us. We
like that, but we are also seeking approval on the existing lead, so that we can provide that as well for existing patients.
But I think going forward we like the notion of a new lead, and so we expect the initial approval here to be that.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: Great. And then the follow-up, just Miles or Scott, if I could, on EPD. Just one of the things that
we get often, questions we get often is just around the sustainability of this growth that you've seen impressive sort of
high single, low double digit, and it would be helpful if you could shed some light on maybe what we can – the drivers
of that business, how we can think about sustainability, what potential future growth drivers could be to carry this into
2018 or beyond would be very helpful.
<A - Scott Leinenweber>: Yeah, Matt, this is Scott. That business has been delivering at a high level fairly
consistently for years, quite frankly since it's been reshaped. The demographics in these markets are aligned with
growth for the long-term. The model that we operate, quite frankly, is quite unique. There's not another multinational
company or a local company quite frankly that operates the model that we operate with the variety of shareholders,
including the trade channel, which is a very powerful channel for us. So given the demographics and the model we
operate and the strong brands that we have, we see this growth rate as highly sustainable over the long-term.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: And that's through sort of – is it portfolio expansion of that product? Is it also geographic
expansion on that sort of core model you're describing?
<A - Miles D. White>: You got several drivers of growth, Matt. It's first of all, the – call it growth or emergence of a
middle-class in a lot of emerging markets. Remember this business is 100% focused in what we'd characterize as
emerging markets and the middle-class income growth and the growth of their health care systems alone is a major
underlying growth driver. Most of these markets are not reimbursement driven. They're consumer driven and have a
model that is both a combination of, I'll call it, medically driven through the physician or consumer driven through the
patient and the pharmacist. So all the drivers of that growth and the distribution structure and so forth say this has got
strong underlying growth.
If, I'd say it's target-rich through geographic expansion in addition and beyond that, portfolio expansion, so a lot of our
organic effort internally is driven toward expansion of key therapeutic areas, expansion of product, formulation
innovation on product, and distribution management. And in a lot of these countries where we are the leader, we are a
leader with not that big a share. So you get all the benefits of being a leader on the shelf and leader in distribution,
leader in breadth, et cetera, with a lot of potential expansion in share gain as well. So all the various factors that would
drive growth are pretty favorable in these geographies and product areas that we target.
<Q - Matt Miksic>: That's great. Thank you.
