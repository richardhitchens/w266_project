Before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang, let me make a couple of brief comments. One
more industry-wide in nature, and the other specific to KMI. Let's start with the industry-wide thought. We continue to
be bullish on the prospects for North American energy, especially natural gas. And as the largest midstream energy
company in North America, we believe we're well positioned in our existing businesses and with our backlog of growth
projects.
Fossil fuels, and especially natural gas, which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for power generation
in the U.S., are going to be needed for a long, long time. I would add that natural gas is a key in reducing CO2
emissions in America. For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the levels of 1993, the
CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat to those in 1993, largely as a result of the increased use of
natural gas to generate that electricity. So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing emissions.
But there have been recent controversies, as you all know, surrounding new pipeline projects, and I'd like to offer my
perspective. First, to the extent it becomes difficult to build new infrastructure, that tends to make existing pipeline
networks more valuable, and we obviously have a tremendous existing network. Second, while the protesters tend to
get the headlines, it is still possible to build out new infrastructure.
This quarter, for example, we completed an expansion on our Texas gas pipeline network. Third, and maybe most
importantly, I think, is to distinguish the permitting environment, both geographically, and jurisdictionally. There's a
big difference, for example, between state permitted projects where imminent domain is a function of state law, and a
federally certificated natural gas project. Ultimately, we realized that the environment is changing, and we are adapting
by building those changing circumstances into how we budget and plan our projects.
Now to the comment specific to Kinder Morgan. During the third quarter, we substantially reduced our debt, and this
positions us for long-term value creation. We're now ahead of our plan for 2016-year end leverage, and as the
Chairman and largest shareholder of the company, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making toward achieving
our targeted leverage level of around 5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This will put us in a position to deliver
substantial value to our shareholders through dividend increases, share repurchases, attractive growth projects, or
further debt reduction.
Now, because we get so many questions regarding these alternatives, let me expand a bit on this subject. Our current
view leans toward increasing the dividend substantially while maintaining both greater coverage than in the past and a
stronger balance sheet. That said, we'll obviously make the best economic decision at the time we reach that point, and
we can't give you exact timing on when we will reach our target because there are numerous factors involved. But as I
said, the message today is we're pleased with the progress to-date. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
Okay. Thanks, Rich. So I'll update on capital projects and counterparty credit, and then hit on some segment highlights
and trends. On the capital update, two of our larger projects, first on Trans Mountain. On that expansion, I'll start with
the fundamentals. We consistently hear from producers in Canada and some refiners in the Northwest U.S. that they're
counting on this project to get built. Production is expected to continue growing, even though it's at a slower rate out of
the oil sands, and take away capacity projects continue to lag the demand. Oil prices have hurt the oil sands, no
question, but from the perspective of our expansion, the supply and demand fundamentals for new take away capacity
are good.
We're nearing the end of the federal review process right now. We have our NEB recommendation finding the project
to be in the public interest, and the federal government has undertaken its further consultation process with the
objective of a final decision in December of this year.
We've made great progress with communities along the route, and have agreements with a majority of the most directly
affected First Nations band. We are actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their five
conditions.

Finally, I'll note, that we do believe that this project would make a very good candidate for bringing in other investors
through a joint venture, or other structure. It is an attractive project, economically, and there is substantial interest in it.
We believe that the project needs to ripen through the review processes that are nearing a conclusion now, but
following these reviews, assuming the outcomes are favorable, or if the outcomes are favorable, we would look to
syndicate this investment. We've got a lot of options here, including self-funding, so we're not committing to any one
approach, but we do think it's worth exploring the options at the right time.
On Elba, we have our 7(c) certificate from FERC. We got that in June. But the news is that we have received now our
first significant notices to proceed from FERC just this week, and that's the authorization that follows the 7(c) that takes
our implementation plan and gives us permission to go forward with construction. So, we and Shell, our customer, are
prepared for us to begin construction starting November 1.
With respect to the rest of our projects, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog.
That's making sure that we're attending to our balance sheet and also ensuring that we grow value through investments
at attractive returns, that we can fund out of the cash flow that we generate. That is, without needing to access the
capital markets.
This quarter, our backlog stands at $13 billion. That's down from $13.5 billion last quarter. We believe it's an attractive
slate of projects, projected 6.5 times CapEx to EBITDA multiple. 87% of the backlog is for fee-based projects in our
Pipelines and Terminals businesses. The changes from that $13.5 billion to the $13 billion, we put $600 million worth
of projects in to service during the quarter, including bringing on Intrastate Texas Gas Crossover project that's in
support of LNG and Mexico markets, taking delivery of two Jones Act vessels, which are under charter, completing
two smaller liquids terminal expansions and we completed phase 1 of our Tall Cotton enhanced oil recovery project. So
$600 million went into service.
We added a little over $200 million of projects in the quarter. $130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2 where
we continue to see good returns even at current prices. If you look at the year-to-date numbers, we've added a little
under $600 million, about $575 million, in new projects. That's been – the backlog has been coming down, so that's
been more than – those additions have been more than offset by projects going into service and project cancelations
earlier in the year. But overall, I think, what this shows you is we've been successful in doing what we set out to do.
We have high graded the backlog to strengthen our balance sheet, and enable the funding of our growth projects
without needing to access capital markets while continuing to add projects where we find them at attractive returns.
Turning to customer credit, we have a broad diverse customer base, with overall very good credit quality. We continue
our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations, active monitoring, calling for collateral, et
cetera, and we've seen some stabilization in counter party credit as our producer customers have been actively
addressing their issues over the last few quarters. So in the past quarter, we were not impacted by any customer
defaults. We had one customer filed for bankruptcy and the reorganized entity continued to contract with us. So no
impact from customer defaults in the third quarter.
So now turning to the segment for some highlights and trends there, starting with the GAAP measures. GAAP segment
earnings were down $211 million for the quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2015, primarily due to higher
impairments in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Those were primarily comprised of a $350 million
noncash impairment on our MEP investments, driven by the expectation of future lower contract rates, and
approximately $84 million loss associated with a partial sale of SNG.
If you look at segment earnings before DD&A and certain items, which is how we measure our performance, we're
down $33 million or 2% quarter-to-quarter. CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year, due to lower prices, $62 a barrel
realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year, and lower production. Nevertheless, we expect CO2 to make plan
due to some price improvement versus our planned price and good performance on cost savings by that segment.
Compared to the same quarter last year, Gas is down 2%, while Terminals and Products were up 22% and 7%
respectively. Overall, we think, again, that the quarter's performance demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows,
even in difficult commodity price environments.

Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business, first, in natural gas, we're seeing the demand side
developments that we anticipated. On our systems specifically, we're benefiting from increased demand for gas in the
power sector, increased exports to Mexico, and now, for the first time, increases due to LNG exports.
On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q-to-3Q, from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this
quarter. On a macro basis, gas is now overtaking coal, as Rich mentioned, as a fuel source for power generation.
Mexico export demand on our pipelines grew by 6% year-over-year for the quarter, and is up 15% on the comparable
year-to-date number. We reached an average volume of 2.8 Bcf a day for the quarter, about 75% of total exports to
Mexico.
We're in the early days of LNG export-driven demand, but even with this Sabine Pass outage in the last two weeks of
the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems, and much more to come there, we
believe.
Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those three market trends, plus one more, and
that is the reversal projects on our TGP system to move more Marcellus and Utica gas to the South.
Natural Gas, which is by far our largest segment, is kind of an 80/20 story, with approximately 80% of the budget
segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage which benefits from the trends I just
discussed, and the other 20% in gathering and processing. Our gathered volumes are down 17% to 18% year-over-year
as a result of declines in the Eagle Ford, Oklahoma and the Bakken. Our Bakken Midstream financial performance is
up year-over-year and up versus planned, primarily due to contract restructuring earlier in the year. But overall, this
business, outside of the take or pay commitments that we have, is dependent upon the recovery in those basins as gas
demand grows and oil prices, and therefore drilling recovers.
We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation and storage capacity will grow as the demand trends
that I talked about continue. And in the longer term, that gathering volumes flatten and turn up when we ultimately see
recovery in the gas supply basins that we serve.
In Products Pipelines, we're getting the benefit, year-over-year, of higher volumes. Refined products volumes are up
3%, quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, and well above the growth in the EIA national numbers. Our crude and
condensate volumes are up 6% year-over-year. Our NGL volumes are down 1%, primarily due to a petrochemical plant
turnaround by one of our customers.
In Terminals we're seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online, and increased utilization of that expanded
capacity. So more capacity online and higher overall utilization. We also took delivery of two additional Jones Act
vessels, which are under contract.
Overall, the liquids portion of our Terminals business is over 75% of the segment earnings before DD&A, before
certain items, and the increased utilization we're seeing and the expansions we're bringing on are positives for that
long-term outlook.
With respect to the Jones Act vessels, we see medium term market weakness there. We benefit from having charters in
place for the vast majority of our vessels, and we have a modern fuel efficient fleet that should be very competitive, but
we expect some overcapacity in the market for the medium term which will affect new charter rates and renewal rates
until the overall U.S. fleet is right sized from a capacity standpoint. On the bulk side, we're down slightly
year-over-year primarily, again, attributable to the coal business.
In CO2, we had lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter down 5%, with SACROC and Yates down
year-over-year, Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan. We also had strong NGL
production in the segment, a record quarter, in fact, which is slightly higher than last year. And we also approved some
new EOR development projects during the quarter, and continue to find attractive return projects in the segment.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the financials.

Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve. Today we're declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget and the
guidance we gave you in December of last year. First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement, you will see
that similar to the first two quarters of this year, revenues in the quarter are down significantly. As I say, many quarters,
we believe that revenue – or the changes in revenue are not necessarily a good indicator of our performance. We have
some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not, which
is why you also see a partially offsetting variance in cost of sales.
In addition, both revenues and cost of sales can be impacted by non-cash sporadic accounting entries or certain items.
The largest impact of the certain items on changes in revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized CO2
mark-to-market and hedge and effectiveness impact on our change in revenues which accounts for almost 40% of the
$377 million change in revenues in the quarter.
We had a net loss in the quarter of $227 million, and a loss per share of $0.10 versus income of $186 million, and
earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of last year, a reduction of $413 million and $0.18 a share.
Now, let me talk about what's driving that loss. We recorded a $230 million non-cash after tax, and that's why that
number is a little different from what Steve said, because this is after tax impairment on our MEP investment driven by
our expectations of lower future transportation contract rates, and approximately $350 million after tax loss associated
with the SNG transaction, most of which is non-cash book tax expense.
For those of you who are interested in how we could have such a large book tax expense on a relatively modest book
loss, when you would ordinarily expect a book tax benefit, I would be happy to explain later, but I'm not going to bore
everybody with all the details at this point.
Together, these two charges result in a net expense of $580 million, and are the primary drivers of our $570 million in
certain items for the quarter. So net income before certain items was a positive $343 million. The adjusted number in
2015 was $345 million or down $2 million, essentially flat. EPS, excluding certain items, was $0.15, or down $0.01
versus the third quarter of 2015, so essentially flat when excluding certain items.
Now let's turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, and is
reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management
judges its performance.
We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.081 billion versus $1.129 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down
$48 million or 4%. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, it boils down to CO2
being down $53 million primarily on lower commodity prices.
But to take you through a more granular analysis, the segments were down by $33 million or 2%. As I previously
mentioned, CO2 decreased $53 million, and Natural Gas decreased about $18 million with offsets – those two
segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other segments
coming from our Terminals segment.
The Natural Gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale, which we sold a
50% interest in, on September 1 of this year.
Adding back an $11 million change in JV DD&A, which primarily reflects our increased interest in NGPL that we
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and you add that back to the segment, the segment is down $33 million, the
assets are really down about $22 million. This $22 million decrease was partially offset by a $12 million benefit, i.e.,
lower expense when you combine G&A and interest expense. The $19 million in increased cash taxes, which is
primarily driven by the fact that Citrus fully utilized its NOLs in 2015 is largely offset by an $18 million decrease in
sustaining CapEx, a lot of which is cost savings.
Netting out the $39 million increase in preferred stock dividends, you get to a DCF variance of $50 million versus the
$48 million shown on the page.

DCF per share was $0.48 in the quarter versus $0.51 for the third quarter of last year, or down $0.03 per share, with
about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares
that were issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet.
$0.48 in DCF per share results in $801 million in excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the
quarter. And year-to-date, we've generated approximately $2.5 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our
dividend.
Now, let me give you some details on our expected performance for the full year versus budget. Natural Gas Pipelines
is expected to be approximately 5% below its budget due to the SNG transaction, lower volumes in our midstream
group, and a delay on our EEC, SNG pipeline expansion and service as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC
certificate.
If you exclude the impact of the sale of the 50% interest in SNG, we would have expected Natural Gas to be about 2%
below its budget. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the 2% is consistent with what we told you last quarter for the
Natural Gas Pipelines segment.
CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Some price help
and cost savings are offsetting the lower-than-expected oil and CO2 volumes.
We currently expect Terminals to end the year about 5% below its budget. That's slightly more than the 4% we
discussed last quarter. The overall variance is due to the impact of the coal bankruptcies and lower throughput and
ancillaries on some of our liquids terminals versus what we budgeted. Actually, throughput on our liquids terminals
year-to-year, when you compare it to 2015, is actually up. It's just slightly lower than what we expected in our budget.
We currently expect Products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget, consistent with the guidance we gave
you last quarter, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower
throughput on KMST and lower rates on our SFPP pipeline and as a result of the lost income due to the sale of
Parkway.
Consistent with last quarter, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on its budget. With respect to other items,
interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining on a combined basis for those items, we're expecting to come in lower than
budget or said another way, they're expected to be a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest and
sustaining CapEx.
Interest is expected to be approximately 4% below its budget. About half of this variance or over half of this variance is
associated with the lower balance as a result of the SNG transaction with the remaining variance driven primarily by
lower rates. Sustaining CapEx is also expected to be approximately 4% lower than budget.
Let me conclude with two overall financial points. On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance has not changed
from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter, when you excluded the impact from the 50% sale of SNG. We
continue to expect that adjusted EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below
budget.
When you adjust for the four-month impact of the 50% SNG sale, so not on an apples-to-apples basis with what we
gave you last quarter, we expect EBITDA to be approximately 4% below budget, the DCF will also be approximately
4% below budget. DCF doesn't change versus SNG transaction versus no SNG transaction, given the interest rate
savings – 4% doesn't change given the interest rate savings offset some of the impact of the lost SNG EBITDA as we
used all the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt.
And the second point is that we expect to end the year at 5.3 times debt to EBITDA, which is also consistent with what
we told you in the second quarter call. The 5.3 times is down from our budget guidance of 5.5 times, largely as a result
of the SNG transaction.

Page 7 of 24
With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. When you look at total assets on the balance sheet, total assets are down $2.5
billion and that's largely driven by the sale of the 50% interest in SNG. We ended the quarter with net debt of $39.25
billion, which is down $1.976 billion from the end of last year, and down $2.073 billion from the second quarter. As I
said, we ended the quarter at 5.3 times debt to EBITDA and as I said, that's where we would expect to end the year.
The 5.3 times is down from the 5.6 times where we ended last year.
Now, to reconcile the change in debt for you, for the quarter, as I said, debt is down $2.073 billion. We generated DCF
of $1.08 billion. We spent about $550 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity
investments. We paid $280 million in dividends. We had proceeds from divestitures of about $1.43 billion, with the
biggest being the SNG transaction. We also deconsolidated about $1.2 billion in debt as a result of the SNG transaction.
And we also took $803 million of the cash that we received from that transaction and it is sitting in restricted cash, so in
other current assets on our balance sheet, and we used that to pay debt on October 1. So that debt was not paid down as
of 9/30 but has subsequently been paid down. And then, we had $9 million of working capital and other items that was
a use of cash.
Year-to-date, the change in debt, $1.976 billion, so we've reduced debt by just under $2 billion. We generated DCF of
$3.36 billion. We had expansions, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments of $2.43 billion. We paid
dividends of $839 million. We had proceeds from divestitures of $1.65 billion. We deconsolidated $1.2 billion of SNG
debt. We placed $800 million again into escrow, which is shown in restricted cash or other current assets on our
balance sheet, again, we used to pay down debt on October 1. And then, we had working capital and other items that
was a use of cash of about $168 million, and that gets you to the $1.976 billion reduction in debt.
So with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Kim, and with that, Mae, we will open the lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin a question-and-answer portion. [Operation Instructions] Our first question is from
Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Afternoon, guys. Steve, appreciated the project updates. A couple quick clarifications. On
Utopia, any color on the judge's denial of your use of eminent domain and maybe could you talk about what this means
for that project? And then on Elba, appreciate the November 1 date, but can you just remind me, am I still going
through the rehearing process? And what does that mean for that project to go forward?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. All right. I start with Utopia. Yeah, we had a Wood County judge who, in interpreting
the eminent domain statute, interpreted that our pipeline didn't qualify for eminent domain. We're appealing that. In
fact, we filed the appeal last week. It's inconsistent with other decisions, including appellate decisions that have been
made in the state. So we think we're ultimately going to prevail on appeal there.
Now, there may be some other decisions that come out of Wood County that'll be consistent with that, but we expect
ultimately to prevail on appeal. Now, we are in the process of evaluating what that means. We're two-thirds of the way
through acquiring right-of-way already [ph] separate and apart (30:23) from what happened with that decision. So this
is fairly recent news, and so, we're sitting down and strategizing about how to go forward with the acquisition of the
remaining right-of-way, what our legal strategy is going to be, et cetera.

But that's what that decision was about. That's where we are in the project in terms of acquiring right-of-way and what
we plan to do in terms of – what we've already done in terms of appeal.
On the Elba project, yeah, we've reached agreement with Shell to proceed without the rehearing having been finalized,
so we're ready to go. Our customers are ready to go. We're ready to go. We have our 7C already, as I mentioned. We
have the notice to proceed which gives us the authority to go forward with construction even without a final order on
the hearing. So we are proceeding and starting up November 1.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Perfect. Thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up for me too. Rich mentioned the change in
regulatory headwinds. Do you think there's a possibility for a change in tides to the positive here? What could be a
driver for that? And if we don't see a change, what could be some of the ways you adjust when thinking about new
projects going forward?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, I'll start with the latter part first, I mean I think and Rich mentioned this on the
adjustments, we what we need to do is and we've been doing for months now is evaluating our project opportunities
and having discussions with our customers that attempt to price and schedule in to our projects what is no doubt an
enhanced regulatory burden for getting those projects through the permitting and approval process. So we have to make
the appropriate adjustments.
In terms of what can turn that around, again, this varies from place to place. I mean we built our Texas pipeline over the
summer effectively, and you have to go kind of place by place and kind of commodity by commodity to sort this out.
But the bottom line is you need to fully take into account, we need to fully take into account the additional lengths and
requirements that'll be placed on the permitting process. So it's not that the whole world needs to change. This is a kind
of a case by case consideration that you need to make.
The other thing that can change the whole dynamic is I think increasingly people will realize, those who don't already,
that a big part of the answer to reduced CO2 emissions and cleaner power generation and compliance with the Clean
Power Plan and things like that is enhanced is additional natural gas. And you don't get the additional natural gas
without the additional gas infrastructure. So I think that's a driver that could potentially change some of that dynamic.
<Q - Kristina Kazarian>: Sounds great. And, Kim, thanks for the walk as well.

<Q - Christine Cho>: Hi, everyone. I wanted to touch upon Elba. Regarding the rehearing, how should we think about
expectations for this asset to be put into a JV? Do you want the final FERC order? Are you in talks with parties and just
waiting for that? Or have talks sort of cooled now just because it's not as urgent with leverage coming in better than
your target for year-end?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, Christine, we've talked – we put Utopia – I'm sorry, we put Elba in as a placeholder kind
of when we showed everyone our capital expenditure plans and everything at the beginning of the year, placeholder as

JV. We don't have to JV Elba. I think it is very amenable to a joint venture. It is a standalone asset investment, at least
when it comes to the liquefaction facilities and it's attractive. It's under a 20-year contract with Shell. We've got the
ability to self-fund that or to JV it, but it is an attractive JV candidate, but again, we're not in a position where we have
to do anything in particular with it.
But we continue to explore options to JV assets and that's one of the big variables in sort of what our plans are and how
quickly we get to where we want to go, and Elba is certainly on the list of things that we can consider.
I don't think the rehearing really bears on it that much one way or the other. I mean I think in the context of FERC 7Cs,
it is often it's traditional for you get the 7C and you start construction when you get the notice to proceed without
waiting for the rehearing. In this case, I would say we've got an extremely tight, extremely well-reasoned, extremely
thorough 7C. They took extra time to get it out. And so, we think it's going to withstand any rehearing or appeal, and
so, we're going to go ahead and get started.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay, great. That was helpful. And then moving over to Trans Mountain, I know we've got a
couple of months before we hear from the Canadian government on this project, and I know earlier in the remarks you
said you are open to JVs, but how do you guys think about project financing in this project, or would terms that usually
come with project financing immediately rule that out and by terms, I mean anything that would restrict how much cash
you could pay out from the asset? Just curious as to how you think about that option.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, I think we'll figure out what the structure is going to be first, in terms of is it going
to be a JV candidate? Is it not going to be a JV candidate? And what's the timing of it going forward and then we'll
figure out what the exact financing plan would be. But I wouldn't anticipate that we would put in structures that would
make it difficult for us to get the cash out of the assets.
<Q - Christine Cho>: And would you say you would lean towards having the asset kind of be off balance sheet or
that's kind of an afterthought?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: If you're asking – I think that the way – we would look at it both ways, both having the
leverage on our balance sheet and not having it on our balance sheet, just to make sure that that we are in a okay place,
even if the leverage was on our balance sheet.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. And then, last one for me, over the third quarter, we saw a big M&A
announcement between two of your peers and then talks of another buyer trying to pick the interests of another
company. Just curious as to what your view on the landscape is for M&A in the U.S. and in Canada, and do you think
we're finally going to see corporate M&A deals get done with everyone trying to fill in the holes of their portfolio and
it also being increasingly more difficult to build new infrastructure, like you said earlier, Rich, or do you think it's just
more fact specific?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think it's always pretty fact specific or situation specific. We continue to look for the
opportunities, but in addition to being accretive to DCF, they kind of need to be accretive to leverage metrics. They still
have to work from that standpoint, so it's a little bit more difficult to get through the screens, but I think ultimately
there's going to be consolidation in this sector. You look at the numbers and you look at how many players are out
there, and we would expect ultimately to be a participant in that.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Great. Thank you.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: Kind of maybe just follow-up on the M&A discussion while we've got it. I think the C corp, C
corp is a tough one to get through, lots of moving pieces with any combination that you may try to put together. But
when you think about individual assets and, Steve, you mentioned essentially the deleveraging event. Given the assets
that you guys have in place today, are there assets that if they were a deleveraging event in totality you would consider
divesting them and, of course, I'm speaking specifically about CO2. But is getting something north of deleverage
multiple enough to make an asset that isn't quite as core to your competencies as sellable item?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: There are unique considerations that surround everyone. As we've shown through making
progress this year on our leverage metrics, we've considered non-core asset sales. We had a few of those. And the big
transaction, of course, was SNG, and that was a bit unique, unique circumstances. We're not generally in the business
of selling cash flowing pipeline assets, but in that particular case, we had a partner who was bringing value, securing
the asset, but also bringing incremental investment opportunities to the project, so it made a lot of sense for us to go
ahead and do that.
With respect to CO2 specifically, we like that business. It's a good business. We invest and get good returns on that
business. It's a niche for us. We're not out chasing E&P and Shale and offshore and things like that. We have CO2,
which is a scarce commodity, and we have the infrastructure to get it delivered to EOR fields, where it's the only thing
that can free up oil, and we've integrated forward into enhanced oil recovery, and we've got expertise there, and we
think we're good at it.
So we like that business, and we're happy to keep running it.
If you think about your question in terms of a transaction, or a potential transaction, we are shareholder-directed
company, and if there is a transaction to be done that will improve overall value for our shareholders, we are absolutely
going to consider it, and do it if it makes sense. The considerations around CO2, specifically, is that it would probably
be slightly dilutive or somewhat dilutive, and then the question would have to be, is the multiple expansion that you get
on the remaining EBITDA of the remaining business and the yield contraction on DCF that you get by having a better
portfolio of, or a more stable portfolio of remaining businesses enough to offset that and produce real shareholder
value. And certainly there are theoretical numbers at which that would work.
And so, again, we're a shareholder-directed company. We're going to do the things that are going to make sense and
create value for our shareholders.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: On the shareholder comment, do you think there's enough shareholder support of the sale of that
asset that make it a more, I guess, make the hurdle easier to jump over knowing that shareholders support that type of
decision?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think it's about the numbers for us. And it's about what's going to make economic sense. As I
said, what will the dilution be, and what would a multiple increase need to be to more than offset – more than offset
that. So at the other side of it, a shareholder is better off. That's the calculation we make.
<Q - Brian Gamble>: Great. And then last question for me. Rich, you mentioned, as part of the opening remarks,
essentially first priority for increased cash flow would be after, of course, you get to your debt metrics is – I think you
put a significant increase in the dividend over time. Clarify one thing for me. Are we getting to 5 times before
contemplating that? Or are we having visibility to get to 5 times before that is a contemplation?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think we've always said we wanted to get to around 5 times before we increase the
dividend, and that's still our target. But, again, I think it's important that we've gotten so many questions about this, we
elected to lay out a little more detail on it. And our game plan, again, we would reserve the right to see what the facts
on the ground are when we get to that point. But our game plan would be we obviously have a lot of firepower, a lot of
free cash flow, and to the extent we can substantially increase the dividend while still maintaining an adequate
coverage ratio. And by that, I would mean that we would be able to fund the equity portion of our going rate of capital
expenditures.

We don't know exactly what that is, but we look back, and you take out the pigs going through the boa constrictor like
Trans Mountain, for example. You're kind of in that, I don't know, $2 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion, in that range, and
if you say once our balance sheet is where we want it, we're going to finance half of that out of retained cash and half
of that back in the debt markets at that point in time, then you can get – you can see your way clearer to having a very
nice dividend but with very nice coverage and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
And that's really the trifecta that we're looking for, and I think, I mean, just look at this year, and I think Kim
emphasized this, we're right consistent, absent the SNG transaction, with where we told you in April and where we told
you in July we were going to be, and that leads to DCF of about $2 per share for this year, and we're paying out a $0.50
dividend, and that's a whale of a spread between the two.
But at some point when we get this balance sheet the way we want it, we're going to be able to take that dividend up
substantially and still have adequate coverage. We're not going back to having $0.05 of coverage or something like that
because we like to cover our portion, the equity portion of a normalized CapEx program.

Our next question is from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hello, Brandon.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Good afternoon, everyone. I guess let's start with Trans Mountain again. Steve, you were
pretty clear – or I would say very clear in your messaging around JV potential for Trans Mountain. I guess one question
is has anything changed quarter-over-quarter that caused you to be more clear about that messaging? Was it
counter-party interest, or has this been kind of the plan all along?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, I think it's – we talked about it in an answer to a question, I think, on the last call, so it's
consistent with it to that point. But we're getting closer now to some – to a decision point and resolution, and yes,
there's been interest in the project, as you'd expect. And so it's just kind of a, as I said, a little bit of ripening here from –
ripening in the process in our thinking. There's a little ripening left to go in terms of getting some of these – getting the
clarity on the regulatory front, which again, appears to be getting closer.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. And probably as expected, the project screams – or almost screams for a JV partner
here. As you think about and kind of prioritize or rank potential partners and project promotes that accrue back to your
part of the development – and this is a big open question, but how do you think through that process in terms of what
you'd like to see in terms of getting paid for your development work here, in terms of reducing your capital
requirements in 2017, 2018 and early 2019, and being able to return to getting cash back to shareholders? How do you
balance all those pieces of that equation just conceptually?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, those are all three benefits, right, and agree with those. But we're really not foreclosing –
we've got a lot of options in addition to having a good interest in it. We've got a lot of options on how to proceed and a
fair amount of work to do to figure out what the best option is. So we're keeping those options open, and not really
ready to refine that any further for you right now.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. Fair enough. But probably just noting the potential there and the opportunity to
create some real value near-term rather than longer-term. Okay. I'll leave that one to rest. Another broad question, so
surprises about 12 months ago from the rating agencies. How have those conversations kind of evolved over the last 12
months in terms of just level of comfort on the other side of the table as you continue to have those conversations with
the rating agencies?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. I mean, if you think about where we were 12 months ago and where we are today,
12 months ago, we were at 5.6 times debt-to-EBITDA and we had, we were paying out substantially all of our cash
flow in the form of dividends. Today, we're at 5.3 times and we are paying out a very small portion of our cash flow in

terms of dividends. And so I think we are in a very good shape in our current rating.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: Okay. Understood. Thank you, Kim. And then last question for me, the MEP write-down,
what triggered that process or that consideration?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah, we've just had some interest from various shippers and potentially looking at
contracts when the contracts on MEP have expired or will expire and based on those conversations, we felt like that the
rates that we might get when the contracts expire don't support the carrying value that we have, where we have that
asset.
<Q - Brandon Blossman>: All right. Great. Understood. Thank you very much.

Next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Good evening. Just a couple of quick ones for me. So we've had a nice run in crude price
recently and services costs have come down a lot this year. At these new lower services costs, can you give a range of
oil price at which you would be able to book new crude reserves at a level that approximates replacing production? I
assume that that number has actually gotten much better than last year.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Jesse do you want to...?
<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, I think we've added projects throughout the year, so as prices improve, I'd say, we're
adding reserves today.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. Do you have a sense of if you wanted to actually replace 100% of your production
this year, what prices would have to be? Or even a range?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah, I mean, we don't look at it that way. The way we look at it is we look at a discrete
project-by-project, and we look at the returns on the project that the CO2 group brings forward, and if those returns
clear our hurdle and, the minimum amount of that hurdle is 15% unlevered after-tax right now, and if they clear that
hurdle, then we generally proceed with it, and if they don't clear that hurdle, at a minimum, then generally we aren't
pursuing those projects.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. Understand. Thank you. And then my second question, exports to Mexico, as you
guys have noted, have grown massively 3.3 Bcfd, and I believe that you mentioned that the majority of that moved on
Kinder Morgan pipelines. There are a bunch of new Mexico export pipes, I think 3 Bcfd coming on in the first half of
next year. Will that have a material impact on your physical flows or segment EBITDA?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think that given where our assets are positioned overall, growth in Mexico export volumes are
going to benefit us, even if other people are building pipelines, and I'd tell you an example of that would be the NET
pipeline that went into service, what Tom? Two years or so? And we deliver a substantial amount of gas into that
pipeline. And the reason for that is we have the infrastructure in Texas. We have the infrastructure on EPNG from West
Texas to – through Arizona, and so it's part of a larger grid and our piece of that grid is well-positioned to benefit from
the pulling into Mexico that's happening in increasing volumes over the years.
So even if it's not us constructing in-country pipe, which we haven't gotten comfortable with from a risk reward
standpoint, the increase in demand and the hooking it up increasingly to U.S. supply sources is going to benefit our
system overall. Transport as well as storage and on the intrastate side sales.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And I think this sounds like a broken record but we've said it time and time again, this is
one more demonstration of the strength that is inherent in having the kind of pipeline network on the natural gas side
that we have, which spans all the producing horizons and interconnects with virtually every other pipeline system in
America, and that's going to pay dividends for many years to come.

<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Thanks. That's really helpful. And then lastly, are we close to contract minimums on gas
gathering, so another way of saying is, as Eagle Ford production continues to decline, there actually won't be much
impact on Kinder Morgan?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we've got roughly, I don't think I can answer that question exactly. We've got 30% of
what we call our gathering or processing that's under take or pay contracts. But without looking at it kind of
contract-by-contract, I couldn't tell you whether – well, wait, short answer is, we're not – if there's continued decline,
then we're not at the bottom. There would be a continued decline in our revenues. But we do have some floor in our
revenue because we've got this 30% of the contracts are take or pay.
<Q - Jean Ann Salisbury>: Okay. Great. Thanks. That's all for me.

Next question is from Danilo Juvane, from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Thank you. Most of my questions have been hit. I did have one very quick follow-up on the
Eagle Ford volumes, gathering volumes, in general. You mentioned last quarter that you signed some incentive
agreements that hopefully would have gotten some volumes in your system. Was that supposed to be imminent here or
is that something that you expect to sort of be reflected in your volumes over time?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we have successfully increased our market share from where we were sitting in the first
and second quarters, and those incentive contracts were a big part of that. And so we have, if you will, restored the
market share that we had at the end of 2015 back to where we were, but we're still – in the Eagle Ford, it's a market
share of a declining overall base. So the declines still come, but I think the program that Tom and his team initiated was
successful in taking our market share back up.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Got you. And with respect to the issues that you had with MEP, are you seeing anything similar
for other pipelines within your system?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we have other pipes that are kind of what you would call basis pipes. FEP is another
example. And so pipes that are kind of point to point that had long term contracts that underwrote them when they were
expanded as those contracts roll off and basis has come in, that would present the same kind of phenomenon.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Do you guys have a sort of magnitude of what revenue impact or EBITDA impact would be
going forward here?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, the FEP – it's not a revenue issue in terms of what the shippers are paying us
because those are take or pay contracts, and I think the contracts go through 2019 or 2020 on FEP. I think it would just
be, as we figure out where we think exactly the market is, whether you had a non-cash impairment on those assets. So
the customers are still paying. In fact, the largest customer on FEP is Southwestern. I think they've actually put a rig or
two back into the Fayetteville, and their credit situation, I think, has improved dramatically over the last few months.
<Q - Danilo Juvane>: Thanks. Thanks for the color. Last question for me. Is the CO2 CapEx still trending at about
$50 million or so quarterly?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, it's up a little bit from where we were. I think we were at about $210 million for the year.
We're now about $249 million, $250 million. Yeah, $250 million.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ted. How are you doing?
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Doing well. Thanks, Rich. Coming back to Trans Mountain here, so maybe you can give us
a little bit of a preview on this ministerial panel's report – I think it's due November 1 – and kind of how that will
impact the December decision? And then also an update on the BC process, meeting the five conditions? In particular, I
think revenue sharing is one of the big ones there.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, so there were a couple of, if you will, additional federal processes. One was a federal
consultation process where the federal government was directly out consulting with First Nations and communities.
The one that you're specifically referring to was there was a panel of three people appointed to go out and hear from the
community up and down the right-of-way and gather data or gather perspectives that hadn't been picked up in the NEB
proceeding.
That process is wrapped up in terms of the hearing, and as you pointed out, there's a report that's due. It's a report that is
cataloging, at least as I understand it, everything that the group of three heard while they were talking to people in the
communities along the rights-of-way.
So these things feed into the federal decision, the Order in Council that comes out of the federal government, which is
still scheduled for December 20. So I don't know of anything, Ted, that's inconsistent with the December 20 date –
certainly nothing that's associated with those two processes. We still expect to see on or before December 20 a final
Order in Council.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: And then the other part of my question – it was a long one – on the British Columbia process
meeting the five conditions and the revenue sharing.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we have been engaged with British Columbia on the five conditions. I think it's been
constructive and productive engagement. We don't have anything final there.
The other process that's going on in British Columbia is the EA order that they are going to issue around the same time
as the federal decision, and at least in our thinking, we're assuming that's in January – that, that's not going to be in
December. That's going to be in January. And so I think what we're aiming for is to have the British Columbia

<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. Great. And then I know you've been back and forth with the contractors. Just any
updates on the cost side, and overall sort of project returns still in line with what you had originally budgeted.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Project returns are still in line. We're still working on the costs with the contractors. We've
made very good progress, I would say. But we're not final yet and we're still, it's, as you know, a complicated project.
There's still work to be done there, but I think we've made good progress.
<Q - Theodore Durbin>: Okay. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.

Next question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to confirm your response to one of the earlier
questions, I think it was Brian's question about retained distributable cash flow. I just want to make sure I understood it
correctly. Let's say you're at a run rate of, and just using round numbers here, about $4.5 billion in distributable cash
flow. And I think if I heard you correctly, you had talked about potentially holding back about $2 billion of that
retained DCF to fund the equity portion of kind of a normalized growth CapEx budget.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: No, you didn't hear me correctly. Let me [indiscernible] (59:59) again.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Yeah.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: What I said was we would hold back, and certainly we would expect that $4.5 million run
rate today to increase as new projects come on line. But what I said was we would hold back the amount necessary to
fund the equity portion of a normalized CapEx expenditure for the year. So, for example, we would think, and that will
depend on what kind of projects you have. But we would think historically that's been between $2 billion and $3 billion
a year. So if you pick the midpoint of that, it's $2.5 billion, you would be withholding $1.25 billion out of that $4.5
billion or $5 billion of distributable cash flow.
So it's not the whole thing because once we get to the level of the appropriate level of debt, we would intend to go back
to financing half equity, half debt. But the difference is we would not put – we would not contemplate putting out new
equity, we would be using retained cash flow from operations to fund the quote-unquote equity portion of that. Does
that – does that answer your question now?
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Yeah, I think we were actually on the same page. So if I do my math correctly, that means
that's a very significant increase in the dividend from where you are today which I think is running at about $1.1 billion
or $1.2 billion. Am I thinking about that correctly, and it corresponds with your whale of a difference comment earlier?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes, that would be, of course, a significant difference, right.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Cool. Second question, and I know that you've been asked this many different
ways, but I realize the company has made considerable progress of getting down to your stated goal of 5 times net debt
to EBITDA. I guess kind of two questions in one here. But has that leverage goal impacted your ability to consider
some growth projects? And then secondly, given all the questions about returning to a higher level of dividends, is the
Board considering any options to accelerate the pace to this 5 times leverage goal either through equity or preferred
issuances? Or even asset sales? Or is the Board comfortable with the pace where you're at, and you'll get there when
you expect to get there?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Okay. So let me answer, and I think my answer to the first will address the answer to the
second question which is that the reason that we decreased the dividend primarily a year ago had to do with inefficient
capital markets, and not wanting to fund expansion CapEx in a market that wasn't rationally pricing debt and equity
securities. And so I think that the debt market has changed. The equity market is still significantly different from where
we were 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And so we are funding our CapEx program. So we – in my mind, what we are
constrained by, we do want to improve the balance sheet, and that is a goal that we have, but what we are doing is we
are living within our cash flow. Meaning that we want to be able to fund our equity – our CapEx and our dividend from
our cash flow.
And so that is the constraint and because we have limited amount of capital, that is why we have the hurdle rate set at
15% unlevered after-tax IRR for projects. I fully anticipate that over time as the CapEx comes down and also as the
balance sheet improves, that we would relax that standard. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be today
but it would be something less than the 15%. It probably won't be back at the 8% unlevered after-tax that we previously
used for hurdle rate, but we will have to make the assessment when that time comes.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: And so you're comfortable with the pace that you're at or would you consider options to
accelerate getting there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, if you mean...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It's...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Issuing equity, we're not an equity issuer at these prices.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: And that was why that we're living within cash flow given where the current equity
prices are.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: But look, we are going as fast as we can. If we can find ways to go faster, we will. And we're
working on this all the time as you might imagine. This is, but it's just a question. The particular method that you
identified as distinguished from attractive joint ventures, for example, and other ways of accelerating us getting there,

that approach that is issuing equity is not attractive at today's prices.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. Fair enough. And one final question. We've seen a spike in global coal prices
recently, and I know you've had some challenges at your terminals over the last two years. Has there been any inquiries
or increased inquiries in terms of folks wanting to ship out coal in bulk out of the U.S.? Or is it still too early to see the
benefit from the recent increases that we've seen in coal price globally?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: We saw actually a 13% uptick last quarter in our coal volume, mostly on the export side now.
On a U.S. basis, exports were down 11.8%. That's just a drop in the bucket. We're still down 30% on a year-over-year
basis. Prices, we've seen some price compression, volumes did spike up, but we don't anticipate that going significantly
higher. The forecast for this year is still tracking at about 59 million tons of export, and that's comparable to 74 million
tons last year. It's not projected a lot higher than that. So we've got some ground to make up.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: All right. Thank you very much, guys.

Next question is from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Darren. How are you?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: I'm fine. Thank you, Rich. I hope you and the team are doing well. I'll be quick. Rich, you
and Steve mentioned the permitting challenges and obviously the Connecticut expansion of TGP comes to mind. I'm
just thinking systemically, what impact do you think these permitting challenges are going to have specifically on the
Northeast gas market when you reconcile the amount of marketed pipe capacity versus what you've said you expect
Marcellus and Utica production growth expectations to be. Do you think it's a rescaling of marketed pipe or a
combination of pipes? And I'm most interested to know your thoughts on maybe some basis differential expectations
more pressure at [indiscernible] (1:06:49) hub, but most importantly, how you capitalize on it through scaling up TGP.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. A lot loaded in there but basically I think our view is it's very hard to get big new builds
done into New England or into the Northeast and we've seen that not only with NED which we talked about in the first
quarter and discontinued but also with, recent rulings that I think verified that decision. It's making it harder to get
things done on kind of a mega scale, call it. Now we have continued to engage with our customers on smaller scale
projects and will continue to pursue those. But I think from the perspective of right now today, it is hard to get new
significant gas infrastructure built into New England, and that would tend to increase the basis differentials between
what's already the lowest price gas at Dominion South, call it, and the New England market which is just a few – the
highest priced in North America and just a few hundred miles away.
So barring some improvement in that overall permitting environment, I think it's difficult to do those but we'll keep
looking for the smaller projects to do. The other thing, I think New England is a perfect example of what Rich said at
the very beginning which is that it does tend to make the existing network more valuable. The other thing I'd add, and
let Tom throw in whatever he wants, but the TGP system is a system that is continuing to produce project opportunities
for us. A lot of our backlog on TGP, a lot of our backlog in gas is on TGP. I mean, it's the biggest home for it outside of
the Elba project right now.
And what a lot of that project capital is directed at now is getting the gas, as you know, Darren South from the
Marcellus and Utica to the new market, the new market area which is now the Gulf Coast of the United States, and we
are proceeding along very well with those. We're building on our existing footprint. That, again, goes to the need to
make distinctions between projects out there in infrastructure projects, building off of your existing footprint, adding
compression, maybe laying some parallel pipe, things like that that create a different – that's a different, in a federally
certificated process, that's a different context in which to be doing your project expansions.

So I think you will see basis widen to New England or to the Northeast, and I think we'll find plenty of things to invest
in and are finding plenty of things to invest in on TGP to get that gas someplace else.

Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMC [JPMorgan]. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay, you're back on.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Sorry about that. Thanks for taking me. Going back to TMX here, I was just wondering if you
could help me think through some things here as far as if there's any target as far as what the right ownership would be
for this? And when you're talking about the JV here, is this just the expansion or the expansion in the existing pipe? I
guess what it comes back to is when I'm thinking – trying to model 5 times debt-to-EBITDA, the spend on TMX and
the drag associated with when the cash flows materialize, there's a pretty big variable in that equation, so I'm just
wondering if you could help me think through that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Okay. A number of things in there, but I think, yeah, the project is hard to separate from the
underlying asset, to answer the simplest one of your questions there. On the approach on what the ownership
percentage would be and more of the details, I'll go back to the earlier answer, which is we have a lot of options and
we're going to pursue the most valuable one. That's the easiest way I can characterize it. And we don't have to do
anything, which is a great position to be in. But we are going to evaluate it.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. That's helpful. And then if I heard you correctly – let me know if I'm wrong – as far
as when in the regulatory process it might make sense to proceed with the JV if the terms make sense, it's kind of
earlier next year when you see if things progress to schedule, that could kind of come to fruition at that point?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, that's a good point to be looking at it; when we see the regulatory clarity. Because I think
investors would like to see that too, and so I think that's a reasonable point for us to be examining it.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Got you. Thanks for that. That's it for me.

Next question is from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the extended call here. So a couple of questions here. One,
Rich, you commented about the historical annual run rate, call it about $2.5 billion a year. I know we have some [ph]
thick in the python (1:11:54) issues with Trans Mountain and other such items that may be JV'd, but I guess my
question is as we think about lowering the hurdle rate for new projects from 15% perhaps to the very low double-digits,
do you see the capacity in this current market to really fill in for that kind of ongoing investment opportunity when
year-to-date, you've only filled in $575 million?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well. I think, again, we would just have to look at what the environment is at that particular
point in time, and these things do vary from year-to-year. But we look back over several years, and it's our thought at
this time, and again, it's a preliminary outlook, as I stressed, but that that annual burn rate, if you will, of expansion
CapEx is something in the range we talked about.
And that's what – what we would want to use as providing enough coverage to pay for the quote-unquote equity portion
of that burn rate. And I think under almost any scenario, that leaves a lot of money to pay dividends, but we'll just look
at the exact circumstances when we reach that point.

<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. Is there any color about how much you've left on the table because it didn't meet
your hurdle rate because of the significant balance sheet management that's really helped a lot in the last two, three,
four quarters? Any kind of color on what you've already left on the table because of that discipline that maybe when in
a better market might be there in the future?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't know that we left anything on the table, Craig. We did elevate our return hurdle criteria,
but we have continued to say, look, if there's something that our business units think makes sense, we've got a good
customer, good counter party credit, long-term contracts, confidence around execution, et cetera, we want to bring it in
and talk about it. And we continue to see those come forward.
I think the one place that we took a close look at was CO2, and we – and certainly in the oil price environment we saw
earlier in the year, we took projects off the table, and now we're adding those back as we see oil prices recover. So
look, is there some – is there – are there some things that we might have been able to do if we were in an 8% world that
we're not doing when we're in a 15% world, then, yeah, maybe so. But I think what we're talking about in the longer
term is return hurdles that we will relax off of the 15%, as Kim said. And I think given the network that we have, we'll
still find those opportunities off our network, and we're finding some of them still today.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. And on MEP was there some specific kind of ongoing revenue or EBITDA drag
reduction expected apart from the one-time non-cash write down?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: If you're asking if we've had any changes on the underlying contracts at MEP. No, there
have been no underlying changes. This is based on, the impairment is largely based on informed by discussions with
customers of rates that we can get when contracts expire.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. And on the Jones Act tankers, Steven, any more color you can provide there on
your comments about the size or duration of the move? I think you still have American Liberty and American Pride yet
to contract, is that correct? And any update about charters rolling over the next couple of years?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we have two ships that are not yet constructed and those are the only two of the 14 ships
that are currently not chartered, the only two of the 16 ships that are not currently chartered. Everything else is, there's
one that's under a shorter term charter that's rolling into a long-term charter. Everything is chartered. We do have some
coming off in one or two in 2017, three? – three in 2017.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: We're at a real strong year there. We're up $12 million on the base, mostly due to less [ph]
op hire (1:16:30) and higher rates, and then the expansions are another $25.7 million If you look going forward, the risk
really is we've got 11 ships that are under long-term agreement, and then 5 ships that could be impacted at some point
or another. That's about 15% of the total earnings for that group.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. That's very good color. Thank you. And then on the – there was the question about Trans
Mountain costs. I just want to confirm, I mean, historically all have said that if we bumped up against that upper limit
of what the off takers were required to accept in Canadian dollars. If we punch through that, there was still significant
shipper interest and if conditions were that you punched through that a little bit that the expectation would be that there
would be plenty of still interest, and you wouldn't be too worried about that. Is that still the case that whatever comes,
you are going to do your best to keep costs down, but the shipper interest is there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: There is good strong shipper interest, including outside of the current shippers, and so, yeah, we
still believe that. Now, having said that, we are working very hard to keep our overall costs down and to be within the
cap. And we're making good progress. But, yeah, we do believe that there is strong shipper interest outside of the
existing shippers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And last question from me. Kind of a bigger picture, but the industry, I don't even want
to call it industry, the activism out there that's made it difficult to put on new projects has also started impacting
existing projects on occasion. And that's called into question what kind of ongoing costs there are for surveillance and
security. Can you comment on those trends and any issues impacting the industry?

Next question is from Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisers. Your line is now open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon, Becca.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Good afternoon. Three questions for you. One on Utopia, back to that, do you have a timing on
the appeal, and how many counties have you sued the landowners?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Timing on the appeal, we've asked for an expedited appeal, so we're waiting to see if that's
granted, and then they would have to set a schedule, and so I don't have a specific answer on that. But it would be
months. It would be months to get the appeal ultimately resolved. And, Ron, in terms of the number of counties where
we've got condemnation suits, it's probably nearly every county [indiscernible] (1:19:41).
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: Yeah, several of the counties. And we've – as is typical of all of our projects, we try to
avoid the use of eminent domain. We negotiate with respect with land owners, and as Steven indicated, we're about
65% just through gaining easements without any eminent domain. So we continue to work that effort while we appeal
this one county effort and what happens in other counties that remains to be seen.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: But other judges, of course, have ruled the other way on this.
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: Right.
<Q - Becca Followill>: But there have been counties that have ruled the opposite direction?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: Yes.
<Q - Becca Followill>: In Ohio?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: Yes.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes. And including at the appellate level.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Was the appellate level on – was that on surveying or was that on eminent domain?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: It was on eminent domain.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay. Are there different districts that have you to go through for different county rules or is it
all in one district and which district is it?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, it's a county-by-county, this is a county court system, state county court system in each
county and then there are appellate districts and that ultimately in the Ohio court – the Ohio Supreme Court.

Mountain Expansion, I assume you would have to have that in hand before you could do a JV?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, and we have to, I don't remember the exact timeframe, but we do deliver it to the
shippers following the receipt of acceptable approvals, and so there's some relatively short window of time within
which to deliver that.
<Q - Becca Followill>: So that would also be in January then?

there. Was there anything unusual that was going on?

<A - Jesse Arenivas>: Yeah, a couple of things. We deferred a couple of projects earlier in the year. And then we had
a power outage in the quarter that significantly affected the field and so on, but nothing major beyond those.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Hey, Rich. Appreciate the time tonight. Just I have a couple of clarification
questions. I guess to start, a kind of model question. Kim, I think I heard you say in your prepared remarks that the full
year sustaining CapEx would be within 4% of the initial budget. Just wondering, I think the original budget was $570
million, or $574 million, so I was just looking at the final page of your release tonight and it – I just wanted to, I guess,
figure out the reconciliation of that comment if I heard you correctly or not, and then the $455 million listed in the last
page. Just what I should be using, kind of what is the number?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Well, the original budget was $574 million, and will be within 4% of that number.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Of that number. Okay. Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: 4% better. In other words, less...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Better. Less. Less.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Yeah, no, understood. There's a lot of improvement you guys have made there. I
knew it was going to be under. I just didn't know, that $455 million go to a larger magnitude, so I'll follow-up maybe

with David about what this table represents but I just want to clarify for our model what the number should be. I guess
second question for me, oil curves moved up significantly since the last call. Curious if any additional hedging activity
had taken place and if you could maybe give me just a quick rundown of where you stand?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Sure. On the hedges, and this is 2017, we've got – and I'm going to give you barrels now
because I think that is easier for everybody's model than giving you percentages.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Yep.

questions on TMX obviously appreciate the color on the project, procedural path, potential for partners. I just, I guess,
as it relates to your historical cadence around guidance, just given that's normally early December and a lot of that
seems like it will be decided either late December, early January, just what we should be expecting from you, if
anything different than normal?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: In terms of giving guidance later in the year with all the moving parts in the first quarter.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah, precisely, yeah.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, so we haven't even started...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Started the budget process.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Going through our budget process for 2017, and so we normally decide if, when and how to
guide when we're deeper – actually when we're completed with that process. So don't have an answer for you yet,
Chris.
<Q - Christopher Paul Sighinolfi>: Okay. All right. Well, thanks a lot for the time, guys.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Thanks.

Next question. I'm sorry. Next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Faisel. How are you this afternoon?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi. Okay. Thanks. Good evening. In terms of the TMX again, can the negotiations with your
contractors extend beyond the end of the year? Or are you expecting that to be done by the end of the year?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I would expect there will be stuff being negotiated with the contractors all the way along
through the project, frankly. But the bulk of it will be done by the time we communicate to the customers, obviously.
So early next year.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And then the increased contribution that you guys talked about in the quarter from the
Hiland Midstream assets. What exactly was that associated with? Was that associated with higher volumes, or was
there something else going on the Midstream assets.

<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, it was shifting contracts from commodity sensitive contract structures where we were
getting a percentage of proceeds to locking in the fee and giving the producer the commodity upside. And so the
producer was happy with the commodity upside, and we were happy to lock in and secure a stable cash flow.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And that caused an increase in the EBITDA...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It did.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: For the quarter?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yes.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: And really through...
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: For the year or two.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Got it. Okay. And then the hedges, Kim, that you described on the call right now, are those
hedge amounts for next year, those look like a little bit lower than what they would normally be at this time of year on
terms of a percentage of volume basis.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: We are within our hedging program.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. And the tax expense you talked about for SNG, is that just related to the deferred
tax assets for the entire company, so is that just a reflection of the change in the DTA for you guys?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: No, it's a reflection of the fact that we don't book deferred taxes on non-deductible
goodwill.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. That's all I had, guys. Thanks.

Next question is from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Jonathan. How are you doing?
<Q - John Edwards>: I'm doing good. I'll try to keep this really brief. Just can you remind us on Trans Mountain,
what that CapEx cap is? And then if you can remind us how much you've invested in Trans Mountain to-date?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's C$6.8 billion is the cap amount. And by the end of the year, we'll be a little under $600
million invested, but keep in mind that there is...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Canadian.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Canadian, yeah. But keep in mind that that's a gross number and we collect what we call Firm
50 fees. This is firm capacity across the dock, and there's $250 million worth of Firm 50 fees that go to offset that
development cost. So the net number and now, that doesn't all match up in time. That's extended over a 10-year period,
but $250 million worth of development costs is funded through the Firm 50 fees.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And then beyond that, of course, as we've explained before, we have commitments from
the shippers for a portion of this in the event that the project would not go forward. So it's not like all of this is on our
nickel. And I think Steve has explained that in the past.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. So if it doesn't go forward, approximately what percentage basically would be...

<A - Steven J. Kean>: It varies depending on the reason, but it's generally no less than 80% is borne by the shippers.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. That's helpful. And then the December 20, is that you expect that to be – is that literally a
go, no go, or is there some other decision that could come out of that?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's a decision and we don't know if it's going to have additional conditions or affirm the NEB's
existing 157 conditions or so. So it's not a – but it will be, it is expected to be, as for example, in the Northern Gateway
case, the Order in Council is a definitive decision about whether they view the project as being in the public
convenience and necessity. So it will be definitive from that standpoint, we would expect. Unless there's something,
very different here, we'd expect them to make that determination definitively.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. So that becomes effectively the go, no go is the public...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I'm not clear on what you mean by go, no go.
<Q - John Edwards>: Yeah, I mean, like you get a decision, I mean, does that mean say, for example, they did not
find it's in the public – it's not a project found in the interest of the public for convenience and necessity, would you, in
effect, at that point, have to cancel the project? Now if they find you'll get a certificate of public convenience and
necessity but they add some conditions, I'm presuming then the project for all practical purposes definitely goes
forward. That's what I'm just trying to figure out.
<Q - John Edwards>: Yeah, and so on the going forward decision, the other elements that I spoke to, we've got to get
the BC resolution, go through the final contractor and customer communications, all of which we expect to happen
fairly shortly, after the federal order. The federal order could be a range of things. I mean naturally we think we've
made a very good case, and we think we've done better even then past applications in terms of meeting the
requirements that the government has laid out.
So we're certainly advocating for and expecting we'll find a determination that it is in the public convenience and
necessity. But it could also have additional conditions and we'd have to examine what those conditions are and what
impact they have on the project. And to your point, yeah, they could determine that it's not, and then we'd have to
decide what our next steps were from that point.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. And then just switching over to the JV possibilities, given that the customers are
effectively funding a portion of this on a JV, would they be eligible to participate in any, say, markup on that? I mean,
how much sharing would go on with the customers?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No. There's no sharing on that. It's – but we're also again, not being specific about who might
want to be a participant if, again, this is an if, if we pursued a JV.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. So I'm presuming, would it be fair to presume that there's a fair number of the customers
that would want to be...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I...
<Q - John Edwards>: Potential...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, I wouldn't lean into that, John. I think that they're generally in different businesses than
owning pipelines if you look at the slate of customers. So I'm just not precluding any potential option there.
<Q - John Edwards>: Okay. That's really helpful. That's it for me. Thank you so much.

Our last question from the queue is from Sunil Sibal, Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.
<Q - Sunil K. Sibal>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for all of the clarifications. Just a couple of quick ones for
me. Just time to think, 6 months to, say, 18 months ahead, you got your leverage to below 5X and then rate they would

advance to higher levels, how should we think about leverage from that point going forward? Because presumably you
are looking to finance some of the future projects with additional debt. Is there a target, kind of a lever that you'll still
be aiming for, especially considering that you may get credit for that future capital – for that capital spend for future
leverage?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah, I mean, I think we've been targeting about 5 times leverage as a decision point.
And when we get to that point, we will, as Rich said, we will look at the dividend, we will look at, whether we want to
pay down additional debt, and we will look at what we think the right long-term run rate is for the business, whether it
is the 5 times or whether it is something improved from there. And so I think in terms of – you can expect that it would
be at 5 times or potentially better, depending on what decision we make when we get to that point.
<Q - Sunil K. Sibal>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just one clarification with regard to your interstate pipelines. I
was wondering what kind of interest you're seeing on some of the re-contracting for those pipelines? I think NGPL
especially had some contracts which were coming up for renewal. Any color on that?
<A>: Yeah, I mean, I would say overall, we've had good interest and good rates. Our contract in have really have gone
and increased over the course of the year, and the right way to think about NGPL is it really has the – it touches all of
the major demand and supply areas that are engaged in the market right now, whether it'd be LNG, whether it'd be
Mexico exports, whether it'd be the petrochemical growth in the Gulf Coast, whether it'd be certainly Marcellus, Utica,
and even the Permian, we're seeing some action out West as well. So good prospects along NGPL.
<Q - Sunil K. Sibal>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you all very much. Have a good evening. I know everybody is going to scurry home to watch the big
