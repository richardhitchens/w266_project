MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Raytheon Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mark
and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The
results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on
our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version
of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial
Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we'll move on to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and
expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?

Thomas A. Kennedy
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results,
and I'd like to begin by touching on a few highlights.
Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.09. This reflects strong global demand for our advanced solutions and
positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our
international business which more than offset a slight decline in domestic.
Company segment margins in 2015 were, as expected, at 13.1% as the team delivered solid operating performance.
Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while
also funding our pension plans and investing in our future growth. So all in all, the company is performing very well
and we're confident in our future.
As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand
for Raytheon's solutions. I would also add that in my conversions with our global customers, it is clear that short-term
shifts in economic growth factors have taken a backseat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face
these security threats.
In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in the three regions. In the Middle East, demand signals increased last
year despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile defense, long-range
radars, modernized command and control systems, sensors, cyber security, and precision munitions, areas that align
with our core strengths.
I've been asked many times how oil prices have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative
impact and here's one of many examples why. Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen
ballistic missiles fired in the region. Missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to
critical infrastructure and defense sites.
In the Asia-Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in
light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are
motivating allies in this region to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities to protect their national interest. As you
may recall, South Korea awarded us with significant upgrade to its Patriot systems in 2015.
Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship-based radars, missiles, force
protection systems and precision munitions. And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a
number of countries in acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions providing additional opportunity for
Patriot and NASAMs.
Domestically, we were pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act which adjusted the defense budget caps
higher for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017, including a 15% increase in modernization funding in fiscal year 2016.
These changes provided much-needed funding for our armed forces while also improving visibility and predictability
for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016, and then continuing into
2017.
Even as we emerge from several years of declining U.S. defense budgets that are now beginning to see growth, the
environment remains competitive. To ensure Raytheon's long-term competitive advantage, we have increased our
independent research and development, capital expenditures and other investments to fund the development of the
advanced game-changing technologies of the future, ranging from hypersonics and cybersecurity to directed energy. As
expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level is expected in 2016.
Now let me give you some more details about our 2015 results. Strong demand from global customers drove bookings
of $25.2 billion for the full year, a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong with a full year book-to-bill
ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better than originally expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I'll

discuss more in a moment. International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015, and our international
book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19% for the year.
Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2014, again, providing a solid
foundation as we move in the 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog compared to 40% at year-end
2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in return
to growth in 2015 a year earlier than we have originally expected.
Our full-year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014 reaching 31% of our total annual sales, a new company
record. In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6%
in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our cost, enhance our
competitiveness, and improve affordability for our customers.
A few examples include: executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, leveraging our
centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support to the businesses, and
reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. In addition, we have kicked off a new
complexity reduction initiative to reduce cost and simplify business processes across the company.
Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand that should ultimately drive our bookings to the
$25 billion to $26 billion-dollar range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05.
Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar. The EMD phase of the next generation jammer, and
SM-3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified.
Along with the strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continued strength should position us well to deliver
revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our
initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call. I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from
domestic customers. This would be the first time we've seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash
flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016, from solid 2015 levels.
This strong fundamental performance provides the foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment
strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our number one priority remains executing our growth
strategy and investing in ourselves. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also
continue to see value in our stock, and expect to continue the share buyback at the 2015's robust levels.
Part of our growth strategy is bringing our advanced cyber security capabilities to government and commercial
customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cyber
security market in a meaningful way, with the formation of Raytheon|Websense. And earlier this month, we changed its
name to Forcepoint, to more effectively brand and position our broad cyber security capabilities in the market.
We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stonesoft after the close of the fourth quarter. This
small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we've articulated over the past several calls, provides
next generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cyber security capabilities.
The Stonesoft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We're excited about the breadth and
depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint that place us in a strong competitive position.
I'd like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year, and for the dedication and all of the efforts that went
into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule while continuing to deliver for our global customers.
With that, let me turn it over to Toby.
Anthony F. O'Brien
Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss
our outlook for 2016. After that, we'll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web

slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website.
Okay. Would everyone please move to page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both
the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than
our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter, at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24.
And for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for
continued growth in 2016, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes.
Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our Missiles, IDS, and Forcepoint businesses. International sales
grew 16% in the fourth quarter. And for the year, sales were up 2%, ending at $23.2 billion.
Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little
more color on in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3
billion for the year, after a $200 million pre-tax discretionary pension contribution which was not in our prior guidance.
Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing
the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion.
As we have previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter of 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance
sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion.
Turning now to page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I
mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a
year-end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with a funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2
billion from year-end 2014. It's worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance
for the full year 2015.
For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings, and for the full year was 34% of
total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was
international.
Turning now to page five, we had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at
the high end of the guidance range we had set in October.
So, looking now at the businesses. IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter and they were up 5% from the same
period last year, primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare
Destroyer program.
Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year primarily due to lower sales on an
international classified program. Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to
the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6
billion in Q4. The change was spread across numerous programs with no one significant driver.
And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense which we completed in the second
quarter of 2015. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon Cyber Products only. For the full
year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full year 2014 consistent, with expectations. International
sales growth more than offset a slight decline in domestic sales.
Moving ahead to page six, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and the full year. Looking at
business margins in the quarter. As expected in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to
restructure the AWD program essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted
in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both
exceed the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance.

Turning to page 7. We had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was
consistent with our expectations. And as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorders settlement earlier in
the year at IIS worth about 80 basis points.
On page 8, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full-year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85 and for
the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October, even after
accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11, and was
not in our prior guidance.
Moving on to our 2016 guidance on page 9. We see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3%
to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook
for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million, and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million.
It's important to note that effective January 1, 2016 w e reclassified amortization of acquired intangibles and the
deferred revenue adjustments. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint which had already been
reporting that way. These non-cash items will no longer be reported within the business segments. Instead, these will be
reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles lines that we have provided
for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G to the press
release.
As for pension, we see the 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I'll discuss in just a minute. We
expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares
outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full-year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%,
driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program which we expect at levels comparable to 2015.
We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the
$0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. It's important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the
R&D tax credit which was permanently extended at the end of 2015.
In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7.00. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for
2016 is expected to between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2015. As we sit here today, we do
not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we previously mentioned, we did
make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015.
Before moving on to page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26
billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings
in the second half of the year, similar to the last several years.
Continuing on to page 10. Before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, it's important to note that effective January 1,
2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical
infrastructure protection, and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our
capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you'll find the recast segment data in the
attachments provided at the end of the earnings release.
Now, moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in
all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016
margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015,
excluding the eBorders settlement.
And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales.
I would also like to point out that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in
specific next-generation U.S. programs to better position the company for longer-term organic growth, investments
which we believe will create value for our shareholders.

At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out that our full year 2016 guidance includes
positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016 which you can
think of in the $100 million to $125 million range.
Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix. Most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new
programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia.
As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer-duration programs which can increase over
time as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies.
We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders
settlement. We see Missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. SAS margins are expected to be
in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs, as
well as from higher business investments in 2016. And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5%
range. This includes the impact from the Stonesoft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins
would be approximately 15%.
If you'd now turn to page 11, we've provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You notice that sales ramp up
throughout the year. And on page 12, as we have done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact
from pensions in 2015 as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant.
As I mentioned earlier, we see the FAS/CAS adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our
investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat, and the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%.
The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind each 25-basis-point change
in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS/CAS.
And finally on page 13, we have provided an updated three-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to
help you with your long-term modeling. Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue
adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly
after 2018.
Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earning calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we
expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating
going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This
includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share
buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and
from time-to-time making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.
Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance with bookings, sales,
earnings and operating cash flow on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business
grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive
shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic
business.
So, with that, we'll open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call here. I was wondering if you could
just walk through the cadence for the year in a little bit more detail, perhaps talking a little bit about opportunities and
risks to the cadence for the year, what would cause things to come in a little earlier? What would cause things to get

pushed out? And just kind of how you generally view the risks and opportunities for the cadence for the year would be
great.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. Hey, Jason, it's Toby. So I think, if we step back from this and look at it a high
level on the cadence, what you see from the revenue profile is not too dramatically different than last year. It's
influenced by, as you would expect, the timing of awards, especially in 2015, and we had a strong back half to the year.
So, we see an influence to the ramp up in the second half of the year, in part driven by the growth and the timing of the
awards we saw in late 2015. That flows through obviously to the EPS cadence, and the other thing I would add, the exit
of business ventures at IDS that I talked about, that's planned to be in the second half, in Q3, which has an influence on
the back-half cadence from an EPS point of view as well.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Toby, are you willing to offer a little bit more granularity on the businesses that you're
exiting?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: I think I'd put it this way. We constantly look at our portfolio. We've talked on the call
here about a couple things. One which is just moving of some of the businesses from IDS to IIS, because we think it's
going to drive some more efficiencies, given how those products had matured, they're more of a service support model.
Where, in the past, IIS had actually performed a lot of work on it. So we think we'll get more efficiencies out of that.
I can't get into too much detail right now, beyond what I said for the exit of the business ventures at IDS, just because
of the confidentiality around it, but we certainly can talk more about that once that is concluded, as we said here, we
expect by the third quarter.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Doug.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'm interested in IDS because, if we go back a year ago, when you were looking forward,
you were expecting some margin expansion, that you would see operating margins up in the 15% range. And it seemed,
as the year went on, you looked at the new awards coming in, that pushed out in time, that margin expansion. But now,
as you look at 2016, and if you make adjustment for the exit from those businesses, it seems like you're still at a lower
margin level than one might think, or one might have expected.
Can you talk about how you look at that IDS trajectory now? I know you mentioned a couple of the new programs,
which may put some pressure on margins in the near term. But I'm trying to understand when we can expect to get kind
of the full margin advantage one might expect from a mature set of international programs.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Sure, Doug. Let me kind of walk through that and try to give some more color on that. So
as I mentioned, and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the
exit of a business venture. I will note, at IDS in any given year, in part because of the nature of their programs and the
size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments that were significant, maybe about the half of the size of this, if
you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger, but it does help to offset, in 2016, some of the mix that we've
been talking about that you just referred to, with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages.
Further, as we've talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic
areas where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs

at IDS, such as AMDR, the Qatar ADOC, a classified radar program that we won last year. And all this taken together
is a key component of our growth story, but in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well.
At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and
deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio. And we continue to be focused on driving down our costs,
overhead and other costs, for the last several years. And as you know, we've seen significant improvements from a
number of different initiatives there around facilities reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our
shared services, working on our organization structure, when we've collapsed from six to four businesses.
And as we've talked about internationally, we changed our model on how we approached international business, and
that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we'll
continue to drive costs down with our objective to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin
improvement.
As far as the cadence of IDS margin going forward, I would think of it this way. As you said, if you were to adjust for
the exit of the business venture, I think as we've said in the past, we would expect year-over-year to continue see IDS
margins improve incrementally, again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture as these larger production
programs that run five years kind of get into the sweet spot into 2017 and 2018, which would drive that improved
margin at IDS.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So if I have this right then you're saying that you still expect with these attractive
international contracts that you can get up to the margins, the sort of high-16%s maybe margins we've seen in the past,
but that this is just taking longer than you probably would have expected 6 months to 12 months ago.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Well, I'd put it – so I'm not going to give you beyond what we've put out there for 2016,
you know, a margin expectation for IDS other than directional indication or cadence. But yes. We really haven't
changed our thinking around this. You've got to keep in mind, as we've said, in the case of Patriot these awards
generally run five years. And a couple big ones that I mentioned in the prepared comments, those are – we're only a
year into those, right? And it's usually in the plus or minus, the third year of those programs, which will be starting in
2017, when we normally see the opportunity to retire risk, drive efficiencies. We also had, if you recall at the end of
2014, a major award for Qatar. Again, that will kind of be kind of hitting its sweet spot when we get into 2017. So, I
won't put a specific margin bogie out there, but we definitely would see improvement in 2017 and improvement over
that into 2018, driven by these large programs.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Toby, the cash flow, even if you added back the $200 million, came kind of at the low
end of your guidance, and then you have a bigger increase in 2016. Was some of that something was missed in 2015, or
if you'd just explain kind of the walk from the 2015 number, of say $250 million to get to the $270 million to $300
million?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So the way to think of it, George, you're right, we came in towards the low end
when you adjust for the discretionary pension contribution. When I look at the change, year-over-year it's primarily
driven by a combination of our net pension funding and lower cash taxes. From a operational or program level, we see
things kind of in-line with the cadence that we saw in 2015.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then one quick one. What was the organic growth if we looked at Forcepoint
and put in the acquisition, so what would've it have been year-over-year?

<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: For the company?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: For Forcepoint. I mean if we put in ...
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Oh.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: ... the acquisition you made, and we put in Websense for last year?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, so, or if you normalize on a normalized basis for full year, the top line would've
been roughly flat, which is what we'd been expecting. You're talking 2015, right?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I'm talking 2015, then I was going to ask you the 2016 comparison.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. So, for 2015 for Forcepoint, normalized on a full-year basis, the
revenue growth would've been flat. That would have been higher sales of the new products, the TRITON platform
offset by a decline in the legacy products on the web filtering, which is consistent with what we'd been expecting.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Right.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: If you roll it forward to 2016 and exclude the acquisition that Tom talked about for the
next-gen firewall, we'd be looking at high-single-digit growth on a normalized basis.

Your next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Good morning, Robert.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Tom, you mentioned you're getting quite a few questions about the potential impact of the oil
price on your defense export sales. I was wondering if you could size the proportion of either your backlog or your
sales that are going into the Middle East? And whether you have seen any signs from those customers of any change in
priorities or deferrals of orders or deliveries, or anything in particular? And then secondly, do you think this is the peak
as a percentage of exports in your backlog? Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: That's an excellent question. Number one, is I just did come back from the Middle East,
visiting our key customer in multiple countries. And so my statement in the script was really based on the
communications that I had directly with the leaders of these countries. And what I'm seeing, at least, what I'm hearing
from these leaders is their number one priority is to protect the sovereignty of their nation. And the words they use, I've
mentioned this before, and I heard it again just several weeks ago, is that a strong defense is a strong deterrence. And in
fact, during my trip, we uncovered or were told about several other opportunities in the region.
So, if anything, we're seeing a stronger demand than a slowdown, and that's why my words were that we're not seeing
an impact relative to the price of oil at this time.
I don't know if that gives you a complete answer, but that's what I'm seeing directly from the leaders of these countries.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: And just a follow-up on the backlog percentage. Do you think this is about as high as you're
going to get at 43%?

<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Not based on the opportunities we're seeing out there. There's always opportunity to
grow. It's just a matter of bringing those opportunities across the goal line.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah, Rob, so maybe just add a little bit on that, I mean, just to put a little context. We
expect strong bookings internationally to continue into 2016. Roughly 35% plus or minus of the bookings that we – that
the range that we gave you, we expect would be international. Keep in mind, we're projecting 2% to 4% growth
domestically as a subset of the 3% to 5% at the company level, and we'd expect international sales to be roughly at the
same level in 2016 as 2015. So, we continue to see, as Tom said, momentum in that area.

Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk just philosophically about the decision you made to
pull the amortization of intangibles of deferred revenue out of the segments. I'm just wondering when it comes to
acquisition opportunities, doesn't that make the segments in a way willing to pay a little higher price than they would
have otherwise? How do you make sure that now you've got the pricing right in the hurdle rates?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, I'll give you the answer, or my view here, in two parts, right? So, first of all,
why we did it. If you recall, back April, May of last year when we announced the Websense deal for that acquisition,
we started with that convention, but only limited to that acquisition. And at the time, we contemplated doing it
completely across the portfolio, but we didn't want to mess with the pure nature of the numbers around Websense. So,
we purposely deferred that to the end of the year to have kind of a clean break going into 2016, and it obviously puts
both of those elements on the same basis consistently across the company. So, that's part one why we did it.
As far as the second part of your question, are we concerned about the businesses wanting or being willing to pay
more? Even if that were to be the case, we've got a pretty disciplined process here at the company. We've got a core
team, an acquisition review team that all acquisitions have to go through. I'm on that. Tom's on that, as you would
imagine, a few others. And through that, we spend a lot of time around valuation looking at it two, three different ways.
And I won't get into any stats, but I would tell you there are plenty of deals in the past that we lost because we wouldn't
bid higher, right? We lost on price, for lack of a better way to say it.
So, I think we've got the right controls and process in place within the company to make sure that we continue to only
bid and pay what is a fair value for any property.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: And just to follow up, the decisions on acquisitions are done at the corporate level, not at
the business level.
<Q - Samuel J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thanks. And if I can just follow up, Toby. If I just look at the first quarter, you've
got the most working days, but clearly, the lowest earnings. And I know you mentioned one of it was from the exit of
those businesses later in the year. But how is it that earnings are so low that early in the year?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. So, you're right. There are more days, calendar days in Q1. That said, we still show
growth in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. I think, as you know, in any given quarter, some of our revenue depends upon
not just the number of days, but the timing of material, which is a significant portion of our cost base.
We are guiding to 3% to 4% growth over last year's first quarter. And that puts our 2015 sales per day roughly in line
for the quarter. So, we don't see anything abnormal about it, and part of it, again, I think back to Jason's comment
around the cadence with the strong bookings we saw in the second half of the year, especially domestically, we'd see

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Thank you very much. I want to talk maybe philosophically for a second also. I think I
heard you or Tom say that you're willing to make some strategic investments in programs. And if I look at one of your
competitors that's reported, they acknowledged taking a charge in LRDR. And I also – I'm aware that you've been
challenged a little bit in a classified program at IIS. So, could you talk a little bit about what you're doing in terms of
balancing growth opportunities versus making sure you build I'll call it a wall of strategic advantage in your businesses,
Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah. So, I think, number one is, we do invest inside the company relative to ensuring
that we have the right discriminators and differentiators to compete across all our businesses, and not only just to
compete, but obviously to win. And so those investments come through the avenue of IRAD, some capital investments,
also people bringing on the right talent so that we can go and win those major competitions, because they are the future
franchises for the company. And that's been our overall strategy over the years.
We look at programs that are going to have runs for decades. What's the next Patriot? One of the examples is Air
Missile Defense Radar. That's going to be our next major franchise coming to fruition here in the next several years.
Next-generation Jammer win, the FAB-T win. These are all franchise programs and we made sure, over the years, that
we had been investing in the right IRAD and the right – the capital to support those projects, and then also in having the
right talent on board. And that's just something that we do as part of the company moving forward.
Now the good news is, we're seeing the results of those investments, and again, the results are these franchises that
we've won over the last couple of years, and that we intend to continue to win as we move forward. And we see a lot of
opportunity here in 2016, 2017 and 2018 already, in terms of new franchise opportunities.
And so, Howard, I think the bottom line is, we're making the right investments and we're seeing the right results
relative to these new franchises.
<Q - Howard Alan Rubel>: Maybe just to follow-up, I want to make sure that you're not seeing the business
becoming so competitive or changed that the cost to, I'll call it, to sustain your growth or to improve your position, is
becoming more costly or more risky.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: I'm not seeing it any different in the past. What I am seeing, which is nice, is, I'm seeing
more opportunities in the last couple of years than I saw in the prior years. So, the bottom line is, there's a lot of
opportunities out there, and we've, I would say, had a pretty good crystal ball in making sure we made the right
investments to be prepared to win those opportunities.

expectations for Patriot over the next few years.
And I was wondering if you could talk about that, maybe in the context of how much you've invested into things like
facilities and R&D and head count, in anticipation of Patriot wins. And would it require you to maybe get a little bit
more aggressive on price, in the event that you sort of need the volume to cover some of those investments that you've
made in anticipation of the awards, on Patriot specifically?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, I think on Patriot, I think the investments have come through contracts. And then
the other capital investments that we made are the normal investments we make to essentially be able to operate our
factory in a lean and efficient manner. So that's – I'll put that in context, and let me put together the opportunities for
Patriot in context.
There was just a recent announcement by the new Minister of Defense Macierewicz in Poland, relative to his support of
pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact, he kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S.
ambassador to Poland on that subject, with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So, that's
really good news for us. That's a very large potential program for Poland there.
And I just, as I mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East, and there's strong demand for additional Patriot
assets there. I mentioned in my script a number of – over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic missiles, just in that
region of the Middle East. So, there's a strong demand across Eastern Europe, and also the Middle East, for additional
Patriot assets, but also for upgrade.
For example, there's – just in the upgrade area alone, there's an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units just to
Configuration-3 plus. So, there's upgrade potentials and then there's also the new potentials for countries like Poland,
and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region.
And if you've – I'm sure you're reading the newspapers, like the information that I'm getting, especially of all the Asia
Pacific activities that are going on. In fact, today there was an article relative to THAAD in Korea, where we also have
just gotten an award on Patriot there, too.
So the bottom line is, there seems to be a significant demand out there across multiple areas, Eastern Europe, Asia
Pacific region and the Middle East for missile defense, and Patriot is the system that's proven and is the system of
choice for these nations. That's what we're seeing.
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Okay. That's great. And maybe, Tom, if you could, maybe just since you mentioned it, can
you maybe help us size the market opportunity for some of that retrofit work, maybe for 360-degree radar. Any context
you could give us to sort of help think about it, in the context of -
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: [indiscernible] (50:18) one that I didn't mention. So there's the whole – that's part of the
upgrade activities also, but there's...
<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: .... there's definitely over $5 billion, just on upgrades to Configuration-3 Plus. There's
opportunities on the radars that are – it's in the billions of dollars there, in terms of adding these AESA 360 radars. By
the way, that was one of the requests that I had in several of my meetings with key leaders in the Middle East, was a
desire to have our new AESA 360 system added to their configurations. So, I think that's getting out there, that that
capability is available, and we're hearing – getting demand signals from customers on that.
So, the bottom line is, is Patriot is a franchise. We continue to evolve it. We continue to upgrade it. Increase its
capabilities. Add new technologies, and it's – we're seeing increased demand across those three major areas of the
world. Again, the Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, and also the Middle East.

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you very much. So, Tom, I think you guys said you expect international to be
35% of bookings in 2016. That'd suggest that really you'd do about – if you do the $25.5 billion that you do about $9
billion up from what looks like $8.7 billion. You have the Qatar award, but other than that you don't seem to have as
many identified large individual awards as you did in 2015. Could you give us some more color of what would be
driving that number that high?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Well, the – you mentioned one of them, which is the Qatari WR. We also have
International Patriot, greater than $1 billion worth of bookings that are in play. We have other activities in Qatar which
we're pursuing and we believe are accessible this year. There's the whole FMS in the area of Aegis, supporting Aegis
Ashore, and also upgrades on some ships in the international marketplace. For those who don't know, we do the Aegis
radar, all the components and the subsystems for that radar. That alone is for example over $300 million.
And then in the whole area of missiles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than
$3 billion across multiple missiles. So, there're multiple contracts. There's no one contract in missiles that's going to do
it, but that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems up. International ISR
was over $700 million. And then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR EOIR systems that's probably pretty
close to $1 billion.
So, I think what's different this year than others is we're seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the
international side. And you say, why is that? Well, we mentioned before that we changed our strategy about two years
ago. We went from a regional strategy to a country strategy. And in that country strategy we focused not on the one or
two customers we've had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that, and now we're seeing that. But these other
customers are buying in the order of $500 million to $1 billion program, not just a $2 billion program. So, bottom line
is our portfolio, which is diverse, is now diverse in the international marketplace, and these opportunities are coming
across in multiple – across multiple of our products.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, Tom, you've said that it takes three years to hit the margin sweet spot on five-year Patriot
contracts. The turn time, I would assume, is going to be shorter on missile programs and some of these other programs.
So, should we start to see this later in 2016 in your margins, or 2017? You know, the non-Patriot programs?
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Yeah. Cai, it's Toby. I'll jump in on this one. I think you'd really want to think about that
out in 2017, okay? And the other thing to keep in mind with our missile program – our international missile programs,
they are essentially FMS and not direct commercial sales. So, while they, relatively speaking, have some incremental
margin compared to our domestic business, it is different than if it were a DCS type of sale.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

good as any in terms of a lot of the air-to-surf missiles and the ground support missiles that are being utilized. I mean,
how did that impact Raytheon in terms of a bookings perspective? Do you see – is it a big long-lag effect, or do you
actually start to have those conversations?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: No. I mean – we just went through that on the – the bottom line is we expect a range next
year, an increase in our international bookings. It's going to be $8.5 billion to $9 billion range next year, which is up
from 2015. So we are seeing an increased demand, and it's coming, again, across our whole portfolio not just Patriot.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: I guess I was referring to the domestic activity in terms of the army and air force expending a
lot – what is the activity on ISIS, (56:18) et cetera? You start to see ...
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: That's part of – yeah, that's part of the range growth we talked about on the domestic,
about 2% to 4%. And we're seeing it both inter – which is interesting here, we mentioned it, is we haven't grown
domestically since 2009. In 2016, we see 2% to 4% growth, and that's significant for us, and it's coming because of the
op-tempo internationally, but also in the pent-up demand that the Department has in refreshing a lot of their systems,
including some new starts in the area of radars and other systems.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. Thank you for the clarity on that. Thanks.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: And Peter, I think the way you can see that translate through if you look at the – our
missiles business, right, they had pretty good growth in 2015, as we started to see the effect of that, and then even better
growth that we're guiding to for 2016.
So, that's the flow-through, the start of the flow-through from a revenue point of view of what Tom just talked about
from a demand perspective.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thanks, Toby.
<A - Anthony F. O'Brien>: Bottom line, we're growing internationally and we're growing domestically; and that's
