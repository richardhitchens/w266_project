Before we begin I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely
to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement
disclaimer at the end of this web presentation. In addition we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for
disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everybody. Let me begin today by acknowledging the families and loved ones of
those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with them at this time. In accordance
with international protocols Boeing is serving as a technical advisor to the NTSB in support of Malaysian authorities.
And we appreciate the ongoing efforts of all parties involved in the investigation.
Turning back to the subject at hand this morning, I'll start with some comments on our first quarter performance and the
business environment. After that Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook.
Now let's turn to Slide 2. Building on our momentum from 2013 Boeing delivered strong first quarter financial results,
including healthy revenue increases, solid core operating margins, and double-digit growth in core earnings per share.
During the quarter we also returned significant value to shareholders by repurchasing $2.5 billion of Boeing stock and
increasing our dividend payout to $540 million.
Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes was $12.7 billion and operating margins grew to 11.8%, a result of higher
volume and a favorable delivery mix. We delivered 161 commercial airplanes in the first quarter, including 18 787
Dreamliners. And we added net new orders of 235 airplanes.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported revenue in the first quarter of $7.6 billion and also generated solid
operating margins. During the quarter BDS captured numerous key contract awards, including a $2.4 billion order from
the U.S. Navy to support full-rate production of 16 P-8A Poseidon Aircraft, an order from the U.S. Army for 82
Apache Block III helicopters. And in March the government of Qatar announced its intent to purchase 24 Apache
helicopters and three 737 based AEW&C aircraft.
Noteworthy program milestones included the first C-17 delivery to the Kuwait Air Force, the first Peace Eagle delivery
to the Turkish Armed Forces, and the successful completion of on-orbit testing for the first Inmarsat-5 satellite.
In summary we delivered another strong quarter of operating performance, achieved significant program milestones,
cash and orders totaling $19 billion, and returned significant cash to shareholders, all of which Greg will cover in more
detail in just a moment.
With that let's turn to the business environment on Slide 3. Global customer demand remains high for our fuel-efficient
and value-creating Commercial Airplane family as evidenced by our strong orders intake during the quarter.
Global passenger traffic trends remain strong. And air cargo traffic continues to gradually improve. Despite some
variation in emerging market growth rates, we see no softening of demand for our Commercial Airplanes, given the
compelling operating economics and increased fuel efficiency that our airplanes provide. In fact underpinning the
strength of this cycle relative to past ones is a sustained high level of replacement demand fueled by compelling
airplane economics and the rapid return on investment that comes from replacing older less efficient aircraft with the
dramatically more efficient new technology airplanes we are building today and will introduce throughout this decade.
Furthermore, deferral requests from customers are still running well below the historical average. Requests to
accelerate deliveries meanwhile continue at a steady and encouraging rate. This ongoing demand coupled with our
sizable backlog of more than 5,100 airplanes, which is balanced geographically and across customer operating models,
reinforces our planned production rates. And we believe positions us for a significant and sustained growth in the years
ahead.

With a superior Commercial Airplane product line that provides customers the broadest range of size and range
capabilities in addition to unparalleled operating economics, we continue to expect a book-to-billed ratio above one for
the year.
In the Twin-Aisle segment we expect 2014 will be a strong order year for both the current 777 family and the new
777X models. All Nippon Airways announced intention to purchase both the 777-9X and additional 777-300ERs
illustrates the value that these airplanes bring to the market and reflects our intended strategy to pair orders when
possible to meet customer fleet needs and support the production bridge to the 777X.
Based on 777 proposal volume, firm orders, and options, we have confidence in filling the remaining 2016 production
slots. And we anticipate active sales campaigns currently underway will readily solidify 2017 and 2018.
With a firm backlog of nearly 300 current 777s, continued strong customer demand, and airplane availability this
decade, we have high confidence in executing a successful transition to the 777X.
The 787 Dreamliner is operating at our planned production rate of 10 per month. And both our Everett and Charleston
facilities have made great strides on rate stabilization and introduction of the 787-9. We delivered 10 787s in March,
and including April deliveries to date, we have delivered a total of 133 787s to 18 customers. The fleet is flying an
average of more than 260 flights per day with overall dispatch reliability trending positively at above 98%. More work
to do there for a number of customers but good progress underway nonetheless.
787-9 flight testing and production are progressing well. And we now have rolled out our sixth Dash-9 from final
assembly. We remain on track to deliver the first 787-9 to Air New Zealand around the middle of this year.
In the Single-Aisle segment airplane interest – airline interest I should say in our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains
high. Cumulative orders have surpassed 1,900 to date. In April we also delivered the first next-generation 737 produced
at the increased rate of 42 per month. And we are on track to further increase 737 production to 47 per month in 2017.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, the President's FY 2015 budget request demonstrated solid support for major
Boeing programs, including KC-46 tanker, V-22 Apache, Chinook, GMD, NASA's Space Launch System and
commercial crew, along with satellite programs, including those in the proprietary area.
While funding for the F/A-18 was not included in the budget request, Navy officials have identified additional Growler
models as a top priority for funding consideration by Congress this year. Our F/A-18 family provides exceptional value
for customers with proven technology for needed missions at affordable cost. We continue to work with Congress, the
Navy, and potential international customers to reiterate the aircraft's value proposition.
International Defense, Space & Security business represented nearly 30% of BDS revenues during the quarter and
remains at 35% of the BDS backlog, as we continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global advantage.
We also continue to target organic growth through investments in technology and innovation in areas such as
commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, cyber security, and the
few but critical future large-scale programs as identified as priorities by our customer, like Long Range Strike,
UCLASS, and the T-X Trainer.
The relative strength of our Defense, Space & Security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven, and
affordable and is being delivered on budget and on schedule.
Across the enterprise we remain intensely focused on driving further efficiency, quality, and productivity gains through
improved program profitability and importantly to fund investment in future growth. Our market-based affordability
initiative within Defense, Space & Security has generated $4 billion of cost reductions over the past three years. And
we are on plan to drive out another $2 billion in annual operating costs.
We are also seeing early benefits from our Partnering for Success initiative with our suppliers with further
improvements expected to materialize over the next few years as production ramp-ups on our new airplane programs
occur.

Before I turn it over to Greg, let me comment briefly on a set of related developments in the first quarter that will
materially improve our competitive position, enhance workforce stability, and reduce business risk for us and our
customer.
Following completion in January of a long-term contract extension with our Machinist Union in the Pacific Northwest,
we successfully negotiated a long-term extension with our machinists in St. Louis. These unprecedented agreements
essentially ensure a decade of labor continuity for us and our customers with economics and productivity incentives
that will improve our global competitiveness. A key feature in those agreements is a retirement plan change, which we
are also flowing across our non-union population.
We started the year with approximately 15% of our workforce on modern defined contribution pension plans. After an
initial transition period we will now have about 80% of our workforce covered by defined contribution plans.
These changes are strategic and fundamental to the way we are structuring the company to reduce risk, ensure the
health of our balance sheet, and enhance our competitive position, all while providing employees with attractive and
competitive benefits and further driving long-term shareholder value.
Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to Slide 4, and we'll discuss our first quarter results. First quarter revenue
increased 8% to $20.5 billion driven by strong Commercial Airplane deliveries. Core operating margins increased to
10.2% in the quarter, primarily driven by solid productivity gains at both businesses and improved commercial delivery
mix.
First quarter core earnings per share of $1.76 was driven by higher Commercial Airplane volume and continued strong
operating performance. Excluding the $0.19 of research and development tax credit we received in the first quarter last
year, EPS this quarter grew 14%.
As previously announced during the first quarter, we recorded GAAP non-cash pension curtailment charges of
approximately $330 million associated with the announced move from the defined benefit pension plan to defined
contribution plans for over 100,000 of our employees. These charges did not impact core earnings per share. And as
Jim indicated, we believe these pension changes and long-term labor agreements further de-risk our business and will
improve the company's long-term competitiveness and further drive value for all of our stakeholders going forward.
Let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on Slide 5. For the first quarter our Commercial Airplane business increased
revenue 19% to $12.7 billion on 161 airplane deliveries and increased operating margins to 11.8%. Solid performance,
higher volume, and favorable delivery mix contributed to the strong operating margins in the quarter and are a
testament to our continued focus on efficiently executing our rate increases and driving productivity.
Commercial Airplanes captured $14 billion of net orders during the quarter, and backlog remains very strong at $374
billion and over 5,100 aircraft, equating to approximately seven years of airplane production.
Gross inventory for the company included $36 billion related to the 787 program, an increase during the first quarter of
approximately $2.9 billion. This expected increase was primarily driven by higher planned inventory in support of the
production rate increase to 10 per month and the introduction of the 787-9 program.
Included in the work in process inventory are deferred production costs. For the first quarter, 787 deferred production
balance totaled $23.1 billion, a $1.5 billion increase from the fourth quarter of last year. The $1.5 billion change in
deferred production was driven by the planned transition to 10 per month rate, additional 787-9s in the production
system, and a one-time IAM contract extension payment. Excluding the IAM payment, the change in deferred
production during the quarter was slightly lower than the fourth quarter level.

Based on further production stability, planned contracted supplier step-down pricing, and continued overall
productivity improvements, we expect the quarterly change in deferred production to decline in the second quarter.
We continue to expect 787 deferred production to peak at approximately $25 billion late this year and moderate at that
level before beginning to decline shortly after we complete the transition of 12 per month production rate in 2016. We
continue to see good progress in key operational performance indicators and unit cost as we further implement
production efficiencies and stabilize the overall production system on the 787 program.
While introducing the 787-9 into the production system and increasing production rates by over 40%, the team
continued to make good progress on reducing 787-8 unit costs by more than 15% and improved final assembly flow
times by more than 10% in the last 12 months. More work to do, but the teams remain focused on improving
productivity, flow times, and quality going forward.
We also continue to see good progress on the 787-9, where we've seen a 30% improvement in unit cost and flow times
from the first to the sixth aircraft to roll out the factory.
We still have work ahead of us on the 787 program and anticipate continued improvement as we further stabilize at the
10 per month rate and increase 787-9 production. We also remain on track to deliver approximately 110 787s in 2014.
Again the team remains focused on execution and improving productivity on the program.
Let's turn now to Slide 6 to discuss Defense, Space & Security results. First quarter revenue at our Defense business
was $7.6 billion and operating margins were 10.2%, largely driven by strong performance and delivery mix.
Boeing Military Aircraft first quarter revenue declined to $3.5 billion reflecting F-15 development milestones achieved
in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins at 9.6% in the quarter were due to strong operating performance,
which was offset by the first quarter $48 million C-17 inventory-related charge.
Global Services & Support increased revenue 6% to $2.3 billion and reported solid operating margins at 12.1%.
Network & Space Systems reported revenue of $1.9 billion and generated operating margins of 9% in the quarter,
resulting from continued focus on execution and productivity.
Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $66 billion with 35% of our current backlog representing
customers outside the United States.
Turning now to Slide 7. Boeing Capital's net financing portfolio declined to $3.5 billion on runoff that exceeded new
aircraft volume.
Let's turn to cash flow now on Slide 8. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $1.1 billion, driven by solid
operating performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures.
With regards to capital deployment we paid $540 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 19.4 million
shares for $2.5 billion in the first quarter. We continue to anticipate completing the remaining $8.3 billion of
repurchase authorization over the next two to three years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued
investments to support future growth remain a top priority for us.
Let's now move to cash and debt balances on Slide 9. We ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash and marketable
securities. Our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Turning now to Slide 10, and we'll discuss our outlook for 2014. We're reaffirming 2014 guidance for revenue,
operating margins, deliveries, and cash flow. And as a result of a $150 million favorable IRS tax settlement we
received early in the second quarter, we're increasing our core earnings per share guidance for 2014 by $0.15 to now be
$7.15 to $7.35 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is unchanged as the second quarter tax benefit offsets the
first quarter pension curtailments I discussed – charges I discussed earlier.
So in summary first quarter financial performance reflects the strength of our backlog, the strong demand for our
products and services, and our continued focus on driving productivity and execution through the entire enterprise.

Furthermore as evident by our meaningful dividend increase and our higher share repurchase activity, we continue to
expect to deliver solid growth, productivity, and strong cash flows going forward.
So with that I'll turn it back over to Jim for some closing comment.
W. James McNerney
Thanks, Greg. With a strong first quarter behind us we remain focused on disciplined execution, quality, and
productivity improvements, and meeting customer commitments.
Our priorities going forward remain clear. The profitable ramp-up in production of our Commercial Airplane programs,
executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability throughout the
enterprise, continuing to strengthen and position our Defense business with investments in growth areas amid further
international expansion, and importantly providing increasing value to both our customers and shareholders.
Now we would be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] First we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: A question for Greg on the 787 and the deferred. You talked about the delta from last
quarter and we should pull out the $300 million from the IAM. So thinking about the $2 billion of headroom left to the
peak of $25 billion, it sounds, Greg, like year-end is the time for that. Should we consider a curve perhaps? A
incremental drop about $1 billion then maybe $650 million and $350 million declining like that to get to that target? Is
that the right way to think about it? Or is it steeper or flatter than that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. I mean just a point of clarity, Rob. Not all the $300 million hit the 787, because that
was for all IAM members, including folks that are on the 787 program. But I think as you think about deferred going
forward, as I mentioned in my remarks we've got some, quarter-over-quarter some step down pricing that we have with
our supply chain that's already contracted. And at the same time continuing to make progress on unit cost and
productivity. And I mentioned that the progress has been made up to now.
And I'll tell you there's a lot obviously in work around how to improve flow, how to improve productivity. And just like
I think if you back in time when we've stabilized rate on any program, that's where the teams have really been able to
capture productivity. And that's what's expected here. So quarter-over-quarter as I said we'll see improvement coming
off this quarter into second quarter. And we still again expect to peak at about $25 billion.
And then it'll hold flat as I mentioned before, relatively flat. And then once we hit 12 a month is where you'll start to
see us burning that off. So we got to stay focused on productivity, we got to stay focused on deliveries as we have, and
stay focused on rate readiness, getting to 12 a month. So across the board the team's doing a very good job staying
focused on those elements of the plan.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So Greg, just to clarify how would we think about the delta just on 787 deferred when we
factor in the IAM? What piece was for that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: It's about $75 million.

Operator
Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So to dig in a little bit on the 787, could you give us some color on how you stand on the
Charleston mid-fuselage issue? Are the jobs behind down? The Mitsubishi wing crack issue. And then perhaps give us
some color on when we should expect the step-down pricing to start to kick in, in which quarter?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, sure Cai. Let me address the jobs first. So as you know we put a very concentrated
effort into Charleston to focus on and particularly in the mid-body. And the team is making good progress. So they
have burned down a significant amount of job. Still some work to do, but making tremendous progress. And I certainly
don't see any impact on our delivery guidance for the year as a result of that. So right focus, the right people making
good progress.
On MHI we're essentially through all the MHI rework As of last night we have three airplanes left to go. And again the
teams executed that flawlessly and met all the requirements there. So I'd say that that's behind us at this point.
So all of that again playing right into the deferred production and improvement that were expected in unit cost. On the
step down we will start to see some of that in the next quarter as we introduce the next block. So you'll start to see that
and obviously expect to see that through the balance of the year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you. Should we be concerned that you've only done one 787 delivery so far in April?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No. I think I mentioned before month-to-month you're going to see variance in deliveries.
Certainly what you just described had an initial impact on specific timing. And at the same time we're introducing the
airplane to 18 new customers this year. So you're going to see a change in cadence month over month.
But like I said when you look at tail number by tail number through the balance of the year, we're comfortable that we
can get to the 110 deliveries.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: You're welcome.

Our next question is from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Doug.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: You talked about the 777X transition and I would assume at this point you have a good
sense of 777 demand later in the decade as you're working through a lot of the negotiations on the combined orders for
300ERs and 777Xs. But do you expect to be able to maintain 300ER production rates through the decade? I mean could
you describe your strategy just for the bridge? And potentially any need you may have for discounting given the large

production quantities that are planned for the A350, the 787, and potentially the A330?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Doug, I'll take that one. I think based on the data we see we do have high confidence in
being able to maintain production rates up until the introduction of the 777X. There will obviously be some feathering
in at the transition point itself but by and large maintaining production rates.
Where do we get that confidence? It's in airplanes sold to date. It's in proposals accepted. It's in campaigns that are
ongoing today. Whereas in the case of ANA, we're selling both 777-300ERs as well as the new 777Xs. The
requirement versus the alternatives still is favorable.
I think you're right. There will be some pricing pressure associated with that that we've anticipated in the way we look
at this. Which is why the most aggressive productivity program we have right now in our factory is on the 777 model to
offset that and more.
But you have to remember the plane that essentially replaces the 777-300ER will be introduced after the first 777X.
The first 777X is a 467-passenger model. The 777-8X, which will be the one that directly replaces the 300ER, won't
come for a couple of years after that.
So there is plenty of running room where they can read the economics of the base 777 in conjunction with buying
777Xs. So it looks good as we talk to our customers, and we do have a high degree of confidence in being able to do it.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: So when you look at 2017 and when things start to fall off, at least when we look at firm
orders, are you already pretty comfortable with the discussions you're having that you can go out into 2018 for
example? Or maybe even a little longer and keep this up?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. I mean the pipeline gives us comfort. And these are real discussions with – you
have to remember the 777 customer base is one of the biggest and most loyal customer bases that we have. And so this
is not discussions that are just happening in a vacuum. These are with people who have both additional 777 needs in the
medium term. And then longer term would need the new model to significantly increase performance and productivity
for themselves.
And there's a large overhang of options. There's a large overhang of other forms of commitments that give us comfort
that this will happen. And there is almost 10 years from now until when the replacement model will be introduced. So

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Just on the back to the 787, thinking through the next couple years, your rate is going to be
flat at 10 a month. But you're going to have a mix shift though from 787-8s to 787-9s. And so 787-8s are actually going
to come down in rate, while the 787-9s are coming up. Your margins are higher right now, where your cash burn is
lower per unit by far on 787-8s. But there's a lot of moving parts here as we think about the deferred profile.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: The question is on the 787-9, when do the margins or the cash, the unit margins on 787-9s get
better than they are on 787-8s?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Certainly when you look at the mix there's still going to be a lot of 787-8s. And that will be
the predominance of the deliveries for the next little while here, next couple years really, they'll still be dominated by
787-8.
So we're obviously still expecting improvement on the 787-9. And as I mentioned, Joe, even on the first six units we're
seeing the unit costs coming down. So we've anticipated that in the current booking rate.
But I think mix really starts to come into play when you get much further out in the blocks and when you see the mix of
787-10, 787-9, and 787-8s in there. I think you're still going to see some as we move further into the skyline. You're
going to see more people converting from 787-8s to 787-9s, and potentially 787-9s to 787-10s, just because it fulfills
their mission more efficiently. So that mix again will have more impact later in the blocks than near term.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Can you compare the 787-9 to the 787-8 in terms of just early learning here? What you're
seeing? I mean you've given us a few different numbers.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: But it's hard to string them all together. Just compare and contrast a little bit?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. I mean it's very hard obviously to compare the first 787-8s to the first 787-9s,
considering where we are. But I'd say they're coming down the learning curve as we would expect them to. So I think
they're making good progress.
At the same time they're incorporating production efficiencies that we've realized on the 787-8. They're getting into the
787-9. And also working anywhere where they had opportunity to work, any commonality on manufacturing process
and so on.
So again hard to compare tail number to tail number at this point, because it's so early on in the program. But we're
seeing the improvement that we'd expect there. Certainly got more work to do but off to a good start.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thank you.

We'll go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Carter.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a quick clarification on a disclosure and a question. Greg, with respect to the unit versus
program differences, which were $1.8 billion versus the $1.5 billion in deferred production on the 787.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I wondered if you could tell us what program that pertained to. And then additionally as a
question, I just wanted to address kind of BCA absolute profit dollars and the guidance. It looks like if you look at what
you did in op profit in the first quarter and where the guidance is for BCA for the year in absolute dollars, on a kind of
run rate basis, it would imply that the op profit is down in the remaining three quarters, despite the fact that the
deliveries will be up, and even on some profitable platforms like the 737, not just the 787. So I wondered if you could

help reconcile that and tell us how to think about what might be driving that, or whether you've got some conservatism
in there.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure. To start with the first, on a unit versus program, almost 85% of that was 787. So as
you look at it, Carter, you will see unit improvement quarter-over-quarter there. And I always got to caution you a bit,
that's not, may not be the case every time, because of the mix of deliveries through EMC, Charleston, and 787-9s now
and Everett. But again we're seeing the right level of improvement unit-over-unit there. So continue to focus in that
area.
On the guidance, certainly off to a good start early. There's a lot of things obviously we got to work through the balance
of the year. I think we got good plans in place to do that. We are making in some investments, continuing to make
investments in efficiency in the production system. So you'll see some of those investments be hitting more later in the
year that we'll certainly benefit from, from years to come that we don't have early on. And then some mix and volume
differences between what we're seeing in the services business in the first quarter through the balance.
So look, we're going to continue to focus on execution, continue to focus on productivity. And if we continue to do
that, we'll update you going forward. But we're obviously focused on like I said those basic elements to continue to
drive the production system and capture as much of the efficiencies as we can.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: So on that unit versus program number, there wasn't a negative delta of any significance for
any of the other programs?

Our next question is from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Sam. Morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: If I looked, it looks like starting in 2014, a significant portion of long-term incentive comp
now seems to be tied directly to total shareholder return. So I guess I'm just trying to think about, what does that make
you do differently? How does that make you think about M&A, the returning 80%, 85% of cash to shareholders, and
even dipping further into the cash balance? How do you get that stock to move the way you want it?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well I don't think the incentive program is designed to change behavior. I think it's
designed to reinforce the behavior that I think we've been talking about, which is the balance, innovation, productivity,
customer satisfaction, and shareholder returns. I wouldn't characterize it as a seismic shift in our program. We've
moved more of it toward what you would refer to as performance-based pay, where there is a TSR measurement that
keeps us focused on our relative stock price, which is sort of the expression of all those things. And so we're just trying
to tighten up and focus our management on the things that are important. We're not trying to say different things are
important.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And if I can follow that up.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Just I mean based on your buyback pace in the first quarter, it seems like with the dividend,
you'll already have returned 85% of your free cash this year to shareholders. Can we expect to see that going up?

Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I have a two part question, maybe half for Jim and half for Greg. To
go back to your end of your opening comments about improved labor stability and more manageable benefit costs
going forward, how does that cause you to think about make versus buy, comparing market-based rates versus what
you can potentially do internally? And then I have a follow-up to that.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well I'll swing at that one, Howard. I mean I think it's a very important point you're
raising with that question. I think we have a highly valued workforce, a number of whom are unionized. We now have
a much more stable, visible set of outcomes in front of us with them. And which I do think coming out of an era where
we may have on the margin relied too much on some outside work. I think this gives us the option where it's smart to
do some of the work inside. And I'm not trying to imply a big seismic shift. I'm trying to say it gives us the option.
And given that it's a highly valued workforce that has some new economics associated with it, which is what we
accomplished with the agreements, I think it gives us the option to use the best mix of inside/outside toward the end of
delivering reliably on time, highly valued products to our customers. So I think it's another arrow in the quiver as we
strive to remain the world's best aerospace company.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then to follow that up. I mean if I add back R&D in the quarter to the operating margins
at Commercial and compare it with a year ago, and maybe even adjust for seven, eight deliveries where there were 18
versus one. We are on the order of almost a 500 basis point improvement in profitability, Greg. I mean is there one or
two things that you can point to? I mean this did absorb some of the changes in the benefit cost, so it's a pretty notable
statement.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. No. Howard, I'd say predominately improved performance on 737 and 777 I'd say were
the biggest drivers in there. But as I mentioned earlier and Jim has mentioned many times, we're really focused on
productivity across all cost elements, certainly continuing to work partnering for success. But at the same time
challenging ourselves internally on all forms of cost, period costs, productivity.
And the 777 is a great example, right? 8,000 airplanes, best-selling aircraft ever, and we're still able to capture
additional productivity gains there. And so it's a great testament to the teams focused on that. And that's really where
you're seeing the improvement. And obviously we're staying focused on that to continue to improve that going forward
on all programs.

<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yes hey. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Maybe just changing gears a little bit to the Military side of the business. When you think
about the BMA portfolio and South Korea's decision and then the Brazilians' decision to buy Gripen, C-17 winding
down. You've got tanker, you've got P-8.
Jim, can you tell us I mean what's your broad strategy on that portfolio? And how do you sustain it? I mean I hear you
that the Navy wants some F-18Gs to get put back in the budget. But and that probably will would be my guess. But it's
a fight now, right? I mean it seems like it's a bigger fight now to keep those programs alive than it was before. And how
do you think about that down the road?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. I mean there's no question that the budget discussion is getting more difficult. And
so every program is fighting for inclusion. We're fortunate that a lot of our programs are in the budget come hell or
high water.
But you do point out correctly that there's some moving pieces that we're going to have to manage. And I suspect that
F-18 line will remain open due to some possible orders from the U.S. government, which you characterize as probable.
I would tend to agree. But we'll see. There's a number of international campaigns that will supplement that.
But C-17 is going away. Tanker and P-8 will more than replace the C-17 when you look at the longer term. And there
are some other big programs that are high priority for our country, Long Range Strike, UCLASS, T-X Trainer that I
think will survive any budget scenario. And Boeing is very well-positioned on all three of those. Will we win all three
of them? Hard to predict.
But winning one or two of them keeps the business intact and the industrial base intact, even in a scenario where the
fighters are winding down. Remember the helos are growing and in high demand around the world. The satellites are
growing in high demand around the world. Space is growing. We've got the major program there on SLS.
So the core is growing. The stuff that's immediately going away is being replaced by more than it represents today. And
the longer-range programs, a betting man would say will more than replace some of the tactical air pressure that we
would see in the medium term.
So the whole equation, near-term flat, longer-term slow growth, and very responsible management of margins all the
way along. That's the role of that business in our portfolio.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: And may I ask a follow on to that?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure. Sure.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yes. So when you think about that business are there any – when we think about capital to
deployment, I mean is there anything in that Military portfolio or areas in that Military portfolio that you'd like to add
onto from an M&A perspective? Maybe bolt-ons? Or when you think about capital to deployment into the Military
business...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: How do you think about investing in growth?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think about it in two dimensions. Smaller bolt-on deals that provide vertical strength.
And that's ISR, that's Cyber, that's all the things that make platforms stronger or make networks more secure. They're
either part of a platform we sell or something we can sell on its own with vertical strength. And then Services
capability, we have by far the largest base out there as you know. You've heard me say it. We have a very large
Services business. I think the Services business can even get bigger.
And of course international. You don't want leave international out of the discussion, because Boeing has a unique
advantage. We have a unique industrial base and engineering base around the world and affiliations because of our

Commercial business, which is a leverageable thing when we start offset programs in support of Military business.
So capital in support of those initiatives on top of what I mentioned before, which is more of a portfolio of products, I

environment.

Our next question is from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Great. Thank you for taking my question.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure. Sure.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: I was hoping the team could give an update on Partnering for Success. I think the analyst
community sort of realizes this is a big opportunity but has a lot of trouble translating it into the model. Is there
anything that you could offer in terms of the percentage of contracts that have been successfully negotiated? Have they
been negotiated on track? What on track means? And any other granularity you're willing to offer?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. I mean again our assumption is a more-for-less world over the next couple of
decades. Okay? And the Partnering for Success program offers a win-win to the suppliers that we do business with.
And as I've characterized it before, we're in the early innings of this game. And I would say 25% to 30% of our base
has reached some form of agreement with us on how to go forward. I'd say another third we're in deep discussions.
We're close to coming to some agreements, which are characterized by mutual benefit. I mean this is not just we want
your margin and be nice to us from now on. This is a broader business arrangement that does reflect the more-for-less
world that I see out in front of Boeing.
And so these arrangements often do have price reductions associated with them, significant price reductions associated
with them, but also have benefits to our partners. And so we have already baked in substantial money into our EACs
based on the agreements we've reached so far. Now look this isn't pure gravy. I mean the reason we're doing this is we
have a world out there that is putting price pressure on us, that is putting cash pressure on us. And we're trying to
respond to that.
And so you see our margins sort of steadily improving. That remains our objective. And by the way we're working as
hard on our internal costs if not harder than we're working on costs in our supply base. I mean I feel quite proud and
credible standing in front of the supply base and telling them that I expect the same from them that I'm expecting from
my team.
And so this is not a zero-sum game. This is a how do we win together game. And the financial impact of improvements
we make in our business relationships will increase over time over the next decade, because a lot of these arrangements
involve technology and procurement for things that will flow out and are growing over the next decade. That's when
you'll begin to see the impact. But it's already in the order of billions of dollars over a medium and long term, and
there's more where that came from.

one of the BDS businesses, Global Services & Support.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: You've had nice margin performance there for the last several years. And yet what you're
suggesting over the next couple of quarters is a deceleration in the margin outlook. I was wondering if you could just
talk a little bit about the dynamic that might be going on there to help us understand why we would see a deceleration
of margins there?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. Well I mean, Jason, as you know especially when it comes to Services and the
thousands of contracts that exist in any Services organization, mix really comes into play here. So we're not
anticipating any performance degradation at all. It's just purely mix quarter-over-quarter or through the balance of the
year that is driving that.
But at the same time very focused on performance. There's no question there's DOD budget pressure that's out there
that we continue to face day-in and day-out and manage our way through that. But again the team is focused on
executing flawlessly on the contracts they have and focused on productivity through the Partner for Success and the
market-based affordability initiatives that Jim described. So I wouldn't read any more into that other than what I just

going to continue, whether they were on board or not.

As you kind of look at the current state of both your supplier management organization with a new leader there and
also getting companies like Spirit to form up a final long-term contract, as well as the absence this time with the
Japanese as far as their role in the 777X, how do you see the relationship with those key players moving forward in the
context of Partner for Success? And whether or not there is room to essentially maneuver to get the kind of cost-cutting
that you guys are looking for on both sides?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think I would characterize the progress as good so far. I think we are finding deals that
have mutual benefit, a significant benefit for our customers and us, as well as benefit for our partners. And it sometimes
takes time to find that, to find those deals.
And as you've noted there has been a couple of events along the way that do reflect the seriousness of the discussions.
But we're making good progress. And the beneficiary of progress here will be the customers of Boeing and the
employees of Boeing, because it's going to create a stronger company.
And so I feel good about the progress, while still at the same time recognizing that the discussions are not always easy.
They are difficult. But Boeing's, the ultimate strength we have here is that Boeing's prospective success is based on our
product lines and our people, something that people want to be part of. And so ultimately that's what's bringing people
together.

have engineering talent around the company that is extraordinary. And where we place work, there is a tension between
engineering work being done right next to the product on one hand, and on the other doing it in the place that has the
best engineers for the task at hand or so-called centers of excellence. And there will always be a balance there.
And what we're trying to do is achieve the right balance between centers of excellence and proximity that leaves us
with the strongest company that will take us from the $50 billion in sales we were a decade ago to the numbers that are
much bigger than that that we're headed toward. And so it's an equation that we're balancing all the time. And what I do
know is it will mean that we will not only be St. Louis-centric for certain kinds of engineers or Seattle-centric for other
kinds of engineers or Huntsville-centric for other kinds of engineers. It'll be a blend all in the name of creating the

Our next question is from Dominic Gates, Seattle Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Good morning, Jim.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Dominic.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Hi. I'd actually like to follow up on Al's question.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: About the transfer of engineering work, because it is on top of mind with people here. If we
look at something like the BR&T shift to St. Louis, Charleston, Huntsville, out of Puget Sound, whatever the business
and strategic rationale, seems like there are two possible negative impacts. One is that there's, because the growth
elsewhere is less than the jobs eliminated here, there's a net reduction in engineering positions. And then secondly,
there's a terrible hit to morale among the engineers here, not just the ones who are now tagged for moving, but
everybody else here. So how do you address this concern about losing capability and the hit to morale among your
workforce here?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well in the minds of most of us, these moves strengthen our company, strengthen our
engineering capability. These are not designed in any way, shape or form to weaken our company. It's this tension
between proximity and centers of excellence that I mentioned in answering Al's question that we're trying to balance.
Listen, I realize that moving work around a very large corporation can be controversial at the local level. I understand
that. But I think that we eventually have to come together as a team and keep making progress. This company is
making progress. And I think as we see further success in the future, we'll fight through the dislocations that happened,
not only in Seattle but in a lot of other places around Boeing as we try to optimize the right work placement for our
engineering capability. So we'll keep working it.

Next we'll go to Steve Wilhelm with the Puget Sound Business Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Hi, Jim. Thanks for taking this moment.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: I wondered if you could talk a little bit about in terms of the 777X assembly, what kind of
robotization and automation are you planning both in terms of the wing assembly but also final assembly? And how is
that going to look different from the current system?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well we're always trying to improve our manufacturing processes. And a lot of our
advance work is looking at some different forms of automation. And we have not yet made the decision which

specifically to deploy where and when. But you will continue to see us make progress on productivity and automation
beyond where we are today, will play a role. And it's very important that we do that to maintain our competitiveness.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator. We have time for one last question from the media.
Operator
And that'll be from Dan Catchpole with The Everett Herald. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan Catchpole>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<Q - Dan Catchpole>: I was wondering if you could talk about the water quality rule that Washington is considering?
The company has raised its concerns with the state that it could affect the company's future in the state. I was
wondering if you could put any finer point on that? And give us any idea of what your concerns are about some of the
possible unintended consequences of a stricter rule?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Listen, I think this is one where we have been working very closely with the legislative
and political leadership in the State of Washington. We're very sensitive to both sides of this question. Obviously we
want to find our way through this issue in a way that allows us to keep developing and manufacturing the world's best
airplanes, but still be sensitive to some of the local sensitivities. I'm highly confident that we can find a solution here.
