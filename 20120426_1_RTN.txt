William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone.
Raytheon's off to a good start in 2012. First-quarter sales, adjusted margins, EPS, and cash flow were all ahead of
expectation. Our continued solid operating performance was once again driven by our strong execution. As a result of
this performance, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year. Overall, I'm pleased with how the company is operating.
We remain focused on delivering the best value across our broad portfolio of programs and technologies, and we're
well aligned with our customers' evolving requirements. We are adapting our proven technologies for new and
innovative applications.
As an example of how Raytheon is able to leverage cost-effective solutions that can be brought to the market quickly is
a recent contract we won to develop the Accelerated Improved Intercept Initiative or, as we call it, AI3. This system
will detect and destroy incoming rockets fired at forward-deployed forces, and it adapts Raytheon's proven missile and
sensor technologies for a new application in a rapid fashion.
Another example is our Multi-Functional Radiofrequency System radar, which we affectionately call MFRFS. This
system was originally developed as part of the Army's Future Combat System program. Now in response to an urgent
operational need, we received an award to develop a Ku Band version to help better detect rocket, artillery, and mortar
threats. Both of these are truly life-saving capabilities for our men and women in uniform.
On a different note, given the ever-evolving nature of technology, our ability to develop innovative
counter-technologies remains key to keeping our defense capabilities on the cutting edge. Part of our strategy is
continue to invest and develop new capabilities for cybersecurity and electronic warfare applications that are aligned
with our customers' requirements. We're doing all of this while at the same time continuing to improve our operating
efficiency.
As many of you are aware, an advantage for Raytheon is our strong position in global markets. Our international
business represented 25% of our total sales and 27% of our bookings in the quarter. Emerging threats are driving
demand for our products around the globe, in particular the Middle East and Asia and Pacific regions. Our
opportunities range from large integrated air and missile defense systems, to precision weapons and missiles, to
Intelligence and Information Systems, and to a wide variety of ISR solutions for both military and civil markets. In the
quarter, we have strong classified bookings, which represented 26% of the total bookings. This is yet another example
of how the diversity of Raytheon's portfolio contributes to our overall success.
For the company, total backlog was up approximately $600 million year over year. And on a funded basis, our backlog
is up over $500 million from the end of 2011 and up approximately $1.2 billion from the same period last year. Overall
bookings in the quarter were in line with what we had expected. This follows a very strong fourth quarter, where we
had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11. As we mentioned in our last call, we expect booking in the back half of the year to be
better than the first half.
Last month we announced a 16% increase in our dividend per share. This is the eighth consecutive year in which we
increased our dividend and is a contributor of our overall balanced capital deployment strategy, and reflects our
confidence in our cash generation potential and the strength of our overall financial portfolio.
From a broader perspective, we recognize that the prospect of sequestration continues to affect the visibility of the
longer-term DoD budget outlook. The risk associated with implementing this legislation have been well articulated by
DoD leadership and by many on the Hill. Whether or not it ultimately occurs won't be determined today. The debate's
not settled, and it'll likely continue through the year. Given that backdrop, we're focused on the things we can control,
and we're managing the business to maximize value for all our stakeholders. Whatever the environment, and if one
looks back at our track record of financial performance, you can be assured that this is what we'll continue to do.

More recently, a key driver of our performance has been our supply chain initiative. About a year and a half ago, we
started talking about our strategic sourcing and centralized procurement efforts. We're now taking the next step, which
is to optimize subcontractor management, which should allow us to drive further improvements over time.
Before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to talk about the company's sustainability effort, with Earth Day having been on
Sunday. For us, sustainability is part of our DNA. Focusing on sustainability is not only the right thing to do, it also has
a positive impact on our bottom line. We've worked hard to improve our performance in this area, and our efforts are
yielding results. Since 2008, we've reduced our water consumption by 21%, our greenhouse emissions by 16%, and our
energy consumption by 9%. We're proud of these results, but we're not stopping here. Our goal is to continuously
improve in this area and further reduce our environmental footprint. As I mentioned before, we finished last year with
the best safety record in the company's history. Through our best-in-class programs, we lead our industry in workplace
safety.
I'm pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. The Raytheon team continues to work diligently to deliver
outstanding products to our customers and to deliver value to our shareholders. I'd like to thank the team for their
efforts and continued dedication.
And with that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to some
questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.
So if everyone would please move to page three. As Bill noted, we were pleased with the solid performance in the first
quarter. And once again, both international booking and international sales were strong. Our adjusted EPS of $1.46 was
up 7%, driven by capital deployment actions and continued operational improvements.
Adjusted operating margin was 13.1%, up 60 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Sales of $5.9 billion
exceeded the high end of our expectations, which I'll discuss further in just a moment. Operating cash flow from
continuing operations of $111 million was better than our prior guidance due to the timing of collections previously
expected in the second quarter.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 7.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million. In addition, our
board of directors approved an increase to the company's annual dividend rate by 16% to $2 per share. We've now
increased the dividend for eight consecutive years. Our full-year 2012 guidance for EPS has now increased by $0.10,
which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.
Turning now to page four, let me start by providing some color on our first quarter results. Our total bookings for the
quarter were $5.2 billion. As I mentioned on the January call, we continue to see the order book back-end loaded,
ramping up in midyear. From a cadence standpoint, we expect the book-to-bill to expand as we move through the year,
resulting in an estimated full-year book-to-bill range of between roughly 1 and 1.05 times. Notable bookings in the first
quarter included $182 million at IDS to provide Patriot engineering services for the U.S. and international customers
and $90 million to provide engineering services, production, and support for the Aegis weapons system for the U.S.
Navy.
Missile Systems booked $497 million for the newest version of the AMRAAM missile for the U.S. Air Force and
international customers. MS also booked $172 million for the AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile for the
U.S. Navy and international customers, and $171 million for the development of SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency.
NCS booked $81 million on the Navy Multiband Terminal Program. Space and Airborne Systems booked $159 million
to supply radar spare parts on the APG-63 for an international customer, $99 million on a radar performance-based
logistics contract for international customers, and $77 million for the production of radar warning receivers for the U.S.
Navy. Technical Services booked $119 million for foreign training and $68 million for domestic training programs in

support of the Warfighter FOCUS Program. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $284 million and $925 million,
respectively, on a number of classified programs.
Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.3 billion, compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2011. Our backlog at
the end of the first quarter 2012 was approximately $600 million higher than the same period last year. And as Bill just
mentioned, on a funded basis, our backlog was up over $500 million from the end of 2011 and up approximately $1.2
billion from the same period last year.
If you move to page five, sales were ahead of expectations, driven by international customer demand. Looking at sales
by business, five of the six businesses had sales essentially in line with the same period last year. NCS had net sales of
$1 billion, in line with our expectations. The change in net sales was primarily due to the planned decline in production
of U.S. Army programs.
Moving ahead to page six, we're pleased by our overall company margin performance, once again showing
year-over-year increase, driven by operational improvements. Our adjusted margin was up 60 basis points to 13.1%.
Our focus on execution, productivity, and efficiency across the board continues to be reflected in our financial results.
So looking at the business margins, IDS, IIS, MS, and SAS margins were up in the quarter compared with the same
period last year. At IIS, margins were up 120 basis points over last year's first quarter, excluding the UKBA letters of
credit adjustment. I do want to point out that IIS also benefited from $8 million related to an insurance recovery for
legal expenses. At NCS, the change in operating margin in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of
2011 was primarily due to the production program efficiencies last year. And at Technical Services, several minor
favorable items in the same period last year drove the difference in operating income and margin. These included a
contract modification, contract extension, and a legal settlement. Overall, the company continues to perform well.
So turning to page seven, first quarter 2012 adjusted EPS was $1.46, up 7%. The increase was driven by capital
deployment actions, specifically share repurchases, and operational improvements, partially offset by a higher tax rate
due to the expiration of the R&D credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit is not included in our guidance this year.
On page eight, you'll note that we raised our full-year 2012 EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of between $5 and $5.15,
and on an adjusted basis to a range of between $5.55 and $5.70. I'd like to point out that the increase was primarily
driven by operational improvements. We repurchased 7.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the
quarter. We expect the quarterly repurchase amount to moderate for the balance of the year, which is reflected in our
share count guidance.
And as you can see on page nine, we've included the change in our guidance by business. The increase in margin
guidance reflects the results from our continued efforts on productivity and efficiency initiatives. Importantly, we
continue to pass along substantial savings to our customers.
On page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings
per share, and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2012.
We saw good performance in the first quarter compared to both Q1 2011 and also the initial outlook for Q1 2012 that
we provided in January. To put this in perspective, we were able to implement improved productivity and efficiency
initiatives, along with accelerated volume tied to customer demands on a number of programs. This resulted in an
improvement in our performance and our outlook.
Okay. So now let me summarize our overall performance in the first quarter. While the environment remains
challenging, we had solid sales and strong margins, EPS, and cash flow. As we stand back and look over the last four
quarters, there are several items I think are that important to highlight. Our bookings have been strong, with a
trailing-12-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.08 times. Our operational performance has also been strong, with adjusted
margin exceeding 13% over that same time period. We're in a good financial position, with net debt of just over $1
billion. We raised our dividend 16% in the first quarter and are raising our EPS guidance for 2012. We remain well
positioned in key areas and are aligned with the priorities of our global customers. And we continue to drive the
business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, Dave, I was wondering if you could just walk through the rest of the year and the
cadence, and maybe offer us some qualitative comment around why we're seeing a bit of a degradation in both
revenues and earnings relative to the guidance that you gave earlier this year. Is it just a bit of conservatism based on
the environment that we're in today?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, we are feeling very positive about the results in the first quarter. From a sales
standpoint, we exceeded our initial guidance by about $200 million, and that was primarily driven by increased
customer demand for certain of our programs. You'll recall that at the end of last year, we received some large
international air and missile defense programs, and we're off to a good start in that area.
Let me just kind of put things in perspective. So if you look back, 2011 was a strong year, and we discussed in January
the results of last year. We expected margins to moderate in 2012. Q1 came in stronger than we expected. This was
partially due to some timing and a few small, nonrecurring items. Without these items, we're still posting margins in the
high 12% range.
I'll repeat some of what I went through a few months back that I mentioned on the fourth quarter call. There is a shift in
our backlog and our sales profile this year versus last year, and it's weighted more toward international customers. And
within the international business, we're also seeing mix impacts driven by the stage of maturity of some of these
programs. Like I just said, we won some large programs at the end of last year. These are longer in duration and slower
to ramp up than typical domestic awards of similar size. So we're being impacted by mix in 2012, along with the
continued completions and wind-down of some later-stage production programs in our domestic backlog.
So with all that said, we are accelerating the ramp-up of some programs, and this is resulting in a shift in our sales
cadence compared to prior guidance, as well as some efficiencies from a margin standpoint, in particular at IDS.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, gentlemen, and good quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I had two bigger-picture questions, one for each of you. Dave, I wondered if you might speak
to some of the things you and your peers, and for that matter, the DoD customer, might begin doing, the sort of
contingency planning exercise for the sort of looming wall of sequestration. I'm sort of interested in things around
workforce planning, cash management, contracting. What sorts of things are you guys envisioning as having to do from

a contingency planning standpoint as this gets closer and we sort of progress through the year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So I'll start, and I'm sure Bill wants to mention a few things. We've talked about this on the
last couple of earnings calls. First of all, we've gone through a number of different planning scenarios, and I think the
best way for me to put this is we are prepared to operate effectively under any given industry conditions. So without
getting specific because at this stage it's inappropriate, just given where we are and all the discussions taking place in
Washington, we are confident that we'll continue to perform well irrespective of how this actually plays out.
It's important to keep in mind we have a very broad portfolio. Close to 40% of our backlog is international. That's
obviously, I think, an important differentiator and competitive advantage for the company. We have over 8,000
different programs and technologies, and we continue to manage the business in a very cost-effective manner. We've
talked about this in the past. We have – seven, eight years ago, we embarked on a strategic initiative to implement
companywide information technology systems from a factory standpoint, from an HR standpoint, from a supply chain
standpoint – excuse me – and from a people standpoint, so that gives us a platform to be very flexible irrespective of
how things play out. So..
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I think -
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Well, just to kind of expand on that, just in one area. As you think about cash management, is
it something where you'll want to preserve cash as we get later in the year and protect in case – should you decide to
self-fund some contracts? Or how should we think about cash management in the latter part of the year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Right. So we've provided our cash guidance. And, again, this was thoughtful and talked
about on the last call. From an environmental standpoint, not much has changed from the last call.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So we wouldn't expect any change from our capital deployment plan, all things considered.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. And one for Bill. Bill, I think there were something like six cyber-related bills making
their way around Congress this week, and I wondered if you might tell us what, if anything, this means for the future of
this domain from your perspective. I mean, does any of this legislation have a chance of passing, and if it did, does it
signal new areas of risk or opportunity or, if nothing else, more funding?
<A - William H. Swanson>: One, I think what I would say is it's a good, healthy debate that's taking place in the cyber
arena of what to go do. And for me, I always remember something that Secretary Gates had said that when he first went
into office, he really wanted to get a definition of what to go do in cyber. And some four years later plus, there still
wasn't direction of what to go do. And clearly, we now see some of that direction taking shape of who calls the ball and
what action to take, at least from what I'll call the sword aspect of cyber, which is the attack or counterattack.
And for me, it's taken a while for this to jell, but I'm encouraged that Congress is looking at it. They're having a debate.
They're talking to all aspects, whether it's Facebook or Twitter or the people from Google or Microsoft, and they're
talking to us, and they're trying to take responsible action. And the good news is there's attention to this problem. And
we need attention, and I think attention is healthy, and so I view it as positive.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I wanted to start with NCS. And we know that's where much of the Army exposure has been
and the supplemental exposure. I was wondering if we could step back and look at the sector today, where is today,
with the $1 billion of sales in the quarter, maybe the profile and how it's changed the last couple years and what you see
going forward.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Super. Thanks, Joe. While traditional sales of Army products have declined at NCS
consistent with the drawdown, I believe NCS is well positioned on our Army's new platforms, such as the Ground
Combat Vehicle, the modernization of their electro-optic sites. We're going from second gen to third gen on the
existing vehicles and fielding advanced battlefield radars and the new radars, which are really sense-and-warn radars
like MFRFS, which is important. And the MFRFS radar, for your benefit if you didn't know or if you do know I'll just
repeat it, is that radar is really the primary sensor to help execute the army's new Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar,
C-RAM, mission. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the AI3 program, that particular missile uses a MFRFS radar to
help it in the counterattack. So we look at that part of the business, as the Army transitions, we're going to transition
with them.
The next area where NCS works in is in the satellite terminal business. There, the Army's SMART-T program has been
on track, and we're ramping up deliveries. The Navy's Multiband Terminal program has been awarded the production,
and that's starting to ramp up for us. And of course the Air Force's MMPU program positions us well in the satellite
terminal business, and we see NCS positioned well where others have ran into trouble in that area. We've just recently
completed our NATO Air Command and Control System – we call it ACCS – which is the largest software program of
its type in the world. And we just got awarded an initial Q1 award to add missile defense capabilities for NATO into
that. So that bodes well for Europe and our systems there.
And then recently, as you probably know, the U.S. government decided to pursue alternatives to JTRS, the Ground
Mobile Radar (sic) [Radio] (28:47) and Airborne & Maritime/Fixed radios, and that's created a real opportunity for us
in our ARC-231 radios and our MAINGATE, Mobile Ad-hoc Networking radio (sic) [Interoperability Networking]
(29:00) GATEway. For us, we believe in the future here one of the discriminators is passing full video across the
battlefield and supporting large node networks, and none of the current JTRS radios can do that, but MAINGATE's
able to do it. And then the other thing I would point out is NCS is one of our – they win most of the CRAD work within
the company.
So we see the transition that has taken place with the Army changing their focus, going more to smaller and on the run,
and NCS is adapting with them. And we see the back half of the year being where that starts to change. So everything's
kind of consistent with what we saw in the transition, and they've been performing well from an operational point and
doing that with no surprises. If that helps.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Would you say that we're much of the way through that transition? This was close to a $5
billion business a couple years ago. Obviously the war spending was a big part of that. Margins were over 14%. So
margins come down as you shift toward some of the newer programs. The sales are coming off. But are we in the
fourth inning or the eighth inning, if we – over a multiyear period of time?
<A - William H. Swanson>: We're probably in about the sixth or seventh inning in that. Probably standing up and
looking at where we're out. We expect some awards here in the second and third quarter, which bode well for them, as
they start to do it. So everything's consistent. We went through this – if you'll remember, because you've follow us long
enough – RTSC transitioned through one of these and came out of it very strong, and we expect the same thing for
NCS. And that's the nature of our portfolio. You look at it. We'd love for everything to be hitting on all eight cylinders,
but that doesn't happen all the time. So what you have are other businesses that carry the load, and – as you adjust, and
that's why we love our portfolio.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Just a quick one for Dave, if I might on IDS. We've had three really solid margin
quarters now in a row, 17%, 18%. You boosted your guidance, but it's still below where you've been the last three
quarters. I'm sure there's been some risk reduction there. Can you just give us a sense as to whether those contracts that
you've been booking the positive adjustments, are those falling off now, or is there still more opportunity the next
couple quarters?

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, that business is performing well. It is the business that it focuses on the larger radars
and the air and missile defense systems. I'll repeat what I said a little bit earlier. They were able to secure some large
awards, both domestically and internationally, at the end of last year. The team over there continues to focus on the
productivity side and on the cost-efficiency side. They have posted, I would say, very strong results. We were very
pleased with how the first quarter played out. Some of this was due to timing, the timing of some of the productivity
initiatives being pulled ahead to the first quarter that were anticipated later in the year. But with that said, I would
suggest the higher end of the margin range is probably the appropriate way to think about IDS for the balance of the
year.

Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Actually, I guess, Dave, I wanted to just follow up on that last comment, what you just –
relative to January, a lot of improvement in terms of the margin outlook for the different segments, and it may only be
20 basis points here and there. But can you talk about things that you had been worried about that you've retired in
terms of risk, and why things would've changed so much in just a couple months?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, we had strong results in the fourth quarter of last year, as I'm sure you recall. And
there is a broad, companywide focus on execution and on – again, I'll repeat it – the productivity initiatives. And we are
seeing some strong and positive results as a result of this focus by all areas of the company. Supply chain is doing an
outstanding job and has implemented a number of new initiatives, both with respect to material procurement and
subcontractor management, and we continued to take costs out of our G&A and general overhead structure. And this is
resulting in a margin profile that is slightly exceeding what we had initially anticipated. As we move further along with
some of these programs and we're off to a good start and solid launches, we're able to retire some early program risk,
but by and large, it's around the execution side from a productivity standpoint.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And then you mentioned in one of your earlier comments about some one-time items that did
help. Can you quantify the insurance recovery in IIS, and was there anything else that you would consider one-time?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So the IIS insurance recovery was about $8 million. It was worth about 100 basis
points to IIS. But let me make this point, because I think it's important. When you normalize IIS operations for the
letter of credit last year and the insurance recovery this year, they're up about 20 to 30 basis points operationally. From
a nonrecurring or one-time event standpoint, the only other item of note would be a consolidation of a couple of related
contracts in SAS, where we were able to realize some material and labor efficiencies. That was originally planned for
the second quarter. And we were able to effect that in the first quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Thank you.

<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Bill, the usual question I ask – I mean, can you give us the international sales growth in the
quarter, the classified sales growth, and then by deduction, how much the domestic, ex classified, changed?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Let me take a shot at the international. As I mentioned, 27% of the bookings were
international, and about 25% of the sales were there. We still think for the year that bookings are going to be around
30% plus or minus. Sales should be 26% plus or minus, and that'll probably – internationally, mid-single digit kind of
growth for us as we look at it. Classified, as I said, was strong for us, with 26% of the bookings. We expect classified to
be around 15% plus or minus a little bit there, which will be double-digit growth year over year. Sales will probably be
on the flattish side on the classified, but the pump is really getting primed here. So we'll feel better about 2013 as we
look at it and go into it. And so from our standpoint, the international is offsetting kind of the weakness that we see in
the domestic, which is kind of related to inflation being – the percentage of inflation taking it negative. It's kind of how
I look at it, if that helps.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah. So do I conclude that mid-single digit growth in international was for the quarter, as
well as what your expectation is for the year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So, George – this is Dave. So let me just get a little more specific – specific, sorry
about that. So sales overall were down about 2% quarter over quarter. Domestic – overall domestic was down about
3%. And foreign – or international – was up about 2%. Within the domestic, classified business was slightly less than
breakeven, so it was down about 1%; and all other domestic was about 3.5% down.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. That's good color, Dave. And then I just wanted to ask a more general one. I mean,
this is like the first quarter in a long time where you've actually been better than what your sales projection is. I guess
my question is, is that due to being overly conservative because of missing last year, or are things somewhat better so
that you're just still being conservative by not raising the sales guidance for the year? Or it's just the mix that you talked
about in your conversation?
<A - William H. Swanson>: That was a lot of questions, there, George. I think the easiest answer for us is we saw
strong demand, and we see some customers asking for things even earlier, so we have the ability to ramp that up. And I
think Dave covered that in his remarks. It's not about being conservative, it's just that there's some good demand for the
product.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bill, another high-level question if I may.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Sure.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: As we look forward, it seems like OSD is actually starting to think about the possibility of a
sequester. Sec. Def. Panetta talked about officially looking into it, preparing in the summer, but I suspect they're
starting to do that now. And even if we get a negotiation or decision from Congress in the lame-duck session, it may be
too late to avoid some impact to Q1. So on that basis, from what you're hearing about what's going on in D.C., do you
think that they're contemplating this across-the-board type scenario, or are they starting to compartmentalize areas of

focus?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I would tell you that, at least my views on the Hill, no one likes sequestration. No
has a plan that everyone likes to avoid it. So, therefore, I don't see anything happening till November. Come November,
everybody's got everything happening during their lame-duck session. I don't see the lame-duck session being able to
do everything that everybody's asking it to do, so we end up in the January timeframe much like you've just articulated.
And the one thing that we've got to think about is that this is not only defense, this is state and education and housing
and energy and their budgets get completely whacked, and so my view is that we're going into a holding period come
January, and then we're going to take a time-out for about 12 months to figure out what to go do. And the outcome is
not anything that anybody wants to live with.
The other part that I think we lose sight of is we're in an industry that does not change dramatically overnight. There are
– you have to look at companies' backlogs. You have to look at programs. And I don't see, and I've never heard
anybody talk about, a peanut-butter approach to this problem, that if they're going to solve it, they're going to have to
solve it with some very hard programmatic cuts, and they'll be after things that are large in nature, not across the board.
Because everyone is warned – or at least if you've been in business or been associated with our budgeting process – that
when you use the peanut butter, all you do is push the problem to the right, and the problem gets bigger. And I've been
encouraged that I have not heard that as a solution, if that helps.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. Well, and then for my follow-up, if we can just bring this now down to the Raytheon
level. When you take what you just said and then throw in the possibility of a fiscal 2013 CR in Q4, how would you
and/or Dave assess your risk essentially to the guidance by segment toward the end of the year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think the way I would answer your question is that CRs have become way of life. And
in our guidance, we have planned for what we think is what happened last year. You go down to the wire, and then
something happens, so that's kind of got to be the norm. Everyone I've to talked to on the Hill, no one wants to repeat
going all the way to April of the following year with a CR. I think everybody's experienced that pain and what that
causes. So I would tell you we're planning the kind of activity that we saw happen last year, and we put that into our
thinking caps and into our guidance as we look at it.
The other thing that I want to point out is you all know we're a process company. So we have plans in place if
something went up, if it stayed flat, and if it went down. And one of the things that I'm extremely proud of is our
workforce planning. It's something that we think is world-class, and it helps us be able to – Dave started to articulate
our IT systems, but the way I like to think of it is we can win it anywhere, we can perform it anywhere, and we can
deliver it anywhere. And that's how we've kind of set up the company to make sure during these headwinds you have
the flexibility and that you don't end up with your work in the wrong places. If that helps.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Bill, which segments have the greatest amount of variability, though, as this plays out?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Oh, boy. I don't know how you'd – if I thought about it, you have to look at the funded
backlog of each of them. And if you look at the international, those aren't affected by it. So you got to -
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Right.
<A - William H. Swanson>: – take out 26% or 30% of our business, and so it really makes it hard. I don't know how
to answer your question in that way, because what I'm now going to start speculating on is what programs get cut and
what don't, and that's really our proprietary information, I guess I'd say it.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah, and I think you need to consider the way the various customers are going to plan
through fiscal 2013 and beyond. So it's difficult to handicap which product areas are affected more than others or less
than others, because much of it will depend on the situation within that particular customer group.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And, Dave, I want to go back. We have the fiscal 2013 budget right now, today. There
were no surprises for us. We're not hearing anything that deviates from what we have in our plans. Our programs are
performing. And we've got to remember that ISREW, cyber, are areas where the Department is focused well on, and

there's not going to be changes there. And the other thing that happens is when something gets cut, there's still a need.
So something has to go back in its place. And a good example of that is when NLOS had its issues, Griffin now has
come back in and filled it. So it's not a static world, it's dynamic. And so when you look at what happens over in A, you
react in B.

Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Bill, you mentioned that 26% of bookings were classified. It seems really
high. So I'm just kind of curious, is that a monolithic one or two programs, or is this a release of classified bookings?
And then conversely, I guess, the implied non-classified domestic bookings looked – the run rate there looked to be
relatively light. Can you just talk about the two dynamics there? Maybe there was some sort of reclassification of
what's classified or not.
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, I think it's – and on the call in January, we talked about this being a year that was
back-end loaded. And so when you look at it, the back-end loaded is not only international, but it's also domestic. But
on the classified side, we had a few good programs that came in in the quarter that the timing of them is plus or minus a
month or two here or there, but they all stacked up, and they came in nicely, and they've primed the pump for a couple
of our businesses, really driven by SAS and IIS.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And then just a clarification on the international sales under sequestration, do you
actually have kind of full clarity that FMS sales won't essentially be handicapped by the fact that they have to go
through the DoD from a contracting perspective?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, I don't see that. I actually see good health from our DoD partners on the FMS side,
because you have to think about it in a way – for us, the FMS helps keep our rates in check and in control, because if
we can put these systems into our plants, they carry a burden of the overhead and help our domestic customers from a
rate point of view. So we've got sophisticated domestic customers that understand that. So it's in their best interest to
help us, say, on Patriot or our other programs that are FMS for us or in our missile programs, they help load our
factories and give us a good competitive advantage.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: I guess I was just thinking mechanically, that a lot of the contracts are going through
the same program offices, who are going to be under massive amounts of stress for various reasons. I was just curious –
but that you think that they'll be able to essentially prioritize to the FMS where the money is?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I do, because these things are not pop-ups. If you saw the planning that we go
through on, say, a TPY-2 radar sale to UAE, it's in conjunction not only with the country, but with the Missile Defense
Agency, with the State Department. There's a lot of coordination on that.
And you lay it out, so you look at your workflow and you determine your peaks and valleys. And we all try and work in
unison to understand that flow and give some insight on both sides. So I think this is where we've got a great working
relationship.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Okay, that helps. Thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bill, on the exports, I was wondering if you could give us any updates on the timing of some
of your larger awards, because sometimes these can move around? And whether you've seen any progress in the U.S.
regarding opening up more military products for export?
<A - William H. Swanson>: A two-part question. The international for us, the big ones still out there are, probably
second half, are Kuwait, relative to some new fire units for them. We expect here sometime in the third quarter and
fourth quarter on Turkey, on their decision. We've got ground-based air defense in Oman that will be in the last half of
the year. We've got Paveway awards throughout the year that represent $400 million to $500 million in business.
Air-traffic radars are $200 million to $300 million. They're sprinkled throughout the year. Missiles, we expect some
short-range missile sales, maybe in about the $600 million range mid – three quarters of the year. Training will happen
in the second half probably, say, $400 million. And then we've got some international C4I that we're hoping to bring in
this quarter. If not, it'll be the first part of Q3.
Relative to releasability, we see some attention there. It moves slowly, but I think as the domestic budget gets under
pressure, as I was just talking about a minute ago, we see – our customers view the international business as being good
for them, too, because it helps control the price or the cost of their programs that run through our factories. If that helps.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: That's great. Thanks much, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Dave, I want to go back to sort of your comments. You talk about
mix and performance as sort of being the driving factors pretty much across the board for all of the businesses, and Bill
talked a lot about mix. Could you talk about, again, some of the initiatives that you're undertaking and what it means
when you say productivity? Does that mean more outsourcing? Does it mean a change in the way you're speeding
processes? Could you elaborate a little bit? And what kind of a runway do you continue to see with these items?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. So obviously, Howard, it's a multitude of different areas, and I think a very good
question to put some color on this. There's the basics, such as looking at our G&A structure. We look at the travel and
outside services and the way we manage those types of areas and cost reduction opportunities from that standpoint. We
continue to expand our shared services activity and become more efficient on – or with respect to a number of what I
would term back-office activities. Much of this is underscored by our approach we take, which is – I spoke about this
earlier – which is driven by our Six Sigma approach. And these bear out continued results quarter over quarter and year
over year.
From a manufacturing standpoint, we continue to improve factory processes across the board through both Lean
initiatives as well as Six Sigma initiatives. Our touch labor continues to improve. I think the best way to look at this is
what we call our wrap rate, which is basically the overhead dollars that are applied to our products. We have essentially
held that flat, and in many areas decreased it for the last number of years, and we're seeing that trend continue as we go
into 2012 and 2013.
There is a meaningful amount of the cost structure that is tied to our materials base, both direct material, indirect
material, and subcontractors. We embarked on a number of initiatives a couple of years ago. They continue to bear out
fruit. I may have mentioned earlier that we've gone from roughly 30,000 suppliers a few years ago to about 12,000
suppliers today. And we continue to gain both quality and economic improvements from that initiative. We are now

working closely with our major and even our smaller subcontractors to take meaningful cost reduction and embark on
meaningful quality and delivery improvements. They're already doing a fine job, and we're suggesting that they begin
to implement the same type of initiatives that we did a number of years ago.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Dave, sort of – part of it's like the, for example, you're reducing the number of trailers that
supported the Patriot in the past. So there's a whole host of – might have been three trailers and now it's one. I mean,
and there's a number of things like that. Is that sort of also – which really is more engineering driven – is there a whole
initiative on that that continues as well?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Howard, let me jump in here. If you remember the old Patriot, we can basically get all of
those three trailers on one trailer now and have room left over. So one of the things that engineering does is the
tremendous job of taking technology and adapting it to make our products more affordable and more capable. I'd look
at a JSOW missile, for example. What we used to be able to do and what we do – we can adjust it in flight today and
have it communicate back awareness, and that never existed before. And you do it in the same airframe at a lower cost.
So, yeah, a lot of it has to do with the engineering productivity in our designs.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, gentlemen.
