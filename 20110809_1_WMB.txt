MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone, and welcome to The Williams Companies' Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference
Call.
At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Sharna Reingold, Director
of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Sharna Reingold
All right. Thank you and good morning. Welcome to The Williams second quarter 2011 earnings call. As always, thank
you for your interest in the company. As you know, we released our results on August 3rd after the market closed.
Yesterday, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, had some commentary about our results. This audio commentary
and slides are available on our website, williams.com, so we will not be reviewing our slides this morning.
In a minute, Alan will make some brief remarks and we will open the lines for questions. Please be aware that Don
Chappel, Ralph Hill, Rory Miller, and Randy Barnard all are available for any questions.
Please note that all the slides are available on our website, williams.com. There are forward-looking statements on slide
two and three and the disclaimer on oil and gas reserves on slide four of yesterday's presentation. They're important and
integral to the company, and you should review those slides. Also included in the presentation yesterday are various
non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to measures included in generally accepted accounting principles.
Those reconciliation schedules and related information are included in the slides available on our website,
williams.com.
With that, I'll turn it over to Alan.

Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you, Sharna and good morning. Thanks for joining us this morning in such a busy time in the markets.
We certainly did experience a great second quarter. Our adjusted earnings per share was up 39%. We are increasing our
full year earnings outlook based on the strength of the first and second quarter and all of our business segments
contributed to the gains that we had in this period
While all our business segments are performing very well and growing according to plan, we also continue to work
hard on restructurings at the corporate level to unlock value for our shareholders. As you're well aware, our WPX IPO,
which I'll comment on in just a moment, continues to move ahead, and we are moving to a growing dividend company
and expect that value to unlock significant shareholder value for WMB. Our WPZ holdings and our Canadian
Midstream Olefins give us a very clear line of sight to this sustainable growth for the WMB dividends for years to
come.
We continue to be very focused on maintaining our investment grade credit and maintaining a very conservative
approach to managing our margins within our WPZ segment, and this gives us a very clear growth trajectory and also
gives us a very clear backlog. We have a very clear backlog of the great projects and that we are very excited about our
future. So we've got a great situation as we sit here today. We also have great transparency about where our growth is
coming from. So we really continue to be very excited about how we are positioned today in these markets.
And so before taking your questions, though, I do want to briefly address our previously announced proposal to acquire
Southern Union Company. At this time, Williams continues to closely monitor the situation, and we are evaluating all
of our options. We won't have any further comments today regarding Southern Union or the agreement they have with
Energy Transfer.
I also have a few brief comments about our planned IPO WPX Energy. We are ready to go with the WPX Energy IPO,
so as soon as market conditions are cooperative we will be prepared to launch that. At this point we still plan to get the
IPO done in the third quarter and the full spin no later than first quarter of 2012.
So as a reminder, though, the purpose of our call today is to discuss our very strong financial and operational
performance in the second quarter and our new higher guidance for 2011. We intend to keep today's call focused on
those topics and so I appreciate your cooperation on that.
We can now open the call for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll take
our first question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Hey, Alan, appreciate those comments. Just a very quick
clarification, if I could, on the WPX IPO because you just said market conditions aren't cooperative. Does that mean
the SEC has declared it effective? I hadn't looked at that, but I just want to make sure that that's not the hold up, it's
now just more your decision of when to go?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, it is; it is just our decision on when we're ready to go, that is correct.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. The questions from the quarter, I guess, really were two-fold
really on the Canada and the olefin side. And I guess on the olefin side you had mentioned that it looks like we are
going forward with an expansion of Geismar, at least as far as some of the project capital that's now being put into the
guidance. And I was wondering if you could give us a better sense of how you're approaching risk management to that
kind of project with respect to ethylene prices going forward. Is part of doing this expansion an off-take agreement with

someone, or how should we think about risk management in terms of the Geismar expansion?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. I would just first say that, remember that on the ethane basis we're still long ethane as
Williams, and so that project actually gives us some hedge on the ethane pricing all the way through the ethylene
margin. So as we've said before, we're fairly confident in the gas to crude ratio remaining, and we're fairly confident in
ethane continuing to be a favored feedstock and ethylene continuing to have strength in the market.
What we're not so confident in is about who makes – who gets what cut of that pie. And so by having ourselves
positioned all the way between the gas all the way to the ethylene, we feel like we're de-risking some of those margins
and making sure that we're not getting somebody else stuck in between us and full margin spread there.
Having said that, we are talking to a number of parties about off-take agreements, and there is a lot of interest around
that kind of project. Rory, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, I think the other thing that I would say is there have been a lot of announced projects.
Probably they're not all going to get built, but a number of them can. And I think in terms of queue, in terms of when
this expansion can get placed, we think we're probably the next tranche capacity that can come into the market. So we
think the timing is right and that there's a window of opportunity for us ahead of the other announced projects.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: And Rory, I'm sorry, have you guys actually announced sort of either the magnitude or when the
expansion would be in service?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, we've not formally announced. I think Alan mentioned it in the call, prerecorded
comments, but it's about a 40% plus increase in the capacity there at Geismar. And we're shooting for sometime
probably late 2013 for in service. But as Alan mentioned, that would be going before the Board in September.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. And then last question if I could just on the Canadian side with the olefins and the
upgrader, that looks like more project capital is going to go into the upgraders as well. How should we – if in that table
we had the project capital, you guys also have been pretty good at laying out expected EBITDA and the like, obviously
it's a little premature at this stage. But should we be thinking about return potential in sort of the same ZIP code as say,
for instance, for the ethane recovery and kind of the five to six times EBITDA deployment or can you give us a better
sense of how we should be thinking about that deployed capital?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I think the returns on the new projects are going to be generally in that same ZIP
code as what we've seen so far.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Carl.
Operator
And next we'll go to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Good morning everybody.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: So I really appreciate that you can't really talk about the sub situation in your monitoring. I
wanted to offer, if I could, one very high level question. Do you feel – when will we expect possibly to hear something
timing wise or do you feel like you're up against the clock timing wise to either say we're involved or we're going to try
and do something or we're going to move on?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, Steve, as I've said we're certainly going to be a disciplined buyer and we certainly
have exciting prospects for growth and value creation in our existing strategy, in executing our existing strategy, and
our plan to separate off our E&P businesses as well. So as I mentioned earlier though, we're going to try to address in

this call the second quarter results and outlook and so we're not – it's hard to get into a conversation without wading
outside of the strict script on that, so...
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. No, I appreciate that. So maybe you can talk a little bit on just with the weakness
recently in oil prices and how should we be thinking about that impact on when would we maybe start to see switching
or moving away from use of ethane?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Don?
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Hello?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Sorry, Steve. I don't think we quite understood the basis of your question there.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Just wondering if we were going to start to see, with the weaker oil price environment,
from your vantage point in the midstreams are we going to start to see a move away from petrochemicals using ethane
as a feedstock. Have you started to get indications of that? How do you think about that over the next couple of
quarters?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I think we've got a long ways to go before we get into that territory. Remember gas
has moved down as well, and so I don't think we're anywhere near that kind of ratio that we would get to that. We have
seen situations where gas oil is at times pricing below ethane a little bit, but it's got a long ways to go. If people started
getting on that it would bring net price up pretty quickly as well. So I don't really see that in this, in the $80 price oil
environment and $4 gas, that's still a 20 ratio which used to be something that we wouldn't even dream of. And so I
think we're a long ways from getting to a point where ethane is not the favorite feedstock.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay. And then final question, can you just talk where right now over the next kind of
several quarters you see some of the bigger bottlenecks on the oil and liquid side as opportunities for you guys?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I do think there's a lot of emerging bottlenecks and we're seeing them in a lot of
different places. And I think there's a lot of infrastructure required in the field and we certainly have got our – have our
eye on some of that. And Ralph's team has certainly done a great job of getting their product moved out of the Bakken,
but as that field grows and we certainly think it will continue to grow, we think there's going to continue to be a lot of
need for long-term permanent infrastructure in those plays as well as on the propanes and heavies.
And just general petchem business in general there's a lot of shifting of volumes that is happening with this increased
volume on both the wide end NGLs, the heavy NGLs and the olefins products and so we are positioning ourselves to
play in what we think will be a big shift. One of those shifts, obviously, is Belvieu product to other locations like the
Mississippi River markets. And so we're certainly right in the middle of opportunities like that and continue to pursue
those.
<Q - Stephen J. Maresca>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Okay, great. Next we'll go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. Just going back to the Geismar question, I saw that you had signed an agreement with
Crosstex for some takeaways. Are you locking in any sort of feedstock cost there, or is that just more pipeline services
and frac and whatnot?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, that is obviously a confidential contract, but it is a way for us, we think, to get some
advantaged pricing in the river. Alan mentioned some of the bottlenecks out there. We think that that's going to be a
very valuable contract for us, particularly with our Geismar expansion.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then shifting over to the E&Ps, you said you had 70 a day I think that's waiting on
the Laser pipeline. What kind of exit rate are you thinking about in the Marcellus as we come out of 2011 and then

looking into 2012? I think you're going to run eight rigs in 2012?
<A>: I don't think we've given specific by area by basin yet, so I'm not sure if I'm – during this period, I'm sure I'm
allowed to do that. But clearly we have a substantial amount backed up in the Marcellus, and Laser's still going to come
on in September. We also have in the Westmoreland Clearfield Centre County areas there's a backup of about another
30 million. So I would need to check and see what we've given out publicly before I can do that. But we obviously have
said that in the future we expect the Marcellus to grow to be around 20% or so of our volumes as we move forward.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the Canadian side, you talked a little bit about the Sun
grader – the SunCore, excuse me, upgrader downtime; how much did that actually hurt you from a volume and a
margin perspective in the quarter?
<A>: Yeah, it was a pretty big blow from a volume perspective. The good news is the margins were so strong over that
period; net/net we were about even with what we've forecasted. So the strong margins definitely help there but there's
no doubt about it that it's hard to replace 49 days of production.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, that's helpful.
<A>: It's as simple as 49 days. We normally would see a couple of days of downtime so you really could call probably
less than about half from a volume standpoint.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, great. Thanks, that's it for me.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.
Operator
Okay, and next we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Hi, guys. I apologize I did not listen to the podcast with the craziness in the market yesterday
and I know you're probably going to talk about it on the WPC call, but can you talk a little bit about Atlantic Access
project? That looks like that's gearing up again. Can you talk about cost estimates, timing for an open season, little
more color on that project?
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Yeah, I'd be happy to. This is Randy Barnard with the Gas Pipes. We've been out in the
market surveying the interest in that project and are very encouraged by the recent visits. It's predominantly a
producer-driven project. It's evolving to recognize the differing geographies of the source or the supply. It's also
evolving to recognize the different timing of end service needs for the various potential shippers.
Bottom line is we think we could have a project to announce by Q4 of this year, open season within the next two to
three months, board outs expiring October for shippers and a month later for ourselves. Possible slippage into Q1 next
year, but it's very encouraging right now for a late this year announcement.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Any ballpark cost estimate?
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: It's in the neighborhood of $1.4 billion, but like I said it's evolving. We may phase the
project and there may be some telescope capacity so as we refine it those – that number could move. It's within – the
slide, once you get around looking at the slides that were placed up on our website, you will see that we have
categorized the potential opportunities at the gas pipelines at around $1.7 billion; $1.3 billion of investment and
guidance, $1.7 billion of possible and Atlantic Access is the lions share of that $1.7 billion.
<Q - Becca Followill>: Okay, I saw the ones over at the WPZ. And then, and is part of that a reversal of flow on
Transco? Just looking at the slides there's an arrow that points down.
<A - Randall Lee Barnard>: Well, actually not immediately. But as Marcellus grows a reversal of flow is truly within
the realm of the plumbing there. The growth we expect in Marcellus will outstrip the zone 6 demand eventually, so

physical back flows may happen. But what Atlantic Access offers to customers initially is back haul, firm back haul
opportunities, into Transco's Zone 5, which is its fastest growing markets today and a lot of power gen load coming on,
incremental and convergent, from coal. And so it would be firm transportation back haul into Zone 5 with some
secondary rights into Zone 6 and that would take their delivery points all the way down to the Georgia-South Carolina
border at the end of Zone 5 Transco which would include Elba Island as a potential if it's ever reversed and it includes
Cove Point and everything in between.

And next we'll go to Michael Karsch with Karsch Capital.
<Q - Michael A. Karsch>: Hi, thank you for taking the time. I have two questions; my first one is on the IPO. If
market conditions are not suitable what – could you just go right to the spin instead of having to do both steps?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Michael, Don Chappel; good morning. Yes, we could. Again, our current plan is to
continue with a two-step process. IPO, hopefully, yet this quarter followed by complete spin-off not later than the first
quarter, but we certainly could change those plans if the market conditions remain challenging.
<Q - Michael A. Karsch>: Okay, great. And then I guess the second question, I won't make it specific to the SUG
acquisition, I'll just ask it overall. If you bought an asset – if you bought a company which you envisioned dropping
down to WPZ, a substantial amount of assets which required in equity raise at WPZ, how do you think about – let's just
say the acquisition takes some period of time to close, how do you think about the accretion when your stock price
could move, your WPZ stock price could move very substantially between the time you agreed to a deal and the close.
Are there ways to mitigate that exposure?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Michael, I think as follow-up to Alan's comments, I don't think we want to go into the
Southern Union example, but I mean clearly we're looking at that with every capital project that we put on...
<Q - Michael A. Karsch>: That's why I asked it – exactly, that's why I asked it generically. I guess I'm asking you
since you have two structures, if it was – if you felt like WPZ stock was down too much could you just hold the assets
for a longer period of time at the WMB level and not feel like you have to issue equity in the WPZ level?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: I would just say, I think we have a lot of flexibility. Each situation is different. I mean
we're faced with changing markets on a regular basis. I think the good news is, again, WPZ has good strong base of
assets and earnings and cash flows and great growth. We think it will be a security that investors show strong
preference to, great coverage.
<Q - Michael A. Karsch>: Yes.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: So we think it will outperform the MLP's phase.
<Q - Michael A. Karsch>: Yeah, I agree.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: But there will be times when the whole market is tough and the MLP market is tough too,
so we'll look to have contingency plans in everything we do.
<Q - Michael A. Karsch>: That's great. Thank you so much.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks Michael.

[Operator Instructions]. We will take the next question from Bradley Olsen from Tudor, Pickering, & Holt.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Morning.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: You mentioned earlier on the call the fact that as a company, you're long ethane and just to kind of
hit on that, the Crosstex/Geismar agreement. What was the thought process, I guess, strategically when you were
thinking about whether to supply Geismar with ethane from a third-party versus ethane from either WPZ or from the
WPX business?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I think looking at that Crosstex deal and opportunity to see a new pipeline built from
Belvieu to the river area or at least to a point that could get into our ethane system is a great opportunity for us.
Crosstex has got kind of the energy and the will to get that done and it was a way to help get that project going and help
make that a reality.
We think that also is going to give us a preferred ethane price on the river compared to the other transportation options.
And so for us it seemed kind of like a no-brainer. They had the will to do it. They had some latent assets there that they
could put back to use, units. So it was a very good fit for us and we wanted to support it.
<A>: And I would also mention there that the – when we say we're long ethane, obviously that is at various cleared
markets. And so as long as those markets are connected and fairly liquid between the spots, we're not obviously
focused on just moving our molecules of ethane into our location. So it's more of a commercial link than it is actual
physical molecules we're concerned about managing.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. And as far as the comment that it was good to see a new pipeline from Mont Belvieu built
into the region, does that imply that you guys were concerned about potentially being short ethane in the absence of
that Cajun-Sibon extension?
<A>: Well, more is always is better if you're buying ethane. And so there's been a pretty significant delta in price
between those two points, and this was an opportunity to really close some of that gap.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Okay. And just jumping to the Marcellus, it looked like there was – on the webcast you mentioned
that CapEx budget was slipping a little bit in 2011. Is that associated with some slippage in the timing of Marcellus
projects? And I guess to that, if it is related to that, if you could maybe just discuss the kind of state of permitting up in
Pennsylvania and whether you've come to an agreement on where Springville is going to enter Transco?
<A>: Yeah, just some general comments about construction in the Marcellus. It is one of the tougher places in the
country to build pipeline. The geography there is obviously not flat anywhere across the basin. There's a lot of farming,
a lot of human interaction in almost every mile of pipe you build.
And so – and the other thing I would add, too, around permitting is you have to deal with the townships there as well,
so there's another level of permitting that you have to go through which adds some complexity to it. The area in general
has not seen the kind of activity that they're seeing now, ever. And so there's a lot of kind of change in the rules, if you
will, that adds complexity as well.
So it has been a challenge. I think over the last two years we've certainly perfected our model around how to execute
significantly. But nevertheless things are moving more slowly than we'd like. I think it's the same on the producer side
as well, everything is a little more challenging to do in Pennsylvania than it is, say, in the highlands of Wyoming. So it
is a challenge. And we think we're making good progress on it, but nevertheless there is some slippage.
It's not any indication of the quality of the wells or the success up there, which has been phenomenal so far, particularly
up in the Northeast area. All of the performance has exceeded what we had in our plans. So we're delighted with quality
of wells, but the construction is the tough spot.
On Springville, we've got all of our major permits in hand that we need to get that pipeline built. We're under
construction right now, we're clearing right-of-way, we've got some major work going on at the compressor stations,

we have all of our permits in hand for our major bores that we've got to do, some waterways and some roads. So
everything that's on the critical path right now we feel like we have a permit in hand for it, so that's moving nicely. We
do have a couple of minor issues we're working out on the tie-in point to TRANSCO, but we're confident that that's
going to be resolved shortly.

<Q - Sharon Lui>: I guess given the potential for a weaker economic environment and even potentially a double dip
recession, how do you think that would impact I guess the petchem's willingness to build new steam crackers? Do you
think that might delay the timing of their decision? And if so, could the market be oversupplied with frac capacity?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, that's a very, very complex question obviously. I would just say first of all that the
market that all of the new olefin capacity is being built for in North America is not focused at North American markets.
It's focused at exports, and so the global economy, obviously, is the thing to keep our eye on there. And expansions
around the globe I think are critical to that.
So I do think that, obviously, a continued downturn in the economy would have some people backing up. As Rory said,
we think we are first in the queue there, so to speak, with our planned expansion. But I do think that you'd have people
checking and double checking if we went into another recession like we were in before. There's not much doubt in my
mind about that would be the case.
Whether there is ample cracking capacity to clear the fractionation capacity that's being built right now I think is a
pretty complex question. Clearly the NGL space is building up very rapidly, and there is going to have to be some
cracking capacity built to consume that. And so I think it's a great question. I think it's a little early to call that given the
very near-term events we're seeing.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Thanks for the color.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Sharon.

All right. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional
or closing remarks.

Okay, great. Thank you all very much for joining us. Again, very excited about our second quarter. We continue to be
very confident in the balance of '11 and '12 and beyond given the transparency we have to a lot of great projects that we
think the fundamentals remain very sound on. And while we didn't hear too much question about the current NGL

market, today we can tell you that we remain very confident in the margins as they exist today, partially because of
how high the margins got at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter, how high they've been. We've got
plenty of room for that to slip down and still be maintaining our guidance. So we really haven't seen the degradation in
that market here in the last couple of days that you might be expecting.
So we remain very confident about both the third quarter and through the balance of the year and excited about the
growth in our businesses and the way those are all executing and very proud of the way this organization is executing
on both running the business and as well doing things like preparing for the IPO of WPX Energy. So, great efforts
around here and great results to show for it. So again, thank you very much for joining us this morning.
