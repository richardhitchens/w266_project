MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day. Thank you for participating in the Ford Credit Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been
placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions]
At this time, I would like to hand the floor to Steve Dahle, Associate Director, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr.
Dahle, I hand the floor to you.
Stephen Dahle
Thank you, Latoya, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone
or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I'd like to thank you for spending time with us today.
Presenting today are Joy Falotico, Ford Credit Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit
Chief Financial Officer. Also participating is Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President, Corporate Treasurer and CFO Ford
Smart Mobility LLC.
Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone of a few items. The scope of this call is limited to Ford Credit's
earnings. Automotive-related questions should be directed to the Ford Equity Investor Relations contacts detailed in the
Ford press release.
A copy of this morning's Ford press release and the Ford Credit earnings slides that we will be using today are available
on Ford's Investor and Media websites. Ford Credit's Investor website also contains the slides. As discussed today,
pardon me – the results discussed today include some non-GAAP references and these are reconciled for the most
comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides.
Today discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford Credit's future
performance. Actual results may vary and most significant factors are included in our presentation. Later today, we will
be filing our third quarter Form 10-Q.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Joy.

N. Joy Falotico
Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. It's great to be here, and thank you for joining us on the phone and
webcast. Marion and I will take you through our third quarter results and key metrics. And then we'll be happy to take
any questions.
So, let's get started on slide 1. Here you can see we remain focused on the business fundamentals that underpin our
strategy to profitably support Ford around the world. Consistency and discipline in risk management continue to
support our originations practices.
In the quarter, we originated 572,000 contracts and managed receivables grew to $134 billion. Our servicing practices
continued to produce high customer and dealer satisfaction. And we continue to grow lean, focusing on operating
efficiency. And our funding plan is nearly complete. And we'll touch on that a bit later. Our liquidity remains strong at
$33 billion for the quarter.
Now let's go to slide 2 where you'll see some of key metrics for the quarter. Here you can see our pre-tax profit was
$567 million for the quarter and represented our best quarterly pre-tax result since 2011. And our receivables were up
10%, if we continue to grow in line with our expectation. Our originations and servicing remain consistent, and we
continue to see U.S. losses normalized from historical lows. You'll see that in our LTR, which was up year-over-year
with a very solid performance at 45 basis points.
Now, I'll turn things over to Marion to take us through our results in more detail.
Marion Harris
Thank you, Joy. And good morning everyone. On slide 3, this slide shows our profit variance, we improved our profits
by $26 million versus the last year's quarter, and that's explained primarily by favorable volume mix and market value
adjustments for our derivatives. Partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual performance and higher credit losses.
The favorable volume and mix was driven by growth in all parts globally.
Lease residual performance reflects higher depreciation in North America related to expected lower auction values in
the lease portfolio, and we'll come back to that in a moment. Credit loss performance primarily reflects higher
charge-offs as a result of higher defaults and severities in North America.
On slide 4, we have a summary of our financing shares and contract volume in North America. The decrease in total
contract volume for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 reflects lower retail installment and lease financing
shares in the U.S.
Now, moving to slide 5. Total international contract volume in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 increased
from the year ago, primarily reflecting growth in China and Mexico, our operations in China achieved record contract
volume in the third quarter.
N. Joy Falotico
And Marion, I just want to follow-up a little bit on China. And Bob mentioned this in the last call, when we entered the
market back in 2005, roughly 5% of the consumers were financing their vehicle purchases. Now, our share alone was
19% last quarter, so you can see that the auto-financing market continues to mature quite nicely in China.
Marion Harris
Thanks, Joy. So, here on slide 6 are some origination metrics for Ford Credit in the U.S. As we've said before, Ford
Credit uses proprietary credit scoring models and our underwriting practices have been consistent for years, and

consistency is the story for this slide. The average placement FICO score has been very stable.
We support customers across the credit spectrum and our higher risk business, as classified at contract inception,
consistently represent about 5% to 6% of our portfolio, and this has been the case for over 10 years. Our average retail
term was largely unchanged from last year and retail contract of 73 month and longer remained a relatively small part
of our business.
Now on slide 7, you can see in the top boxes the delinquency and the repossession ratio were up from the same period
last year. Severities have increased over the last number of quarters and these increases include such factors as higher
average amount financed, longer-term financing, shorter average time to repossession, lower auction values and higher
principal outstanding at repossession. The lower auction value is accounted for about half of the severity increase in the
third quarter from the prior year, with the other half explained by the other factors I mentioned.
The charge-offs and the LTR ratio were up year-over-year, this primarily reflects higher defaults and severity. The
higher defaults reflect an increased default frequency as well as growth in receivables. We expect credit losses to
continue to increase modestly as they normalize towards our historical experience.
Now turning into slide 8, our worldwide credit loss metrics remained strong. The worldwide LTR ratio was higher than
last year primarily reflecting the U.S. retail and lease businesses covered on the prior slide. Our credit loss reserve was
based on such factors as historical loss performance, portfolio quality and receivables level. The increase in credit loss
reserve at the end of the third quarter compared with the second quarter reflected credit loss performance trends and
growth in retail receivables. The third quarter reserve as a percent of managed receivables was up from the third quarter
of 2015.
Now on slide 9, we show lease origination metrics for the U.S. We manage our lease strategy very closely with Ford.
And given the significant industry growth in leasing and higher new vehicle incentives, we've lowered our projection
on residual values which makes the relative cost of leasing higher. Mark and Bob talked about that in the Ford earnings
call just shortly ago. As a result, our lease share and lease placement volume in the third quarter were lower compared
with a year ago.
On slide 10. Lease return volume in the third quarter was up in the prior year, this change reflects higher lease
placements in recent years, and an increased return rate. The higher mix of 36 months leases returning in 2016 reflects
the shift towards longer term leasing made in 2013.
Our off-lease auction values in the third quarter were lower than a year ago and slightly lower than the prior quarter.
Our 36 month off-lease auction values were about $600 lower year-over-year. Our auction performance has been very
consistent with the industry, when you compare it with similar vehicle ages and segment or to NADA wholesale prices.
Looking forward, the increased supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to put downward pressure on auction values.
Turning to slide 11, our funding strategy continues to be to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet with
ample liquidity to support Ford through economic cycles and markets stresses.
Our managed receivables were $134 billion at the end of the third quarter and were funded primarily with term debt
and term asset backed security. Securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables was 33%. We continue to
expect the mix in securitized funding to trend lower over time, however, the calendarization of funding of our funding
plan may result in quarterly fluctuations.
We expect the mix of securitized funding to be higher in the fourth quarter and an update to our funding plan is on slide
12. We now project full year public term funding in the range of about $26 billion to $29 billion and through October
26, we're already at the low end of that range, having completed $26 billion in term funding and we're essentially done.
Of note, FCE Bank wants this new UK public retail securitization platform in October and this will be FCE's first
public ABS issuance in the UK market, something we're pretty happy about.

On slide 13, at September 30, our leverage was slightly above the targeted range. This reflects growth in receivables
and the continued impact of the strong U.S. dollar, but it continues to trend towards our targeted range and our liquidity
remained very strong.
Now let's go back – let's go to slide 14 and back to Joy to wrap up.
N. Joy Falotico
Thanks, Marion. So as you've we had a strong quarter and we've earned about $1.5 billion through the first nine month
and we continue to expect our full year pre-tax profit to be about $1.8 billion. We expect the fourth quarter results to
have a couple of items of note. We continue to expect higher supplemental depreciation in our lease portfolio and we
also are reflecting our outlook for lower auction value that is impacting that.
Additionally, FCE Bank expects a one-time charge of approximately $80 million related to a pension settlement and
this offset will be reflected in Ford Europe's result.
Let's turn to slide 15. So, in summary, another very strong quarter for us. Our best quarterly pre-tax profit in about five
years. And looking ahead, we do continue to expect headwinds from lower auction value. We are well positioned with
our funding and balance sheet and we continue to consistently execute the business fundamentals, as evidenced by our
results.
Now, I'll turn it back to Steve and we'll be happy to take some questions.
Stephen Dahle
Thanks, Joy. With that we'll now start the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we will take Ford Credit
questions in this call. Automotive-related questions should be directed to the Ford Equity Investor Relations contacts.
Latoya, maybe we have the first caller please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle of SunTrust.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. I'm just asking generally, you guys are the most
forthcoming largest guys, and we've obviously gone through this cycle together. So I obviously trust your opinion
amongst everyone else and so want to use your opinion on two things that are swirling around the auto world. One, you
spoke of some retail softness in the third quarter. Do you attribute that more to the economy softening or more to
uncertainty around the election?
<A - Marion Harris>: When you say retail softening, retail sales or something in the Ford credit business Eric, Eric?
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Would it just be the amount of the incentives and – that are being used to address some softening
behavior there?
<A - Marion Harris>: I think I would – to that question, I think I would have you – I'll refer you to the equity investor
relations group.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Okay. And then, looking at competitive environment on the credit side, and it ties into volumes
which maybe Auto, but it really on the financing side, do you guys see credit profiles normalizing versus a very long
period of being tight, kind of the 2010 to 2012 and now we're kind of normalizing the three-year portfolio? Or do you
see more of it as a worsening credit profile?

I mean, I guess I am kind of ask you, there is a Wall Street Journal article out today and I'm sure everybody on this line
has gotten 10,000 calls on the auto cycle, leading us into recession and just my basic question is, are these credit
profiles normalizing for this cycle? Or do you see us as going to worsening kind of credit cycle?
<A - Marion Harris>: So, it's a good question, Eric. We don't see it getting significantly worse. What we see is the
credit environment continue to normalize. Our credit loss experience has been, as you know, at near historic levels for –
low levels for an extended period of time, and they are increasing, losses are increasing, but they're only normalizing
towards what we would expect to be more historical levels. They are still below what our models would have projected
them to be. That being said I think from where we are in the cycle, we are starting to see indicators that we're in the late
stages of the cycle, but it's – but there is nothing out there that's worrisome about credit losses getting significantly
worse, short of a recession. I don't know, Joy if you have a perspective?
<A - N. Joy Falotico>: Yeah. I'd just add to that and thank you Eric for the call – the question. We are seeing the
normalizing of credit trends that he mentioned. We still have good consumer delinquency performance. It still remains
very strong and we do think that we're going to continue to see a little higher degree of default, but it's normalizing on
where we're at in that later stage of the credit cycle, so that's what the indicators are saying to us.
<A - Marion Harris>: Yeah. Maybe one other thing I would say. It hasn't been very pronounced, but maybe the right
word is noticeable. We've seen a noticeable decline in subprime financing over the last two quarters, but it hasn't been
dramatic. It's just that a couple of banks have been somewhat vocal about that in their calls.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Yeah, my former employer to be one of them. And if I can speak more and more in on the demand
side, yeah, from the securitization we heard speaking of subprime – talked to a guy recently that has sold of a BB slice
for the first time in history. Are you guys seeing demand from kind of the idiosyncratic investors to be able to sell off
some of those equity tranches that the rating agencies hold on the wholesale and retail side. And maybe you guys have
seen rates come down to a point where you guys could potentially offload that exposure. And then maybe your cost of
capital has it gotten that high or you guys are still holding onto that?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Hi Eric, this is Neil, and I think from our perspective, we still think that's a good asset for us to
just hold on to.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Yeah. I agree. Neil, it's great hearing from you man. I will turn the call over. I really appreciate
your time.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: All right. Thanks Eric.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altherr with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Mark Robert Altherr>: Hi. Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I know you've got a lot of experience on credit losses
in North America and Europe. With China growing, that's probably new even for them from a financing standpoint.
How are you looking at reserving there, with, I guess, very little history?
<A - Marion Harris>: It's a good question. We do have very robust rules of the road on the reserving policy. So – and
we feel good about that. But let me talk more broadly about the financing market in China. So, the average consumer in
China, traditionally you've heard the story they pay with cash. And what happens many times, as they walk in and they
want to buy say a Ford Fiesta and the dealer does a really nice job and sells them a Ford Focus, and they finance the
difference between the Fiesta and the Focus.
So, really what we see is a very low loan to value on the vehicle itself, and so that the risk in the portfolio is
extraordinarily low, and we see that play out in our credit loss performance in market. I don't know Joy if you have
anything else to add.

<A - N. Joy Falotico>: Yeah. I would add to that. We do have about 11 years of data. So you're right, we're just now
getting to a maturity level where we can really do some good modeling there. But as Marion mentioned, the structure is
very different, the terms are a lot shorter and there is significant down payment. So we've had the factor that into our
consideration set. But the performer portfolio there is performing as we would expect.
<Q - Mark Robert Altherr>: Okay. Thank you.
