In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This
disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation
materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those
reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.
With that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you very much, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us here for our Q4 and full
year 2014 earnings call today. To begin with, I'd like to welcome a couple of new members of our leadership team, and
they are joining us today as John just mentioned by phone. First is Bob Purgason, who became Senior Vice President of
Access Operating Area in January. And just to remind you, Bob has been COO at Access since 2010 and before that he
was here at Williams for about 19 years in 2006. So the organization here at Williams is very excited to have Bob back
and really looking forward to a lot of the leadership he's bringing.
Additionally, Walter Bennett is here with us and Walter previously led the Western Operations for Access and, in
January, he began leading Williams Western Operations post Allison Bridges retirement. And of course, that includes
our Northwest Pipeline area and all of our big gathering and processing out in the Rockies, as well as we've added to
that now the Niobrara area in Wyoming that ACMP had this built and our team – the Williams team had collaborated to
help bring that business up as well. So really excited to have Walter's very strong operating background and strong
technical expertise brought to our team out there in the West.
Additionally, I would just tell you there are a lot of great leaders that have come in from ACMP and they really are
contributing a lot to our organization and help us lead through this tremendous growth period that we've got going on
here at Williams. So, really nice to see the teams coming together so nicely and so quickly.
Moving on here to slide two, you can see a lot of the major topics that listed here on the slide that we'll hit on the short
presentation. But this is the place I'd like to spend a little more time discussing the drivers of our new guidance and
really the significant de-risking that has occurred as we have dramatically lowered our planned commodity margins,
we've lowered our fee-based volume assumptions, and we've got more conservative on our Geismar ramp-up schedule.
So, here first on the commodity price deck, our new price deck is centered on a $55 WTI and a $3 Henry Hub gas
price, and we try to be conservative with the price decks that are largely below the forward curves for products like
propane and natural gasoline where we're along the commodity and below the forward curve where we're short like on
natural gas and ethane. We believe this is certainly one of the most conservative decks being used amongst our peers in
the industry. And, overall, this resulted in a 44% reduction in our planned commodity margins and in commodity
positions at WPZ and this now represents only about this commodity price – only about 12% of our gross margin is
now exposed directly to the commodities.
On the gathering volume side, we've assumed reduced activity on the assets with unprotected volume exposure. So, in
those areas, we're directly exposed to volumes and in many case we're ahead of what the producers have publicly
communicated to investors. In other words, we're trying to get ahead of the lowering of rig counts and making sure that
we've got a good handle on what we expect and, in many cases, where that hasn't been publicly tried to get ahead of
that with their own estimations. And then unfortunately, though, I would tell you these impacts were really limited to a
handful of our assets. And in the context of the new larger enterprise, the impacts we think will certainly manageable.
So, for example our Northeast volumes are currently tracking ahead of our revised plan for 2015.
On the Geismar ramp schedule, we have incorporated a much lower utilization of the facility over the first three months
of the year and this is going to allow for a safe, controlled ramp-up to full production. We spent a considerable amount
of time doing it safely and ensuring a very high quality asset and we certainly don't want to try to make any shortcuts
here at the last minute on that, so very proud of the team there, continuing to be very focused on safe and making sure
when we do, get up to full capacity that we've got a safe and durable asset there.

A couple of offsets to the impacts of these more conservative assumptions do exist in our plan. First of all, the early
in-service for Transco projects on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast expansion and the Virginia Southside
expansion and I'll hit on more of this in just a little bit, so I won't spend any time there. And then finally, on the – next
on the cost cuts, we do have some offset to some of the negative variances as we've stepped up our focus on really
right-sizing our cost structure to match the reduced levels of activities in a few of the regions. And so while we have
not specifically called out that number, I would emphasize that this can and will be a moving target depending on the
ultimate levels of activity and the production around our assets, but we certainly see an opportunity to offset some
slower growth and take advantage of the lower energy prices and materials in our own business because we certainly
are exposed to energy and materials in our own business and a lot of those prices have come down.
So, in general, we are taking advantage of this low commodity market to position ourselves for a very strong consistent
performance. And with many of the potential upsides that have been taken out of our guidance, now we still see a lot of
those upsides out there but we pulled a lot of that out of our guidance. And so, as those occur, they will result in
upsides to our guidance. But despite the significant de-risking, WPZ still has one the highest distribution growth
amongst our peers, and this is driven now by approximately $4.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015, which is further
driven by fee-based revenues, which make up about 88% of our gross margin. And so – and then we expect our
EBITDA to continue to grow to about $6 billion on the backs of over $9 billion of fee-based projects as we look
forward to 2017.
Moving onto slide three. We can see here the key drivers of the fourth quarter and the comparisons to fourth quarter of
2013, along with some of the mixed results that generated headwinds for us in the fourth quarter. So this was certainly
another very busy quarters for us as we undertook the commissioning of three very large assets. These assets are now
ramping up to our expectations here in the first quarter and will be big contributors to our growth for the balance of
2015 and beyond.
So first now to hit on the WMB highlights. WMB received $515 million of distributions, up from WPZ and ACMP,
and this was a 16% increase, up $70 million. The higher distribution was supported by a 30% increase in the fourth
quarter adjusted segment profit in DD&A, which was up $216 million to now $944 million there in the fourth quarter.
So this large increase was certainly driven by the additional ACMP interest that we acquired in the third quarter of
2014 and as well the associated consolidation of those interests.
WPZ had mixed results for the quarter, we had some real positives and some real challenges as well, ongoing mature
businesses continued to perform as expected. However, we did have some delays and higher expenses in bringing on
Geismar and along with lower commodity prices caused the quarters to come in lower than we had planned.
So now looking into each segment, the Atlantic-Gulf, strong underlying performance in Transco and the Western Gulf,
but this was offset by some producer startups on the Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar facilities. These projects are now
online and ramping up nicely here in the first quarter and really pleased to be serving our customers out there both the
Anadarko's Lucius facility and the two Hess's operated Tubular Bells facility out there.
On the NGL and Petchem side, Geismar being offline versus an expected mid-fourth-quarter startup plus some LCM
inventory adjustments, that marks most of the products that we have for line pack and operating inventories back to a
much lower market. And so this is nothing new in terms of how we account for our inventories, but the severe
downward move in NGLs caused a much larger than normal swing on this inventory valuation. We also saw some
higher expenses for the quarter associated with commissioning and repairs to our Geismar facility.
In the Northeast, we continue to ride the wave of strong growth in the Marcellus volumes with a 26% increase on a
quarter-to-quarter basis and a 28% increase in a full year 2013 to 2014 comparison. However, we did not hit our
expected numbers in OVM due to a delay in bringing on some of the major well pads that producers were bringing on
right at the end of the year, but we do continue and enjoy tremendous growth in this area and our current production
levels in the Northeast segment, as I mentioned earlier, are ahead of our more conservative plan now for 2015.
Out West, the West really performed largely in line with what we had expected with the exception of the commodity
prices, which certainly clipped our NGL margins in the area and this area has really held up fairly well despite the lack

of drilling and, as always, our Northwest Pipeline asset remains very steady. And in 2015, our plan has less than 15%
of the company's gross margins – sorry, of the gross margin in the West coming from commodity exposed contracts.
So, in the past, as you know, the West has always been an area of big commodity exposure to us into some of our big
processing facilities out there and because of the continued growth in our fee-based business as well as the large
decline in NGL margins, we now only have about 15% of that gross margin, actually a little less than that out West. So,
lot less volatility as we go into 2015 out West.
So, overall, a noisy quarter for WPZ given several one-time and discrete events, but our underlying fundamentals are
very strong and they give us confidence in our 2015 plan. And certainly now on the ACMP side, ACMP produced
another very impressive quarter, fee-based revenues were up 48% to $593 million and this was driven by a lot of new
capital investments that delivered record gross gathering volumes of 6.5 Bcf a day. So, tremendous accomplishment by
that ACMP team there in the fourth quarter as well.
Moving on to slide four, talk about some of the milestones and the recent accomplishments here that certainly give us a
lot of confidence in our plan going forward. First of all, as I mentioned, Gulfstar One, the typical startup issues I would
tell you for the producers bringing on, a lot of new big wells on to that platform, but it is looking like some ultimate
upside to our original expecting flow rates from the facility and so really pleased to see the way that's going and very
excited about that investment.
On the Transco side, another winner and another big increase in peak volumes on the nation's largest and
fastest-growing pipeline with this year's peak day here in January beating last year's record by 8%, despite a very, very
cold winter in 2014, January of 2014. So really just a lot of continued growth is driving that on the Transco system and
that team continues to do a great job, keeping up with all that growth.
ACMP, as I mentioned, also hit another record volumes and this really was a major contributor – a major contributor to
this was the gathering volumes in the Utica and those that into the 49% UEO processing JV there in Eastern Ohio and
the latest train to come online was the new Leesville plant. So continued great exposure there to the growth in the Utica
and really excited to see the way those volumes continue to perform. More recently, the big addition to our discovery
partnership, the Keathley Canyon Connector, received first production from Anadarko at their Lucius platform. And
now as we move into March, we expect to begin receiving much larger gas volumes from Exxon's Hadrian field. And
so, again, another huge accomplishment bringing on that major facility out in over 7,000 foot of water.
Our Geismar restart certainly been long-awaited and we're excited to be where we are on that finally and it is. We are in
the process of getting that lined out and we expect to continue to ramp-up here at the end of February. And our plan
doesn't really expect consistent full rate production until the very end of March. And so, we de-risk that as well and we
currently are working to improve the ultimate efficiency of several of the heat exchanger systems before we can reach
back for full production, but all of the systems in the base plant have been activated and we've been able to run that up
to about 70% of load there on the base plant. So, we're very confident in where we are today on that. It's really just a
matter of getting those exchangers being able to operate up to their peak efficiencies.
Our combined Access and Williams operating teams came together on the new Bucking Horse plant in Wyoming right
during the dead of winter. And so, while we don't expect this plant to generate a significant amount of cash flow here in
the near future. It was very important for our teams to get this plant online for the benefit of our new largest customer,
Chesapeake. And it also demonstrated the clear benefits of integration between both Access and Williams personnel
into one new organization out there, so hats off to that team that worked through a pretty tough winter up there to get
that plant started up.
Many of our recent expansions have involved, along with other facilities, modifications to the Transco mainline and so
this allows us to facilitate moving gas from the Marcellus and the Utica from the North to the South. And so, with two
kind of projects in common here on this list, first Virginia Southside, which started up in December of 2014, the
mainline portion did – not yet the lateral, but the mainline portion started up much earlier than expected and that full
facility with the lateral come on in the third quarter of 2015. And then the same story on Leidy Southeast which in
March of this year will bring on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast project and that also beats our expectation
for that project as well.

And together, these projects will yield $50 million to $75 million of incremental operating profit in 2015, these are all
fully contract and that's been approved by the FERC. So, we are ready to put these into service and, of course, bringing
on all this incremental operating profit that wasn't expected originally in those investments really gives a very nice
boost to our original expected returns for those projects. And then finally, our Rockaway Beach Lateral is expected to
start-up in either late March or early April and the team has been working hard to hold the schedule despite as a lot of
you all know, a very wet and cold weather there in the New York area, but really excited to finally bring that project to
closure and being able to serve our big customer up there, National Grid.
Moving on to slide five. This slide really just provides a real quick snapshot of the different types of cash flow that
make up our $6 billion of gross margin. And just to make a few points here. First, it shows that not only 3% of WPZ's
risk remains tied to the NGL margin commodities and the spread on NGLs and only 9% is tied to our olefins margin in
both our Geismar and Canadian facilities. So, meaning 88% of our cash flows are now from fee-based revenues here in
2015, and including nearly two-thirds of those that are under contract that have demand payments, cost of service or
minimum volume commitment.
So, as we can see on the next slide, our future growth is even less dependent on commodities as we move to slide six
here. And this really shows that 99% of our $9.3 billion of growth capital that's in guidance are tied to fee-based
projects. So, this slide really gets to the heart of our lower risk and growth strategy for next few years. And as you can
see, the vast majority of this is tied to – even the fee-based projects, the vast majority is tied to the kind of business that
are either on our gas pipeline system or in the ACMP area where we have a lot of protection from volume risk. And so,
a lot of confidence and certainty from our perspective about how we go forward.
So, while certainly commodity prices aren't remain important to our business specifically here for the near-term cash
flows and coverage, they really are not the driver of our growth. Our business strategy is built around natural gas
volume growth and the demand for associated large scale infrastructure that are going to be required to build out as the
natural gas and natural gas products markets continue to build on the backs of a very low price commodity. And as a
result, we're confident in our ability to deliver one of the highest rates of distribution growth amongst our large-cap
peers, despite the lower expected commodity prices that are now built into our plan.
Moving onto slide 7, this slide just drills down into the known projects over this longer period. And so, I'm not going to
go through each of these facilities. But one of the things that I think we have not spoken very much about but it's pretty
impressive is the amount of exposure that we have to the LNG export facilities. And in fact, Transco has connections
that allow it to receive or deliver gas to nearly every LNG import, export facility in the Gulf Coast and the Eastern
Seaboard other than the Everett facility in Boston. Those LNG facilities include Cheniere's Sabine Pass, Exxon's
Golden Pass, Trunkline's Lake Charles, Sempra's Cameron LNG, the Elba Island LNG and the Cove Point LNG. And
we have – as you know, we've talked in the past about our access to our Gulf Trace project being a 1.2 Bcf a day
commitment to Cheniere's Sabine Pass facility that's fully contracted and start-up in early 2017. But we also recently
concluded an open season in December of 2014 for the Gulf market expansion and this is designed to provide an
additional 1.4 Bcf a day of firm transportation from station 65 going back to the West to points on the mainline in
Louisiana and Texas. And great progress there and we're in the process of negotiating the firm commitments from our
shippers and that came out of the open season and it is anticipated that this 1.4 Bcf a day of capacity could be in service
as early as late 2018. So, just continued tremendous growth on the Transco system both on the market side and supply
side.
Moving to slide eight here for the conclusion, certainly we're very pleased to have the PZ/ACMP merger closed and
remain more excited than ever, really continue to see tremendous benefits from the combined strength of this new MLP
and we think it is the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth of
both natural gas and natural gas derivatives, because clearly our strategy is very tightly focused on this opportunity.
As we looked to the PZ distribution growth, all of the issues I've gone through today really drive to this and the revised
outlook for PZ and WMB result in a new guidance of 7% to 11% annual distribution growth at WPZ through the 2017
period with the midpoint of 9%, and this really reflects the strength and the quality of our underlying assets with a
growing coverage ratio of greater than 1.05 once we get through this first quarter and 2015 ramp-up period. So, not

only do we think we have a good growth there, but we are continuing to build coverage through the period. And so
we're really excited that despite these much lower and a very – relative to our peers, a very conservative price deck, we
continue to be even at the lower growth rate at the low-end commodity prices, we're still at the high-end of our
large-cap MLP peers. And so even though this is slightly below the plan that we articulated at the time of the ACMP
and WPZ merger, these level of growth and coverage are indicative of the best-in-class large-cap MLP.
As we look to the WMB dividend growth, we've also slightly slowed down our targeted levels of growth for WMB and
this, of course, is driven by the lower price environment that we've forecast with a range now of 10% to 15% growth
largely to match the underlying growth of cash flows coming up from the MLP. So just to highlight the stability of this
business plan even under the low price commodity case, we can grow WPZ at the 7% we talked about and continue to
move over 1.0 coverage there at the low price and at WMB at 10% with additional layers of coverage in excess of 1.0
at WMB as well. So we really like how we're positioned now with the distribution and coverage and we certainly like
the underlying fundamentals that underpin that.
So overall, we're very confident in this business plan. We think it's realistic. We think it allows us to continue to
provide tremendous total shareholder return whichever commodity price environment develops as we go forward. And,
in fact, across all of the scenarios we have the best-in-class growth at WPZ and a top tier growth at WMB with growing
levels of coverage across both entities.
So this continually building list of investment opportunities are very tightly aligned with our strategy, they gave us
great confidence in our future and continued to give us a very high quality long-lived cash flows that we think are some
of the highest quality in the industry and this is coming from our continually very competitively advantaged assets.
And so, with that, I thank you for joining us and we'll turn it over for questions that you might have. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead your
line is open.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Alan, can I start maybe with the growth projects and I'm
just curious in the current market as you look to Canada, one of the things we were looking at was the PDH facility. I
didn't know if the – be at the weaker Canadian dollar and perhaps some of the activity coming out of that area might be
tempering down the investment costs and perhaps keeping that potential growth project still in advanced stages, as well
as in third quarter, you guys were certainly opening up the possibility of Appalachian Connector and I didn't know if
we could get an update on that as well?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yes, sure. First on PDH, you are correct, Carl, the fundamentals were actually improving
there as we are seeing some lower – the signs of lower costs coming in for equipment and vendors as we go out and are
in the process of really tightening up our estimates on that. And additionally, that project is really built around the
benefits of the logistics of taking low-cost propane right there in Canada and converting it into – eventually into
polypropylene by our partner and being able to serve markets. So we're basically just cutting down on a lot of rail
logistics. And those things continue to improve, propane prices continue to be a huge spread to Mont Belvieu, propane
prices up there, and we think that's going to continue for some time, because there is not real any logistical answers
coming out that will improve that anytime soon. And so, we really like how that continues to unfold as well. And really
just a matter at this point of getting contracts finalized with our downstream partner there that pulls a lot that risk off of
our shoulders from a commodity spread standpoint, but we really do like the fundamentals and they are certainly
improving for that project.
On the Appalachian Connector project, we are certainly still excited. We think the strengths of our market pool and the
demand of our market there along the mainline as a real positive for us. There has – as you know, there has been some

turnover in some of the properties, upstream and certainly with the lower gas prices. People are looking for creative
solutions out of that area, and so we're certainly working with a lot of those customers both on the market side and the
upstream side to try to bring those two together in a way that they can firmly support our project. And so, feeling pretty
good about that, but it is certainly everybody is going to – anybody in the energy industry right now is reeling a little bit
and trying to get their forward-looking perspectives pen down before they make any major commitments. And so, I
would say that that's where we stand on that today.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Do you get a sense – and that's kind of where I was – where I was going, do you get a sense that
even as these continue to percolate, they have been – they've both been pushed back to the back half for the year if they
do come together or how would you think about timing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would say on the PDH project, it really is just – we're going to be very, very
careful, that's a big investment for us. We want to make absolutely certain that we've been – that we know exactly what
our numbers and we get as many bids and estimates, solid estimates that are well engineered in the door first. So, the
PDH project is more in line just of us moving along at a pace that is focused on making sure we can execute on the
project effectively rather than being in a rush on it. And so, that one is more driven by our own efforts and getting the
contracts finalized than it is anything in the broader macro industry at this point.
On the Appalachian Connector piece, I think the answers have got to come a little quicker on that. And so, I think we'll
be pressing in the next quarter to decide one way or the other on where we go with that. But in any way shape or form,
I think we're going to position ourselves to benefit both our assets in the area, both our wholly-owned and some of our
equity investments and making sure that we get good market attachment to those assets and as well making sure that we
get the investments that are due us for the downstream mainline expansions for that gas as well.
So, pretty excited about it, but we're not going to push a rope on that. We've got plenty of great investment
opportunities and we're not going to step out and take risk on that.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: No, I appreciate that. One final one, just for Don, just very quickly, I appreciate the WPZ equity
as far as obviously retaining investment grade. Don, do you have any planned equity issuances in 2016 and 2017 at PZ
in the kind of base case budget?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Good morning, Carl. The PZ equity issuances in 2016, 2017 at this point are de minimis.
So that gives us capacity to really take on some additional opportunities as we see exciting opportunities develop.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thank you, guys.

And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. First one for me is just on the balance of distribution growth, dividend growth,
coverage. Keeping PZ flat here, it looks like in 2015, I guess, how are you thinking about the right level there,
especially given that you have a much higher mix of the fee-based cash flow?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Hey Ted, this is Don. I'll just note that we felt we wanted to go in with a fairly
conservative plan here in light of what happened in the marketplace. So, rather than continue to boost the dividend or
distribution during the year, we set forth a plan that we'd hold it steady. And obviously if we see things develop to the
upside, we could change that, but we felt that we'd set a plan here that was more conservative and one that hopefully
investors will agree that is conservative as well.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, great. Next one for me is on just on Geismar. Can you maybe quantify a little bit more
closely how many pounds of ethylene are you actually planning to sell in 2015 or some sense of the utilization rate
you're looking for as we ramp-up through the year?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, as I've said, really we're – call it about anyway you want to, but we're expecting very
little here in the first quarter, and then we would be at our typical run rates on Geismar for the balance of the year. And
so, that would be up against the new expanded capacity and somewhere around 98% to 98.5% of that expanded
capacity.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: That's very helpful. Thanks. And then last one for me. It looks like you're no longer giving
guidance by segment here, I guess I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of versus the old guidance that you
used to have at the different WPZ segments, how much plus or minus are we against those or will we start to get some
more color there in terms of how the actual operating [indiscernible] (37:06) performing?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Ted, it's Don. I'd say again given as much changes we've had here, we took a little different
approach this quarter. I would say that as we approach our Analyst Day, we'll look at providing some additional
information, but I'll note for you that we did take volumes down fairly substantially up in the Northeast at OVM as well
as – less so but some volume reduction – reduction from our prior growth expectations that is in the West. So,
hopefully, that helps.

And our next question comes from Abhiram Rajendran with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Just a quick question on the dividend illustration and an outlook over the next couple of
years, obviously, on the cash tax rate line, you're not paying anything for the next couple of years, I think previously
you talked about that, kind of eventually rising up to maybe the high-single-digits, low-double-digit sort of percentage.
How should we think about that kind of looking beyond 2017 and then what that might mean for maybe longer term
growth coverage et cetera?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, Abhi, this is Don again. We had a couple of things change here since our third
quarter guidance on this matter. And cash tax rates are down substantially. A couple of key points there, one was a
bonus depreciation, which again lowered our cash tax rates nicely. And then as well the fact that income was lower also
it kind of extended the period of time over which some of these deductions would be realized. So, I think you can see
there the tax – cash tax rate is about zero through 2017 and in our footnote on that schedule you can see that we've
disclosed 2018 and 2019, we estimate it about 4% currently. And obviously, things will move around a bit, but as we
continue to add projects or potentially even M&A, that will have the tendency to push the cash tax rate down in 2018
and 2019 as well as perhaps periods beyond that. So, again, some good news on the cash tax front.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hey, got it. And you mentioned M&A, what are your thoughts on the M&A environment
and possibilities? Are you continuing to look or are things sort of put on the backburner a little bit, you guys deferred
the drop of the NGL Petchem projects from WMB to a little bit later down the line. How are you thinking about that
whole dynamic?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, sure. This is Alan. Thanks for the question. I would just say we have a lot of
acquisition opportunities that are where we have a preferential position to acquire and so – and those are right down our
alley and our knowledge base. So, we wouldn't be taking a lot of risk where we already know the area, know the asset,
know the investments. And so, I would say those are probably first on the list for our capacity in that space, and – but
we're going to be pretty prudent frankly and we like where we're positioned right now and think that as the cash flows
really start to come through and people really see the strength of these investment opportunities, we think we're going

to be very well-positioned to take on some of those transactions.
So, I would say that's first, but I think one thing you can – we've certainly been consistent on is we stuck with our
strategy very tightly on the acquisition front and have stuck to things that are very consistent with our strategy. And so,
you should think about that as we go forward the same thing.

Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: I know things have been changing really quick here. But I was wondering if you – you might
be able to expand a bit more upon conversations you're having with your producer customers as far as their drilling
activities in 2015. And is there any way we can think about quantifying the risk of throughput through the legacy WPZ
G&P assets, there's a low end of guidance in that certain volume assumptions are different than the high-end or any
help there would be great?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Well, just kind of put that in context for you from where we were in the previous
guidance period, we've pulled well over a $100 million out on that – from those fee-based volumes. And so, we have
dramatically reduced that. And I would tell you the areas that are hardest hit and we think are going to be hardest hit,
and I would tell you we've been more conservative than some of the input we've had from some of our producers in
many areas. But the areas that have been hardest hit were areas that were enjoying a big lift from liquids. And I think
the gas market overall, particularly the demand side, probably doesn't appreciate all the nice benefit of continued
supply that has come on the backs of high price liquids margin. And with those pulled out of the space right now, that
is – we think that's going to dramatically retard drilling. And so if you're as, I would say, conservative and maybe even
bearish relative to our peers about where we think liquids prices will be for the year, then that also has you not being
very bullish on people drilling for rich gas. And so, I would say those are the areas that from our perspective are most
effective, not so much the dry gas but really the richer gas areas are the ones we've really pulled back our assumptions
on.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: That makes sense. Thank you. And just one last question on Constitution, if you could
provide any updates there as far as how that's progressing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, sure. Rory, you want to take that one?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah, this is Rory. Jeremy, we've had some pretty good news in the fourth quarter, this is
probably fairly well known, but just as kind of a recap, December 2 the FERC issued a Certificate of Public
Convenience and Necessity authorizing the Constitution Pipeline project. So that's a big milestone for the project. And
then later on, that same month on December 24, the New York DEC issued a Notice of Complete Application on the
project and set out three public hearings that took place in that second week of January. And they've set a deadline of
February 27, 2015 to get all of the written comments in on the action that they are considering. So we've been working
very closely with the New York DEC, that's probably the next hurdle that we need to clear, but they're asking a lot of
questions, I think they are very intent on doing their due diligence on the project. And they've been very inquisitive but,
we've been working very hard and very steadily to get them the answers that they need and put them in a position to
issue that permit, hopefully in a few months after the – a month or two after the close of the comment period.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Great. Thanks for that.

Our next question comes from Brad Olsen from TPH. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Bradley Richard Olsen>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Good morning.
<Q - Bradley Richard Olsen>: I had a really kind of a financial structuring question. We've obviously seen Kinder
Morgan take the step of getting rid of their MLP entirely and as you look out with the ACMP deal now closed, then you
guys have provided what I think is very conservative guidance versus what market expectations are and you're still
building coverage even in this conservative $45 scenario that you've painted. And yet, we still see WPZ trading a
couple of hundred basis points in several cases wider in terms of yield than a lot of the big cap MLP peers that it's
comped against. And so, I guess you guys have provided some interesting color in previous presentations in terms of
kind of where you expect on a yield basis WPZ to trade, based on its growth rate. It seems like that that discount is
persisting and I was wondering if, you had thoughts on; A, any kind of further steps that you can take to close that
discount; and B, if you still find that WPZ is not an effective financing vehicle or is just simply too expensive of a
financing vehicle, would you consider simplifying your structure and eliminating the MLP or folding it into WMB?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, I would just tell you, I think that certainly a tool for us in the future. I think, though,
right now, we've got a great plan in front of us and we do believe that as these big projects come on and really began to
generate the kind of tremendous cash flow that they've got that we're going to see the market re-price that, the WPZ
currency. And so, we think that the – that is yet to come and certainly what Geismar continuing to be down and the big
Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, Rockaway Lateral, all these big projects really starting to kick up here for the balance
of the year. We think that's going to give the markets a lot of confidence. So, I would say we certainly understand that
the benefits of that as a tool for the future. But I think right now we've got to execute on what we have and let the
market retune itself before we make any further decision on that.
<Q - Bradley Richard Olsen>: Got it. Thanks for that color. Just one follow up, as you looked out into potentially
heating up M&A market in light of the market dislocations that we've seen recently and you think about potential
opportunities in the M&A market. Would you be willing to contemplate using WMB as a consolidation vehicle given
the fact that you've spent the better part of the last year getting WMB into a fairly streamline general partner HoldCo or
would you be willing to wait for WPZ's valuation to get more competitive in terms of an M&A currency before
attempting to do anything?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I would just say, I think both of them are fairly undervalued right now from our
perspective. And so, I think we've got to get them both in position. But I think it certainly would depend on the
transaction as we move to that point and then it would certainly depend on the transaction as to which one would be the
more appropriate currency for that. So, it's nice to have both of them frankly, because there are times when the C-corp
currency would be a much more favored currency than the MLP currency. And so, I think it's important to have both of
them right now and we like having both those tools.
<Q - Bradley Richard Olsen>: Great. Thanks a lot for the color, Alan.

<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a quick follow up to actually to the discussion you just had
with Brad. When you're thinking about it taken or whether it's a tool in the chest further down the road, is it fair to
assume that given the fact that you're effectively – based on an earlier comment, not a taxpayer at WMB through 2017,

that it pretty much wouldn't make sense to even consider it until you actually become a taxpayer. Is that sort of the way
we should be thinking about that as kind of the first step in terms of whether you would consider taking it all?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Shneur, this is Don. I think the tool is one that we'll continue to look at. And yes, we're not
a taxpayer for many years. However, there are other attributes to the option, but again, I think as Alan mentioned
earlier, we think execution is likely to cause WPZ to trade at a level that is appropriate given its opportunity set, the
growth set, and we think the relatively low long-term risk that natural gas growth demand drives. So, again, we'll just
put that on the shelf, it's something we'll continue to study, but we think that execution is job number one, and yes,
taxes are something that would not be all that valuable for quite a few years.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Sorry. So, just moving on to some of the questions that I had. First, there has been
a quite a few announcements by many of the processors around the country of significant cost saving initiatives, some
head count reductions and so forth. And I realize at the time of the merger, you were very adamant about no head count
reductions, if anything you were looking to hire people and so forth, but I think more kind of in a different commodity
environment today. I wonder if that thought process has changed at all and if you're pursuing some sort of cost
reduction strategies, sort of – I was wondering if you can sort of comment against what you're doing versus what the
rest of the industry is doing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, great question. And we certainly are going to put a lot of pressure on costs and we
do think that we've got a lot of room to do that. And so, certainly, using the combined buying power of the two entities,
lower material costs, lower cost on things like lube oil which as you can imagine, with as many spinning parts as we
have in our business, is a big number for us. And so, we certainly are going to go after cost on that side.
On the head count front, I would say, there are certainly a lot of those opportunities coming to us as we merge a lot of
support functions. But I would say we still really need to continue to preserve our strengths on the operating and
technical side, because we do have a lot of growth on that front, but it is shifting around and we will need to shift some
of those resources around to be focused on where the opportunities lie. But I would tell you, we still are looking for
great talent in the technical and operating side and we do see some opportunities on the support function side as we
continue to consolidate the organization. So we are pursuing them aggressively, I guess, is the best way to say that and
we do think there is quite a bit of opportunity around that.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay. And then a question about the dividend policy, last night you effectively tampered
the growth you said it in your prepared remarks, reflecting the current commodity environment. Is it also fair to say that
this is somewhat of an affirmation that there is no longer going to be kind of an IDR waiver type strategy in terms of
how you sort of structure the PZ distribution in the Williams dividend policy, or is it really just about the current
commodity environment?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Shneur, we believe the WPZ is sufficiently strong to carry itself without requiring any
IDRs. We initially designed it with very stout coverage. Fortunately, we have that stout coverage designed in and we
used it. But nonetheless, as you can see here, we're building coverage back again in a way that we do not expect WPZ
to need IDR waivers. As Alan pointed out, with 88% being fee-based gross margin, with 30% of that coming from
interstate pipes and another 27% coming from ACMP, and it's cost of service contracts and MVCs, we have nearly
60% of our gross margin coming from either interstate pipe or cost of service, MVC type revenue. So very low risk, we
think on a relative basis cash flow. So again we don't see a need for IDRs, we don't think the market puts enough value
on those to make it worthwhile.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Okay, fair enough. And one final question just with respect to Geismar, I was just
wondering if you walk us through where you are with ethylene production today in sort of the confidence that it will be
at full runway in the first quarter, kind of like what are the hiccups or challenges that you're dealing with today that you
need to get complete, so that you can actually be at full run rate by the first quarter?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Well, I'm going to have John Dearborn provide you a little more detail here, but I
will just say, in general, as we started up the plant, we hit a – we started seeing inefficiencies and some fouling in our
heat exchangers that are critical to reaching peak efficiency in a plant like that. And so, rather than continued to be

dogged with that, we chose to take those heat exchangers offline, stop sales on ethylene out of the plant for a little
while and get those heat exchangers cleaned out adequately, to make sure that we could get back to absolutely full
efficiency on the plant. So, – and not continuing to try to limp through that as we pull through start up. So, that's really
what's going on. That's not a big issue, it's just a matter of getting some of the residual fouling that had been sitting in
those heat exchangers and getting them tuned up.
But, we have gotten the plant up in running, we've had all of our systems up and running, we just weren't hitting the
efficiencies that we wanted to and so we're back getting that tuned up. And then, the next step would be to bring on the
larger expansion, the expansion as well. And so, we think we've got that part of the plant ready to go as well. And so,
that's what we'll be doing here for the next three weeks or so is tackling both those issues, but things are going well on
that front and we're pleased with the way the work is going. John, do you have anything to add?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Well, obviously, Alan is very well-informed on this issue of how Geismar is going, but you
can be assured that we keep him well informed that way. The only thing I'd add is, as we look forward, it's our intention
that we bring the plant back notionally to the base capacity level, that 1.3 billion pound rate. And at that rate, which as
you heard Alan say earlier, we've demonstrated now 70% of that rate already, operating with nine furnaces, then we'll
line up the plant, we'll be absolutely certain that the plant is running stably and then we'll take the next steps to ramp-up
to the full capacity getting up into that high-90%s operating rate against the full capacity over the subsequent few
weeks. So that's the way we had it planned out and we're making very good progress at getting this heat exchanger
cleaned and expect to turn the plant back over to operations next weekend and a few days after that, it would be back in
the pipeline.

And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Good morning. I was just curious, you guys in the press release talk about the deferral of the
planned dropdown of the remaining NGL and Petchem projects. When are you thinking that that's going to be deferred
to, do you have a sense of – an idea of when that's going to be?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Christine, this is Don. We didn't put a date on it, so it's not embedded in any guidance that
you see here. However, I think we'll be – I'll just say, we'll be opportunistic about that, so we'll look to do that when we
think WPZ has the financial capacity to do that in a real value creating kind of way with debt capacity or with a
combination of some debt and equity, when the equity is trading in a way that we think is more appropriate. So, right
now, I'll just say we'll be opportunistic and we'll deal with that as we see the right facts and circumstances line up.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then my next question is a bit of an operational one. You, in a prior response to a
question, you talked about how you stripped out $100 million of margin tied to areas where there is lots of liquids-rich
related drilling. If I'm to think about kind of the Marcellus and you've previously talked about Oak Grove coming on at
the end of this year, is there really a reason for that to come on by this year? Can we defer that? I mean, it doesn't sound
like Fort Beeler is going to be fully utilized this year. So, can you just kind of migrate whatever volumes were
dedicated to Oak Grove to Fort Beeler in the meantime?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Christine, actually Oak Grove is – TXP I is up and running already. And recall that that is
where our de-ethanizer is. And so, we have both the processing train there and the de-ethanizer there at the Oak Grove
facility. So for operational reasons, it's good for us to have that up and running. I would tell you that, again, even
though we've pulled the upsides and the stuff that's not fully contracted out of our guidance on our forecast, there are a
couple of very sizable packages of gas out there that we are extremely well positioned to capture, because we do have
that capacity available. And so, I'm not going to get into specific customer names there, but I would just tell you we're
extremely well positioned to capture those because we do have that capacity available. And so we're excited to have

that Oak Grove capacity ready and available to serve those customers and we think we're going to be able to capture
that. There is quite a bit of gas that is just sitting there, not flowing today because producers have had troubles bringing
pads up. And so I think as those come on and as we have an opportunity to capture some of that other gas out there,
we're going to be really glad we have that capacity available.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. So no changes to at least the second train of Oak Grove then, the timing of that then?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: That's right.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then, my last question is we've always talked about potential to convert Geismar into
fee-based with the customer. Given all the changes that have happened in the last couple of months, has this thinking
changed or is the challenge really finding a counterparty to do it with?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: No, I certainly don't think it has changed and we are certainly looking to really think about
that from a shareholder value standpoint. Certainly, if we were just looking at the PV of the cash flows, we think that
having the commodity risk especially as it covers our ethane processing risk, we think that absolute PV of those cash
flows is probably better just riding the commodity risk. However, given the beta and the volatility that that brings in
from an investor perspective, we think there is some value to be had by lowering our risk and so it's a matter of finding
that right trade off. And as we've said – as I've said earlier, the fact that we've got a much lower assumption and
expectation right now on the commodity margin, actually gives us a little more room to go do a transaction like that.
And so we certainly are very interested in that and I would tell you that the – while they seem separate, the ability to
bridge between somebody's needs on Geismar 2 and perhaps their more current needs from available production at
Geismar 1 starts to become the opportunity there. So, we're still very interested in doing that and we think the current
margin environment gives us a little more room to do that, because we wouldn't be coming out and having to lower our
forward guidance so much, if we were to be able to convert that into fee-based.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Great. Thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Just backing on Christine's question a little bit, do you guys seen any appetite among producers
potentially to convert to fee-based contracts as they're looking to print more barrels and show more growth, is that
something that they're potentially open to and in this type of environment for the right price level?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would just say that a lot of our business has converted to fee-based. And so, really the
place that we have remaining exposure on a keep-hold basis, as I mentioned, is about, a little less than 15% out West of
our total gross margins out there. And so, I would say that, it continues to be an opportunity. But, we structurally, I
would just tell you, there are ways for us to keep the risk and for them to report the barrels. And so, that I would say,
we've figured – we've done many of the – we've done a lot of that in the past where the producers still report the barrels
as their own equity barrels, but we don't have to really change the equity ownership of those barrels. And so, that's
always a discussion that we're always interested in. I'll tell you that we've – on the processing side, we have, over the
years, tried to contract for fee-based when the margins are high and take on the keep-hold when margins are really low,
and so – just because we certainly believe in that cyclicality of the processing margin, and so I don't know that we've
really changed our perspective so much on that front.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Got it. And just on the Access business, it seems like quarter-over-quarter a little bit more flat this
quarter. Can you maybe just kind of talk about the trajectory you see going forward there and kind of what puts and
takes you see?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Bob, you can take that one, please.
<A - Robert S. Purgason>: Yeah, no, certainly, Alan. Brian, glad [ph] that you look at (65:49), I think we didn't feel –
we felt like we had a really good quarter actually and are seeing good volume growth in our Northeast areas, Utica very
strong, still strong volumes in Marcellus, Eagle Ford volume is still growing. As Alan noted, Niobrara coming up
although whilst picking that up here in the process. So we feel very good about our performance coming out. No
integration impacts from that and in fact are looking for the kind of growth that you saw in detail as Access standalone
continuing and in fact accelerating with the Williams team.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Perfect. Thanks, Bob, that's helpful. And then finally, Don, I was just wondering if you could
maybe just speak to what kind of leverage capacity you think you have at the MB level, I mean, in order to stay
IG-rated up there? And then, would you guys have any appetite to potentially fund some projects up at that level?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Brian, I think at this point in time, we don't have much in the way of debt capacity at the
Williams level. So obviously, as cash flows build and perhaps margins improve, we'll build some of the debt capacity,
but today, I wouldn't view that we have debt capacity to do much of anything in the very near future.
<Q - Brian Lasky>: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks.

Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Alan, in response to Brian's question about processing contracts, you expressed the long-term
contrarian view where you see cyclicality continuing. On that note, in contrast to going to fee-based at Geismar, would
you have the appetite for increasing the commodity exposure on the midstream processing to kind of neutralize some of
your exposures on both ethane and also take advantage of that long-term cyclicality you're describing?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah, great question, Craig. And I would just say that, we certainly are not in the olefins
business for the sake of being in the olefins business. We see it as a nice extension of our midstream business in a way
to push through into those markets and keep those markets open on the tail end. And certainly, we are working to try to
be neutral on that ethane to ethylene spread. We're actually a little bit short ethane right now.
If we were to turn on all of our ethane recovery capacity, obviously we're very short right now, because we're not
recovering ethane anywhere, but if we wanted to turn on our ethane – if we were at full ethane production against the
contracts we have, we still would be a little bit short ethane. So, fine to get neutral on that, but another way of getting
neutral on that would be to enter into some fee-based contracts on the ethylene side, and therefore reduce our length on
the ethylene and reduce – and improve our balance between ethane and ethylene. So, I would say, that's more likely the
way we would approach that.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. That's helpful. And, on the commodity deck for guidance, obviously very conservative,
but the one area I had a question on, and I understand that you don't really have long-term ethane markets that are
useful. But, if I'm not mistaken, recent ethane, ethylene crack spreads are perhaps a few cents below the full year
guidance, if I'm not mistaken. Can you provide some color around olefins margins expectations and market drivers you
see as Geismar achieves full capacity?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Sure. Well, first of all, just want to tell you that on the ethylene side, remember that,
that is at a $55 oil price, and so we think that ethylene price is very commensurate with a $55 oil price that we have in
there. Also, you obviously have to pay attention to the spread and not just the absolute price that we have in there,

which it sounds like you're focused on, Craig.
But the other thing that – I think it's missed sometimes in this is that we are actually looking at the netted price, and
remember that we produce in the Mississippi River market. And so, while we certainly sell and exchange a lot of our
product into Mont Belvieu as well, we do have exposure to the Mississippi River market, which has been extremely
short and there is actually a lot of derivative production that's been down in the area, due to shortages.
And so you have to take that into consideration, when you look at our proposed ethylene spread. And so, I think we feel
pretty good. As you look into the 2016 and 2017 timeframe, you can see our ethylene price coming up, but you can also
see that the ethane price is coming up right along with that as well, and so really again need to look at the spread.
I would tell you, I'm pretty bullish, the ethylene market as we look out in the next couple of years, because the growth
that I think we're going to see in the economies and the lack of near-term productive capacity coming up. It's pretty
hard to argue that there isn't going to be quite a bit of pressure on those olefin markets to the upside and a lot of demand
coming to that. So that's what I would have to offer for you. I think we feel pretty good about where we're positioned
there. John is a great student of that space as well, and I'll have John provide any additional comment [indiscernible]
(72:30).
<A - John R. Dearborn>: And I have only one or two other things to add. Of course, the lower prices are certainly
expected to stimulate some demand, but also we've been looking at some recent reports that would say that we're seeing
slowing exports and increasing local demand here in North America for ethylene and ethylene derivatives. And
certainly the ethylene derivative market remains quite strong.
The second point I would add for consideration here is that if you look at ethylene inventories, they're at pretty much
all-time low levels. There're estimated to be about six days' worth of production in inventory at this point in time. But
remember that all those six days are not available to take advantage of a production mishap and nearly no one forecasts
production mishaps.
So we think there are probably only about maybe three or four days' worth of useable inventory there ready to make up
for some production shortfalls. And certainly coming into the year, we see a couple of crackers that are down now
though we have a light turnaround season this year.
And then lastly, I'd turn your attention a little bit further to the Louisiana market. Today, with the Evangeline pipeline
shutdown and suffering from some reliability issues at the moment, the spot price premium between Texas and
Louisiana is in the $0.08 to $0.10 pound range. I think as we bring our facility back in operation, that will likely return
to a more normal levels. But we are very well aware of some derivative capacity there on the river that is underserved
because of the combined outage of both our plant and Evangeline. So I think as Alan expressed, and as I would confirm
here is, we're generally positive as our guidance would suggest. So thanks for the question.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Just a follow-up question on ACMP. Maybe if you could provide some color on the organic growth
opportunities, and what type of CapEx is embedded in your guidance relative to the historical level through the G&P
business?

<A - Robert S. Purgason>: Sure. Yes, Sharon. Nice to hear from you. In terms of just looking at going forward, you'll
notice we had a good strong capital year this year and we've given, I believe, a three-year look out here in the new
numbers. And if you compare those to our past guidance, you'll see some strength in capital over our older forecast just
in terms of our thinking that there are still new opportunities coming.
These assets have not been worked hard and we are seeing the kind of backfill that we've always talked in to our
capital, not just dropping off the ledge, when we finished this first round build out that arguably happened this year. So
we still see good capital investment opportunity. And as you know, that drives earnings, given our business model.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: So has there been, I guess, the shift or change in producers' willingness to commit to like a contract
under cost of service under the current commodity environment?
<A - Robert S. Purgason>: Well, these are not new contracts. These are continuing to build on the footprint that we
have already established and continuing to build out in these core areas like Utica, and the strength that we're seeing
there. In the Eagle Ford where, yes, drilling softer, but there is still good strong drilling going on and really just filling
out our existing portfolio.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Great. And then I guess just one question with regards to liquidity at WPZ. So post the
merger, does the partnership have access to both credit facilities or is there plans to I guess renegotiate with the bank
group for one larger facility?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, we've put a new larger facility in place effective as of the date of the merger, as
well as a supplemental liquidity facility. So, we have abundant liquidity.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. And has the pricing terms changed?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: The pricing terms are more in line with WPZ's pricing, given its historic WPZ's pricing, in
light of the fact that we have a mid BBB investment grade rating. So the ACMP pricing really move to the WPZ level
of pricing and it's got a little bit better than it was in our prior facility.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Thanks. Welcome.

Our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Craig's question. When we look at the spot prices for
ethylene, if I look at sort of the Bloomberg today, it looks like for Mont Belvieu, you're looking at $0.3475 per pound.
Is that the right number to be looking at? And what is that now for the Mississippi River market today, roughly?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Unfortunately, there is not an awful lot of transactions
happening on the Mississippi River. The few recent transactions that we saw came out to be plus about between $0.08
and $0.10 to that number that you see at Mont Belvieu.
As I mentioned in my commentary, just a moment ago, at least I would believe that as we bring our plant back into
service here, through this early part of this year, we would probably see that differential decline to a more normal
levels. And those more normal levels range between $0.01 and $0.03.
So if you're looking forward, I think it'd be reasonable to expect those kind of differentials. But certainly and once
again, we feel that there is some pent-up demand over on the River that's been [ph] stranded (79:08) by our outage and
the reliability of the pipeline is getting ethylene to that market in recent past.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Okay, that's helpful. But the $0.3475, that's a good number – that's kind of the good number for
ethylene pricing in Mont Belvieu as of right now.

<A - Donald R. Chappel>: It's a good number, whether all transactions happen at that level. They'd probably happen
around that number. So, yes, it's a good number to be looking at.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: And just – I mean just kind of to remind me, I should have this somewhere, but I just don't it on
top of my head. If Geismar is running at, say, 95%, 98% or whatever the target is, what percentage of, I guess, U.S.
ethylene capacity would that be? Like how much more is coming back on to the market?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah, it's just under 4%.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: 4% okay.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Right in that range, right.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: All right. And then my second question is just switching gears I guess to Atlantic-Gulf, and I'm
sorry if you touched on this. It looked like the other segment cost jumped pretty significantly there. And I can
understand that there is going to be perhaps some startup costs associated with Gulfstar. I was hoping you could
quantify that a little bit more? And then just try to understand if that's what it is at Gulfstar? Are there any revenues?
Were there any revenues whatsoever in the quarter from Gulfstar [indiscernible] (80:20) anything like that?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah. There were revenues in the quarter from Gulfstar. I think we had $19 million at new
Gulfstar fees. We actually collected quite a bit more than that in the second half of 2014, so we have the cash in. But
based on the revenue recognition model that we're using, we kind of have to dose out those collected dollars based on
the forecasted throughput through the facility.
So our cash numbers actually are far in excess of the $19 million that we took to earnings, but that will continue to
grow. We are collecting a base fee or demand fee under that contract, and then there is a usage fee, as well as those
barrels and those MMBtus of gas total across the facility. So that's a fairly significant impact on revenues in the quarter.
Also, our Transco transportation revenues were up, fee-based revenues were up about $15 million. And that was some
higher IT volumes and some short-term firm deals and as well as some seasonal volumes that we saw pushing that
number up.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: Okay. But is there something that kind of caused the – is it really Gulfstar startup or how much
of this is one-time to go from sort of 3Q number of $133 million of [ph] other segment (81:58) cash cost to, say, $160
million?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Yeah. The quarter I would say is not really indicative of the year. So if you look at the year
in total on the expense side, we were right on our target. But if you look quarter-to-quarter it looks pretty extreme. I'll
tell you what happened though, if you remember the Polar Vortex that we went through Q1 of 2014, it was kind of an
all hands on deck period for Transco. We were setting new records.
It seemed like almost every day. It was a pretty severe environment and we saw almost all of our expenditures that we
could push got pushed into the second, third and fourth quarter. So it's a game of catch up all year, and we just wound
up loading a lot of those expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at the year's total, it's pretty much right on.
<Q - Eric C. Genco>: All right. This was helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: You bet.

<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Hey, guys. Just real quick and first of all I appreciate all of the color you gave on the
ethylene markets, that was super helpful. It's actually funny, as your call was going on, [indiscernible] (83:18) filed for

color on what the exit rate maybe was at OVM? And then secondly, have any of the producers up there actually pushed
back to you and kind of had some look, can you give us a break on any of these rates that you guys are charging us in
exchange for, we'll keep the volume going?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Timm – sorry, Jim Scheel, you want to take that please?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Sure. As we spoke last time, we were pretty bullish about ending the year around $400
million. That didn't happen. We had a couple issues associated with some pretty significant CRPs that had some
operational issues associated with producers actually having much richer liquids content. So we'll expect that volume to
show up later in the year as we install the equipment necessary to handle that quality issue that we faced at the end of
the year. So we ended just over $300 million.
We have been talking to our producers, and as has already been talked about it a number of different times, we have a
much different expectation for growth around OVM, but it is continued growth. It's just at a slower rate. We have had
discussions with producers about renegotiation of agreements and that's not without opportunities for us to improve on
the base agreements that we had achieved with Caiman and negotiate some better terms. But at this point, those are just
preliminary discussions and we have not made any commitments to make any changes. But obviously, if we can create
a win-win position with our producers, we'll be open to those discussions.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: All right. Super. Helpful. Thank you, guys.

for any additional or closing remarks.
Alan S. Armstrong
Okay. Great. Well, thank you all very much. We're excited about our future and really like how we've repositioned
ourselves here and de-risked our forecast substantially, and yet still tremendous growth in distribution, and we think
best amongst our peers, considering our more conservative forecast. So thank you very much for joining us. We look
