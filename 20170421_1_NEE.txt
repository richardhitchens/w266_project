Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners Conference Call. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Roskot.
Please go ahead, sir.
Matthew Roskot
Thank you, Gina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 combined earnings
conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners.
With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Armando Pimentel, President and Chief
Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all

John W. Ketchum
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners delivered solid first
quarter results and are off to a strong start towards meeting their respective objectives for the year.
NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 10.1% against the prior year comparable quarter,
reflecting strong performance of both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. Over the same period, NextEra
Energy Partners grew per unit distributions by roughly 15% versus the prior year comparable period. Adding to the
solid run rate with which NEP entered the year, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of an additional asset from
Energy Resources, which I will discuss in more detail later in the call.
At FPL, earnings per share increased $0.10 from the prior year comparable quarter. Continued investment in the
business was the primary driver of growth, as regulatory capital employed grew 9.7% year-over-year. With residential
bills significantly lower than the national and Florida averages, FPL's focus continues to be on finding smart
investments to lower costs, improve reliability, and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
In addition to the approximately 1,750-megawatt Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which remains on track and on
their budget, FPL continues to make excellent progress towards its recently announced solar development initiatives.
Earlier this month, we filed FPL's Ten Year Site Plan with the Public Service Commission and announced that we
expect to add a total of nearly 2,100 megawatts of solar across Florida over the next several years.
We have already secured sites that will potentially support more than 3 gigawatts of FPL's continued solar growth. We
also remain excited about our 50-megawatt battery storage pilot program that was approved as part of the 2016 base
rate settlement agreement, which is expected to complement our solar development efforts.
In addition to solar, as part of FPL's Ten Year Site Plan, we announced our intention to modernize one of FPL's oldest
power plants in Dania Beach, Florida, with a new approximately 1,200 megawatt high-efficiency natural gas plant and
to pursue the early phase out of an additional coal-fired plant that we co-own with JEA.
FPL was recognized in 2016 for the second consecutive year as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation, as
well as for its response to Hurricane Matthew and Hermine. We remain committed to continuously improving our
customer value proposition by continuously making investments to harden and automate our existing transmission and
distribution system.
Not only does FPL offer what we believe is a total customer value proposition that is second to none, but as a result of
these initiatives, we also expect to continue to deliver shareholder value, as regulatory capital employed is expected to
grow at a compound annual growth rate of roughly 8% per year over the four-year term of January 2017 through
December 2020.
At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.10 per share against the comparable prior year quarter, as
contributions from new investments continued to drive growth. It was another outstanding period for renewables
origination with the addition of 413 megawatts of wind and 208 megawatts of solar PPAs added to backlog this quarter.
We also entered into agreements to sell over 1,000 megawatts of wind development rights and new wind projects to
one of our largest customers, which we have not previously announced and are not included in our backlog. I'll provide
more details on our continued origination success later in the call.

During the quarter, Energy Resources successfully commissioned the first 114 megawatts of its wind repowering
program and continues to make solid progress on the remaining sites. As a reminder, we have tax equity financing
commitments in place for the approximately 1,600 megawatts of repowering projects that we have previously
announced. These projects represent around half of the total $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capital deployment that we
expect for repowering through 2020.
We continue to actively pursue additional repowering opportunities for our existing contractor portfolio, which will
largely comprise the balance of the repowering opportunity in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Beyond renewables, we continue
to make good progress on development and construction activities related to our three natural gas pipeline projects, and
our development team continues to seek new pipeline opportunities going forward.
At NextEra Energy Partners, the assets operated well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations.
Yesterday, the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.365 per common unit, or $1.46 per common unit on
an annualized basis, continuing our distribution growth at the top end of our range. Inclusive of this increase, NEP has
grown its distribution per unit by 95% since the IPO in July 2014.
Further building upon that strength, today we're announcing that NEP has reached an agreement to acquire the
approximately 250 megawatt Golden West Wind Energy Center from Energy Resources. We expect the transaction,
which is anticipated to be funded with available debt capacity, to yield a double-digit return to NEP's unitholders and
be accretive to LP distributions. With its extended growth runway, we believe NEP offers a superior value proposition
and is better positioned than ever to deliver upon the expectations that we have outlined for our investors.
Before continuing with a discussion of our strong results for the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the
Oncor transactions. Oncor has always been an opportunistic transaction that we believe leverages our core strengths in
operating rate-regulated utilities efficiently to deliver on our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability,
and outstanding customer service.
We are disappointed by the recent ruling from the Public Utility Commission of Texas that our proposed transactions
are not in the public interest. We expect to file a motion for rehearing with the Commission sometime in the next few
weeks. However, if we are ultimately unsuccessful with the transactions, we continue to believe that we have one of the
best growth opportunity sets in our industry, and we will be disappointed if we are not able deliver financial results at
or near the top end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8% through 2020 off a 2016 base.
We remain laser-focused on continuing our long-term track record of delivering outstanding results for our
shareholders. As a reminder, through the end of 2016, we outperformed both the S&P 500 and the S&P Utility (sic)
[Utilities] Index in terms of total shareholder return on a 1-, 3-, 5-, 7, and 10-year basis and have outperformed more
than 70% of the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. We were once again honored to be named, for the 10th time in 11
years, number one in the electric and gas utilities industry on Fortune's 2017 list of World's Most Admired Companies
and to be ranked among the top 10 companies worldwide across all industries, for innovation, social responsibility, and
wise use of corporate assets.
While third-party acknowledgments are a reflection of our past successes, we remain focused on the future. We expect
that the organic growth prospects of both FPL and Energy Resources combined with our continued focus on running
our businesses efficiently through initiatives such as our recently announced Project Accelerate will allow us to extend
our long-term track record of delivering value for our customers and providing growth for our shareholders, while we
continue to maintain one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry.
Now, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2017, FPL reported net income of
$445 million, or $0.95 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.10 or approximately 12% year-over-year. The
primary driver of FPL's earnings growth was continued investment in the business. Average regulatory capital
employed grew roughly 9.7% over the same quarter last year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.7
billion for the quarter, and we expect our full-year capital investments to be between $5 billion and $5.5 billion. I will
discuss FPL's capital initiatives in more detail in a moment.

Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.5% for the 12 months ending March 2017. As a
reminder, under the new rate agreement, we maintain the ability to record reserve amortization entries to achieve a
predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12-month period. We began 2017 with a reserve amortization balance
of $1.25 billion and used $211 million during the first quarter to achieve the regulatory ROE of 11.5%.
As we previously discussed, we expect to use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, given the pattern of
our underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different. As you may recall, in 2016, we
entered the year with a reserve amortization balance of $263 million and utilized $176 million in the first quarter, but
ended the year with the balance of $250 million.
The Florida economy continues to show healthy results with recent unemployment rates near their lowest levels since
2007. Florida's consumer confidence level is at post-recession highs. The real estate sector continues to grow with
average building permits and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up 1.1% and 6.7%, respectively, versus the prior
year. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 65,000, or 1.3%, from the
comparable prior-year quarter, which is generally consistent with our long-term expectations for customer growth.
Overall usage for customer decreased 1.4% compared to the prior year. As we have previously noted, usage per
customer tends to exhibit significant volatility from quarter-to-quarter, which is more pronounced during periods of
abnormal weather conditions similar to those experienced during the first quarter.
On a 12-month rolling average, weather normalized customer usage has declined by negative 0.5%, consistent with our
long-term expectations averaging between 0% and approximately negative 0.5% per year. However, as a reminder, for
the full year 2016, we saw no negative impact from weather normalized customer usage. We will continue to closely
monitor customer usage trends going forward.
After accounting for these effects and the impact of a leap year day in 2016, first quarter retail sales decreased 1.2%
year-over-year. Looking ahead for 2017, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by the reserve amortization
balance, coupled with our weather normalized sales growth forecast and current CapEx and O&M expectations to
support a regulatory ROE towards the upper end of the allowed band of 9.60% to 11.60% under our new rate
agreement. As always, our expectations assume, among other things, normal weather and operating conditions.
Before moving on, let me now take a moment to update you on some of our key capital initiatives. During the first
quarter, FPL selected the sites for the initial projects being developed under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment, or SoBRA
mechanism, of the base rate settlement agreement. The approximately 600 megawatts of 2017 and 2018 solar is
comprised of eight 74.5-megawatt sites, which are expected to commence construction this spring with commercial
operation expected for half the sites by year-end 2017, and the remainder in the first quarter of 2018.
As a reminder, under the SoBRA, FPL was permitted to petition for recovery of up to 300 megawatts of cost effective
solar to be placed in service each year through 2020, and if approved, immediately begin recovering the cost of these
projects through rates upon commercial operation. By selecting optimal sites on FPL's transmission system and
leveraging the company's industry-leading construction, sourcing, and developing capabilities, these projects are
expected to produce millions of dollars in net lifetime savings for customers and will help to further diversify FPL's
fuel mix.
We continue to develop sites for the approximately 600 megawatts of solar capacity plan for 2019 and 2020 under the
SoBRA and we'll work to advance the additional 900 megawatts of solar that is included in our Ten Year Site Plan over
the next several years.
As part of the new Ten Year Site Plan, FPL also announced its intention to further modernize the Lauderdale plant in
Dania Beach, Florida with a new approximately 1,200-megawatt high efficiency natural gas plant that will begin
operation by mid-2022. This project, the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, will help FPL maintain its best-in-class
rank among major U.S. utilities for having the lowest operating and maintenance expenses measured on a cost per
kilowatt hour of retail sales.

By modernizing the plant that was last updated nearly a quarter century ago with current state-of-the-art technology,
FPL customers are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced fuel and operating and maintenance cost
over its operational life. FPL plans to initiate the Public Service Commission approval process for the modernization in
the second quarter.
Additionally, earlier this year, together with our joint interest owner, JEA, we announced the preliminary agreement to
decommission the St. Johns River Power Park, a 1,252-megawatt coal-fired plant in which FPL has a 20% ownership
stake. Similar to the Cedar Bay and Indiantown transactions, the early closure of the St. Johns plant in 2018, which we
intend to seek Commission approval of this spring, is expected to both reduce cost for FPL customers and significantly
reduce emissions. All of our ongoing capital initiatives are aimed at enhancing our overall customer value proposition
of delivering low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions for Florida customers.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of $476 million, or $1.01 per
share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $357 million, or $0.76 per share. Energy Resources contribution to
first quarter adjusted earnings per share increased $0.10 or approximately 15% from the prior year comparable period.
New investments added $0.35 per share. In 2016, we commissioned roughly 2,500 megawatts of new wind and solar
projects in the U.S. which was a record year for Energy Resources. Contributions from new investments and
renewables, together with the timing of tax incentives on certain projects, added $0.31 per share reflecting strong
contributions from these new project additions. New investments in natural gas pipeline added $0.04 per share.
Contributions from existing generation assets were essentially flat against the prior year comparable period as was
fleet-wide wind resource.
Contributions from our upstream gas infrastructure activities declined by $0.11 per share. As a result of sustained weak
commodity prices, in the first quarter of 2016, we elected not to invest capital in drilling certain wells, which resulted
in liquidation of in-the-money hedges and the resulting recognition of income. The absence of these hedged
liquidations this quarter combined with increased depreciation expense reflecting higher depletion rates were
responsible for the year-over-year decline.
Mild weather negatively affected our customer supply and trading business, where contributions declined by $0.04 per
share. All other impacts reduced results by $0.09 per share, including the effects of interest expense, reflecting
continued growth from the business and share dilution. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
At Energy Resources, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on one of the best environments for
renewables development in recent history. While state renewable portfolio standards continue to provide strong support
for wind and solar growth, customer origination activity continues to be largely driven by economics. Based upon
continued equipment efficiency improvements and cost declines, Energy Resources can offer wind PPAs at very
competitive prices. Similarly, solar is becoming more competitive on a levelized cost of energy basis across the
country.
We anticipate that improved wind and solar economics and low natural gas prices will continue to lead to additional
retirements of coal, nuclear and less fuel efficient oil- and gas-fired generation units, creating significant opportunities
for renewables growth going forward.
Additionally, over the long-term, as battery costs decline and efficiencies improve, we expect batteries to further
complement renewable economics, supporting additional demand as the tax credits phase down in the next decade. As
a result, we believe the size of the market potential for new renewables is larger than it has ever been, helping to drive
growth well into the next decade.
I am pleased to report that since the last call, we have signed contracts for roughly 413 megawatts of new wind
projects, including 368 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. We have also signed 208 megawatts of new solar projects,
including 177 megawatts for post-2018 delivery. These contracts are a reflection of the factors I just mentioned
combined with the continued success of our origination efforts as we capitalize on our competitive advantages in both
solar and wind.

In addition, one of our largest customers is purchasing over 1,000 megawatts of wind projects for self-ownership.
These projects represent a combination of development asset sales, where our customer finishes development activities
and manages construction, and build-own-transfer opportunities, in which Energy Resources turns the project over
prior to commercial operation.
With our strong internal origination efforts and large pipeline of development projects, Energy Resources has an ability
to recycle capital by sometimes selling developed sites to or building projects for others, who may want to own some
renewable assets outright. These efforts allow us to optimize our development portfolio and, in most cases, are
expected to help us secure additional PPAs.
More importantly, the project sales are expected to generate a significant portion of the after-tax NPV per kilowatt that
we would realize over the life of a contracted wind project; roughly 20% to 25% of the NPV for a development right
sale and roughly 40% to 50% of the NPV for a build-own-transfer project.
Our core business will continue to be to provide long-term contracts to customers. We believe the addressable
long-term contracted market remains as strong as ever with cooperatives, municipalities, commercial and industrial
customers, and most investor-owned utilities benefiting from the scale and other competitive advantages that Energy
Resources can provide.
The attached chart provides additional details on where our renewables development program now stands for 2017 and
beyond. We will give further details on our renewables development program at our investor conference, which we
plan to hold on June 22 in New York.
The development activities for our natural gas pipeline projects remain on track. Construction on the Florida pipelines
is progressing well and we expect an in-service date in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy's
investments in Sabal Trail Transmission and Florida Southeast Connection are expected to be roughly $1.5 billion and
$550 million, respectively.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline has continued to progress through the FERC process. We continue to expect to be in a
position to receive FERC notice to proceed later this year to support commercial operations by year-end 2018. NextEra
Energy's expected investment is roughly $1 billion.
Let me now review the highlights for NEP. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $170 million and cash available for
distribution was $40 million, up $29 million and $2 million, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter.
Overall results were consistent with our expectations.
Portfolio additions over the last year drove growth in adjusted EBITDA of approximately 21%. Adjusted EBITDA and
cash available for distribution from existing projects was roughly flat, declining by $2 million against the prior year
comparable quarter, primarily as a result of lower wind and solar generation.
For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 99% of long-term average versus 100% in the first quarter of 2016. Desert
Sunlight, which NEP acquired a 24% interest in during the fourth quarter of 2016, provided a minimal contribution to
first quarter cash available for distribution growth due to its seasonal generation profile and quarterly debt service
payments. Looking ahead, we expect substantial growth in cash available for distribution in the second and third
quarters of this year, as Desert Sunlight begins making meaningful contributions.
When viewed on a run rate basis, which removes the timing impact of acquisitions and their seasonal generation and
debt service profiles, annual cash available for distribution grew 18% over the prior year comparable quarter,
supporting the growth in LP distributions.
As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees, since we treat these as an operating expense. The impact of other
effects, including management fees and outside services, are shown on the accompanying slide.
We continue to execute on our plan to expand NEP's portfolio and I'm pleased to announce that NEP has reached an
agreement with Energy Resources to acquire the Golden West Wind Energy Center. Golden West is an approximately
250-megawatt wind project in Colorado that entered service in October 2015 and sold 100% of its output under a

25-year PPA. The transaction, which is expected to close in early May, represents another step toward growing LP unit
distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least
2022.
NEP expects to acquire the Golden West project for a total consideration of approximately $238 million, subject to
working capital and other adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $184 million in liabilities related to tax
equity financing. The acquisition is expected to contribute to adjusted EBITDA of approximately $53 million to $63
million and cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on an annual run rate basis
as of December 31, 2017. The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded entirely through existing debt
capacity and the asset is expected to further enhance the quality and diversity of NEP's existing portfolio while being
accretive to LP unit distributions.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2017, GAAP net income
attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.583 billion, or $3.37 per share. NextEra Energy's 2017 first quarter adjusted
earnings and adjusted EPS were $820 million and $1.75 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate
and Other segment decreased $0.4 per share compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of
FiberNet and the timing of certain tax items.
The sale of FiberNet at 16.7 times 2016 EBITDA, generated net cash proceeds of over $1.1 billion and a net after-tax
gain on disposition of approximately $685 million that is excluded from NextEra Energy's first quarter adjusted
earnings. NextEra Energy's operating cash flow adjusted for the impacts of certain FPL Clause recoveries and the
Indiantown acquisition increased by over 10% year-over-year.
Based on our first quarter performance at NextEra Energy, we remain comfortable with the expectations we have
previously discussed for the full year. For 2017, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy
to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.85, and at or near the upper-end of our previously disclosed 6% to 8% growth rate off
a 2016 base. As part of the financing for Oncor, NextEra entered into equity forward transactions for 12 million shares
which would provide approximately $1.5 billion in proceeds. Given that we do not have a current need for the equity,
we intend to settle the forward contract shortly in an orderly manner.
We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.30 for 2018, and for NextEra Energy's
compound annual growth rate and adjusted EPS to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2020, off a 2016 base while
maintaining our strong credit ratings. We also continue to expect to grow to our dividends per share 12% to 14% per
year through at least 2018, off a 2015 base of dividends per share of $3.08. As always, our expectations discussed
throughout today's call are subject to the usual caveats, including but not limited to normal weather and operating
conditions.
Turning now to NEP; at NEP, as I mentioned earlier, yesterday the NEP board declared a quarterly distribution of
$0.365 per common unit, or $1.46 per common unit on an annualized basis, representing a 15% increase over the
comparable distribution a year earlier. Our expectations for December 31, 2017, run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD
are unchanged at $875 million to $975 million, and $310 million to $340 million, respectively.
These expectations are subject to our normal caveats and are net of expected IDR fees, since we treat these as an
operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2016 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of
$1.41, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distribution as being a reasonable range of expectations
through at least 2022, subject to our usual caveats. As a result, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter of
2017 distribution that is payable in February 2018 to be in a range of $1.58 to $1.62 per common unit. We continue to
expect NextEra Energy Partners to achieve its distribution growth targets without issuing common equity for 2017 and,
potentially, 2018.
In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. FPL, Energy Resources, and NEP, all have
an outstanding set of opportunities across the board, and we are off to a strong start to 2017, as we continue to execute
well against all of our strategic and growth initiatives.

At FPL, we continue to focus on operational cost effectiveness, productivity, and making smart long-term investments
to further improve the quality, reliability, and efficiency of everything we do. Energy Resources maintain significant
competitive advantages to capitalize on the expanding market for renewables development and is continuing to make
strong progress on its natural gas pipeline development and construction efforts.
For NEP, growth in the North American renewables market and the origination success in Energy Resources continue
to expand the pipeline of potential drop-down assets and its long-term growth prospects remain stronger than ever,
providing benefits for both NEE and NEP. We remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities and
extending the long-term track record of delivering value to shareholders.
With that, we will now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Hi. Good morning and congratulations on good results.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Hey. Thank you, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: I wanted to explore the motion for rehearing in Texas and I wondered if you could just
speak to what that process might look like? And then, I guess, at the core of it, what I'm about are the conditions that
were set out that seemed very challenging and probably really don't set a good president for our industry, how could
those potentially be addressed through this process?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Steve, I'm going to defer that question to Jim.
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Steve, just from a process standpoint, and I get the day is pretty close; I think we have 25
days from when the final order went out to file through rehearing. The Commission then has 30 days to rule on that.
They can extend it for a bit, should they choose to. And so that's the kind of process that you're looking at in terms of
timing.
I think in terms of – obviously, we were disappointed in the decision. We think we would be a terrific owner of Oncor
for the state and for its customers. I think we would add enormous value to customers in Texas from how we would
operate the – how we'd operate the utility. So, in terms of anything else, I think, I guess the other two things I would
say is, obviously, we can't pay $18.7 billion for a utility that we can't run. And we can't control the board and we can't
have access to dividends. And it's just bad business to do anything other than that.
And so, you can expect that we will not be accepting any conditions that would not allow us to appoint the majority of
the board or have access to the dividends. I mean that's just – we've been very clear about that from the beginning on
this transaction and we continue to be very clear on it. And so, we remain very committed to trying to get it done. And
as I said, we'll be filing for a rehearing here shortly.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: Understood. And then, if I could just shift gears over to wind, we're certainly really
encouraged by wind economics improvements. Just looking now a bit further than maybe we typically do, when you
think about the changes to wind turbine technology, the next generation of blades and turbines, what's the approximate
timing for, really, the next generation and how should we think about potential step changes and improvements even
further in terms of wind economics and what that does to your addressable market?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. I think from a wind step-change standpoint, we had commented on the last call that
we expect wind to be about a $0.02 to $0.03 per kilowatt-hour product, without tax credits early in the next decade.
And we get comfortable with that largely, because of the step change and the improved economics that we see with
wind turbines.

First of all, we're expecting even a taller tower design, wider rotor diameter, towers getting to about 90 meter, rotors up
close to 130 meters, which could drive the NCF to right around 60%. You combine with what we expect to be
continued progressive reductions in turbine equipment pricing, which we think will get even more aggressive as the
PTC phases down, that's how we really get comfortable with that market.
And then when you think about the production tax credit actually phasing down right around 2023, we continue to be
optimistic about what we see on batteries. We have 20 people dedicated to our battery development effort. We're
investing upwards of $100 million a year in batteries. We're excited about the 50-megawatt battery storage pilot
program that FPL has. But imagine the game-changer that that would be for renewables, not only wind that blows
predominantly during the evening, but peak shaving economic opportunities around solar, that could really also help to
substantially drive renewable economics.
Granite batteries still have a long ways to go, they're still expensive, still inefficient, but with all the investment from
the automotive industry, the focus that you're seeing from our sector, we obviously want to be a leader. The Chinese
have announced that they plan to take a major role in battery manufacturing which is one of the factors that really help
to drive down the cost curve on PV panels. Those are all things that really make us very optimistic about the prospects
for renewables development as we head into the next decade.
<Q - Stephen Calder Byrd>: That's great color. Thank you very much.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Two questions. First, I guess, this is for Jim. Obviously, you're pursuing rehearing
on Oncor, but assuming that, that doesn't work out and you're kind of in the stand-alone case, which – it sounds like
you're thinking, you could hit the upper end of your growth rate, kind of how important is looking at other M&A in the
future? I have some investors who say, strategically, you guys need to do a deal. Could you just kind of give your view
on that?
<A - James L. Robo>: Sure. Sure, Steve. So, I think, John said on the call, excluding Oncor, we'd be disappointed if
we didn't earn at the top end of the 6% to 8% range through 2020 from an EPS standpoint. And we're very comfortable
with that, we're very comfortable with our organic growth prospects. We do not have to do anything. I love our
stand-alone prospects. I love our two businesses. They have tremendous opportunity to deliver growth for shareholders,
and also tremendous opportunity to do good things for customers. And so, I love our two businesses on a stand-alone
basis.
M&A is hard; I think we've seen in the last month in our industry how hard it is. And any – our perspective on M&A
really hasn't changed for a very long time, which is it – that – anything that we would do, if we were to do something,
would have to be really compelling for shareholders. As I said, it's very hard to do, and we're – as always, we're going
to stay disciplined and let me just reinforce, again, we don't have to do anything on the M&A front because we really
do love our stand-alone organic growth prospects.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Good. And then, on the – just a question on renewables, so if you look at the – your
2017 to 2018 development targets, you still have a decent amount to fill-in to get to your kind of current expectations.
Could you just give color how you're feeling about getting to that?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Hey, Steve; Armando. We feel good or we would have obviously changed the
numbers. I think we said at the last call that there was a lot of activity really through the four years for wind from 2017
through 2020. And honestly, there's a lot of activity in the market right now for solar from 2018 to 2021. So, we
continue to see folks that are interested in bringing renewables in, in 2018. Even if the price may be a little bit higher
for them, they understand that.

But for their own reasons, whether it's commercial and industrial folks that have something internally to get done or
whether it's folks on the utility – broadly defined the utility space, that have made commitments to regulators or others,
they're interested in 2018.
So, I don't know ultimately how it will work out, but we looked at it again this quarter based on the activity that we
have in-house and what we know is coming down the pipe, we continue to feel comfortable with the range.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Turning to the utility business, when you talk about the 8% growth rate and using sort of the
settlement agreement as a benchmark, what's in the capital plan today and what's not? Refresh my memory, but I
believe the plan that was approved by the Commission allowed up to 300 megawatts a year of solar, but it sounds like
your opportunity set is a lot higher than that. So, what are you planning on doing? And then, some of the new initiatives
you've announced, like the proposal to knock down and rebuild the gas plants. Could you just give us what's in the base
line and what the opportunity set is?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. Sure. I mean one is the transmission and distribution; continued storm hardening, the
automation effort that we have there. We have the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center opportunity as well. We have the
1,200 megawatts of solar. I'll get to the extra 900 megawatts in a minute that are part of the SoBRA adjustment.
We have the 50-megawatt battery storage opportunity, although we'd have to recover in rates during the next rate case
on that. We still have combustion parts improvements that we continue to make to the existing facilities, continue to
complete the peaker upgrades that we have talked about previously. And then, we have all the opportunities that we
laid out in the Ten Year Site Plan, which are incremental.
First of all, the additional 900 megawatts of solar, which we have secured better than 3 gigawatt of sites in Florida for,
that we'd like to be able to execute on over the next several years. Obviously, we're in a good position with our surplus
amortization balance. And then the Lauderdale opportunity that we announced as well, which would be more of a 2022,
I think, COD that we would pursue there.
And then, obviously, the St. Johns opportunity that I've mentioned earlier. We continue to find smart investment
opportunities to clean up the emissions profile in Florida; continue to make NextEra Energy and FPL one of the
cleanest emissions generators of all top 50 power producers in the country, and we'll continue to try to identify further
opportunities going forward. But those are the things that really drive that 8% regulatory capital employed growth.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Forgive me for following up on the solar. If you chose to go ahead because you have the
opportunity in the sites to go build more than what's in the current settlement plan, what's the recovery mechanism for
that?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: So, Greg, this is Eric Silagy. So, outside of the rate agreement, if we went ahead and did solar,
then we would seek to recover that during the next rate proceeding. That would be the mechanism we would do that.
So, we're looking at opportunities on identifying sites. We'll determine whether or not we want to do that before we go
into the next rate proceeding or afterwards.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And two quick questions...

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Yes.
<A - James L. Robo>: Hey, Greg. This is Jim. Just one last thing on that. We're going to – you can expect that in the
June investor conference that we will lay that out with some details.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. Two more quick ones, just to be clear on the – when you say you're
going to settle the forward sale, that mean you're not issuing the equity?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: That is correct.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. And then, the numbers were great in the quarter, but you had that $0.11 headwind from
upstream gas and you described very clearly why. When I look in the appendix of your release and I look at the
expected EBITDA and PTC contribution from upstream and midstream, which is $190 million to $290 million and $95
million to $195 million, that guidance is a function of your expectation that you're going to behave this way with regard
to those investments or should we expect that...
<A - James L. Robo>: Yeah. Yeah.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: ...at the low end or below the low end?
<A - James L. Robo>: Yeah. Remember, Greg, we didn't add any new projects, right, that really impacted Q1
performance because of economics, but we continue to, through our development efforts, look for further upstream
opportunities that would satisfy that forecast that we have outlined in our materials.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Thanks, Paul. Good morning.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: As you look at investment opportunity, you've really deepened your roots across the energy
platform. Would you ever look at an LDC?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Well, a couple of things I'll say about LDC is, one is they tend to go off at very high
premiums. It's just hard to make the economics work on an LDC and then you've got to get comfortable with the
liability profile associated with an LDC as well.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thank you. And...
<A - John W. Ketchum>: They tend to be expensive, and we're only interested in doing transactions that create
long-term shareholder value.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: On your repowering, does your entire capital program capture 100% of the PTC or are any of
those phased down to 80%?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Your capital program for repowering the wind turbines, will all of those projects get 100% of
the PTC or is the timing -
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yes. Yeah. They all get 100% of the production tax credit; that's correct. The test on the
80%, it's an 80%-20% test in terms of determining whether or not it's a new turbine. We get 100% of PTC.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And back to M&A, are the rating agencies comfortable enough with the contractiveness of
Energy Resources? Is utility life enough that you don't need to do anything to rebalance the portfolio?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. Just to be clear, we do not need to do an acquisition to meet the growth prospects and
maintain the credit ratings that we have through our guidance period.
<A - James L. Robo>: Yeah. Just to be very clear, we will have very strong credit metrics in 2020, even with the
growth that we'd expect out of both FPL and Energy Resources through 2020.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Great. Thank you.
<A - James L. Robo>: No need to do M&A to rebalance the balance sheet and I know there has been a lot of investor
questions about that, just to put that to bed, hopefully, once and for all.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Jerimiah Booream with UBS.
<Q - Jerimiah Booream>: Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the economics of build-own-transfer and
development rights on the wind side. Obviously, you've had a couple of big announcements recently. How does that
flow through the income statement and, really, what's the kind of near-term earnings, incremental opportunity that we
should think about there?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. I mean, there is two impacts, right. There's book in cash; we talked a little about cash
impacts on the call. We said, out of these opportunities – think about them in mean two ways. One are development
right sales, which we put the NPV on a kilowatt basis, when you compare it to long-term contracted, new build's at
about 20% to 25%. And then a build-own-transfer, if you look at that on an after-tax NPV kilowatt basis, it's probably
about 40% to 50% of the NPV of a long-term contracted basis. So, that's cash. On the book side, obviously, you're
going to generate a gain off those sales. In those gains, would we don't think be material and would be reflected in our
income statement.
<Q - Jerimiah Booream>: Okay. And then also just more specifically on the commercial and industrial opportunity, I
mean, how many of the PPAs that you're signing are really more focused on the C&I sphere going forward versus
traditional PPAs?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: It's Armando. Just let me go back to the previous question just a second and I'll get to
that one too. So, I just want to put it in context, right. We have an updated numbers on our pipeline for wind and solar
in a while. And I just want everybody to understand, we've got a lot of development out there.
When we talked a couple of years ago by how we were essentially doubling the amount of G&A that we put into both
the wind and the solar business through 2018 and we're doing that. So, today, just in terms of what I call inventory,
we've got 10 gigawatts to 12 gigawatts of inventory on its way to 20 gigawatts here in the near future on wind; and
we've got about 10 gigawatts of solar that's on its way to 20 gigawatts here in the near future. So, we've got a lot of
opportunities out there for projects. So, if once in a while someone is interested in doing some development and it
makes sense for us, then we've got the inventory to be able to do that.
On the C&I side, C&I gets a lot of press and so on. It's still not a giant portion of the market. It's a market that we've
looked at, it's a market that we've played in, it's a market that we've originated. It is a market that we will probably do
more of than we've done in the past in certain regions. But it's also a market that doesn't make sense for us in certain
regions where folks are looking for very short-term contracts in places where we've got to take a significant amount of
merchant risk in the term year.

So, my expectation is, it could be 20% of what we do on a go-forward basis, but I think the traditional stuff that we've
been doing with the IOUs [investor-owned utilities], the munis, the co-ops, and so on, will continue to be the bulk of
that business for us.
<Q - Jerimiah Booream>: Okay. That's great. And then just one last one from me. On the legislation in Florida right
now on gas reserves, could you just talk about any kind of stumbling blocks there and what the – and any kind of
material changes would be versus the previous program?
<A - Eric E. Silagy>: Yeah. This is Eric. So, we're right now in the midst of the legislative session. And so, there are a
number of hurdles for that legislation to clear. So, it's by no means certain that gas reserves legislation would actually
clear both houses. So, at this point, I think it's just speculative to try to predict what is going to happen, because there's
a lot of areas that need to be covered, lot of water needs to be covered within the legislative process at this point.
<Q - Jerimiah Booream>: Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Hey, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just wanted to make – weave together a couple of the themes you've already talked
about. So, the Xcel model of BOT and some development sales, do you see the utility market shifting in that direction
and that this might – or was that kind of a one-off as you're looking at go forward?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: No, we do not see the market shifting in that direction and I think that's the point Armando
was making just a minute ago. I mean, we continue to see a very strong long-term contracted market, made up of our
typical customers, whether it's munis and co-ops, C&I, most investor-owned utilities.
With the build-own-transfer like we're able to do with Xcel where you can see an opportunity to generate an attractive
NPV off of a sale and yet get contracts back from a customer who's been one of your largest customers, those can be
attractive situations. But our core business is going to continue to be the long-term contracted business. And when we
look out and we'll lay this out at the June Investor Conference, we really see the market continuing to stay at the level
it's been in the past on the long-term contracted opportunity set side.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So, your preference is more to stay in that space? I was just curious whether there
were sort of a balance sheet angle that – with these – the changing NPV, but you have less balance sheet tied up. So,
maybe that would reduce some of the rationale around the Oncor transaction, where you certainly portrayed it at the
time as something that would give the ability to max your development activities?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Jonathan, that market – and I know it's gotten a lot of play here recently. But that rate
base market, if you go back historically, year-in, year-out, I mean people have been building rate base on the wind side
for the last decade, and it's averaged about 15% of the market. Could it go up a little bit? Yeah, maybe it will go up a
little bit, but it's a small portion of the overall market.
And so, we don't – so, although there were some transactions here recently, at least our view right now is, and even if it
goes up a little bit, it's just not a significant part of the market. And if there are people that are interested and we can
help them help us with our inventory, then we might look at the transaction, why not. John mentioned some economics
are attractive, but I wouldn't spend honestly that much time thinking about whether what happened during the last three
months has turned the market around. The rate base market is just not that large.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. And then, I just want to clarify one thing. You talked about 1,000-megawatt
transaction at the beginning. I wasn't sure if that was something a new one that hasn't yet been announced or were you

And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Yeah, guys. Just curious, Project Accelerate, is there any way to quantify what the EBITDA
or EPS benefits from it would be, and which of the businesses kind of more or less impacted by it?
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. I mean, first of all, Project Accelerate is an initiative that we said on last call will
generate several hundred million dollars in run rate savings going forward. We will give more details on it at the June
Investor Conference, but it affects all of our businesses. I mean, we're reimaging all of the businesses at NextEra
Energy Resources, at FPL finding smarter ways to leverage technology, and other approaches to each of our individual
business lines, and we will lay that out including EPS impacts from that at the Investor Conference.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: But when you say several hundred million dollars, meaning on a pre-tax income run rate
eventually or on a discount and cash flow type of view.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah, on a pre-tax run rate basis going forward.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. I mean, that's a pretty material – on an after-tax basis, that would be a pretty material
driver of an EPS uptick over time.
<A - John W. Ketchum>: Yeah. But remember that Project Accelerate is included in the expectations that we
provided.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. Okay.
<A - James L. Robo>: And the other thing, Michael, to remember is FPL is roughly two-thirds of the company, and
you cannot take the several hundred – two-thirds of that run rate create surplus, it doesn't create earnings, okay.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Understood.
<A - James L. Robo>: So, you got be very careful about how you think about it from an earnings standpoint.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Understood. No, that benefit over time would actually accrue to the customer, once you hit
the 11.5%, 11.6% range. Unrelated question; just curious, Jim or Armando, for your thoughts on the prospects in the
economics of offshore wind in the U.S.?
<A - James L. Robo>: So, Michael, we have looked at offshore winds. We spent a lot – I personally spent an
enormous amount of time looking at it for a very big customer of ours back when I was running Energy Resources.
And we came away from that effort of not being the big fan of offshore wind for several reasons.
One is, it effectively, from a construction standpoint, very hard to get comfortable that you can never – it strikes to me
more as a new nuclear than it does of onshore wind in terms of the construction risk you take, right? It's marine
construction, the O&M associated with it is challenged. If the seas are high, you can't – you have to fly out to fix the
turbines as opposed to get in a boat and go out there to do it. There is an enormous number of hurdles that you need to
get to.

And then you get to the biggest hurdle, which is just, it's bad economics for customers, right? I mean, we've been very
proud that we've done good economic renewables for customers and we think onshore wind and onshore solar and,
frankly, solar in New England will be probably a third of the cost of offshore wind. It is really, really not good for
customers to be doing offshore winds relative to onshore solar or onshore wind. So, to say that we're not fans would be
an understatement and I don't think it's good for customers and, frankly, I think it's – we certainly wouldn't do it. We
think it's too risky.
