Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today
are: Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Sandy Peterson, Group Worldwide
Chairman; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available to a broader audience via webcast
accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I will begin by briefly reviewing
highlights of the second quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my
remarks Alex will provide some additional commentary on our results and an update on our near-term priorities and

Sandy will provide an update on our Consumer business and our global supply chain.
Please note the presentations that accompany Sandy's and Alex's remarks are available on our website. Dominic will
provide additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for 2013. We will then open the call to your
questions. We expect the call to last approximately 1.5 hours.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and or
businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the
press release.
Before I get into the results let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's
actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or
developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online.
During the review non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables
reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press
release let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to
customers were $17.9 billion for the second quarter of 2013, up 8.5% as compared to the second quarter of 2012. On an
operational basis, sales were up 10% and currency had a negative impact of 1.5%.
In the U.S. sales were up 8%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 11.8% while the effect of
currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.8 points. Sales included the impact of the
acquisition of Synthes net of the divestitures of the DePuy Trauma business. Excluding this impact worldwide
operational sales growth was 5.6%
The Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 14% operationally while Europe grew 11.4% on an operational
basis. Asia-Pacific Africa region grew 11% operationally. The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made
strong contributions to the results in all regions.
If you will now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.8 billion compared to $1.4 billion
in the same period in 2012. Earnings per share were $1.33 versus $0.50 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the
box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items.
As referenced in the accompanying table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2013 second quarter net earnings were
adjusted to exclude special items related to increases in litigation expense accruals, integration and transaction costs
related to the acquisition of Synthes, and costs associated with the DePuy ASR Hip program.
Second quarter 2012 net earnings included after-tax special items of approximately $2.2 billion as shown in the
accompanying reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these special items for both periods, net
earnings for the current quarter were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.48, representing increases of
17.7% and 13.8% respectively as compared to the same period in 2012.
I would now like to make some additional comments relative to components leading to earnings before we move on to
the segment highlights. For the second quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 30.7% was down 50 basis points from the
same period last year primarily due to positive mix, lower costs associated with strong volume growth in our
Pharmaceutical business and cost improvement initiatives across all the businesses. This was partially offset by
incremental amortization expense related to Synthes of approximately $140 million or 80 basis points and the impact of
the medical device excise tax. Second quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 30.1% of sales,
consistent with our 2012 results.

Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.9%, up 20 basis points due to milestone
payments.
Interest expense, net of interest income of $101 million, was down $28 million versus the second quarter of 2012 due to
a lower average debt level.
Other expense, net of other income, was $172 million in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $2 billion in the same
period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $394 million was $220 million favorable
compared to 2012. The gain on the sale of the Elan investment is reflected in this amount.
Excluding special items the effective tax rate was 20% in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 21.6% in the same
period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his remarks.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products
or businesses for the second quarter of 2013. I will begin with the Consumer segment.
Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the second quarter 2013 of $3.7 billion increased 1.1% as compared to the
same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 1.7% while the impact of currency was negative 0.6%.
U.S. sales were up 1% while international sales grew 2% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of divestitures
net of acquisitions operational growth was approximately 2.5%.
Baby Care products increased on an operational basis by 3.1% when compared to the second quarter of 2012 primarily
due to hair care and cleansers. Sales in the Oral Care business increased operationally 0.2%. Results were driven by
strong international sales of LISTERINE due to the continued success of new product launches partially offset by the
impact of the divestiture of manual toothbrushes in North America.
Beginning this quarter, we are reporting OTC pharmaceuticals separately and have nutritionals to the other line. To
assist in updating your models, a summary under the new format is included in the sales schedules that accompany the
press release.
For the second quarter of 2013 sales for OTC pharmaceuticals increased 5.4% on an operational basis compared to the
same period in 2012. U.S. sales were up 17.4% driven by strong growth in analgesics and other key brands as we
continue to make progress in returning a reliable supply of products to the marketplace. International sales were up
0.9% operationally.
Our Skin Care business was down 0.4% on an operational basis in the second quarter of 2013. Strong results for
AVEENO were offset by the impact of divestitures. Excluding divestitures, operational growth was approximately 1%.
Women's health grew 3.6% on an operational basis due to strong growth in women's sanitary protection products.
Women's care other sales decreased 4.3% on an operational basis impacted by competitive pressures as well as a
divestiture in nutritionals. That completes our review of the Consumer segment and I'll now review highlights for the
Pharmaceutical segment.
Worldwide net sales for second quarter of $7 billion increased 11.7% versus the same period last year. On an
operational basis, sales increased 12.9% with a negative currency impact of 1.2 points. Sales in the U.S. increased 9.1%
while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 16.5%.
Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas, immunology products grew 17.6% operationally with sales in the
U.S. up 7.3% and sales outside the U.S. up 51.5% operationally. During the quarter the company made certain supply
chain changes for REMICADE resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales now being
international sales. Adjusting for this impact the U.S. immunology growth was approximately 14% with REMICADE
excluding export sales up approximately 4%, SIMPONI up 38.1% and STELARA up 53.3%. Results were driven by
market growth across the major products complemented by increased market share for both STELARA and SIMPONI.
With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the US market leader in immunology.

Adjusted immunology sales outside the U.S. increased by over 25% operationally with REMICADE up approximately
20% due to strong growth in Canada and the emerging markets including a tender shipment. STELARA made
significant contributions due to market share gains and market growth across major regions while very strong growth in
Japan drove the results for SIMPONI. Sales of infectious disease products increased 23.9% on an operational basis.
INCIVO, a treatment for hepatitis C, grew 71.8% on an operational basis due to the success of the continued rollout,
most notably in Latin America, as well as a shipment for tender business. Continued momentum in market share
growth of PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results as did the combined sales of COMPLERA and
EDURANT.
Neuroscience product sales increased 0.4% operationally. U.S. sales declined 4.9% impacted by generic competition
primarily for CONCERTA. The long-acting injectable antipsychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA
SUSTENNA or XEPLION, achieved operational growth of approximately 15% due to an increase in combined market
share.
Sales of oncology products increased 53.2% on an operational basis due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA and
VELCADE. ZYTIGA is now approved to treat both chemo refractory and chemo naive metastatic castration resistant
prostate cancer. In the quarter ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of 70% with U.S. sales growing 54% due to
very strong market growth of over 20% and increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate resistant
prostate cancer market. ZYTIGA has captured over 30% of that market and is up approximately 3.5 points sequentially.
Operational sales outside the U.S. grew 85.2% versus second quarter 2012 and on a sequential basis ZYTIGA was up
over 20%. Additional country rollouts and the expansion of the label to chemo naïve patients drove the strong results.
ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries.
VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 22.7% on an operational basis. Strong performance in
patient share in the front line setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continued to drive sales growth. Other
oncology increased primarily due to DOXIL/CAELYX. Other Pharmaceutical products declined 2.7% on an
operational basis with lower sales for EPREX and PARIET related primarily to generic competition. PROCRIT sales
declined 18.1% due primarily to a market decline.
Positively impacting results, XARELTO sales grew over 20% on a sequential basis, capturing nearly 39% of new to
brand scripts in cardiology surpassing warfarin. Total prescription share in the broader anticoagulant market grew 1.5
points on a sequential basis to 7.4%.
As an update on the pipeline, during the quarter in immunology the FDA approved SIMPONI for the treatment of
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and the EMA application for SIMPONI IV for the treatment of adults
with moderately to severely active RA was resubmitted. In infectious diseases, a marketing authorization application
was submitted to the European Medicines Agency seeking approval for simeprevir for hepatitis C and it was granted
U.S. priority review status by the FDA with a PDUFA in late November. The European Commission approved a new
twice-daily dosing for INCIVO.
In neuroscience regarding bapineuzumab, Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy and its alliance partner Pfizer have
decided to discontinue development of the subcutaneous formulation. Studies with other compounds in earlier stages of
development in the alliance portfolio are ongoing and future development strategies will be discussed jointly by the
alliance partners. We remain committed to our efforts to discover and develop promising new treatments for people
with Alzheimer's disease.
Regarding the stent thrombosis sNDA for XARELTO a complete response letter was received from the FDA. We
remain confident in the results of the Atlas ACS trial and are in ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding this
sNDA.
In oncology, breakthrough therapy designation for daratumumab for the treatment of certain patients with multiple
myeloma was granted by the FDA and a positive opinion from the European authorities on two variations relating to
the use of VELCADE were received. The first recommendation for the use of VELCADE is retreatment in adults who
have previously responded to the treatment with the same medicine. The second recommendation was for use in

induction combination therapy for certain adult patients.
And, ibrutinib was submitted to the FDA for use in the treatment of previously treated patients with Chronic
Lymphocytic Leukemia or CLL and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma or SLL and for its use in treatment of previously
treated patients with Mantle Cell Lymphoma or MCL.
That completes the review of the Pharmaceutical segment. I'll now review the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment
results.
Worldwide Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment sales of $7.2 billion grew 12% operationally as compared to the
same period in 2012. Currency had a negative impact of 2.4 points resulting in a total sales increase of 9.6%. Sales
excluding the net impact of Synthes were up 0.5% on an operational basis with U.S. sales down 3.3% and sales outside
the U.S. up 3.5% on an operational basis. Adjusted for divestitures and exits from certain businesses, underlying
growth was approximately 1.5% reflecting continued market and pricing pressures. I will provide more commentary on
these factors in the franchise reviews.
Now turning to the MD&D businesses starting with cardiovascular care, cardiovascular care sales were up 7.7%
operationally with the U.S. up 4.6% and sales outside the U.S. up 9.6% operationally driven by Biosense Webster, our
electrophysiology business, with worldwide operational growth up over 16% in the quarter. The success of a number of
catheter launches made strong contributions to the results.
The diabetes care business operational sales declined 11.8% in the second quarter of 2013 with the U.S. business down
23.1%, due to the impact of lower price, competitive pressures and softness in the retail market. The business outside
the U.S. was down 0.5% operationally with strong growth in the emerging markets offset by lower sales in many of the
developed markets.
The diagnostics business declined 4% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of the divestitures of RhoGAM
and Therakos businesses operational sales grew approximately 2.5% primarily due to growth in donor screening in the
U.S. and emerging markets outside the U.S.
Infection prevention increased 5.2% on an operational basis with sales in the U.S. down 4% due to lower sales of
capital equipment. Outside the U.S. operational growth of 12.3% was driven by both consumables and capital item
sales.
Orthopedic sales were up 48.9% on an operational basis when compared to the same period in 2012. Excluding the net
impact of Synthes operational sales were up approximately 3% with the U.S. up approximately 2.5% and outside the
U.S. up approximately 3.5% operationally.
Operationally, hips were up 4% worldwide driven by 5% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem
platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were up 4% on an operational basis
driven mainly by heads and acetabular products.
Knees worldwide increased 2% on an operational basis with the U.S. up 3% driven by the ATTUNE fixed bearing knee
as well as revision platforms offset by lower sales of rotating platforms. Sales outside the U.S. were up 1%.
Including the Synthes business in both periods and excluding the divested DePuy trauma business in both periods,
trauma grew approximately 4% on operational basis due to both new products and stronger underlying demand.
Growth in the U.S. was 2% and 7% operational outside the U.S. Including the Synthes business in both periods
worldwide spine was down 2% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 7%, impacted by continued
softness in the market as well as the impact of the attrition of the commercial sales organization as we integrate the
businesses. Outside the U.S., sales were up approximately 6% operationally with strong growth in Latin America,
Canada and Asia-Pacific.
Specialty surgery operational growth was 2.8% in the second quarter of 2013. U.S. sales were down 1.5% and sales
outside the U.S. were up 7.5% on an operational basis. Strong sales of balloon sinuplasty products from Acclarent and
biosurgical products were partially offset by lower sales of MENTOR products due to competitive and pricing

pressures.
Sales of energy products were flat on an operational basis with new product launches and continued penetration driving
strong sales outside the U.S. offset by softer sales of HARMONIC products in the U.S.
Surgical care worldwide sales were down 1.2% on an operational basis with the U.S. down 4.2% and sales outside the
U.S. up 0.6% operationally. Negatively impacting growth were divestitures and business exits. Excluding these items,
the underlying business was flat with lower sales of women's health and urology offset by strong demand for
endocutter products with the ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler.
Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment, our vision care business achieved operational
sales growth of 5.4% in the second quarter with the U.S. up 3.6% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.4% operationally.
Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses.
That completes highlights for the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for
Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2013. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?
Alex Gorsky
Hello, everyone, and thank you, Louise, and thanks everyone for joining us on this call today. It's really my pleasure to
review our results for the first half of the year and also the progress we made on our near-term priorities.
Now you'll recall in January that I discussed the framework for managing our business. The success of our enterprise is
built first on our credo which unites Johnson & Johnson as a global enterprise. Our strategic operating principles
continue to serve us well in the evolving marketplace and with our four growth drivers we have a sound approach to
sustaining and driving growth in today's dynamic global healthcare environment.
At the midyear point we've achieved strong growth across our enterprise. A year ago our team established a set of
critical near-term priorities for moving the business forward and as part of our commitment to keeping you appraised of
how we are doing against them, I'm pleased to say that with the laser-focused approach we have taken, we've made
solid, demonstrable progress in delivering on our financial commitments, restoring a reliable supply of OTC products
to consumers, continuing the successful integration of Synthes, and building on the strong momentum in our
Pharmaceutical business.
Reflecting our broad base of leadership in healthcare, we have generated sales of $35.4 billion thus far in 2013, up a
strong 9.9% operationally versus this time a year ago, 4.8% operationally excluding the net impact of Synthes.
Medical Devices & Diagnostics represents 40% of our total sales, generating $14.3 billion in sales year-to-date. Sales
grew 12% operationally driven by the positive growth contributions of the Synthes acquisition. Excluding Synthes,
overall growth in this segment was impacted by portfolio decisions to divest and exit certain businesses as well as the
continued economic and pricing pressures within these markets. Underlying growth was essentially flat year-to-date.
With $13.8 billion, the Pharmaceutical segment represented 39% of our total sales and has continued its strong
momentum, reporting operational growth of 12.1%. And our Consumer segment generated 21% of our total sales at
$7.3 billion in revenue at an operational growth rate of 2.4%.
Now as the global economy evolves, more people are entering the middle class in emerging markets and increasing
demands on the healthcare system. As I outlined at our year-end earnings meeting in January, we're investing in growth
and expansion in the broader emerging markets by leveraging our strong iconic brands as well as acquiring
market-specific products and, today, they account for nearly a quarter of our sales.
As a subset of the emerging markets, we're also seeing growth in the BRIC nations which account for approximately
10% of our overall sales this year. And we're encouraged by the double-digit growth rates we're seeing in these
countries driven by our core Pharmaceutical, MD&D and Consumer brands, as well as the complementary acquisitions
we made in Russia and China. As our global reach and local focus strategy for driving growth matures, we will over

time be introducing more products that will increase options for consumers in these fast-growing parts of the world.
Moving now to the segment highlights. I'll start with Pharmaceuticals.
Our Pharmaceutical segment continues to drive robust growth through the delivery of meaningful innovations that will
improve patient care, demonstrating the effect of the transformation we've made in this segment. I am very proud of the
accomplishments that our pharma team has exhibited in this process. Our market-leading execution in support of the 11
new products we've launched since 2009 has led our Pharmaceuticals business to a record 13 consecutive quarters of
operational growth. That pace positions us as the fastest-growing top 10 global pharmaceutical company and the U.S.
leader in new product sales.
Those new products which include ZYTIGA, STELARA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA comprise 24% of our global
Pharmaceutical sales in the first half of 2013. Now we gave you a full review of our Pharmaceutical business in May at
which time we announced our intention to file more than 10 new molecular entities and 25 significant brand line
extensions by 2017. So today I will just comment on two important developments we made in the quarter within our
oncology division since the meeting which will really help to increase our leadership position in the category.
As we announced last week ibrutinib became one of first medicines to be filed with the FDA under the new
breakthrough therapy designation and if approved it will be a first in class treatment option for patients who have
received prior therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma and also for patients who
have received prior therapy for mantle cell lymphoma, populations who today have very limited options.
Now recognizing this need, we and our strategic partners at Pharmacyclics are pleased to have been able to open an
expanded access program for relapsed or refractory MCL patients in the U.S. The program began enrolling in May and
is allowed by the FDA as a means of making an investigational drug available to patients with a serious or immediately
life-threatening disease without comparable or satisfactory alternatives.
We also announced a definitive agreement to acquire Aragon Pharmaceuticals, a move that will add their androgen
receptor antagonist program to our R&D engine including their lead development stage product ARN-509 for prostate
cancer which is attractive to us because of the way it complements ZYTIGA while also increasing the options we can
eventually offer patients in this important and growing segment of the oncology field.
So now let's look at the market performance of some of our recent Pharmaceutical launches. By combining superior
science with best in class commercial capabilities many of our newly launched products are delivering robust growth
and outpacing our peers. As you can see, XARELTO, which is the broadest indication among the novel oral
anticoagulants, is tracking well ahead of warfarin and the others in the category in new to brand prescriptions among
cardiologists. And ZYTIGA is continuing on its strong growth trajectory gaining 22% in the U.S. chemo naïve market
since its approval in this indication in December.
INVOKANA, our new treatment for Type 2 diabetes, was launched in the U.S. in April and is demonstrating very
strong early results with both primary care and endocrinologists. Access for INVOKANA is also building steadily and
we are seeing strong interest from payers. Overall 80% of patients with commercial plans now have access to
INVOKANA in either Tier 2 or Tier 3. This success coupled with the support of joining the forces of our
Pharmaceutical group with our diabetes care business has helped INVOKANA overtake Januvia, Onglyza and
Tradjenta in share of new to brand prescriptions in the important endocrinologist segment.
This type of early progress demonstrates the power of leveraging our enterprise wide capabilities to offer patients a full
solutions-based approach to diabetes management. And we're looking at leveraging our broad capabilities across the
enterprise to support the growth of our products in other categories in similar ways.
As I referred to earlier, the pace of growth in the global MD&D market has slowed and competition is intensifying. In
spite of the economic compression however, the medical device industry remains attractive and we're transforming our
go to market approach to drive our competitiveness in this dynamic environment and ensure we continue to lead the
sector. With market-leading platforms and products we've succeeded in sustaining or growing share in the majority of
our key platforms holding #1 or #2 positions in about 85% of them.

We are continuing to bring innovations to patients and providers through meaningful product launches that will help
sustain and drive growth and we're especially excited about the steady cadence of innovation emerging across the
segment. For example Biosense Webster, a business unit that's on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth
as it has for more than 10 years in a row. Their nMARQ circular ablation catheter is designed to reduce cardiac ablation
procedure time and complexity, two key customer needs. It was launched last year in Europe and we began enrolling
patients in the clinical trial that will support our regulatory filing in the U.S. planned for next year.
Also the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH catheter is an important innovative product that measures the catheter tip
contact force and direction inside the heart during ablation procedures in real time. We launched this product in the
E.U. in 2012 and compelling new safety and efficacy data were presented recently at the Heart Rhythm Society
meeting. These data will be included in our application for U.S. approval that we plan to submit later this year.
We are also bringing products to patients that meet specific market needs. The BIOSEAL Fibrin Sealant in China is just
one of many. We're also focusing our resources to advance more strategic options in our portfolio that start with taking
a comprehensive view on the disease, like we've done in large chronic disease states such as diabetes.
Now to help bend the cost curve in healthcare, we're focusing our broad and diverse R&D approach and portfolio to
deliver total solutions of products that will increase the clinical value we offer patients and providers as well as the
economic value we offer for healthcare systems and payers across the globe. Consider the ATTUNE knee system
which DePuy Synthes has just recently launched. The development team conducted extensive research into the design
to help improve functional outcomes for patients, performance for surgeons and efficiency for providers.
From the patient perspective, ATTUNE is designed to provide better range of motion and address the unstable feeling
some knee replacement patients experience and it also provides an extensive range of sizes for better patient matching.
From the provider perspective, simply reducing the number of instruments used with ATTUNE in addition to several
innovative design features flattens the learning curve and delivers more efficiencies for the surgeon and operating room
staff.
Now an update on DePuy Synthes, we're a year into the integration and as we envisioned, by broadening our base of
offerings and expanding our reach in emerging markets, we have built a compelling growth combination that solidified
our leadership in the $40 billion global orthopaedics and neurologics marketplace. Our joint reconstruction business
continues to do well, especially with hips in the U.S., which have grown approximately 5% thus far in 2013, and the
ATTUNE knee that I just described has had a favorable initial response.
In trauma, we are encouraged by the second quarter results that generated mid-single digit operational growth in
international markets fueled by Europe as well as in emerging markets, notably China. In spine, disruption due to sales
force attrition has improved and favorable increases in volume are being seen as the sales force continues to see
momentum with cross-selling by the combined forces, especially outside the U.S., with operational growth this past
quarter in the mid-single digits.
While we still have work to do in certain areas of the integration, we're making good progress and we're seeing the
benefits of bringing a broader portfolio of products to our customers through cross-selling including the collaboration
between our Cranio-maxillofacial and Codman businesses. We're also looking forward to similar results as they begin
cross-selling products from our power tools and biomaterials platforms.
As we advance, we see additional growth and synergy opportunities within the organization and we are turning our
attention to R&D, manufacturing and supply chain and to standardizing the IT infrastructure across the globe to
improve our focus, speed and efficiency in order to realize them. You will hear more about the progress of our
orthopaedics business in the third quarter when Michel Orsinger, our Worldwide Chairman for DePuy Synthes, will be
on the call.
Our Consumer segment is showing signs of its continued return to growth through its increasing momentum in
returning a reliable supply of U.S. OTC products to the shelves, the continued expansion of iconic brands in the
emerging markets and an overall focused portfolio management approach.

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Sandy Peterson.
Sandra E. Peterson
Thanks, Alex. I've been with Johnson & Johnson now a little over seven months. It has been a great beginning and the
longer I am here, the more excited I am about our ability to have a meaningful impact on people's lives around the
globe.
I've had the privilege to work at a number of well-respected companies, both inside and outside of healthcare, and
across geographies. With that perspective, I'm convinced that Johnson & Johnson is uniquely differentiated by its virtue
of its broad portfolio, talented people and geographic reach to make a profound difference in healthcare. As you know,
healthcare across the globe is changing. As governments and consumers work to improve the quality of care and the
roles of providers, healthcare professionals and retailers also adapt and become more global.
I've spent much of my time so far meeting customers and colleagues around the globe and learning our business. I have
been to our major business and manufacturing campuses in the U.S., Brazil, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Belgium, China,
Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand. I have met with numerous retail and provider-payer customers in the U.S. and in
our key other regions both large global customers as well as small mom-and-pop operations. What is most striking to
me is the talent and diversity of our colleagues around the globe. And equally impressive is experiencing our credo as a
source of constancy and inspiration in a time of remarkable change inside our company and in healthcare across the
globe.
Our Consumer brands are strong and resilient. Our breadth is a source of strength and competitive advantage. Although
we have been challenged in recent years, our reputation with consumers, retailers, healthcare professionals and
providers remains strong. As you know, I have accountability for some of the company's key enterprise functions;
supply chain, including quality and information technology, as well as our consumer business sector.
This integrated portfolio affords us the capacity to leverage these important functions to deliver innovation and value to
our customers and companies across sectors and across the globe. We have the opportunity to leverage our scale and
breadth through world-class deployment of information technology, services and supply chain to better serve the
evolving needs of our customers and consumers.
Today I will provide updates related to our consumer businesses and the Johnson & Johnson supply chain. Let's start
with what Alex has previously identified for you as one of our top enterprise-wide priorities; restoring a reliable supply
of our U.S. OTC products. Our priorities in the U.S. OTC business are: first, to deliver on our consent decree
milestones; second, to ensure reliable supply of OTC products to retailers and consumers; third, to achieve both brand
leadership and sustained healthcare professional number one recommended status; fourth, to rebuild customer trust and
become our customers' preferred partner; and fifth, to execute a return-to-market plan for our core U.S. OTC brands
and SKUs.
Our consent decree work plan was approved by the FDA without modification in the fourth quarter of 2012. We've
achieved 100% on-time execution of the prescribed steps through the second quarter. Additionally, all reports have
been submitted to the FDA on time. We are making good progress on restoring our OTC brands to the shelves; we have

achieved solid steady unit sale rates and consistent delivery commitments to customers and retailers. By year-end, our
plan is to deliver reliable and consistent supply of three quarters of the product brands.
In the first half of 2013, we achieved U.S. OTC operational growth of 19.7%, which includes 26% growth in revenues
in over-the-counter medicine. We are winning the hearts of consumers as these products return to the shelves in all four
segments: cough, cold and flu; allergy; pain; and digestive health.
For instance, Extra Strength TYLENOL is the number one code in adult pain. Children's TYLENOL and MOTRIN are
the top two SKUs and pediatric pain and we are leading in other important categories such as allergy care, with
ZYRTEC and our digestive health brands Imodium and Pepcid are returning with strength.
We're focusing on our top retail customers. We've achieved full distribution of key brands and point of sale has
improved with all top retailers. We are partnering with them on strategic initiatives that are rebuilding our relationships
and supporting their health and wellness strategies in order to educate consumers, simplify their purchasing experience,
and ultimately to help bring more consumers into their stores. Our strategic purpose for our consumer segment is caring
for people around the world by anticipating their needs and creating solutions and experiences that help them and those
they care for to live healthy vibrant lives. And, we are uniquely suited to do just that.
Our broad consumer portfolio from well-being and beauty to health and healing is a competitive advantage as are our
iconic brands. We have a legacy of innovation that leverages our scientific heritage and wins us unparalleled
professional endorsements, trust-based relationships with healthcare professionals and deep consumer insights. We're
applying a portfolio discipline that calls on us to make choices that will drive global brand growth in key priority
markets including, rationalizing SKUs and harmonizing formulations.
With our long history in emerging markets, which represents a proportionally higher share of segment sales than
elsewhere in Johnson & Johnson, we are globalizing existing brands such as LISTERINE, MOTRIN, Johnson's Baby
and CAREFREE and complementing our portfolio with key local brands like Elsker in China and RINZA and
DOKTOR MOM brands in Russia.
Our Consumer segment is not only a critical component of Johnson & Johnson's diverse portfolio and growth plans.
Our iconic brands are those that stakeholders most closely identify with Johnson & Johnson. We are pleased with the
value-creation opportunities ahead of us but we know there is still work to be done to restore our OTC businesses to
sustainable growth while globalizing our remaining brand portfolio and investing in key market growth.
Let's now shift to how we are working to deliver a reliable and cost-competitive supply of high quality products to our
customers, consumers and patients across our businesses. Three years ago, we created a global enterprise supply chain.
Our goal was to integrate into a network that would employ consistent quality standards and systems, leverage the scale
and technological breadth of our portfolio, and enable continuous production of cost-effective and high quality
products. This is a multiyear effort to integrate and leverage over 120 manufacturing sites, over 500 external
manufacturers, 450 distribution centers, and over 60 ERP systems that support about 275 operating companies. But the
opportunity to leverage our scale and breadth to better meet our customers' evolving needs and maintain the highest
quality and regulatory standards is significant.
We've implemented a new quality and compliance operating model to ensure consistent standards and capabilities
across all products, businesses and geographies while strengthening independent oversight processes. For instance,
we've adopted and are now deploying 34 common quality standards for all companies around the world. An
independent internal audit program launched three years ago is ensuring that all Johnson & Johnson sites are in full
compliance with health authority regulations and our own quality requirements.
Each of the three business segments has Chief Quality Officer responsible for developing the quality and compliance
strategy and overseeing quality results for all companies in the segment globally. Each of the three business segments
has a Quality and Compliance Systems Group to drive standardization in quality and compliance practices.
We're evolving our supply chain model to enable leverage across our global network in sourcing, logistics,
transportation, and distribution management and to strengthen business continuity plans. Our improved product-launch

performance demonstrates tighter commercial integration.
We have begun to consolidate and harmonize our ERP landscape. This is a four year program that will deliver
efficiencies in terms of COGS to offset pricing pressures and working capital improvements, supply reliability and
flexibility for years to come.
We are integrating Synthes into our global supply chain network and quality system. And we're optimizing our product
supply network both internally and externally to meet our growth objectives for new product launches and emerging
market growth.
Healthcare is a challenging but immensely rewarding space. In the few months that I've been part of the Johnson &
Johnson leadership team, I have gained even more conviction that we are making a real difference for consumers, for
patients, for customers, providers and healthcare systems. I see the enormous opportunity we have to do more and I am
looking forward to growing our businesses and creating meaningful innovation for our customers and value for our
shareholders.
Thank you for the opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you today. And now I'll turn it over to Dominic.
Dominic J. Caruso
Thank you, Sandy, and good morning, everyone. It's really great to have Sandy join us today on the call and it's a real
pleasure working with her as a new member of our executive committee. I'd like to now provide some brief comments
about our results and also provide our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the balance of 2013.
I'm pleased to say we've had a strong first half of 2013. The breadth of our business, which provides balance and
consistency to our overall performance as well as the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people in all of
our locations around the world, positions us well to sustain growth in this increasingly dynamic global healthcare
market.
While there are some indicators of general economic improvement, the healthcare market data we see in terms of
utilization is still relatively flat over the prior year with just a modest sequential improvement over the first quarter
utilization data. Overall, however, we continue to drive growth in many areas of our business, especially in the
Pharmaceutical segment with the launch of new products addressing unmet needs. Alex and Louise already commented
on our results for the quarter, so let me just mention the impact of special items this quarter.
There were special items recorded in the other income and expense line during the second quarter of approximately
$560 million on a pre-tax basis that consisted of charges for litigation expense accruals related to various legal matters,
DePuy ASR hip program cost and, as expected, continued costs associated with the global integration of Synthes.
Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $1.48 exceeded the mean of the analyst
estimates as published by First Call.
Now let me provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2013. Let me begin with a
discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $10 billion of net
cash. This consists of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and $15 billion of debt. We continue
to generate very strong cash flows. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you
consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million, a slight improvement from our
previous guidance.
Turning now to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation and other
divestitures, asset sales or write-offs. As previously disclosed, during the second quarter we sold our equity interest in
Elan and that gain is reflected in this line. This account is difficult to forecast but we would be comfortable with your
models for 2013 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain excluding special items ranging from approximately
$750 million to $850 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance and includes the gain from the sale of our

equity interest in Elan.
Now a word on taxes, through the second quarter of 2013, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was
approximately 19.5%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 at approximately between
19% and 20%, or a slightly lower rate than our previous guidance. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities
in this area to improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year.
Now turning to sales and earnings, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth on a
constant currency basis of between approximately 6% and 7% for the year, which is higher than our previous guidance.
This would result in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.3 billion to $71.9
billion.
And while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if
currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2013 were to stay where they were as of last week then our sales growth
rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 2% for the year.
Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4% and 5% for the year
for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70 billion and $70.6 billion, which is lower than our
prior guidance simply due to the overall weakening of foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the
Japanese yen, Brazilian real and the British pound.
Now turning to earnings, considering the strength we saw in our operating results for the first half, we suggest that you
consider full year 2013 earnings per share estimates excluding the impact of special items of between $5.42 and $5.49
per share on an operational basis at constant currency rates or an operational growth rate of between 6.5% and 7.5%,
which is higher than our previous guidance. As a reminder, the benefit from the Elan gain, as we noted, would largely
be reinvested in the business and our other income guidance is unchanged. So this increase is related to the operational
performance of the business which we see improving.
We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings
per share if currency rates for the balance of 2013 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported
EPS excluding special items would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share or $0.04 lower than the
impact we had previously estimated in our guidance solely due to exchange rate fluctuations.
We therefore suggest that you model our reported earnings per share excluding special items in the range between
$5.40 and $5.47 per share or a growth rate of between 6% and 7% resulting in our reported EPS guidance being higher
than our previous reported EPS guidance reflecting our strong operational performance somewhat offset by the
movement in currency rates.
Overall as you update your models for the guidance I just provided you should see pre-tax operating margins will
continue to show improvement over the prior year as we indicated at the beginning of this year and which we feel
confident we can achieve given the strength of our operating performance while we continue to invest for future
growth.

<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Good morning.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: I wanted to ask about a recent event which was the allowance of the patent application
on ZYTIGA in combination with prednisone. And could you give us your updated view on the life of ZYTIGA in the
U.S.? And how ZYTIGA is going to fit in with ARN-509 in the Aragon acquisition? In other words, how do you see it
positioning the two products? Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Mike. This is Alex. Thank you a lot for the question. As you know, Janssen's got five years
of date exclusivity in the U.S. from the date of approval which was April 2011 or until April 2016. We're also watching
the Hatch-Waxman extension to December 2016. At this point in time, we believe that those are the correct dates to be
using. Obviously we're going to be looking at some of these other recent events closer to see what impact it may have,
but at this time, we're sticking with December 2016.
Regarding the Aragon, look, we think it's a great complement to our portfolio. If you look at the great job frankly that
our team has been able to do with ZYTIGA, in the launch, regarding the clinical – I should backup. Actually the actual
approval of the compound, the ongoing clinical development, very impressive, the commercial penetration that we've
seen as well as the care programs for patients, we think it represents a significant capability.
And now when you complement that with the Aragon compound it will certainly enable us to leverage all of those
skills on to a next phase. We think that there could be potentially complementary utilization of both compounds
together and again, is another example of us continuing to really make a difference for patients and for our business in
this very exciting oncology area.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you. Let me just ask two quick follow-ups if I can. One, is there an update on the
plans for the clinical diagnostics? And two, Dominic, where are you with the completion of last year's ASR? And could
you just talk about thoughts on additional share repurchase following that? Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Mike. I'll take the first half of that question and I'll ask Dominic to follow-up on the second
part. As you remember, earlier this year we announced that we were going to be exploring the future of the diagnostics
group at an enterprise level and the initiation of this process is really part of a broader strategic planning process across
Johnson & Johnson, recognizing that we wanted to be very disciplined and decisive about what we were going to do
with our businesses and our capabilities going forward. As we stated back in January, we expect that this process could
take anywhere from about 12 to 24 months. We are on track for that. We're still in the early stages and we think it's
premature at this time to speculate about the specific impact but we're continuing to look at our options. Dominic.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah. Hi, Michael. On the ASR program, we expect it will be completed in early August so
we're near the completion of it. As soon as we complete that program, then we'll be permitted to recommence the share
purchases that we normally do in the normal course of business, which as I think you all know, we repurchase all the
shares that are issued in connection with any employee compensation program. So obviously commence that right after
the ASR program is completed in early August.
As far as any larger, more significant share buyback programs, as we've said before, we always evaluate that in the
spirit of utilizing our strong cash flows but, quite frankly, in the priority we've always said first our dividend, second to
use in building our business to generate even more sustainable cash flows for the future and then finally, considering
additional returns to shareholders as appropriate given the first two.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Next question, please?

Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Morning, Rajeev.
<Q - Rajeev Jashnani>: Morning. My first question was on the Consumer business, Sandy, and I was hoping you
could talk a little bit about the margins in that business. And clearly there's some costs associated with compliance that
are ongoing now but maybe you could talk about how you see that playing out over the next few years and some of the
investments you have to make at the brands? Thanks.
<A - Sandra E. Peterson>: Thanks, Rajeev, and thanks for the question. As you know, we're still in the process of
remediating the OTC business, which is an ongoing effort and clearly we will spend what it takes to ensure that we are
completely compliant with the CD and we're bringing all of the products back. Our expectation is that that will
continue for the near term. But in addition to all of the remediation efforts, we also are going to ensure that we're
investing sufficiently to bring these brands back and bring them back fully to consumers and retailers and that our
current estimation is that we will probably be spending at a higher rate than our historical averages as we're bringing all
of these brands back.
So that clearly in the near term will have some impact on our margins. But at the same time, we are also working very
hard to globalize our core brand portfolio, and by doing that, that will improve our margins over time across the total
Consumer portfolio. And we've also, the team has been put a lot of effort in the last couple of years in reducing
overheads and driving efficiencies throughout the business.
So I think what you'll see is that over time we will start seeing improvements in our margins as we bring the OTC
portfolio back and as we globalize the rest of our core portfolio. And our expectation is that our business will have
similar margins in the Consumer sector as you see in the other parts of the J&J portfolio as we bring all of these
businesses back and we'll continue to improve those margins over time.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Next question, please?

Your next question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Good morning. One for Alex and then one for Sandy. Alex, if you look at the Pharma results,
ZYTIGA, XARELTO and INCIVO were big drivers globally but it looks like Europe accelerated again this quarter,
even if you back out adjustments, one-timers, ZYTIGA, INCIVO. So my question is what are the one or two things
that's changed in Europe for you to gain all this share?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: I'm sorry, Matt. Would you repeat the last part of that question?
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: Yes, the question is what's driving the share gains in Europe for the base business, not the new
products, but the base? It seems like you continue to do better and better in Europe in Pharma.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Matt, really it's I think strong performance across both base and launch brands. So if you take a
look, for example, of how we're doing in the CNS area, continued growth with those products. We've had, of course, a
number of new launches on top of that. And I think overall our team is just executing extremely well. So I really think
it's a mix both of some of the core brands combined with the new product launches that's driving that kind of
performance.

almost as big as OTC, nutritionals and the last, I'd say, three quarters even again ex-divestitures it looks like it slowed a
little bit. Is that market share or market growth? And is there anything coming there innovation wise that could
accelerate the growth?
<A - Sandra E. Peterson>: Matt, thanks for the question. Actually, the overall Skin Care market as a category is
improving but it's still not what it used to be at a historical level. However, our own business is doing relatively well.
So our NEUTROGENA portfolio in the U.S. we've gained a half a share point in the first half of this year. Our
AVEENO business is up almost 8%. Our [ph] LPN (59:59) business in Europe is growing close to 10%. And our
Johnson's adult business is growing in the mid-single digit level. So those are all very positive things and we're feeling
good about our businesses in Asia as well.
The one thing that is impacting those that are in this category is the sun care business, the market category is down 11%
in the first half of this year. We've actually been gaining share in the U.S. over 2% and we're now the #2 global sun
care provider in the world. So the impact of the sun care market clearly is having an impact on the overall business and
while we're doing very well in it, a little over 2% is less than the historical rates that you would see normally in that
business. So that's a general sense of how we're doing in the Skin Care portfolio and that's why you see a relatively low
overall growth rate because of market growth. But our shares are actually growing in our core brands.
<Q - Matt J. Dodds>: All right. Thanks, Sandy.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question please.

Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to take a step back I guess and just discuss
what gives you I guess the confidence to raise the overall operational outlook for the rest of the year? Is it coming more
– I mean obviously you had a good first half. But is there anything in the end markets either within Medical Devices
that gives you some increased confidence or are you just having a higher level of conviction on more of the Pharma
side with some of the performance there?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Kristen. This is Alex. Thanks for the question. I'll start off and then I'll ask Dominic to
finish. So I think overall if we characterize our business we're really pleased with what we've seen during the first six
months. We made a lot of progress around our top objectives that we've been very clear about from the very beginning
delivering on our financial performance, obviously accelerating the launch of our Pharmaceutical products. And I think
as we look at that portfolio in particular there's a couple things.
One is in spite of new competition really in all of our newly launched categories, we continue to see very good uptake
and we think that's driven by first of all product profiles that are really important for patients but that have also have
been very well developed by our clinical development team. Two, by great commercial excellence. And I think that's
demonstrated in our ability to differentiate, but also in our ability to ensure access for these products through
managed-care Medicaid in the United States but also through tendering processes outside the United States. And we've
also seen good performance in our pipeline in development by bringing in through licensing and acquisitions, but also
continued progress on our own. So all around, I think our Pharma business, we believe, is in a good place and certainly
positioned well for future growth.
If we look at MD&D, clearly we've been challenged by the macro economic situation that's having an impact on
demand around the world. And if I start in the United States, what we've seen is fairly flat performance overall. And by
the way, if we look at some of the leading indicators, for example, if we look at hospital admissions, if we look at
inpatient procedures, we see relatively flat to even slightly negative statistics. Even primary care physician visits are in
the low single digits. We've got multiple quarters, consecutive quarters now with those types of trends. We don't expect
that to turn in the near-term. Longer-term we'll have to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act on that. That being

said, we remain very committed to our MD&D business.
In areas such as Biosense Webster, ENT, Vision Care, we have seen very positive performance this quarter. However,
if we look at some of our other core businesses in surgical care, for example, sutures and surgical instruments, we see
the challenges associated with the macroeconomic environment.
We're also somewhat I would say encouraged as well by what we're seeing in orthopaedics, particularly in hips and
knees and trauma over the past quarter. And clearly if we look at our Consumer group, we see a very strong
performance from our U.S. OTC business. Sandy took you through some of that earlier. I think around the rest of the
world, we tend to follow more what we're seeing with GDP but if we total all of that, we think that we're continuing to
make good progress. We still see challenges ahead. At the same time, our teams and our employees I think continue to
demonstrate that we're delivering on our commitments and that's the way we intend to finish out the rest of the year.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Alex, I wouldn't add anything else except that we're not reading into our performance any
uptick in utilization trends generally speaking. So I think that, that still remains to be challenging for the balance of the
year. But as Alex said, individual product performance is really pretty exceptional, especially in the Pharma business.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And then just real quickly, just the breaking out of the nutritionals from the OTC business.
What was the rationale for that? Is nutritionals an area where you might look to divest? Or how should we think about
that separation?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: We wanted to break it out so actually for your benefit so you could track the progress in our
return of the OTC business. It's pretty significant in terms of our progress there. I think it sometimes gets buried by the
grouping of different things in the same line. So really for your benefit and your modeling purposes we wanted to show
you singularly what the U.S. and overall OTC business was doing. No other reason than that.

Your next question is from Lawrence Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Larry.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Alex and one for Dominic. Alex,
could you share with us your first and second quarter growth rates in emerging markets? And given the macroeconomic
and political dynamics, could you give us your latest thoughts on the outlook in those markets for healthcare in general
and your business? And for Dominic – and then after that, I'll ask my question for Dominic.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Larry. This is Alex. Larry, we're not splitting it out specifically for all emerging markets but
if we take a look at our BRIC markets – Brazil, Russia, India, China – what we're seeing is about 19% growth. So you
can see obviously that that's a significant multiple of what we're seeing in developed markets. And again, I think it's
built on the fact that we've been in these markets for a substantial period of time, particularly if you take a look at our
Consumer and our MD&D business in places like China but even our Pharmaceutical business as well as the other
businesses in places like Brazil, we've made investments over the last several years in our Consumer and our MD&D
business. So for example with Dabao, Elsker, BIOSEAL in China.
And so we see these markets as very important for our growth. We continue to see good uptake in healthcare. It's
something that we're looking watching very closely in light of the larger macroeconomic environment. But overall, we
believe that these markets represent a significant growth opportunity simply because more patients are receiving access
to treatment and secondly because we have solid positions in many of these areas.

<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: That's helpful. Just to clarify, the 19%, Alex, in the BRIC markets, was that for Q2 or the
first half of the year?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: That was Q2.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: And it excludes Synthes.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Larry, it excludes Synthes.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Okay. And Dominic, you grew I think 4.8% year-to-date ex-Synthes. I think Alex talked
about earlier in the presentation, implied – correct me if I'm wrong – but the guidance, the updated guidance implies
about 2% to 4% in the second half of the year. Is my math correct? And is this just conservatism? Or is there any
reason why you would expect the second half to be slower than the first half? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So, when we were looking at operational growth, let's focus on that because obviously
currency is going to have a negative impact on our sales growth. Operationally for the first half, we had pretty strong
growth all related to the Pharmaceutical business primarily and obviously the inclusion of Synthes.
In the back half of the year, to get to the between 6% and 7% operational growth that I was referring to, we would
expect about 4% overall growth for the back half of the year because the first half obviously was impacted by Synthes.
That's the math I have, Larry. About 10% this quarter, roughly 10% for the first half of the year, between 6% and 7%
for the full year which implies about 4% in the back half of the year on an operational basis excluding any currency
impacts.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Thank you very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please?

Your next question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: ...my question. Start out with just a couple housekeeping items. Was there any impact to sales
this quarter from either in the Pharma, the Medicaid rebate adjustments or in Medical Devices, any extra selling days
that might have inflated sales growth rates?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Derrick, no Medicaid rebate adjustments in this particular quarter. We had a significant
adjustment last quarter that we talked extensively about but nothing of that nature in this quarter. And on selling days,
Louise, I don't know if there's any real significant impact of selling days this quarter.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Really no significant impact. It's about 0.2 days and that's all O-U.S. And it only really
impacts our Orthopaedics business.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Great. And Louise, could you give us a sense for the breakout of pricing and mix again for the
orthopedic divisions?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Sure. Price worldwide, just price, is about 1% decline and that's consistent U.S., O-U.S. and
total, and that's the same as the first quarter. If we get into the U.S. only where I have a price and mix number, for hips,
the price was down about 3.5%, very consistent with the prior period. Mix, however, was up about 1.5% so it netted to
about a 2% decline. So that's a little bit more favorable than the first quarter. When you go into knees, the price number
was down about 1%. We did have favorable mix again so now we're about at 0.5% favorable and that's very consistent
with what we had in the first quarter.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: And how about spine?

<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. In terms of spine, price was about 3% negative for the second quarter and mix was
about 2.5% positive, netting to about a half negative, very similar trend on the total between the first and the second
quarter. However, there's a little bit of changes between price and mix.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Great. Thank you. And just one more for Sandy, if I could. Sandy, what are your expectations for
how much share you'll gain once you get your products back into the market, now that you've seen how the initial
relaunch of your OTC products is going? I understand the 75% expectation for brands to market but how much of that
lost share do you recapture when you hit the market? Thank you.
<A - Sandra E. Peterson>: Thanks for the question. Quite honestly, we're still in early days. Our intent and we're on
track to bring 75% of those brands back this year. We have others that we will be bringing back next year. But as we
begin to get into the stores and interact with consumers again, we've had very positive responses from not only retailers
but consumers and healthcare professionals.
It is a little early to be able to answer that question but what I can tell you is that in the first half of the year, we have
seen with the limited distribution – now we have full distribution but in the first half we only had limited distribution –
we've seen things like our Extra Strength Tylenol share double in the first half of the year. We've seen significant
growth with most of our other products that we've bought back to the market. But it's a little early for us to actually
give you a clear sense of what that number will be. Clearly our intent and our desire is to get back to the share numbers
that we had before we went into the CD process and that's what we're very focused on doing.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning. Just two questions. Dominic, I just wanted to follow-up on an earlier question and
that is the implied guidance for the second half of the year. Even if I assume the top end of the guidance, that still
assumes a second-half earnings growth of 4.5% versus 9% during the first half so I can't imagine that having Synthes
now fully annualized would affect the operational growth rate that much. Maybe it does but if you could just talk about
what specific headwinds you expect in the second half that we didn't see in the first half?
And then Alex, a question for you. As long as we have the opportunity to have you on the call, if could you talk bigger
picture about business development? Dominic said that your priority is: number one, the dividend; number two,
business development – or maybe I had that mixed up – and then number three, share buybacks. But now with Synthes
having fully annualized, just wondering if you could talk to what your business priorities are in terms of specific
businesses? What sort of size we should anticipate? How are you thinking about business development? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So Jami, on the earnings part of the back half versus first half comparison, remember we
did indicate that we expected this other income and expense line to be about $800 million for the year. That's consistent
with our guidance now. So no change there, but of course, with the Elan gain coming all in one quarter, the vast
majority of that has already happened in the first half of the year...
<Q - Jami Rubin>: How much did that contribute? How much did that contribute this quarter?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yes. If you look at that we released in April, we talked about the fact that we sold our Elan
shares and we filed the registration statement concerning that and we indicated the estimated gain was going to be
about $200 million from that sale. We then sold some additional shares later in the year. So think about it as about a
$0.07 number that we disclosed earlier.

Page 19 of 27
But to put one thing in perspective with this other income and expense line, your models, of course, have modeled one
quarter of the $800 million which is about what I'd expect you to model. And this quarter we had within that line $400
million of other income and expense. Right? Because it has the Elan gain in there.
So if you look at the impact just this quarter of the Elan gain versus the overall analyst models, I would say that that
$200 million excess or roughly $150 million after tax is worth about $0.05 compared to what The Street has been
modeling.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Okay. And Jami, for your first question, I think the way that I would frame our overall position is
look, we're going to continue to look for internal and external opportunities that we feel are going to drive our growth
going forward. We've been very consistent in saying that when there are new technologies, new innovations that give
us a platform to build, I think a great example of that is what we've done in oncology over the past few years in our
Pharmaceutical business. There's a lot of unmet medical need and we've been able to do some great partnering to
rapidly build what we feel is now a world-class platform in oncology both from a Pharmaceutical development, but
also from a commercial and access point of view.
The next area that we look at of course is what businesses could be complementary to our existing businesses? What
may round out some of our current portfolios or build on capabilities that we currently have? And there are other
opportunities perhaps where we look at vertical integration. What we've done for example in our biosurgicals business
is a great example of that with Omrix and we're excited about the potential that that has as we're in the process of
launching that on a global level. That's the way we look at it.
But regarding our Pharmaceutical business, look, I'm really proud of the work the team has done there in taking
agreements such as what we've done with Pharmacyclics, what we've done with Bayer, what we've done with other
organizations in partnering and adding on to our portfolio to bring forward great opportunities for patients, but also for
our business.
In MD&D, obviously the Synthes transaction was a very large transaction. Michel and his team are doing a very nice
job through the integration process but we realize that that does take some time. We remain committed to having the
broadest and most comprehensive orthopaedics platform. We're seeing that happening right now as those businesses
come together.
And in Consumer, we think the Consumer area, let alone consumerism, will also be very important as we go forward in
healthcare. And we've made some select acquisitions there, particularly in China over the past couple of years. We've
also done some other divestments in our business as we've really focused more in certain areas of our portfolio and as
we've also done in MD&D.
So I think that's overall our approach. We want to continue to look for technologies and innovations that really make a
difference for patients. We want to continue to look for opportunities that can be complementary, add on, give us
additional customer offerings. Or if we see other brand-new areas that we think can really be transformational,
obviously we'll be interested in that as well.

<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I just wanted to touch on
the diabetes business a little bit. I mean you mentioned some of the impact from competitive bidding. Can you talk a
little bit, Alex, about your commitment to that business going forward and how we think about the business now in the
context of competitive bidding? And, Louise, if you could remind us the impact of competitive bidding to the business?
How much of the business is exposed to Medicare?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Danielle. Thank you very much for the question. Overall what I would say is that J&J and
our diabetes companies, we still feel that we are very uniquely positioned for strong leadership and success in the
category based on a great track record that we've had in technology innovation, scale and brand equity. If you just look
at diabetes, of course, it's one of the largest and most significant issues in healthcare today. I think there is around 370
million people with diabetes today, projected to go to almost 500 million by 2020. The need is great, and it's a very
difficult area to control.
What I would say is that with the recent launch of INVOKANA, our sales and marketing efforts are broadly targeting
both endocrinologists and primary care physicians who treat the vast majority of these Type II patients. Both Janssen
and LifeScan and Animas are partnering to accomplish this objective. And it's the first time where LifeScan and
Animas have been involved in promoting an oral therapeutic agent of any kind. That really helps extend their reach and
it strengthens basically their commercial and clinical relevance beyond just glucose monitoring and insulin delivery
among those healthcare professionals.
And then when you compound that with the Calibra acquisition that we recently did, it's the wearable insulin patch
technology, we feel that that's going to be a very good opportunity for patients, making it easier for them. If they're
currently on basal only insulin therapy and they need an easy to administer mealtime dosing option that certainly
provides that.
While we look at all that, we also acknowledge the realities of the market. And with the competitive bidding process,
the 72% reduction in pricing that we are experiencing in the United States, we are having to adapt our business model
to meet that challenge. But again, it's a – diabetes we think is a very important space with a lot of unmet medical need.
We think we have a number of offerings across our MD&D, Pharmaceutical and Consumer segments that can address
them. But clearly we will adapt to those changing dynamics as events unfold and as we predict they will unfold in the
coming years.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. And Medicare sales are at about just over 20% of the U.S. business.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Okay, great. Thanks so much. And then on Synthes, if I could dig a little bit deeper on that,
and you mentioned some positive momentum in spine procedures. I'm wondering how much of that is underlying
market growth versus specific to Synthes? And how is Synthes doing relative to your internal expectations as far as
sales force attrition goes? And how are you managing that going forward? Thanks so much, guys.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure. Let me start with Synthes. Overall, look, we are really pleased with the way the integration
is going. Taking on a company the size of Synthes with the reputation, its scale, its capabilities is no small undertaking.
And bringing those together the way that our teams have, I think they really need to be commended for it.
We've got a multiphase program in place to bring it together commercially, the entire research and development
organization as well as all the supporting functional areas and when you look at for example our hip and knee
performance in the United States, what we saw is growth in the Hip area 5%, again, based on new products being
introduced, things like Acclaim, Corail, other things. Our Knee business being helped by the introduction of the
ATTUNE new knee system. And if we compare those to the U.S. growth rates, we are estimating, and this is first
quarter data because we don't have all the second quarter data yet, up 1% in Hips and slightly down in Knees. We think
that's very favorable performance. Again, keeping those segments focused, keeping them delivering while going
through the integration is no small feat.
If we look at Trauma, we are up 2% in the U.S. versus a market that we think is probably growing around 6%. We have
seen some loss of share due to the nail recall that we experienced earlier in the year. We think it's being managed well.
We think we will see our way through that. On a worldwide basis though, we think we are growing commensurate with

what we are seeing with the market. So continued strong emerging market growth, the globalization that we offer to
some of those businesses we think is a real opportunity.
Last but not least in Spine, on a worldwide basis what we see is a market that is down 2%. We think we're down about
1%. So we think we are commensurate. In the U.S. we have seen performance where we were down about 7% versus a
market that was down about 3%. We were clearly impacted by some transitional issues with our sales force during that
period. They put a comprehensive plan in place where we think that and we project that we'll do much better going
forward. And more importantly, when you look at the offerings that our representatives have across the minimally
invasive segment, degenerative spine, a number of other areas combined with the rest of our portfolio is going to put us
in a very good position in that marketplace.
So we remain very optimistic, pleased with the performance around the integration and feel that DePuy Synthes again
is going to be good for patients and also be good for our business.

The next question is from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Tony.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hey, Tony.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Good morning and thank you very much for the time. Really two questions and one is two parts.
Alex, a question for you first. Clearly some discussion not only in the press today but it's been in the press for some
time about the Ministry of Public Security looking into business practices, principally in China. And I'm concerned
that, that could spread not only to Glaxo but to other companies including J&J, just simply looking at business
practices. Can you comment on what you know today, maybe going on with certain investigations and whether or not
your practices are being discussed?
And then two product questions. One, clearly around the very strong growth of PREZISTA, up 18% sequentially,
Louise or Dominic, any commentary that you can make regarding that very strong growth sequentially?
And then secondly on XARELTO, I understand 20% sequential growth but do you believe that's solely driven by DTC?
Thanks very much.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Tony. Let me start off. On the first question, what I would say is that we are absolutely
committed to ensuring that our businesses are run in a highly compliant manner around the world and we have a very
active compliance program in place in countries such as China, let alone all the BRIC countries. We continue to update
our policies and procedures as we get more information, and at the same time, we recognize that these countries are
very important markets going forward. And by that, there's still a lot of unmet medical need with patients and clearly
we know that these governments are also very committed to ensuring that they have a compliant environment and at the
same time that they are getting access for their citizens to important healthcare options.
So we remain very diligent on it. We've made significant investments in these areas in compliance and we want to work
closely with these countries and governments to ensure that we're working together in a collaborative way to ensure we
have a very compliant environment going forward. Louise? Dom?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Tony, on PREZISTA, we've seen basic market share improvement over the quarter.
PREZISTA is doing very well. Our sales team is doing an excellent job and the product has become, quite frankly, a
mainstay in HIV therapy. So it's really just we saw pretty strong market growth – not market growth but market share
growth sequentially.

And then on XARELTO, we did do some DTC there but I think that product, as we've talked about before, with the
breadth of its indications is becoming much more recognized as a standard of care in that marketplace and as Alex
pointed out earlier, we've now surpassed warfarin in the new to brand share.
So I think the breadth and our strategy around the breadth of that compound in a market that needs that kind of therapy
that has both exceptional efficacy and obviously safety is what's driving that growth. I wouldn't just pin it on overall
DTC advertising. I would just say the breadth of the overall indications for the product as we expected. That's what our
strategy was and it looks like it's playing out.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Tony, I would add one other thing onto that because I think Dominic gave a really comprehensive
answer and that is in addition to the clinical development program that has resulted in numerous indications to give
physicians a very broad application of the product, there's also been a great job done by our access team in ensuring
broad formulary access in our managed care places here in the United States. So I think now we've got more than 85%
access Tier 2 in both private as well as Medicare customers. That's very important for them. It relates to an issue of
affordability, of convenience and of course the reason that we are able to get that kind of access is because our teams
have done a great job of demonstrating the clinical and overall economic value of XARELTO to those patients and in
the settings.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Alex. Alex, I'd like your view
on the CapEx environment in the United States. It appears the environment remains challenging, and I know you spend
a lot of time visiting hospitals and hospital executives. Is the CapEx challenged environment a function of utilization?
Is it a function of pending healthcare reform? Just curious of your views? And then as a follow-up, what do you think
turns the CapEx environment to the positive in the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Thank you very much, Glenn. I'd say in discussions I've had with hospital CEOs and other people
in the marketplace I'd say there's a couple things. One is clearly there has been this issue now for I believe almost 10 to
12 consecutive quarters where we have seen admissions in the hospitals as well as numbers of procedures being flat to
negative. Clearly we have seen some shift to the outpatient setting, but when it comes to inpatient procedures and
admissions, that market has obviously been impacted by the macroeconomic condition.
I think secondly, people are waiting to see the full impact of the Affordable Care Act. They are still working their way
through the details and how that might affect. There are certainly changes regarding risk bearing in areas such as
hospital-acquired infections and other procedures. So I think that's also having an impact.
Third, what we are seeing is that patients frankly and customers are just being more demanding about the data that is
supporting justification for new approaches, new procedures and innovations. So that's the way I would describe the
overall CapEx environment as it relates to hospitals.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Just as one quick follow-up, do you have a view on Europe? Europe has remained very
challenging from a utilization and a capital point of view. That appears to be stable, is that correct?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: What I would say, Glenn, it's a bit of a tale of two cities. On one hand what we see in CapEx
particularly if you go to Southern Europe is a very challenging environment. It's because of the macroeconomic
situation they are facing. I don't think we've seen a pronounced decrease or improvement. We've seen it fairly steady
quarter to quarter, but we expect that to remain a very challenging environment going forward.

On the other hand, what we have seen is that when you introduce new innovations such as our Pharmaceutical group
has done over the past 12 months that can really make a difference for patients, that you can get reimbursement and get
access for patients.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please?

Your next question is from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Thanks. Good morning. Alex, very much appreciate the update in perspective. There's a lot to
talk about here, but I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on your thoughts on innovation as you just
mentioned and earlier in the call, particularly as it pertains to MD&D and a few different factors? First, the degree to
which new technologies, smart instruments, some of your competitors in different areas are putting that out. You've put
that out obviously effectively with Biosense Webster over time. Number two, whether these opportunities are greater in
areas where you have an established business like orthopaedics, like cardio or whether new platforms and opportunities
are as attractive? And then finally, I think you just mentioned again presenting innovations in a way that hospitals and
caregivers can recognize the value and are willing to pay for them. Maybe just your broad thoughts as those factors
pertain to MD&D? And I have one follow-up for Sandy.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure. Matt, thanks a lot for the question. If I reflect on it, at a very broad level what I would say
around MD&D is that look, innovation is going to continue to be important. However, I think that the bar will be raised
on the data that will be required to describe and represent that innovation. So let me give you a few examples.
I think overall what we are seeing is incremental innovation, while still clearly an important part of the overall portfolio
and ultimately that can help you lead a path to significant breakthrough innovation, is not being rewarded with, for
example, increased pricing or improved pricing in the marketplace. And we would expect over time that we will need
to have more transformational innovation or more significant innovation. We recognize that that's going to require
additional clinical development and investments.
At the same time, we think at Johnson & Johnson we're uniquely positioned in that category given the broad breadth
and scale of capabilities that we have with our Pharmaceutical group and our Medical Device group. So, for example,
what we've done in our biosurgicals area as we're getting ready to launch Fibrin Pad, the way that we're having our
cardiovascular team even, for example, work with XARELTO and some of the things that we're doing in Biosense
Webster, it gives us a unique opportunity for convergence. And in fact, we see opportunities in some of these segments
to look at innovation differently and frankly raise the bar with innovation from a clinical point of view, but also from a
regulatory point of view that's in the best interest of patients as well as for our business.
If we look at areas going forward, I think it's going to be a combination. We still think that in areas such as general
surgery when we look at biosurgicals, when we look at areas such as energy, there's a lot of opportunity to make
procedures less invasive, to simplify the procedures, particularly in emerging markets, that will ultimately lead to better
overall outcomes and reducing morbidity. We think in other areas there's great technology opportunities, such as in
Biosense Webster.
So in the general surgery category, I think there's a lot of opportunity for growth. In orthopaedics we're working on
innovation with products like the ATTUNE knee, like a number of things that we're doing in spine and hip as of late.
We're also looking at innovation from a commercial model standpoint. What can we do around having a broader
offering, a different kind of relationship and partnership with hospitals and other large payers, again, in a way that's
good for patients, that helps to improve outcomes, but also is better for the institution? And we think, again, there too,
we're uniquely positioned given the breadth, the depth, the scale and size of our business.

<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: That's great. Thank you for that. And for Sandy and maybe Alex may want to chime in on this
as well, but around quality and regulatory we tend to have focused over the past couple of years on the pathway and the
process for OTC in managing through the OTC specific challenges that have come up. But it would be very helpful –
you touched a little bit on this with respect to the supply chain. But it'd be great to hear maybe some of the changes
you've made proactive and ongoing at your other major businesses and facilities and maybe if you could provide some
examples or anecdotes that would help illustrate the progress that you're making across the organization in terms of
quality.
<A - Sandra E. Peterson>: So, Matt, thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, our quality effort
is across the enterprise, across all of our businesses, our manufacturing sites as well as all of our R&D sites because
they're under the scope of trying to ensure that we have the highest standard of quality for the safety and care of our
patients and consumers. So when we launched the quality initiative a number of years ago, the focus really was on
ensuring that we've got consistent quality standards.
We went through a three-year cycle that we're just ending the first of the cycles over a three-year period where we've
gone through all of our manufacturing facilities, all of our core strategic suppliers as well as all of our R&D sites to
ensure that all of them are living up to the appropriate regulatory standards in those countries but also a standard that at
J&J we believe is one of the highest in the industry and it's across all of our sectors. So there's been an immense
amount of work and focus ensuring that we have consistency across our operations, across our product lines and across
all of the countries in which we operate.
And we have, obviously, as we've gone through all of this work we have identified corrective actions and we've
immediately taken those corrective actions. We're harmonizing systems. We're putting in place processes and systems
so that we have early warning systems in place to understand if we think there may be something going on with a
product. So we identify it early and we go out and correct it.
In addition to that, an important component of all of this is how we're managing our global supply chain. So one of the
very important changes that we have been making with our global supply chain is ensuring that all of our external
suppliers, so our material suppliers, are thoroughly reviewed, are thoroughly managed and that they are living up to our
quality standards and in that process in the past three years we have actually consolidated our external manufacturing,
our external material suppliers by about a third. So we have a third less than we had three years ago. That means that
we have an ability to manage them more much more effectively and ensure that we are reviewing their quality of their
products coming into our facilities.
We've also looked at our external manufacturers, those that provide finished products to us, and we manage those
across the enterprise now in a very rigorous manner with thorough reviews and thorough audits and we are learning
across the enterprise how to share best practices from business to business and technology to technology.
So this effort is not just focused on the OTC business; it's really across all of our businesses and all of our countries
globally and we are ensuring that we have independent audits and independent approach to managing this but we are
ensuring that we also are putting the right systems, processes and capital and automation in place in all of our facilities
around the globe. So we've made significant process.
I think one other indication of that progress is that over the last couple of years we've recently closed out a number of
warning letters and we are making very good progress on the ones that are remaining but we are feeling good about
where we are. Always things can happen. We have 300,000 SKUs around the globe so that's where our vigilance has to
be is ensuring every single one of those SKUs are meeting our high standards.

Your next question is from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi there. Just wondering if you can you give us a bit more of an update on the diabetes care
business, just where you've been progressing to in terms of market share versus your key competitors and just what you
think outside of reimbursement changes what the underlying growth rate here, just for expectations going forward?
Thank you.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Jeff, are you referring to – which of our businesses, our MD&D diabetes business or
INVOKANA?
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Sorry, MD&D diabetes.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Okay. We believe that we've been relatively flat in share this last quarter. We think that there may
have been a slight downtick based upon some of the pricing changes that are being made and particularly intrusion of
store brands and other offerings. Obviously, it's something that we're watching very closely.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: And Jeff, I might add our estimation is that the market, the overall market is declining
there. So overall market trends are negative in diabetes test strips. Market volumes are declining overall.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Hello?
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Hello? Can you hear me okay?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Hi, Bob.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: We can hear you.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Sorry about that. I know it's getting late so two very quick ones and thanks for taking the call.
First, there hasn't been a lot of commentary on your general surgery franchises within medical technology so I'm
wondering if you can just comment a bit little more specifically on those businesses and what you're seeing there?
Because the growth rate in general surgery and specialty surgery did look like it was a little bit better than last quarter
so a little bit of a commentary there on what you're seeing in those markets and what you're seeing competitively? Is
the uptick more a little bit better market or is it a little bit less share loss than you've been seeing?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure. There's a number of things driving our performance over there. First of all, we saw modest
growth overall in the specialty surgery category for the quarter. Our biosurgical platform had solid growth, particularly
outside the United States. We also saw good growth in the U.S. in our ENT business. And while the worldwide energy
business continues to grow driven by the continued expansion of emerging markets and new product launches, we were
challenged at the U.S. with our energy business with low-cost competitors as well as some competitive pressures. So
that's the way I would describe specialty surgery.
In general surgery, of course, our business was impacted by what has taken place in women's health and our decision to
exit some of those businesses. That had negative. If we look at suture and some of those basic platforms, we are seeing
very consistent growth with the overall market that we think is basically up about a percent or two.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. And then, just one quick follow-up on an earlier question on emerging markets, I know
you talked about a lot about how well positioned you think JNJ is, but just in terms of the emerging outlook – the
outlook for growth of the markets in emerging markets, especially as it relates to MD&D, how confident are you that
the current growth trends in the markets can continue as we look forward over the next couple of years? Again, it's

really a question of gauging confidence in light of some of the things that have gone on in these economies, your
confidence in the ability of these markets, specifically in Medical Devices to continue to grow at the nice pace we have
seen over the last year or so?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure. I think there's a couple of forces and dynamics that will be impacting it. First of all you've
got the significant increase in the middle class populations in those countries. For example in China, I think most of the
recent statistics would suggest you have about 150 million people in that middle class. That could go as high as – north
of 500 million to close to 800 million people over the next 10 years. What we also know is that as people move up the
economic ladder, they generally consume more healthcare. So we think that the urbanization trend, the trend towards an
increasing middle class, does offer a significant growth opportunity.
Now of course, offsetting that will be pressure put on governments on how they are going to control overall healthcare
spending. But if you look at the healthcare spending levels in places like Brazil, Russia, India and China, it is very low
single digits. We think that it's an opportunity for them to invest in their society, even have a more stable society as
well as a more productive society. And so we think that the growth opportunities there will continue.
We recognize that it's going to take perhaps a different portfolio of products that are really targeted towards specific
disease states, areas of unmet medical need for those markets. It will take at times different commercial approaches.
But overall, we do think that emerging markets will be a major source of growth for the next several years.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great. Thanks for the comments, Alex.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: With respect to everybody's time, we will take one more question, and then we will have
some closing remarks by Alex.

Your next question is from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Two quick ones here, Louise, to keep on our time schedule here. First,
Dominic, on cash flow, cash flow did, and free cash specifically, got better in 2012 versus 2011, I believe. How do you
feel about first-half free cash generation? I know you don't give specific guidance, but if you think about free cash
versus net income, how do you expect back half 2013 and 2013 in general to shape up relative to 2012?
And then maybe a quick follow-up maybe for Louise, just on ibrutinib: any timing expectations and could we see that
approval before year end? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: David, we are pleased with our cash flow generation. And for the first half of the year, free
cash flow is a little over $6 billion. So we expect to be well north of $12 billion for the year, which is where we ended
last year's free cash flow. So I think we will see 2013 overall free cash flow generation better than we saw in 2012 and
we are off to a good start already.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Regarding ibrutinib, the NDA, the new drug application for ibrutinib, was submitted June, 2013.
We just announced it recently. This was announced by the FDA. We do have the breakthrough therapeutic designation,
which we are very excited about for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, CLL, SLL. And we
received at least one prior therapy in patients also with Mantle Cell Lymphoma, MCL, who have received at least one
prior therapy.
We've got two pivotal trials that we think are both very strong. And the FDA has not communicated a PDUFA date.
And the review period is not dictated in the existing breakthrough therapy guidelines from the FDA. Now that being
said, we have requested a priority review designation, which has an FDA goal for completion of six months after a
two-month validation period. But we really can't comment beyond that at this time.
