And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
Reed, thank you and good afternoon, everybody. As you have -- well, seeing in today's earnings release News
Corporation closed out fiscal 2012 achieving the financial targets we provided a year ago.
For the full year adjusted total segment operating income was $5.6 billion, 30% higher than the 4.975 billion in
adjusted total segment operating income we reported a year ago. This increase was driven by a 19% operating profit
growth at our cable networks, 22% growth and contributions from our Filmed Entertainment segment and the
elimination of Myspace related losses partially offset by lower publishing results.
Reported net income this year was $1.2 billion or $0.47 per share, which included impairment and restructuring charges
of $3 billion equating to $1 per share, primarily taken in the fourth quarter and mostly related to the company's
publishing asset. Additionally full year results included gains of $270 million or $0.07 per share from the company's
participation and BSkyB buyback program and $224 million in cost related to the UK investigations also represented
$0.07 per share, excluding the net income effect of these items and comparable items in both years' adjusted earnings
per share with $1.41 compared to the adjusted year-ago results of $1.18. This 19% improvement primarily reflects our
operating segment income growth and the buyback of close to 10% of the company's outstanding stock over the course
of last year.
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results; and for the quarter, the company reported adjusted segment operating
income of 1.24 billion as compared to 1.35 billion reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. This anticipated decline
which was discussed on our last earnings call reflects continued growth in our cable networks more than offset by
decreases at the company's remaining segments.
The company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 1.6 billion, largely reflecting the previously mentioned
impairment or restructuring charges that offset segment operating income. Fourth quarter results also include charges of
$57 million related to the investigation in United Kingdom. Excluding these charges in the comparable items in the
prior year, fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.32 per share as compared to the year ago adjusted EPS of $0.35 a
share.
And now, I'll provide some comments on the fourth quarter performance at a couple of our businesses. And let's start
with the cable networks; this segment continues to drive overall company result generating two-thirds of News
Corporation's total segment operating income. Fourth quarter operating income contributions increased over 25% from
year ago levels to $792 million, reflecting particularly strong results at Fox News and FX domestically and in both the
Fox International Channels and STAR internationally.
This growth continues to be topline driven with segment revenues up 15%, affiliate fees at the cable network's
increased 19% over year-ago levels with domestic affiliates, these up 16%, is driven by our successful affiliate
renewals earlier in this fiscal year. International fees were up 31% with about half of the international affiliate revenues
increased driven by organic growth and the remainder reflecting the consolidation of Fox Pan American Sports after
acquiring that business in December.
Fourth quarter advertising revenues for the segment were up 9% over year-ago levels with domestic ad growth of 5%
and international growth of 18%. The strong result from the international businesses reflects particular strength in
viewership trends and ad markets in Latin America and India, as well as this year's contribution of Fox Pan American
Sports. Fourth quarter expenses at the cable network's increased 11% over a year ago. This primarily reflects increased
sports programming due to costs, due to the delay of the NBA season and resulting increase in televised games this

quarter. It also reflects the launch of The Ultimate Fighting Championship, as well as the impact of Fox Pan American
Sports.
At our television segment operating income in the quarter of $213 million decreased 20 million versus fourth quarter a
year ago, this decline is largely due to American Idol and another rating softness that more than offset higher
retransmission revenues and higher political advertising in that stations.
At our filmed segment, fourth quarter operating income was $120 million, a $90 million decline compared to a year
ago, largely reflecting the expected difficult comparisons for last year is very successful, the actual release of Rio and
the strong home entertainment titles, Black Swan and The Chronicles of Narnia. This quarter results included the
launch cost of the number of successful theatrical releases that will help set of the filmed segment for a solid fiscal
2013 and they include Prometheus, and of course, Ice Age, Continental Drift, which has generated over $715 million
total worldwide box office to date.
Turning to SKY Italia; segment operating income in the quarter of $89 million declined 56 million from a year ago.
This decrease reflects the challenging economic environment in Italy has directly impacting gross subscriber additions
and churns. SKY reported 4.9 million subs at quarter end, a net loss of 42,000 subscribers in the quarter, resulting in
reduced subscription revenue compared to a year ago. The quarter results also reflect increased expenses related to
subscriber retention efforts as well as a more than 10% negative impact on operating profits from the strengthening of
the US dollar versus the euro for quarter.
Given the relatively low pay-TV penetration in Italy and SKY's strong competitive positioning, we continue to have
complete confidence at long-term growth prospects for this business. However, the short-term weak consumer
confidence and consumption behavior is likely to sustain its current difficult trading conditions in Italy.
And at our publishing segment, operating income of $139 million declined 131 million compared to a year ago. This
decrease largely reflects lower advertising revenues at the Australian and UK newspapers, lower in store revenues at
News America marketing as well as the impact and of course, revenues at the world. The quarter results also included a
charge for litigations, for a litigation settlement related to the eBooks prices at HarperCollins. And these declines -- the
declines at these groups were partially offset by higher earnings contribution at Dow Jones.
Before turning to our guidance for fiscal 2013, I'd also like to update you on our buyback program. And through
August 7, the company has spent $5.1 billion repurchasing nearly 280 million shares, reducing News Corporation's
total outstanding by more than 10% compared to 12 months ago.
As you may recall, three months ago, we increased our original $5 billion buyback authorization by another 5 billion
with a target of completing the total authorized buyback by the end of fiscal 2013. Even with the June announced that
we intend to pursue a separation of the publishing and entertainment businesses; we are fully committed to completing
the $10 billion buyback program.
Although, the repurchase pacing will initially moderate to a $3 billion to $4 billion annual rate, as we work through the
details of the separation process. As always our objective is to buyback our shares in a disciplined manner without
artificially pushing our share price up.
In final, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2013; and as we measure our guidance, we're starting with the fiscal
2012 total segment operating income of 5.4 billion we just reported, and exclude from this to $224 million of charges
related to the ongoing investigations in the United Kingdom, resulting in a base for 2012 of 5.6 billion for comparative
purposes.
And as we look at fiscal 2013, we expect our channel's businesses will generate strong year-over-year earnings growth,
resulting from continued double-digit growth that our cable networks led by further expansion of our international
channels, as well as sustained advertising and affiliate increases both by Fox News, the RSNs and FX.
Higher television segment earnings which will benefit from the continued growth and retransmission consent revenue,
and a strong political advertising market heading into the November election, the growth of our channel businesses will
be partially offset by reduced contributions from SKY Italia, largely due to the current economic climate in Italy.

Additionally, our operating plan for fiscal 2013 assumes the development spending in our Education Group amplify
from nearly $180 million which is $100 million more than we recorded in fiscal 2012. We are also assuming that the
contributions from our publishing segment will stabilize and be no worse than the results reported in fiscal 2012. And
also across the whole company, foreign currency rates will negatively impact our growth by about 1%.
And lastly we are continuing to exclude the cost of the UK investigations from our forecast due to their
unpredictability. Taking all these items into account and based on all the assumptions inherited in our projections, we
anticipate our total segment operating income percentage growth rate for fiscal 2013 to be in the high-single from low
double-digit range above the 5.6 billion fiscal 2012 segment operating income base level.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase.
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Thanks, Dave. I'd use the next few minutes to provide a bit more color on the value that Dave just gave. In a number
ways, I believe our ad volume guidance for 2013 does not fully reflect the underlying strength and momentum of our
core business.
Driving force of our growth will continue to be our cable channels and broadcast business. Networks like Fox, Fox
News and FX continue to build on their position as unique market leaders. We all continue to meet or exceed our
targets for retransmission and subscription fees, reflect the success with those networks. Internationally, we are ahead
of the targeted growth previously discussed and always looking to add new dimensions to this business. One of the
areas, where we are investing for the future in sports is in India.
The core STAR business will grow strongly in 2013, however, we will also be investing and building a dynamic Indian
sports business. All these strategic advancements will more than absorb STAR's growth this coming year; they will
take the business to a whole new level of profitability in the next three to four years. These are exactly the kind of
growth investment opportunities for targeting.
I also believe that one of the things that really set us apart is our strength in content. On the filmed side, the
international success of Ice Age 4 has gotten us off to a great start and our TV studio is once again an industry leader.
Demand for our product is stronger than ever as more companies strive to compete in the dynamic digital world.
Nonetheless, we believe the prudent approach for setting expectations in the content business is to be cautious when
we're tracking filmed contribution. So our guidance reflects essentially flat year-on-year results on a very large base of
profits.
At our satellite platforms, we believe our businesses and investments in the UK, Italy, Germany and India have never
been stronger competitively. In each case, the strength reflects the combination of leadership and content, technology
and operations.
The one business that is facing, real economic headwinds and will adversely impact 2013 results is Italy. We're focused
on taking steps to position SKY Italia for tough economic times, which will enable the business to resume its growth as
we move towards 2014. In all honesty SKY Italia is never been in a stronger competitive position and we could not be
more excited about the future of this business, particularly as the Italian economy begins to recover.
Another business part that we believe has long-term potential is education. However, we'll impact our overall growth in
2013 as Dave said as we're investing an incremental $100 million this year. Our aim here is to build a unique education
business positioned to take advantage of today's digital technologies. These investments are recorded as a loss on our
P&L; however, as in the case of other businesses, we successfully built over the years, we believe these are investments
that will pay off in multiples.
Recent agreements, like the one with the -- speak to unique excitement about this initiative we have more at Fox. We
know many of you would like to know more about our plans here and (inaudible) is planning to provide that data for

you this fall.
Finally, our publishing businesses are clearly in a restructuring mode, overall this segment is expected to be essentially
flat in 2013. We do expect start to see some of the benefits of our initiatives in the UK; however, Australia and News
America marketing will still be in the midst of restructuring and challenging pressures that will adversely affect --
impact problems.
As we look ahead into fiscal 2013, we also expect to you continue addressing our off balance sheet investments. In
some places like India, we've moved to monetize investments. In other cases, like our recently announced steps around
the assets of CMH in Australia, we're moving to take greater operating control of businesses. This is obviously an
ongoing process and we're up to layout timetables for future moves, but we will be optimistic.
Equally as important, we want to be flexible and opportunistic; we also recognized the importance of an efficient
capital structure to maximize shareholder value. We pursued a balanced approach of buybacks in investments to
achieve this goal and that continues to be our plan. Our undervalued stock continues to support our buyback plans, but
the same time, we believe there may be a strategic investment opportunities to exceed our target returns and strengthen
our businesses for growth.
Overall, we really like where we stand and are particularly excited as we move forward with our plan separations that is
really all about bringing focus and alignment to our businesses. The original Fox News to having a separation since we
announced it a little over a month ago, but everything is on course, and we're targeting to make our initial regulatory
filings around calendar year-end with operating details to file.
In closing, while these macroeconomic times may test our nerves, we are incredibly well positioned for another year of
growth, inclusive of the investments we're making. Ultimately, we feel confident our strategies will bring strong
shareholder returns for years to come. Thanks.
And now Chase, James and Dave would be happy to take your questions.
Questions And Answers
Operator
So, ladies and gentlemen, the executive team will take questions first from members of the financial community. In the
interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. (Operator Instructions) And we'll go to Michael
Nathanson with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
Michael Nathanson, Analyst
Hi. Thank you. I have two quick -- what I promise on, domestically on it, if you look at your affiliate fee growth this
year ended 12%, but it was lumpy, first half nine, second half 15, can you give us a sense of next year domestic affiliate
fee growth, what's the range within that ballpark of the fee growth?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
Yeah. It's pretty much what we said in the past, which again I think as we said, we sort of achieving month double digit
affiliate fee growth, but I think that as we look out that's the growth we expected, but there would be a little lumpiness
just because of when large deals come up and on particular channels they can give a quarter-to-quarter lumpiness, but
as we look out over the next few years, I think, we expect to continue the same sort of potential growth rate, we've been
generating.

Michael Nathanson, Analyst
Okay. And then lastly other question would be, you ought to have lumpiness on the cost side throughout the quarter
domestically, what's the right range of cost of organically, because I know there were lot more pieces on the domestic
side, but what's the range of cost growth for the domestic networks?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
I mean, that's the much tougher one than I get general statement, (inaudible) really got such a mix of businesses that are
in different places, I mean there, I think we do think it's important to make targeted investments to strengthen channels.
I think the channels where we think to be still have room to improve margins while the others will sustain margins in
that by buy channels that, we think, we should be, we can grow both the top and the bottomline that haven't yet
achieved their potential.
So, I think, if you look at our business, Fox News, which obviously has a much more controlled cost base, Sports
business has right to come up, the business is like transactions like -- agreements like ones with the US, see, where
we're investing to build a channel-like few. So I think we feel comfortable with those margins, but again, it's going to
be a mixed set of story, as you look across the big channels and you added many channels as we do and across the
expanse of sports entertainment, news and non-fiction, there are different strategies for each.
Michael Nathanson, Analyst
Thanks.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Swinburne, Analyst
Thank you. I guess, two questions on the guidance. So, one on the publishing business, you mentioned sort of flat
results, you talked about on the expense side, what you're doing there, it sounds like expenses will be down at least in
the UK?
And then on the clean-up around your investments, Chase, can you comment a little more on Sky Deutschland, I think
that the business is in sort of an inflection point, you've got Bundesliga rights now. I think they start the exclusive in the
fall and the businesses are into probably ramp in profitability, is that makes that something that you want to own more
over, any comments as in the opportunity in Germany, how you're feeling about operations maybe compared to Italy
and help us think about the long-term plan there?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I mean, I guess first on the cost side of the publishing, I mean, we certainly are focused on the cost and I think
particularly in some of the businesses that will be a major focus for the coming year, take their places, somewhere a
little further along for I just, I think, I would (inaudible) in a place like the UK, Australia, we've right into management
just the first half of this year, so that's probably one that is really going to moving into a very significant restructuring
during this year.

So, we get that part of our all those businesses, but there are little bit at different places, obviously the UK also has
initiatives, they are not just cost base like the Sunday Times that bring the dimension back that certainly cost, our major
focus across those businesses.
On Sky Deutschland, which we offered business, yet nothing really to be announced, as we said before, we're
comfortable were with that, where we're at today, I agree the business continues to make great strides forward. I think
the management team there has done a fabulous job, you could -- you need to see it in the service to subscribers and the
improvement in the financials and I think if you, any channel you could really feel like that the channel that really is
creating a real excitement about it.
They're sort of channels that we're excited about it, the launch of the sports news there added exciting mention to it. I
think the rest of rights we took, we just acquired on the Bundesliga will give us the opportunities to launch it again,
some of the technological enhancements we're adding to it, are really getting traction.
So, and the business doing really well and again, our focus today is on continuing to improve that business and drive it
everything you can, Ben. And well, besides as we got it down what's the right path for us in an ownership context.

Yes. We go to Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Jessica Reif Cohen, Analyst
Hi. I have also two questions. Chase, I was hoping you could just elaborate a little more on your global support
strategy. I mean, it really seems like you're focusing in on some really big markets, besides the rights fees, I think you
got something in Holland today, are you -- what is the level of investment, are you trying to develop plank of brands a
la [ph] ESPN and you're managing it, can they be global channels?
And the second question is can you just give some color on fiscal Q1 advertising outlook by business?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. And I think this product is (inaudible) yet, it's not a global strategy and I think it has to start sort of with a niche
business making investments that make sense there. Yeah, there may be, as we go forward, opportunities to look at it
more broadly, nothing to do with the ESPN, it is to do without the builted businesses that we think makes sense and we
think where we can drive real value.

We like sports, I mean, sports, yes, it's a cost effective, but I think the world is increasingly fragmented to digital and
it's been proved in time and time again that there's one area of content that just continues to sort of differentiate itself,
it's sports and I think sports as particularly unique values for you've got a large broad business that you look at India
where we've got multiple channels and the like and the ability even in the US perhaps, having those the big flagship
sports franchises that create value within the sports but in many ways, it becomes a part of the larger growth strategy
for those businesses.
But I think it really starts when you have to, best is big enough and we make it whether it's Germany, Italy, India or the
US or Latin America, we made all those bets we based and based on what we've been, but we try and make sure, we
believe we can generate returns we need within those markets, that there are opportunities that then take the breadth of
those investments and add dimensions, I think that's something we'd always love to do.
But the fundamentals are really to make sure we can add value there and clearly when you're adding sports in a base
where you got the breadth what we do with Sky Deutschland or SKY Italia or the breadth of the businesses in STAR or
the U-rated [ph] channels we've got in the US, sports plays uniquely important role in driving the business as a whole.
In terms of fiscal, for the advertising for the first quarter, yes, it's actually kind of feels reasonably good, I mean, there
may be couple of weeks you've been shut in, sort of, obviously pretty dormant from those just not the Olympics, but I
said, excluding sort of this immediate term.
It's marks pretty good and there is anxieties, I think still the anxieties for there's Europe or the election here and what
are the consequences to those, I think continue to -- certainly people height and short and people are bit on edge, but
when you look at the scatter market, the network is still up low double digit scatter market and cables always pick that,
cable markets, fairly, here stronger than that. And, it actually is the market -- recently it's been a reasonable good
market and it's not great, not of the charts, but recently solid market in a period when clearly there are a lot of anxieties
about the economy.
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Thank you, Jessica, if we have next question, please.
Operator
We go to Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Douglas Mitchelson, Analyst
Thanks. If I can actually follow-up on the advertising comment, can you give us a sense of what the domestic air
growth underlying your guidance is?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I mean, I think in the station business, we've assumed essentially pretty flat in a marketplace except -- that's be
underlying marketplace, that we've got market places like in low single digit, like one or -- the market like 1% deal --
1% or 2% (inaudible) while, 1% chance -- things up. So I think we assume a flat, close to flat marketplace, we do think,
we can take, we got success on taking share of and that is our goal for the year. That's, yes, I think we've assumed a
pretty flat in advertising market business overall.

Overall, that's station then and network?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. I mean, the network is, we're paying, we've added to come through the upfront, so it's a sort of into the network
that is sense of being a little bit more based on the upfront, certainly we, I think we achieved what we set out in the
upfront and sold about 80% of our inventory and equip, we're down at touch on volume, up on pricing and then, I think
certainly seen to what we've set to achieve in the scatter market, it has been pretty good so far.
Douglas Mitchelson, Analyst
And the follow-up to that Chase is and refer this answer this would be sort a little bit of everything, but the biggest
swing factors from the low end to the high end of guidance that you would point is to beyond advertising?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yes, beyond the marketplace?
Douglas Mitchelson, Analyst
Yeah.
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
And, now, that I guess, it's something to begin, and probably you'll start with the businesses that they said that we
broadcast live which is the film business and always we start that -- forecast we gotten off to a really good start with Ice
Age, it will be Ice Age film, but there is a business in media and on TV site, we think the digital world that produces a
lot of energy, we're kind of go out and get too far out there, I mean, you're getting more international activity than
you've had, so you've got a lot of -- and you've got energy, systematically you got more activity internationally.
We got to first make sure we continue to be disciplined about how we approach it and I think we probably said we're
not going to just have a quick buck. But, I think, see if there are opportunities there and I would not believe, we
projected sort of, any big buyer coming into in a new way. So we've approached it sort of much more based on -- the
world as we know, in the world and that I think is if I'm going to say, where do I think the digital world goes, you look
out next to be certainly feel like that it's going to happen, more buyers across the world that are looking to try to access
unique constants and I think we feel great about our constant brands and I think that would give us opportunities to
intelligently explore while sort of protecting and building our core business is the channels, but intelligently taking
advantage to digital.
So I'd probably say that basic that those would be the execution of content, on content film that we don't put in there
and the digital world providing opportunities that we haven't tried to project.

Richard Greenfield, Analyst
Hi. Couple of questions as to relate to cable nets; first on sports, I think your sports is such a vibrant part of what News
Corp is all about and I think some investors who don't like News Corp really fear that the RSN business is not in a
strong position. Just given the cost of those networks in the current multi-channel world relative to other networks, as
well as just the risk of (inaudible) networks when you see what's happening like in LA, using to have a lot confidence
in the trajectory of the RSN business, kind of help us all understand kind of why you are still confident in that
business?
And then just kind of a related question to the topic of cable net, we're seeing new distributors like Google Fiber with
their facilities build out and we're seeing some potentially new over the top MVPDs come on line over the course of the
next few months. Can you just update us on what your thought process is I know you're working with Google Fiber,
maybe just an explanation of why that would be great?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, I mean, on disappointing RSNs, I mean, I guess, yeah, I think the confidence is probably starts with the simple
fact that most of our agreements are pretty good terms at right now, meaning months and then departures what we're
dealing with, yeah, I think, most of them are at least five to six-year terms and some of them are in many are more
definite. So, the issues, we're dealing within the dollar terms get done, really ones that broadly exist. I think beyond
that, I think, we believe, we can navigate those issues and I think we've been pretty good, when I've used Texas as an
example what we did, feel a little bit of as we came out of Dallas with.
So, sports is always going to have a, all our business is going to get more parried with more players and that's part of
our challenge and try to make sure we've got the strengths and management, they continue to tackle those challenges
and build those businesses. And I think we've proven our ability to do it. So I guess, I think it's a combination of the
strength we've got and the track record, we've proven to be able to execute and in facing those challenges and the
strength of the agreements we've got in place for those businesses.
In terms as Google -- the Google Fiber, I mean, if you really mean, you mean the Kansas City, yeah --
Richard Greenfield, Analyst
Yes.
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
There are, I mean, eventually, they are building out in the cables, I mean, we just as we sort of satellite we don't sell
geographic exclusivity, so somebody comes in and wants to overbuild for this next generation cable system, we have
reached the right terms and kind of what divested, and we want to make sure it's the people that respect issues that are
important to us around piracy and everything else. So, generally, but if that players that -- again, we said, we think it's
important for the business and we can reach property business terms. We, just as we license our products at satellite
when they came on that thing, it's -- this is really, if you can say next generation cable operators building out a cable

system.
I think several digital MPVD thing is much more clear and much less clear consuming lots of that and is again, a lot of
stuff going on in digital, but I think that, that's much more difficult, but I don't think it's really about that far and off that
really have a clear picture of who is trying to watch. There are a lot of people talking, but I think that Google Fiber is
much clear, again, I think they just tell whether the economics of that work for them long term, I guess we'll see, but I
just don't say this next generation in our cable systems and broadband network.
And, I mentioned to them determining, can you generate it and I think from the digital revenues, but pay for that
incremental, for the cost they've invested in the ground.
Richard Greenfield, Analyst
Is that why you probably made an investment in Roku this quarter to just kind of have exhibit that over the top table?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
I think it's certain, the date is not that specific, I think it's -- I think what we know that the digital, this digital arena is
going to be important to our future. I think, you don't want to be -- you don't want to be spending it out of the curve,
because lot of business models are yet to evolve, but we think it's important for us to be active in this place and try and
get insights to it.
(inaudible) always gives us one important path just try and develop digital businesses, we've played a little bit with the
YouTube channels and this is more than clear, but it gives again an ability for a very modest investments that to try and
develop the different dimensions to this digital experience, growth of business again, a little different window into
digital experience, Roku also has to some -- has some values to our satellite platforms overseas that are probably be
different to what we be pursuing which is feasible here that could be enhanced and to that, they try and figure out,
which is clearly part of their strategy.
And you see it today as we roll out products, but it's, whether it's Sky Go or Sky On Demand of the like and better
understanding of kind of how you -- how do you develop that sort of everywhere TV concept as a satellite player. So I
think, its more, guiding the insights into the digital world -- in a way that we think it is smart, manageable.

Hi, thank you one for Dave and one for Chase. Dave, just wondering if you have the numbers on organic affiliate and
advertising revenue growth in the international cable networks, if you were to exclude the impacts of foreign exchange
and the impact of Fox Pan American Sports consolidation, we are just looking for a sense for the recurring growth rates
of those and then what they look like and what might be implied in your fiscal '13 guidance for those?
And then, I'll just give my follow-up here, which is, Chase that the LA Times reported that you're able to negotiate Fox
News with Time Warner at a very favorable step up initially. Just wondering if you can comment for us about that

networks early along with Fox News, just wanted to get some context for me on that? Thank you very much.

Dave?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
Yeah. On the -- as far as this Fox Sport center again like in the advertising, we're about 30% you pull off the.
Anthony DiClemente, Analyst
Thanks. And for the guidance any comment on sustainability of that type of organic growth?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
No. As we said before that we feel pretty good about double-digit growth, both on the international businesses.
Anthony DiClemente, Analyst
Okay. Cool. Thanks.
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
I am now going to comment about a lot about specific agreements and I think that's been our practice and we want to
achieve direct, I mean, I think we feel good about the agreement. I mean, that's not going to put us stick in anybody
eyes, maybe, I think we got goal and use this to get fair value for not trying to -- we're not trying to pick fights, we
think, Fox News has been undervalued for the importance having in the marketplace.
We have, as we've, I think talked about the fact by the end of the calendar year, we'll look for new, a sort of second
goal [ph], I think at least half the Fox News universe, we've expected and have -- we've expected to receive significant
increases reflects the value of that Fox Business Network, continues to make strides, well actually Fox Business
Network will be profitable this year.
So, it is and I think its -- clings to stronger channels as it goes forward. We always look to sort of and try and look at all
our franchises, find the right balance, I will say, we achieved what we set out to do and then probably exceeded targets
we had, which is pretty much, I'd say and really the affiliate -- the affiliation agreements, we've had certainly over the
last couple of years, I think, we have, we tried to be pretty disciplined, pretty clear and yes, in some places, we have
perhaps, definite increases, but I think where we do, we think it reflects the value whether it reach its mission of those
or other franchises and we have continued to achieve or exceed our targets, but I'm not going to get into comments on
specifics, we've got with good relations, cable and that would be our goal is to continue to have a constructive
relationship with them.

And we'll go to John Janedis with UBS. Please go ahead.
John Janedis, Analyst
Thanks. Can you just talk about any change in strategy you may employ in the near term in Sky tie-up to get to the
downturn, while you continue the retention program as trends pickup as it maybe mid to high teens at this point and as
the competitive environment turns it off? Thank you.
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
It's David, here. Thanks. Thanks, John. I think on Sky, look, I think, it's very clear to everyone particularly the Sky
tie-ups that the macroeconomic environment at least, providing some real challenges, but really the focus from a
strategic point of view is really handle the cost base, just we can really attack the cost base through a right size of
business in an economic environment that is very different than it was a number of years ago.
And actually across the board in terms of operating costs, and rights costs and things like that, subscriber management
is still a very, very big focus. And churn has picked up a bit, but I think that this year, we'll see that business has
stabilized and be able to grow from a different base and we have very high hopes for that business going forward.
On the competitive landscape side I've just stated, I think we all think its Sky tie up probably never been better
positioned competitively, it's performing very well in a challenging environment there. And I think when you hold it up
to their competitors and where media study is where the cable industry which doesn't really exist there is, which were
very good about positioning and right now it's just a question of really right sizing the cost base to deal with the
subscriber growth environment that really isn't going to be there for, a little while and to move from there.

see that get paid for or negotiate for with with TV Everywhere and authentication?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
I don't -- we have been like (inaudible) we think it's the right time. I mean, we think it's the right solution and it's --
there's a question. Yeah, I think it's what the consumer wants is that flexibility to get that content, where they want,
when they want, obviously, those become part of large negotiations in many cases, but we think it is right path for us
and our distributors, we think it's enabled us continue to grow this business in many ways leverage on some of the cost,
the cost of the content to a consumer I think is one of the most important ways to address that is to continue to give

consumers new things that excite them, make it more valuable and make them appreciated more and I use my
experience to DirectTV where as I said I think realistically, I don't think in most cases cost I mean obviously I was
scare but they really care about a quality experience with getting holistic things that excites them and if you really
deliver on their expectations, I think the business sales has real, I think we've ability to continue to add dimensions to it.
So we think it's the right past, we have to negotiate the appropriate agreements surrounded and some ways I think we
expressed our frustration that it hasn't moved faster.
And in some way fully recognized the importance of doing somethings like standardize and simplifying the experience.
And I hear the question it's too complicated and experience for consumers to encumber some of the experience for
consumers in a -- and I think we are getting look the simplicity of an iPad and we realize how important it is to create
an experience that reinvent[ph] figure out.
Alan Gould, Analyst
If I could follow-up, won't you realistically expect to have some a measurement on authentication and is that an
important milestone?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
You mean measurement.
Alan Gould, Analyst
So say you can measure advertising, get paid on the advertising side of it?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
We're getting paid. I mean we've got digital content and is getting; we're getting, it means we're getting value for
advertising today. We started a year ago when we wanted the upfront of being able to package part of our digital
advertising with our traditional television advertising stuff. We are measuring it today.
Now some of that sort of digital site, but it's going to be part of, it means part of the whole digital experience. I don't
think it's really, I don't give that as a purely an authentication issue may you have as digital and some of that digital
viewership will come through authenticated viewing, some of that will come through than who lose and other players.
But we are certainly well into trying to develop. We don't have the targeting. We're clearly targeting our advertising
broadly an opportunity to add on path. And I think one of the real opportunities for the business and I know cable guys
are investing in it and it's important for all of us. If you go how do we take that type of target advertising to another
level, but we certainly, we've been in it and developing at the last year and it's an important area of growth for us.

Thanks very much. Two questions, the first one is to help us kind of evaluate the scale and size of the international
cable business. Could you give us a sense on a pro forma basis for the fiscal year that just ended including Fox Pan
American Sports and STAR and all those things. What is the split in revenue and OI between international and
domestic? And then if you can give us a sense for what you think that would be underlying your 2013 guidance?
And the second question is, without addressing any specific partners, can you give us a sense of when we think about
the guidance next year doesn't anticipate any new additional player's of scale coming into the digital distribution
business, that you're counting on revenues form, or is it sort of anticipate the same basic playing field? Thanks.
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
No, I'm trying a lot of questions, I may, I think I don't who asked earlier about where the upside as it to touched on it
there I mean, we think will be mark 70[ph] but we haven't really -- our guidance does not factor any big new player or
something big happening and I think we've looked at it more as largely a continuation of the international side again at
that, some activity, probably do but it's, I think, we've guided in much more towards what we see today as opposed to
trying to handicap, what the new players do it, what I think that is an upside, I think it's much more than bit down but
that is mostly upside opportunity, perhaps, we haven't factored in the numbers.
And I think in terms of international it's roughly 25% of the earnings we just reported, it's 25% of revenue that are
international and it's pretty broad, okay. So many international set for a while, I mean, I think we said in the past, we
expect the business in 2015 to be and this is excluding STAR to be a $1 billion business we're at -- realistically we are
at that part of today. And then STAR would be on top of that, then it starts significant additional components to
international.

Just have a quick question for Mr. DeVoe. I just want to confirm that the guidance that you've laid out assumes that the
offer for CMG does not go through or in other words it's not in the guidance and if that offer does go through say
mid-year. Does that help your OI about a 1% or 1.5% of that directionally about the right number figured out, it's only a
calendar year, close mid-year fiscal?
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
It's not included in our guidance and I am wondered it wouldn't help our OI with part of that the moment we pick up the
equities is on the sports business. So here we're not too far off actually with this 1%.

Marci Ryvicker, Analyst
Thanks, Dave. Two quick ones; the first one, it sounds like the flat guidance for publishing will be driven primarily by
cost cuts rather than any stabilization in revenue, so is just the right way to think about this? And then my second
question is on education, when would this become a contributor to profits, is this a 12 to 18 month thing or a three-Year
initiative and will cost ramp up over time, so we're looking beyond fiscal 2013 that 180 million make or another 100
million each year?
Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer
May I now touch on the education with Dave touch on the publishing. I think, I really, I think that the right way to give
some visibility because we haven't in it, so comprehensive plan is to have Joel Klein do it which we're going to plan for
this fall and give it some visibility, I will say on (inaudible) left disbanding. We do look at probably 2013 is essentially
being a peak year, but and it's for now restart to pick up the revenue side and really invest in building things, we still
have significant investment in 2014, but '13 is probably the peak and again we will develop for advertising, Joel is
better off I guess a better sense to that and a better sense with products with clients are --
David DeVoe, Chief Financial Officer.
Yeah. End of subject really it's a combination of combination of cost cuts which also a combination of increases in
revenue; we certainly expect our business in the UK to significantly better in fiscal '13 as it did in fiscal '12.
