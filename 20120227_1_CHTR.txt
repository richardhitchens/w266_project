MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Charter's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
And Ms. Gutzler, you may begin your conference.
Robin Gutzler
Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2011 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. This morning we
issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. We will not review
those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make in this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2010 and
2011. The pro forma results reflect the divestiture and acquisition of Cable Systems in 2010 and 2011 as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2010, unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this
morning are on a pro forma basis.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our CFO, and Don Detampel, EVP
Technology and President , Commercial Services. The presentation that accompanies their comments can be found on
our website, charter.com under financial information. The press release and trending schedules are also posted on our
website under Investor and News Center.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Robin. I'm glad to be here. I've watched Charter for a long time and have always thought it's a great
company with terrific assets and real potential. The company has addressed some unique challenges in the past and I
believe it's now well positioned. I've been diving into the business and while still early on I'm impressed with the team,
the operations and the strategy for future growth.
In 2011, Charter improved its customer relationship growth trend and delivered solid financial results. The company
grew revenue by 2.7%, increased adjusted EBITDA by 3.3% and generated free cash flow of $488 million. With a
stronger balance sheet, Charter returned more than $725 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.
I'm excited about the year ahead and I believe there is significant opportunity for growth here. My focus will be on
ensuring that the fundamentals of taking care of our customers are constantly improving, that we offer products and
services that are better than any alternative and that we're a company that customers want to do business with.
The team here is terrific and I'm excited to be on board and to help Charter reach its full potential. I want to thank Mike
Lovett for his support in the transition phase and his leadership in implementing many elements that are critical to our
future success. Given that I've been at Charter for two weeks, I'm going to stop here and turn it over to Chris and Don
to give additional details about the fourth quarter, the past year and our strategic priorities. Chris?
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. We made significant foundational progress in 2011 and gained momentum in the back half of the year.
We maintained our focus and continued to execute consistently against our four strategic priorities which included
fundamentally improving the customer experience, leveraging our superior Internet product to drive residential
relationships, aggressively driving Commercial growth, and changing the dynamic in Video.
We made strategic investments in our business, which sets us up for future success. Specifically, we rolled out the first
wave of a multiyear customer experience transformation, switched digital Video and DOCSIS 3.0, covered 86% and
93% of homes passed at the end of the year, and we improved our existing products and added new residential and
commercial offerings.
This past year, we continued to focus on customer relationships by using Internet, our most competitive product today
to get our foot in the door, particularly in the more than 7 million homes where we don't currently have a Video
relationship where our Internet penetration is only 10%. We see a significant opportunity to win those households, and
ultimately, selling more product.

At the beginning of the fourth quarter, with significant progress on the building blocks, we felt it was the right time to
get aggressive to capture share and increase customer relationships. We saw the results of those efforts in our Q4
results.
In the past quarter, we drove increased volume and grew revenue 2.6% on prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was basically
flat with the prior fourth quarter, driven by one-time effects in both Q4 2011 and Q4 2010.
So let me provide some background on the drivers within the quarter. As Slide 6 highlights, we ended the year strong
with very favorable customer trends and momentum as we entered 2012. We grew residential customer relationships by
nearly 3,000 this past quarter versus a decline of approximately 35,000 in the year-ago quarter, and we grew non-video
relationships by nearly 50,000.
In terms of residential primary subscriber units, or PSUs, we drove an increase of approximately 50,000 compared to
1,900 last year. We more than doubled our residential Internet gains versus last year and continued to see penetration
opportunity, particularly in non-video homes, which comprise just over 65% of our footprint and where we increased
our penetration with Internet or Phone in the past year by roughly 25%.
Phone grew sequentially and while not quite matching gains of prior year Q4, the year-on-year comparison improved
relative to prior quarters in the year. We also improved our Video performance cutting losses by more than 25%. We're
very pleased with our success in growing volume coming out of Q4 and that momentum continues across all product
lines. The strategy is the right approach and timing to create long-term value.
Turning to Slide 7, our overall fourth quarter revenue grew by 2.6%. In the residential side of the business, Internet rose
8.6% and Phone increased 2.8% while Video decreased 2.5%. In Video, our biggest opportunities are reducing Video
losses and driving advanced services penetration, which our strategic initiatives are squarely focused on.
Video ARPU increased 2.9% of prior year as a result of price adjustments in the third quarter and higher digital and
HD/DVR penetration. However, premium revenue development remains lackluster decreasing by $6 million versus the
prior year.
As shown on Slide 8, Internet ARPU increased 2.2% versus prior-year Q4, nearly flat versus Q3 with higher attach
rates of our $10 home networking product offsetting the effect of promotional offers.
Phone ARPU decreased $0.50 versus Q4 of last year reflecting our strategy to drive penetration particularly with
existing Double-Play customers. Given the retentive benefits in incremental margin increasing Triple Play Phone
penetration at a reduced Phone ARPU is accretive. It's still early in the year but the momentum we had coming out of
Q4 is continued nicely in the first two months of 2012, which sets us up for long-term success.
The team has already made some tweaks to acquisition and migration plans to balance rate and volume to ensure we are
maximizing revenue. Success in our Commercial business continued with another quarter of accelerated growth
highlighted on Slide 9. We drove revenue gains of almost 22% year-on-year, excluding Video, revenue rose nearly
30% in the fourth quarter. The majority of the growth was due to higher sales to small to medium-sized businesses as
well as a healthy increase in sales to carrier customers.
We are making the investments to drive this business, so you'll see CapEx accompanying the accelerated growth. These
investments, particularly in cell backhaul significantly strengthened our IP capabilities at the core and at the edge of the
network, which supports all of our residential and commercial services including Video over time.
Fourth quarter ad sales were down nearly 5% year-on-year. Q4 2010 included the benefit of political advertising, and
while we had a bit of political advertising this year, the year-over-year difference for political spend was approximately
$9 million. So excluding this effect, core advertising grew by 7% and overall revenue grew by 3.1%.
Looking at Slide 10, total year adjusted EBITDA grew 3.3% and margin increased 20 basis points compared to last
year, while Q4 adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat and margin decreased from 38.3% in 2010 to 37.4% in 2011.
Within the quarter, the year-over-year decrease was driven by several factors. First, the effect of the fourth quarter 2010
political advertising. Second, programming expense grew $31 million versus a year ago, now, keep in mind that Q4 of

last year reflected a one-time accrual adjustment. The full year programming cost rose 4% in total or 9.3% on a per
customer basis.
Finally, within the fourth quarter, we also invested in accelerated growth and our customer experience transformation.
All-in-all when you consider these three effects, we believe the impact to Q4 adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year
basis was roughly $20 million. As we continue to execute on these initiatives, revenue will naturally lag investment and
we're seeing a near-term impact on margins and cash flow from the growth in customer experience investments. But
these efforts will ultimately benefit our financial profile long-term.
Turing to Slide 11, in CapEx, we finished 2011 with $1.3 billion capital expenditure, which was at the low end of our
$1.3 billion to $1.4 billion guidance. This represented an increase over 2010 driven by investments in our rapidly
growing Commercial business. Commercial CapEx totaled $195 million, representing roughly $60 million of our $102
million increase year-on-year. The remaining increase stemmed from investments in our sales and product capabilities
and incremental capital for storm-related damage in 2011. Both years, 2010 and 2011, included spending for DOCSIS
3.0 and switched digital video which were essentially completed at year end. Combined spend for those investments
was approximately $65 million in 2011.
Q4 CapEx totaled $327 million, a $66 million increase over prior year, driven primarily by higher spend for
Commercial, Internet infrastructure, such as CMTS, and support capital. About three-quarters of our CapEx remained
success based.
Looking ahead to 2012, assuming higher residential and commercial growth, we expect CapEx to total $1.4 billion to
$1.5 billion in 2012. We want to provide some color around those assumptions. We expect Commercial CapEx to grow
similar to the 2011 increase, and to support higher expected residential growth, we expect spending in the following
areas: CPE driven by customer volume and more aggressive HD/DVR, higher CMTS for upstream and downstream to
support speed increases, higher penetration and increased usage, service group splits to gain further HD capacity on
SDV taking our HD channels to 100-plus in the course of this year, and further investments in the customer experience,
both in the systems and the network. This is an ambitious activity plan subject to achieving the higher growth rates and
targeted benefits of certain programs. And more importantly, as Tom gets his arms around the business and sets the
agenda, we'll look to provide an updated estimate after Q2.
As Slide 12 highlights, in 2011, we generated $488 million of free cash flow and we ended the year with $1.3 billion of
liquidity. Our leverage target remains 4 to 4.5 times and we're comfortable plus or minus a half turn either way to
enable strategic activity. We look at investment opportunities inside the business and also externally in the form of
M&A and absent those opportunities, we will evaluate the best return of capital to our shareholders over time and we'll
be disciplined.
We've demonstrated that discipline this past year and we've taken an opportunistic approach. We signed or closed on
more than a dozen tack-on acquisitions or swaps, we returned more than $725 million of capital to our shareholders, for
about 150% of free cash flow, buying back 12.7% of the company since the beginning of 2011.
That reduced our shares outstanding to 100.6 million shares at the end of the year. In addition, we've been busy this
past year enhancing our liquidity position and improving our maturity profile. From January 2011 to February 2012,
we've raised more than $5 billion of debt to extend our maturity profile and approximately 90% of our debt now
matures beyond 2015.
More recently, we began to reduce our annualized interest expense by taking out costly legacy debt at better rates.
Since the last two tender offers and the repayment of the remaining bonds in March and April, we will be able to
reduce run-rate interest expense by approximately $100 million on an annualized basis. Keep in mind that full run rate
doesn't start until April.
And moving to the next slide, a quick update on our tax assets. At 12/31, our NOLs totaled $7.4 billion and our tax
basis was $9.3 billion. We have provided additional disclosure in our 10-K and on Slide 13 to give more color around
the timing and amounts of depreciation and amortization of our tax basis which we hope you'll find helpful.

I'll now turn the call over to Don to review the 2012 priorities.
Donald F. Detampel
As Chris outlined, we've been building momentum as we head into 2012. This year we'll continue to focus on our four
strategic priorities summarized on Slide 14, which are consistent with 2011. We will continue our customer experience
transformation which is the foundation of our overall strategy. Our goal is to deliver an unmatched customer experience
through a companywide initiative that is gaining traction. We still have a lot of work to do but the cultural
transformation is taking hold and early customer feedback is positive. Satisfaction for our new customers is 35% higher
than for tenured customers. We're implementing our 'None or One' philosophy, meaning that customers should not
experience any disruptions in their Charter services, none, but if they do, we'll make it right the first time, one, and
we're backing that all with a service guarantee.
Our second priority is to deliver the fastest, most reliable and clearly superior broadband service. For the third time in
two years, we increased our Internet speeds further distancing ourselves from the competition. In December, we
announced the increase of both download and upload speeds for our residential and commercial customers, and 95% of
our customers are now on speeds 15 meg or higher. But our Internet service is about more than being fast, it's about
being powerful, it's multidimensional including download and upload speeds and ease-of-use.
We're focused on delivering the best Internet experience for our customers particularly with the growing number of
IP-enabled devices in homes. And we have the network capacity to deliver that rich experience now and in the future as
the demand for high speed services increase. In addition, we're driving managed home networking solutions which
allow us to be the solutions provider for our customers and also benefits ARPU. Today, one out of four of our
residential Internet customers rely on us for home networking. Third, we'll continue to aggressively drive growth in our
commercial services business.
As Chris mentioned earlier, we drove fourth quarter revenue gains of almost 22% year-on-year in our commercial
services business and our momentum continues to accelerate. We will continue to invest capital to upgrade our regional
core networks and extend our fiber plant to support cell tower backhaul opportunities passing additional business
opportunities on the way.
As of the end of 2011, we had 1,400 cell towers in service and over 300 towers under contract and the pipeline remains
very healthy. We'll also continue to expand our commercial product offerings with advanced telephone services and
enhanced ETHERNET connectivity. We're making improvements to automate and streamline our back office to
support the Commercial business and we're supporting all of these initiatives with an aggressive sales effort. We see
lots of opportunity for growth in this area.
Our fourth strategic priority for 2012 is to change the dynamic in our Video business. We have deployed a version of
the TiVo product in Fort Worth and are working with TiVo to field test the product in several other markets with our
employees. We don't expect that testing will be completed in time for us to fully launch TiVo across the enterprise by
the end of the second quarter as previously projected. Meanwhile, we currently deliver a very robust video product and
continue to enhance it. We've added exciting new video content such as the NFL Network and we advanced our TV
Everywhere capabilities with the launch of our unique online search and discovery engine and increased streaming
capabilities.
We ended the year with an average of 75 HD channels per market and we plan to significantly increase the number of
channels available to our customers by the end of this year. We'll continue to bring even more content on demand and
drive HD/ DVR penetration and we recently completed our EBIF software deployment which provides the platform for
product and advertising applications that enhance the customer experience and laid a foundation for Interactive TV.
And now back to Tom.

Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Don. As we enter 2012, we're continuing to accelerate our volume growth year-over-year. We'll stay on the
offensive as we move to increase penetration and drive deeply into the marketplace. Pricing, packaging and
technological innovation are the key focus areas for me personally as I get up to speed. This is a great company with
even greater potential. There's a lot of work ahead of us, but we're focused on execution. We're in a terrific position and
I'm pleased with the start of our new year. I look forward to delivering on our strategic plan and capitalizing on our
opportunities and I'm confident that we're setting the stage for long-term shareholder value.
Operator, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Maybe we should start with just the sort of operating margin
thoughts for the year CapEx going up pretty nicely, it's a lot of success based in, is that – should we assume that's a
significant increase in the marketing budget and so that margins contract a little bit through this year, how do you think
about that?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, as a general proposition we look at growth and growth opportunities as a return to
capital and not particularly from a margin perspective. So depending on the various revenue mixes, whether it's from
business services or from video you get different margins and so rather than give guidance on margin, I want to say that
we're focused on growth.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Okay.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think that's right. So from a technical standpoint, obviously, it's we are increasing on
the acquisition side both on CapEx as well as marketing their success based acquisitions. Of course, you have cost per
order, you increase the amount of media spend to go drive inbound call volume and commissions and reconnect spend,
but as Tom pointed out, not trying to get into guidance on the margin, but some of those cost categories will tick up to
the extent we're having success.
<Q - Phil Cusick>: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. It's Jeff Wlodarczak, a couple for Tom. Realizing it's early, I wanted
to get your thoughts around potentially rebranding at Charter. You've met with a lot of success with Optimum. And
then your thoughts about continuing Charter's Dish and TiVo partnerships, and I have one follow-up.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I don't have any opinion on rebranding. You're right, we used a brand strategy at
Cablevision that was successful. You've seen Comcast do a similar thing with XFINITY. So it is an opportunity but I
haven't worked through the marketing issues with the Charter team yet on that particular issue.
Regarding DISH and TiVo, DISH is a relatively small channel. It's unusual but successful. And so we'll look at that.
I'm not sure I would have come up with that on my own, but it is interesting and successful. And TiVo, I've always
thought was a fabulous user interface and I'm glad to see that Charter and TiVo have been working together to bring
that user interface to our customers. And so, as we work through those issues, I'm excited by the way TiVo can present
information to our customers.

<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: All right, sounds good. And then just wanted to get your take on potential M&A, does
Charter need more scale? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: No. With regard to scale, I think Charter can be a very successful company at its current
size. It's – the thing that's great about Charter is that it has 12 million passings. It's got a huge runway in terms of
opportunity and it can be a much larger company without any kind of change in potential marketplace.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you provide a bit more color on your
CapEx outlook and specifically some of the one-time projects or initiatives that are embedded in the guidance and how
long they may take to complete? And then if I could ask a second question, your video results were a bit better than our
estimate and could you provide any changes or any color, I should say, on changes that you may be seeing in the
operating environment and landscape either from a competitive perspective or from a consumer perspective?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So I'll take the CapEx one. The – as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the CapEx
estimate that we've provided today really is contingent on higher growth from both the residential and the commercial
segments and I mentioned that we expect similar amounts of increase in 2012 as we experienced in 2011. In 2011, it
was $60 million for commercial and then the remaining categories really a success based CapEx, whether it's HD/
DVR, it's the scalable infrastructure associated to CMPS investment and the converged IP network and it's different
programs related to driving growth. So I think it's less about one-off items and it's much more about the growth
opportunity.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Okay, so there are – we don't know what sort of SDV like or...?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, I mentioned that there are service group splits for switched digital video which
enables us to take the channels to over 100. But as your expanding capacity, which is enabling further growth on the
network, you're always going to have these type of investments.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: All right, okay.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And the second question again was...?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: The video question.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Right. Yeah, just perhaps you could provide a bit of color on the environment for video at this
point and anything you've seen from either the consumer perspective or competitive perspective?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, go ahead.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So look on the video side what we're seeing is we've seen a 25% improvement
year-over-year on the net losses. Obviously, we'd like to change that into an even better performance over time but it is
an improvement, I think that reflects a couple of things. One is customers are recognizing that it is a different day at
Charter and that we have taken customer experience seriously. So I'd like to think that you see some of that coming
through. We've done – made some improvements to the packaging of offers. We're running a free HD/DVR inside of
Q4 and that has certainly had an impact.
I also think you see a slowing down of the overbuild as it relates to particularly U-verse, which is kind of 30% of our
footprint and 4% is FiOS. So you see that impact slowing down. The lines have been drawn, and so we are certainly
hopeful that some of those impacts will slow down. And the network is increasingly digital, which improves the
amount of subscriber losses to which you are subject to. So I do think there is some fundamental trends that are

happening inside the business and we'd like to keep it up in terms of the improving performance.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: That's right. And I think we can continue to improve our video product. Relatively,
rapidly, we have a network that's highly capable from a physical perspective and it's a question of launching all of our
product in HD, getting a fully digitized product in front of all of our customers, and essentially having a superior video
product to our competitors, which we're able to do and we're on track to do.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Thanks. Just one last little caveat question around this issue of the consumer. Have you seen
in your view any change to the way consumers are currently behaving within your footprint?

at Cablevision such as the RS-DVR, municipal Wi-Fi, going all digital. I just wanted to get your thoughts on whether
you see an opportunity for Charter to pursue those similar initiatives and I guess specifically on all digital is that
something that should be a priority for the company or is that something you can spread say over a three to five year
period? Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Right, well. All cable systems in the United States have similar architectures and they're
highly capable. But we're in a – and Cablevision was successful in its approach, in its time and place, and Charter has a
different time and place, but the network's as capable as any network in terms of what it can do. The question is what
do you do first and how do you do it in the unique circumstances that we're in today? And while I think RS-DVR
ultimately is a strategy for enhancing the value of the network and moving intelligence into the network and reducing
CPE, I'm not sure it's an immediate priority for Charter. I think having a full digital product available to our customers
is an immediate opportunity. How soon we go and turn off all the analog from a digital perspective, I've yet to
determine, but I think we can get to market very quickly with a complete and robust digital product. And as Don said,
we have a Wi-Fi strategy already at Charter and a significant portion I think a quarter of our customer base is already
buying Wi-Fi services from us, so, we have an opportunity to extend that opportunity, but I don't have a game plan yet
to express.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Okay, thanks for your thoughts. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: I have a question for Mr. Rutledge maybe on similar lines, maybe it's too early to say
much. But as a layman, just looking at Cablevision relative to Charter, it just seems that you almost couldn't pick two
more different cable companies. Cablevision, very clustered, Charter, less so. Cablevision, very urban, Charter, less so.
Cablevision, low DBS, Charter, very high; Cablevision, high FiOS, Charter, low FiOS. I mean the list – high video
penetration at Cablevision, low at Charter. So I know it's sort of early days but as you sort of look at that list of
differences, how do you think that will influence the opportunity at Charter relative to sort of the game plan at
Cablevision?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well as I just said – Charter isn't Cablevision and it's a different time and place for me
with the issues in front of Charter, but inherently, the physical asset, the cable system that passes 12 million homes at
Charter is a highly capable network and we can design products on that network that are superior to our competitors
and I think we can drive into the market place. It is true that it's less clustered which requires different kinds of

marketing strategies and tactics but I think those tactics are available to us. So at some level – the cable systems are
similar, the architectures and the physical assets are similar. Obviously, Charter went through some unique
circumstances that gave it a marketplace disadvantage. Those issues are behind us and now we have a sort of a
greenfield marketplace opportunity product perspective and so growth is our priority and when you think about how
many unsold passings we have, there's a big opportunity.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: And so is ultimately – is sort of acceleration and top line growth the primary metric

Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Hi, thanks. Given your CapEx guidance, should we assume that commercial growth will kind of
accelerate in 2012 relative to this year? And also high speed data ARPU grew nicely in the quarter. Can you help us
think about high speed data growth over the next few quarters particularly as you balance that with customer
relationship growth? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So Amy, this is Chris. On CapEx, the answer is yes. It should assume that commercial
continues to accelerate growth. On the second one for high speed internet ARPU, I think it's less about the actual
ARPU here – Charter's at a different stage than maybe even some of our peers given our low penetration rate. Both
were – both crossed the entire base of homes passed and particularly in those areas where we don't have a customer
relationship today, it really is about driving growth. And what we've been able to do so far is to be aggressive in the
marketplace with promotional offers. Not only do you get the benefit of that roll-off price once it is coming off
promotion but in the meantime what we've been able to successfully sell in is 25% of our base has this in-home Wi-Fi
product that's offsetting some of the promotional pricing on ARPU. And as a result of that, we've been able to keep
ARPU relatively flat, sequentially and year-over-year. I mean it bounces around a little bit here and there depending on
which lever you pull. But that's really how we think about Internet ARPU is not much, it's really about driving growth.
There will be a time and place for that but Charter may be in a different place than others.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. Thanks. And can you also talk about programming expectations for this year either on an
absolute basis or on a per sub basis?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So, go ahead.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I don't think we want to discuss our future programming contracts. It's an issue in
the business and we'll try to manage it the best we can.

and I think there are a variety of tactics to do that and we're not today laying out a all digital strategy but it is something
that the business has to do and will do.
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: And I will also note that in certain nodes we are all digital, so we've already started that
effort.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Okay. And on the residential video link subscriber losses, do you have a sense of there – the
reason for leaving – the breakdown between were they going to Telco, satellite or just economic reasons?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: At a fundamental level, I think our video product in some households isn't as competitive
as it ought to be. And our job is to make it more competitive and superior to our competitors as quickly as possible.
There are other forces besides that. There are economic forces. As I said earlier, I don't think those are getting worse, so
I think our actual video performance is improving year-over-year. And I think it will – if we do what we're supposed to
do, which is to have a superior digital product, we ought to be able to grow video.

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Great, thank you. A couple of questions. Tom, I see the general strategy appears to be
pretty similar to sort of non-conventional strategy we've heard outlined from Charter before you came, but you can give
us an idea, are there any – should we be looking for any changes from you maybe when you report first quarter – any
update on your overall strategy. I assume you're pretty much on board with that and then any thoughts on – and
particularly with thoughts on the DISH partnership that you've done, has that helped grow the non-video customers and
what do you think of the – after a few months of that under the belt, how do you feel about that as a longer-term
opportunity?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I've only been here two weeks, so it's not a couple – I'm still learning where the –
how the elevator works. And so I don't have an opinion on it other than to say that it's an effective strategy. And
Charter does have a superior Internet product almost everywhere – virtually everywhere it operates. And it has invested
heavily in its Internet service. It can deploy massive speeds across its platform and that's a distinguishing characteristic
of the company and it has taken advantage of that. That doesn't mean we can't do other things as well, and so I will try
to make all of our products as good as our Internet product.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay. And then what do you think is the ultimate penetration of the Home Networking
product? I've seen you've done some marketing studies and so forth, so it's been a nice lift for what seems to be a little
bit of a curious product. Congratulations on getting customers to pay for that, but where do you think that kind of goes
ultimately going forward?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I think depending on how you price it, you can – and how you package it, you can
dictate the market share. And I think it's healthy for us to have a Wi-Fi product in our customers' homes at very high
penetrations.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and welcome aboard, Tom. Can you provide a little

<A - Donald F. Detampel>: I can respond to that. So first of all I just want to echo Tom's words, I mean we remain
very committed to the TiVo platform. We believe that the experience it delivers to our customers is superior than
anything we have in the market right now. So we remain very committed. In our particular circumstance, the
integration of the TiVo platform into our platform, basically we had different baud systems than TiVo had integrated in
the past. So what we're working through are some of those integration issues. But we had previously believed that
through the first half of this year that we'd be pretty well implemented across the enterprise. We now know based on
our testing that we will require some further field testing and we're not going to deliver that product to our customers
until we know it's fully baked and right.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Fair enough. Can you give us an update on Charter Starter. I know that was an initiative last
quarter that I thought was intriguing. How is it working out?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So Charter Starter is doing exactly what it was intended to do. It was never intended
to be a significant driver of volume. It is a very, I think, helpful way to get the product to the customer in a way that
they can actually afford to take the product in a way that's protecting Charter as well from a credit standpoint. But it
was never one of Charter going out and trying to specifically target that segment over time but just making sure that we
could be fair to the customers and fair to Charter as well. It's doing that but it's not a material driver of volume.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: I mean it's kind of hard to suss out what CapEx is going to be contributed to what but since the
commercial incremental increase last year was $60 million, the incremental this increase this year – I mean- is it going
to be roughly half of the stated increase?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think what I said in the prepared remarks is that we expected a similar increase in
commercial CapEx as what we had experienced in 2011 as we – heading into 2012.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Hello, sorry about that. You mentioned you're focused on return with respect to the CapEx,
focused on return rather than margins, I understand that. Can you give us a sense though of what the hurdle rates that
you set out when you plan your CapEx budgets?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I don't think that's something we disclose and want to. No, we don't and we wouldn't
want to. What I can reference you back to is what we've said in the past, is it depends a little bit by product, right? If
you take a look at things like cell backhaul, obviously you accept longer paybacks because it's a secured revenue
stream with a long-term contractual horizon. As you take a look at residential products that don't have the same type of
contractual requirements, the payback, both by needs as well as just by definition of what we're getting is much, much

shorter on some of those products. Those hurdles are in place internally. They depend by product and by segment as
well.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: I mean, I guess from my standpoint, this year you did about $2.7 billion of EBITDA.
You've told us that you intend to spend roughly $1 billion on success-based CapEx. I'm just trying to get a sense how
much incremental EBITDA can we realistically expect over the next few years? I mean, can Charter ever become a
$3.5 billion EBITDA company?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think what you're not picking up in that analysis is that – the answer is we're not
going to provide the answer. But what you're not picking up inside of there is that repairing the video business means
substituting what today is well over $100 million of bucket that we have to fill of revenue, a portion of that on EBITDA
every year. So, stopping the video losses and potentially returning that business to growth over long time is the
opportunity as we continue to deliver on commercial and Internet. But, when you take a look at EBITDA growth, if
you looked at these, the CapEx and the revenue in EBITDA coming from those growth areas in isolation and not offset
that with the Video losses you'd be looking at it in the wrong way. Is that helpful?
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Yeah, it is. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi, I have a couple of questions. First on Video. You made a comment that you're seeing the
Video business sort of improve, but I'm still looking at sequential Video revenue sort of decelerate, actually decline and
even though the subscriber losses are improving. So, can you give us some context? I think you mentioned something
about a $6 million premium revenue decline, some context on that would be helpful. And second, a more philosophical
question for Tom, obviously, the network at Charter is very different from what you've seen at Cablevision and also
what you probably saw at Time Warner Cable, can you sort of talk about how far are the networks, what does it take to
sort of get to the same level playing field? Are we two years behind? Obviously, CapEx is sort of trending up in part to
operating the plan for DOCSIS and everything else, so some context on that would be really helpful. Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So I'll take the first one on video is, you're right, if you take a look at the sequential
development of revenue, the key things to keep in mind is, one is the timing of rate increases. So we did take some rate
increase inside of Q3 and that's why you saw a lift inside of Q3 on video related to that. The second one is that, as
you've heard Tom talk about the opportunity he believes here, and we all believe is that the opportunity to drive further
proactive migration to digital and to HD/ DVR, some of that upgrading that we've had in the past has not taken place as
aggressively inside 2011, and so that's a revenue opportunity that has historically offset a lot of the subscriber losses
and we didn't see as much of that in 2011, the opportunity there is large.
And the third one, as you've pointed out, is historically we've been able to drive increases in premium as well as Video
on Demand and I think that's more driven by the economy inside of 2010, 2011, we've seen a lot less of that premium
and Video on Demand uptake. In fact, premium as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, was down $6 million
year-over-year. So it's all of those factors, it's subscriber losses which have declined and we are doing a better job there
and it's digital and HD/ DVR, where we have a larger opportunity, and then rate increases, as I mentioned, where we'll
be having some rate that will be taking place effectively inside of Q2, on the video and Internet product. And it's
stopping those subscriber losses is the big one.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So on your philosophical question, as I said earlier, the network that we have is a
high-capacity, fully upgraded network. We have a capability of delivering superior products in video data, telephony
and in-home Wi-Fi across our platform. And we can build products that are integrated in such a way that the overall
value that we're providing is superior to our competitors.
The network is essentially built, there are additions and minor upgrades to the network but we have two master
head-ins, we have the capability of providing high-quality digital products throughout the United States and it's a

question of putting them together in the right packaging, pricing and product mix and driving yourself into the

Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with Standard & Poor's.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Good morning, thank you so much for taking the question. I apologize, Chris if you've alluded
to this, I'm trying to get an update on the VOD premium take rates, I think you alluded to card shaving last time, I was
wondering if there is any update on that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I did mention that premium year-over-year has seen a decline of $6 million
Q4-over-Q4. So some of those trends we've seen to continue. Video on Demand, the overall usage is going up quite a
bit but it's really taking place inside the free Video on Demand space. So Video on Demand, year-over-year was
relatively flat in terms of dollars and overall usage is significantly higher but the pay usage per customer has declined
and I think that's consistent with what you're hearing from other MSOs as well.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay, that's helpful. And on the tax basis, I see that the number kind of dropped from about
$10 billion to $9.3 billion and you've talked about that as a major tax attribute along with the NOL and I do agree. So I
guess my question as you look out to your projection on regarding the kind of the year that you feel those would apply
to, seems to me a little bit conservative, you talk about 2017 potentially as a date that you expect to become a full
taxpayer but -
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: If I can interrupt, I think what we're saying is we do not expect to become a material
cash income tax payer until after 2017. And the feeling from us hasn't changed. Of course, that's subject to a number of
different variables but as of today that's what we are comfortable saying that we would not be a material cash income
tax payer until 2017. And on the book value, the tax basis, if you remember as that tax basis amortizes it flows into net
operating losses, so if you take a look at net operating losses, they're actually higher.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay, that's helpful. Just one last question then for Tom, sorry for the question that seem to
compare to Cablevision, but I had one myself. I guess as you think about what you did there in terms of getting content
out to consumers in and outside the home and you look at Charter, where do you see perhaps the opportunities? I know
both companies seem to be going a little bit different ways. You did the TV to PC relay and some of the other
initiatives there.
Charter clearly seems to be going a little bit different route. They talk about the charter.net aggregation with the SVOD
provider, the search and discovery with TiVo, which they're pursuing a little bit more aggressively. So, I guess the
question is, how do you kind of reconcile those two strategies in terms of getting the content out to the consumers
within and outside the home? And what are their rights – associated rights issues with that from both companies'
perspective? It seems to me that Charter has a little bit different sets of right issues to deal with here given the
difference in strategy. So any comments around those would be helpful? Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well. Again, they're two different companies and decisions I will take at Charter will be
based on the circumstances at Charter. And the opportunities that the market presents to us. And there inside the cable
business, the right structures are fairly similar from a programming perspective across the industry. And the copyright
laws are obviously applied across the United States. So, the opportunities that those laws and rights structures present
themselves to most of the players in the business and I'm not prepared to announce a new strategy for Charter today,
but we have a highly flexible network and a highly capable network and we have the ability to mix and match those
opportunities and present them to our customers in a way that we think will resonate in the marketplace. And so, stay
tuned.

areas in some aspects of our products, but you see our Internet product is now in the marketplace being marketed as a
vastly superior product to our competitors. What we intend to do is bring all of our products to that position and to
