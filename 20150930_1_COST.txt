Now to begin with, our fourth quarter fiscal 2015 operating results, net sales for the fourth quarter came in at $35
billion, up 1% overall from a year ago. Comp sales were down 1% on a reported basis, but were up 6% including the
negative gas and FX impacts. Gas prices for the quarter were down 21% year over year, negatively impacting U.S.
comp figures by a little more than 3 percentage points, so a plus 6 percentage points U.S. comp, excluding gas price
deflation. Foreign currencies overall were weaker relative to the dollar year over year in the fourth quarter such that our
reported international comps, on a reported basis, are minus 10% in Canada and a minus 7% in other international.
Assuming flat year-over-year FX rates and excluding gas price deflation, it would have been plus 7% in Canada and
plus 6% elsewhere internationally. For the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.73, up $0.15 or 10% from last
year's $1.58 figure.
In terms of a year-over-year EPS comparison, a few items of note, and the biggest item of note, FX. In Q4 year over
year, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign
earnings this year in Q4 being lower by about $53 million after tax or $0.12 a share than these earnings would have
been had FX exchange rates been flat year over year.
Number two, income taxes. Our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that, in the aggregate,
decreased our income tax line by $23 million or about $0.05 a share. The largest component of the $23 million figure
was a $17 million or almost $0.04 a share income tax benefit that resulted from our decision to repatriate in the near
future from Canada back to the U.S., CAD 750 million or about $560 million of cash balances.
Third item of note, IT modernization. As discussed in the past several quarters, our major IT modernization efforts are
ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through the next fiscal year and
possibly beyond, especially as new major systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the fourth quarter,
on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or six basis points, or
four basis points without deflation in FX, or about $0.03 a share.
And lastly, LIFO. Last year in the fourth quarter, we recorded a pre-tax LIFO charge of $11 million pre-tax or $0.02 a
share. This year, we actually had a LIFO credit or a bring-back of $14 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share. A lot of that had
to do with gas deflation.
In terms of new openings, for all of fiscal 2015, we opened 25 new locations, which included two relos, so a net of 23;
12 new in the U.S, three each in Mexico and Japan, and one each in Canada, U.K, Taiwan, Korea and Australia, which
therefore ended fiscal 2015 a few weeks back with 23 net new warehouses and a total of 686 locations operating
worldwide. For the current fiscal year '16, our plans are to add up to 32 net new warehouses, including a few business
centers in the U.S. 18 to 20 of the planned new locations will be in the United States, with the remaining international
markets, including our second opening in Spain and our first opening planned for France. During the first four months
of 2016 through calendar year end, we plan to open 13 of those – up to 32 warehouses, including two relos, so net of
11; nine in the U.S, one each in Canada, Australia, Japan and Spain, and then the two U.S. relos in that 11 figure – in
the nine figure, sorry.
Also this morning I'll review with you, our membership trends and related activities, our e-commerce activities, plenty
of discussion on margins and SG&A, and recent stock repurchases activities. Okay, so our first – fourth quarter results,
sales again for the fourth quarter, the 16 weeks ended August 30, were $35 billion, up 1% from last year's $34.8 billion.
On a reported basis, again, comps were down minus 1%. For the quarter, this minus 1% reporting comp figure was a
combination of an average transaction decrease of about 4.5% for the quarter and, again, this included the detriment
from FX of a little over 4% and gasoline price deflation of a little over 2.5% impact. So as you can see, excluding these
negative factors, comps overall were up 6% in the trend – the transaction, actually, on a – ex-gas and FX would have
been slightly positive. And an average frequency increase of just under 4%, about 3.75%.
In terms of sales by geographic region, most U.S. regions registered low single-digit comp increases, again, that – these
numbers include the impact of gas deflation of a little over 3% in the U.S., with the Midwest Texas and California
being the strongest. Internationally, in local currencies, the strongest results were Australia, Mexico, Taiwan and Spain,
recognizing Spain only has one new unit – one unit.

In terms of comp sales by merchandise categories for the quarter, for food and sundries, comps were mostly flat for the
quarter. Again, all these item – all these figures include about a 4% detriment from FX. The better performing
departments were deli, sundries and candy. Within hardlines, in the low single-digit range, better performing
departments were sporting goods, hardware and automotive. Consumer electronics were negative low single-digit year
over year, positive low single-digit ex-FX. For softlines, comps were in the low single-digit range. Better performing
departments included home furnishings and domestics. And within fresh foods, comps were in the low single-digit
range as well, with the best results in deli, produce and meat.
Moving on down the income statement to membership fees, on a reported basis, membership fees came in at $785
million or 2.24% of sales. That's up $17 million or 2% dollars, and up three basis points. Again, FX has a big impact on
these dollar figures. On – assuming flat year-over-year FX, the 2% dollar increase would have been up 6%. In terms of
membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada, and 88% worldwide. And a
strong – also, we're enjoying strong signups, both new and existing warehouses, and continue to strengthen our
Executive Member program.
In terms of members at fiscal year-end, we had 34.0 million Gold Star members, up from the most recent quarter of
33.2 million; Primary Business, 7.1 million, up from 7.0 million. We continue to have Business add-on members of 3.5
million. So all told, member households, 44.6 million at fiscal year-end, which is up from 43.7 million 16 weeks
earlier. Including additional cards, total card holders out there stood at 81.3 million at fiscal year-end, up from 79.6
million a fiscal quarter ago. At fiscal year-end, Executive memberships were 16.1 million, which was an increase of
about 400,000 members since Q3 end, so about 25,000 a week increase in the quarter. In terms of membership renewal
rates, as I mentioned, they continue strong. Total came in at – rounds up to a 91% for U.S. and Canada, and total
worldwide rounds up to an 88%.
Getting back to the income statement, our gross margin in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was higher year over
year by 44 basis points, coming in at 11.14% this year versus the year-ago fourth quarter at 10.70%. Without the impact
of gas price deflation, that increase would be up 15 basis points.
Now I ask you to jot down just two columns of numbers looking just at the fourth quarter here. Both column one would
be reported basis. Column two would be without gas deflation. The first line item would be core merchandise, on a
reported basis year over year up 17 basis points, ex-gas deflation down eight basis points; ancillary businesses, reported
plus 25 basis points, without gas plus 18 basis points. The 2% reward increase in sales penetration related to Executive
Member sales of the 2% reward, minus five basis points reported and minus two basis points ex-gas. LIFO, plus seven
basis points and a plus seven basis points. And total reported basis, as I mentioned, plus 44 basis points, and ex-gas
plus 15 basis points.
Now reviewing these figures, again, the core merchandise component was up 17 basis points but minus eight basis
points without gas, primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our gasoline and several
other ancillary warehouse businesses.
The core merchandise gross margin, which I define as the main four departments, merchandise departments, food and
sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were actually up 13 basis points year
over year. Food and sundries, hardlines, and softlines were up year over year, while fresh foods was a little lower.
Ancillary and other business gross margins were up, as I mentioned in the chart there, up 25 basis points, plus 18 basis
points without gas. We enjoyed broad-based strength across most of our ancillary businesses, with year-over-year gross
margin improvements in gas, optical and hearing aids, as well as solid operating results in e-commerce, business
centers, travel, and Executive Member services.
In LIFO, in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, year over year was a four basis point benefit or $14 million compared to
a three basis point detriment a year ago of $11 million. Our year-end inventory shrink results were in line with our
all-time best results, and our inventory positions are in great shape. All in all, gross margins and inventories are in good
shape.

Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentages year over year in the fourth quarter were higher or worse by 27 basis
points, coming in right at 10.00% of sales this year compared to 9.73% last year; again, taking out gas deflation,
essentially flat year over year, higher or worse by one basis point.
Again, I'll ask you to jot down the two columns, Q4 reported and Q4 ex-gas. Deflation in terms of operations, reported
minus 15 basis points or higher by 15 basis points, without gas deflation plus eight basis points or lower or better by
eight basis points; Central, minus seven basis points and minus five basis points; stock compensation, minus five basis
points and minus four basis points. All told, we came in on a reported basis higher by 27 basis points on SG&A; and
again, ex-gas deflation minus one basis point.
In looking at these figures, the operations component of SG&A was higher again or worse by 15 basis points; and
again, excluding gas, lower or better by eight basis points. Within operations, ex-gas deflation, core warehouse payroll
and other operating expenses were better by 10 basis points, half of which was improvement in payroll percent. Central
expense was higher or worse by seven basis points year over year, five basis points without gas, with nearly all of that
variance coming from our IT modernization efforts, six basis points and five basis points respectively with and without
gas deflation. Lastly, stock compensation expense represented again a minus five basis points, minus four basis points
without gas. Just we have over 4,000 people in our plan and that's done well as a compensation tool.
Next on the income statement is preopening, higher by $12 million, coming in at $27 million this year versus $15
million a year ago. Last year in the fourth quarter we had 10 openings. This year we had 13 openings. Of the $12
million year-over-year incremental expense, which is about $0.02 a share, a little under half of it is due to incremental
units, 13 openings versus 10 openings. The rest, about $7 million of variance is simply increase in preopening expense
associated with upcoming openings in the first several months of our new fiscal year versus the similar period of a year
earlier.
All told, reported operating income in the quarter increased $65 million or 6% year over year to $1.156 billion this
year.
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year over year, coming in at $40 million this
year, up from $35 million a year ago. This is mostly due to the interest expense on the $1 billion debt offering that was
completed earlier this calendar year to fund a portion of the special dividend.
Interest income and other was higher or better year over year by $10 million, coming in at $40 million this year in the
fourth quarter versus $30 million a year ago. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $12 million compared to
$17 million a year ago, so actually lower by $5 million. The other component of interest income and other was higher
or better by $15 million, primarily related to various FX-related items, a lot with the foreign countries where they're
locking in some of their FX needs.
Overall pre-tax income was up 6% or $70 million this year versus last year.
In terms of our tax rate, our company tax rate for the quarter came in lower than last year at 32.7% this year versus
35.1% last year in the quarter. Again, we benefited from several discrete items in Q4, as I explained – discussed earlier
in the call, such that overall net income was up 10% or $70 million, coming in at $767 million this year in the fourth
quarter versus last year's fourth quarter net earnings of $697 million.
For a quick rundown of other items, while the balance sheet is included in this morning's press release, a couple of
quick balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter came in at $351 million, and for
the year $1.127 billion. Our accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis was essentially 100% –
101% both at last year and in this year fiscal year end. Ex-non-merchandise payables, mostly construction-related
would be that, both last year fourth quarter end and this year fourth quarter end came in at 89%.
In terms of inventory per warehouse, average inventory per warehouse was up $200,000 or 2% to $13 million at Q4 in
this year, up from $12.8 million. The actual number, again, assuming FX was flat year over year would have been
$535,000, or up about 4.2%. The increase pretty much spread across many departments, no real surprises there. Overall
inventories are in good shape, as I mentioned earlier.

In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter we spent $805 million. And for all of 2015, capital expenditures totaled $2.4
billion. Our estimate for fiscal 2016 CapEx is an increase from that $2.4 billion dollar level, somewhere in the high $2
billions, somewhere between $2.8 billion and $3 billion range. This year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our
plans for more openings this year versus last year, increased spending for remodeling and expanding ancillary business
operations, planned expansion of our cross-dock and distribution operations, and expenditures related to our ongoing IT
spending for our modernization efforts.
In terms of Costco Online, we're still operating Costco Online in four countries, U.S, Canada, UK, and Mexico. For the
fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3.5 billion, up a little over 20% for the year. Comp sales in
e-commerce were also up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.
In terms of expansion, I talked earlier about up to 32 units. Net of relos, we would expect 11 units in Q1, three units in
Q2, seven units in Q3 and 11 units in Q4, Q4 being a little longer fiscal period of 16 weeks versus 12 weeks in the
others. In fiscal 2015, I mentioned on a net basis we added 23 units on a base of 653 units, so about 3.5% square
footage growth. This year, assuming the 32 new units on a base of 686 units, that would be just under 5% square
footage growth.
In terms of new locations by country, assuming that 30 – 32-unit figure, about 18 units in the U.S; Canada up three
units; two units each in Japan and Australia; and one unit each in the UK, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, and France.
As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 98.7 million square feet.
In terms of common stock repurchases, buybacks, for the fourth quarter we spent $260 million on 1.836 million shares
at an average price of just under $142. On an annualized basis, that would be about $850 million as an annualized run
rate during the quarter. For the year, we spent $494 million at an average price of $142.87.
In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share, or $1.60 a share annualized. That was up
12.5% from the prior quarterly rate that was paid in the first two quarters of fiscal 2015. This year's $1.60 per share
dividend represents an annual cost to the company of about $700 million. And, as you know, back in February, we did
a special dividend of $5 per share, which was a total of a $2.2 billion special dividend paid out to our shareholders.
Lastly, and before I turn it over to Kayla for Q&A, our fiscal 2016 first quarter scheduled earnings release date for the
12-week first quarter ending on November 22 will be after market close on Tuesday, December 8, with the earnings
call the following morning on the December 9.
With that, I'll open it up for questions and turn it back to Kayla.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Grom from Sterne Agee Credit (sic) [Sterne Agee
CRT].
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Hey, good morning, Richard.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Just on the core margin performance in the quarter, I think you said it was up 13 basis points.
Could you delve into the performance by the four subcategories? I know you said that food, hardlines and softlines
were all up. I'm just curious.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: They were all up...
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Why the pressure on the fresh food side?

Page 6 of 18
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the pressure on the fresh food side is us. When you've got some inflation on some
of the commodity items like eggs or nuts, you've got a – we're not changing the price of a 16-pack of muffins or a slice
of pizza or a hot dog. So it has more to do with that and nothing really surprising there. If you look at each of those four
categories, again, overall, the gross margin, as a percent of sale, their own sales year over year in the quarter was up
13%. I think the range was in the low 20%s on the high side and the mid teens on that negative downside. So not –
pretty much similar or slightly above last year. No real big changes there.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay, good. And then when you look to next year, just kind of switching gears a little bit,
when you switch the Visa from Amex, can you shape out for us how the switch is going to work and be handled, and
what you're planning to do with the interchange savings that you're going to generate? And also, just looking back, how
you handled it in Canada and any surprises on that front?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, things in Canada, first of all, went fine. A little different in Canada because of certain
Canadian issues. The portfolio was not purchased by the new issuer so we had, essentially, have people apply for it.
That being said, they shop at Costco, they want that co-branded card and it's done just fine. You see a little bit of
change in renewal rate when that happens because of auto renewals. You've got to re-sign people up and everything,
but from a – improvement in terms of additional monies, be it for us in terms of lower merchant fees or our members in
terms of better rewards on the co-brand, that's all been as planned.
In the U.S, we're working through everything right now. The plan is for – again, the current contract ends at the end of
March next year. That could be in and around a month or two months from there. The two parties, Amex and Citi,
continue to work towards that end, and we will expect to tell you more when we can.
In terms of how it's going to be split between merchant fees and rewards, I think I've stated in the past, our philosophy
is to – when we save money on product purchases, we want to give most of it back to the consumer, to the customer.
And we're looking at all kinds of opportunities to do that, so stay tuned.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: Okay, fair enough. And just a last question, August comps were obviously pretty good. Just
wondering with September almost closed here, any surprises on September sales for you guys?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If I could tell you, I would. We'll wait until next week.
<Q - Charles P. Grom>: All right, fair enough. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks, good morning, Richard, quick question. I think you telegraphed this on the sales
side Labor Day. Realizing it was in September both years, but this year, the quarter may not have caused, I guess, the
lead up to it. I don't know if that's a big deal from a sales or earnings perspective. Just quickly on that.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: More of just a sales perspective given you're talking mid-single, low single-digit numbers
normalized and reported. We basically, in August, it was – we feel a negative impact of about one percentage point,
and there will be a corresponding improvement in September reported for the same reason because of the – but four
weeks versus five weeks, so it's a little less of a positive, maybe seven-tenths or eight-tenths of a percent if our crystal
ball is correct. So, yes, the August numbers were impacted negatively a little, the September number will show a little
positive in that, and we'll point that out in the release.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then the second question on membership fees and the potential increases, just
a question on the thought process. And I think in the past, largely, you've done them to cover inflation. I'm sure there's
been inflation over the past five years in many areas, so can you talk about considerations and how you think about it?
Are you surveying? Are you probing customers ahead of time to understand what's tolerable, and then keep taking into
account that the landscape is evolving a little, you have some nontraditional online models and membership models. So
how do you think about the right range to raise that?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think we've done six $5 increases over roughly 30 years, generally about every five or so
years. We don't do a lot of polling, we look at it internally if – of have we improved the value of that membership to
our member? In terms of the tolerability of it to the member, I know our historical $5, and in the case of the Executive
Member last time, five years ago, a $10 increase, is a hell of a lot less than we see in other types of fees out there, be it
fees for your television or your phones or other services out there. So I personally don't think that's going to ever be an
issue. When is – well, we really haven't talked about it a lot. It's something that we'll probably do at some point, but
stay tuned.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Good morning, Richard. I wanted to just to discuss assortment and fulfillment online.
Certainly, across the industry, there's been a lot of competition and investments being made in fulfillment, whether it's
Amazon or Jet.com or some of the newer initiatives from Sam's Club. Could you just discuss some of your recent
online sales trends and any updates that you could provide for us on upcoming enhancements around assortment or
fulfillment online?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think there's – I mean, in terms of – there are a few things I had mentioned over the
last few quarters on a topical basis. We certainly expanded, to some extent, the SKU selection and added what I'd call
more frequent – for frequently purchased items, be it food and sundries or a few office needs, everything from, again,
sundry items to health and beauty aids, K-Cups, a few apparel items. And so we've expanded that. We took certain key
departments and brought them in line, so we're not competing with each other and providing, I think, a little more
excitement to that.
We ship out at more than one depot. When we first started this for the first several years in the U.S., we think we
shipped out of one depot in Southern California, which meant that it might take a little longer to get to you and it cost
us a little more in terms of delivery or the member. And as we've expanded, we've improved that quite a bit as well –
quite a bit for us. And we're pleased with the fact that sales for the last, gosh, the last two years or three years at least
have been, on a year-over-year comp basis, around 20%. So we're doing it methodically. We're not going to go crazy
out there.
I think our mobile apps have improved and will continue to improve, and we like the value proposition we have. We
are recognizing that we can't be everything to everybody. That's not what we do for a living, but we have great value.
We also like the fact that some of these other services are buying from us. Some of our top customers are some of those
guys. So if we can deliver that single unit of milk or cereal to your doorstep, so what that is, maybe you want to buy
from us.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Got it, that's helpful. And you spoke about the impact to margins from an IT modernization
standpoint. Could you just give us a little bit more detail about what some of the latest focus points have been in terms
of system upgrades and what we should be looking forward to you all tackling over the fiscal 2016 period?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, going back, again, 3-ish years ago, we embarked on a pretty significant effort to
really upgrade and modernize all our systems. Our systems were, for the most, part legacy systems, many of them
written in-house. Many of them what I'll say were Band-Aided over the years and worked fine, but were arguably
strained. Some of the systems that were included in there that were not legacy were from outside suppliers that were
not going to be supported going forward or had not been supported. And so we probably started a little later than we
should have a few years ago, and we have a lot going on as I've indicated over the last – each quarter, frankly.
What we try to do is just show you really what the expense associated with those incremental efforts are. We've
installed a new membership system a little under a year ago, I think. We installed a new point of sales system, which is

another deliverable, if you will. There's a lot of small deliverables that I won't go into. We've got several more over the
– that are heavy into the expense side and should be forthcoming over the next year to two years.
The other thing I mentioned in terms of when – I talked where we are on SG&A. On an incremental basis over the last
few years, I think we're now up to something in the low teens, 12 basis points, 13 basis points. Those two basis points,
three basis points, and five basis points that have added each year. And recognizing your denominator, your sales, S&P
expense over sales, sales keep increasing. We're seeing all the costs associated with it. I think we'll start to see benefits
when we look out beyond 2016. It doesn't mean that this SG&A will remain – will not go up a fewer basis points, we'll
see. But there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes it's long. Some days it's a longer tunnel than others, but we're
starting to see some deliverables from it. So there's not a lot I can tell you about where the benefits are.
There are clearly some benefits that we're going to see on the transportation side and some of the ancillary businesses
like travel and other things. But the big switchover will be when buyers are buying on a new system a year or so down
the road, as well as the benefits in transportation and other. But we don't want to put any dollars or basis points on those
improvements. We had to do this if we want to double our size over a 10 or so year period starting a couple years ago
with the expenses because we had a lot of systems that were really strained. And this is going to set us up for the years
to come.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Much appreciated. Good luck.

Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. Regarding a bigger picture question, and I was curious
about your thoughts on what really sets you apart from other Internet pure plays in terms of your supply chain and
vertical integration, and kind of this buying scale and scale you have there. And then also, international is a nice piece
of the business. Just as we look at our models and talk to as part of the story, which countries do you have the most
opportunity to increase your store base versus maximum potential? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. In terms of e-commerce, I mean, first, we're different because we – yeah, for us, we
have a lot more items. We have 8,000 items or 10,000 items or so instead of 3,700 items in-store. That's a nit compared
to everybody else out there that has hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of items. I think what separates us is we've
got – certainly, we and others will have great quality merchandise. We've got the best pricing overall. We work on
margins that are at or slightly below our reported total company margins, but up there, high singles, very low double
digits. We'll compare that to anybody out there.
Again, we recognize we're not going to be selling single items delivered within an hour or four hours or overnight
necessarily. But in a methodical way, we think we're doing just fine and we think we'll have additional opportunities.
And as I mentioned earlier, we're selling to a lot of these other guys that are wanting to deliver in certain unique ways.
There's room for all of us. We've got to keep – it's a big pie out there in terms of market share. And we think that we'll
be able to take our share of that. Some little sub-departments, you lose a little, others you make a little. Certainly, we
want people to still come into our warehouses.
In terms of opportunities outside of – in terms of warehouse club growth opportunities, I think the first comment, for
those of you on the call who have known us for a long time, the market potential keeps improving. I don't think we ever
would have thought – when we had 60 or so locations in Canada, we never thought we'd have more than 80 locations.
We now have more than that, and we'll certainly be over 100 locations at some point in the next several years. In the
U.S. we're expanding. If you'd asked me five years ago when we were at 80 locations U.S., 20 locations international,
I'd say five years hence or now, it's probably 50:50 and going further south in terms of the percentage of openings in
the U.S. We keep finding more opportunities here, so that's good news.
In terms of other countries, we think we've certainly got a lot of potential in the three countries in Asia we're currently
at. A bigger market, of course, is Japan, much bigger than Korea and Taiwan, but we think we could go from the low

teens in each of Taiwan and Japan – each of Taiwan and Korea, double over the next 10 years, but we'll see. It's one at
a time.
Australia, we only have seven units in a – seven, yes, in a country that's what, two-thirds or a little more of that of the
population of Canada, which has 80 units or 90 units. And I'm not suggesting we're going to have two-thirds of that
anytime soon, but we certainly can add a few there.
Western Europe, we'll see. It's been tough getting in with all the rules, regulations, and permitting process, but we're
pretty interested in continuing that process. Again, we'll open our second unit in Spain next month in Madrid in Getafe,
a second unit in the Madrid area next calendar year, and hopefully our first in France towards the end of the next fiscal
year. So we think there are plenty of opportunities.
I think we feel comfortable that over the next five years, we'll continue to open 30-ish plus units a year. I know we
thought we would do that this year that just ended, but certainly in the high 20s units. A few of those got delayed and
that's life, but we've got a pipeline that's full. The international generally takes a lot longer for a variety of reasons by
country. So we think that we'll continue to grow and do just fine in terms of that.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay, and, Richard, just a quick follow-up. There has been talk in terms of competitors in relation
to how competitors are dealing with vendors. Could you just update us on your thoughts on your vendor relationships
and any catalysts there, given your buying scale and your leverage and your heritage? I was just curious on your
thoughts. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd like to think that the comment that we shared internally and we talked to you guys
about is that we're tough but fair. We are tough. We fight for our member every day, and I'd like to think that we do
that as much, if not more than anybody else. The good news about us in terms of our view of our competitiveness is we
give the vast majority of any improvement back to the member. And that in our view creates that moat that hopefully
continues to get bigger.
One of the challenges and opportunities we have is just the sheer size of our needs of various commodities, organics,
nuts, long staple cotton, you name it. And so we've got a lot of efforts in that area that I think that many of our
competitors don't necessarily go to that level because they're dealing with vendors and lots of more items. And so I
think we have some opportunities and challenges, but opportunities and challenges that I think create something special
about us.
I don't think anything has changed. As we get bigger, we can be tougher but still fair. And we work with our vendors.
We think we have good relationships with them. I would assume that most of them would agree; probably a few don't.
But we'll continue to be very transparent in how we deal with our vendors, and we have very good relationships with
many, many of them.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Best regards, thank you.

Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Hi, good morning. It's Dan Binder. My question had to do with ancillary margins. The
last five quarters, you've had three quarters where ancillary margins were up about 15 basis points ex-gas deflation, and
then two quarters where they were up substantially more than that. It happened to coincide with the decline in gas
prices. And what I'm trying to understand is how much of that gross margin improvement in ancillary is sustainable
versus just being a function of the way gas was fluctuating during the quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Gas for I think most of the last five fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis has helped a
lot. But the other ancillary businesses continue to grow. Whether it's optical or hearing aid or some of the other
warehouse club businesses, all those things add up; travel, you name it. So I think – I hope it's sustainable. Other than
clearly gas, we have no illusion that at some point in life, gas prices will go up and our margin will be more normal

relative to our history. Right now it's good for our member in terms of low gas prices and good for us in terms of albeit
lower top line sales, it's been more profitable on a year-over-year basis.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Okay. And then the other item I wanted to talk about was other income, which I realize
is a function of these FX contracts you talked about earlier on the call, always a challenge to model. I'm just curious if
FX rates were to stay roughly where they are today, how do you think that line item would look in Q1?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know. All I can tell you is that we look at it that way too. We manage it in the sense
that if you've got a foreign country where some of their inventory purchases are paid for in dollars or euros sometimes,
but I'll use dollars as the bigger example, once they're comfortable with a price point that they're going to be able to
convert at that level and sell goods in their local currency in their local country, they're going to choose to figure out
how much of that they want to lock in, recognizing locking in just means that they're comfortable with that price. If the
local currency continues to weaken, that was good. If local currency then strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar,
shouldn't have done as much. But we don't try to be completely right either way.
So I think over the years, in the last four or five years, that's a number that has probably ranged from plus or minus $15
million pre-tax, usually a little less than the number that we had this period where it was up about $15 million or so.
But I'd say it's – we just want to point it out because it's a component of the income statement. It's very hard to predict.
I think by doing it the way we do it, we're not going to ever have any giant surprise either way because of some drastic
change in FX prices.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: And then the last item, the share repurchase picked up a bit this quarter. How are you
thinking about it for this coming year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We'll tell you at each quarter end. It's part of what we do with our cash. As long as we feel
good about our future, we're not going to ever be – we're going to buy on a regular basis, not try to pick the market. I
think the fact that we bought a little more this quarter is the stocks have come down a little bit, but as I've said in the
past, we buy a little more when it goes down. I certainly feel comfortable about our future prospects as a company. So
don't expect giant changes in how we've done it in the past. Certainly, we trended each quarter this year on an
annualized basis upward, and we're certainly comfortable at the current level.
<Q - Daniel Thomas Binder>: Great, thanks.

Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: So, Richard, if you look at the three categories or the three broad departments, we
saw some margin improvement. So two things, was there any common themes there in terms of maybe COGS doing a
better job on your cost or KS mix? So any commonality there? And have we kind of reached a point here, because I
assume the KS mix will continue to get better and how you buy that will continue to get better, where there should be
an upward drift in growth just secularly because the elasticity of what you would choose to invest in kind of doesn't
merit, right, putting all of that back into the market price-wise?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't – I'd like to think that we were that smart. Overall, I mean, we try to improve
margins a little while lowering prices, and I mean that sincerely. And we're going to give most of it back to the
customer and to our member. As you know, we're pretty stubborn and intent on maintaining, in a rising commodity
standpoint, prices on certain fresh foods, so we've seen some impact there to the negative. I think you're right, though,
as we continue to improve – increase penetration of KS, that helps a little. Certainly, as we've had relative strength in
the departments over the last couple of years like softlines and domestics and housewares and some of those items, we
can improve that a little bit. And that's, of course, outside of the ancillary and other businesses, which, in some cases,
work on higher margins as a starting point, be it pharmacy or hearing aid center or optometry or whatever else.

So – but the – organics helps in a small way, I've mentioned it in the past; not only organics relative to their substitute,
the non-organics, same products. Organics sell at a higher price point, but our view is that others, while it may be
competitive, we actually can be – we show a more competitive framework and a little bit higher margin than on the
underlying non-organic items. So it's really, in our view, a win-win for us, the challenge being getting more organic.
And that's not a challenge -that's a challenge for us, of course; it's a challenge for everybody out there.
So all those things help. I don't think we started the fiscal quarter and said, let's see how we get an extra 10 basis points
or 15 basis points or 20 basis points higher in our year over year. But we're always trying to improve a little as we
know we have challenges elsewhere.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: And do you think – I've noticed this particularly, I think, more in softlines, but do
you think that the quality of KS, it seems to continue to get better maybe at a faster pace even than it has in the recent
past. Do you think that's fair that the quality's getting better, that's the investment, not price point so much?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think two things. On the softlines side, like apparel and everything, over the last few
years we've made a bigger effort in that area. We took what sometimes would be a retail branded item at $200 or $300
for a pair of slacks that we're at $49.99. But when you go out and buy the same fabric and make, hopefully, a very good
quality item, and commit to 0.5 million or 1 million units or something, that helps. So we're always pushing the quality
and the quantity and buying power of that. And that quality value relationship continues to, I think, improve.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay. And then just lastly, I don't think you guys have done a whole lot of data
mining with your membership base. Do you see that? Does IT modernization allow you to do that? And then I'm
wondering, when you think about sales – sort of comp sales by comparable member, I'm just curious when you look
going forward, do you guys see a bigger opportunity to get – and I'm not saying the most loyal members, maybe
somebody a little bit below the top – to come in more frequently and that's a fresh food driver, or more of an
opportunity to get product and more items in the basket per trip when you think about sustainability of comps by
somebody who's been a member for whatever, three, five, six years? Where do you see the bigger opportunity?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First and foremost, we've gone from doing virtually nothing to being a little more
open-minded about it. I think there's a lot of low hanging fruit that we haven't done. Certainly, there's more efforts in
these areas in our membership marketing team on dot-com a little bit, but we don't do a lot with it. But we're doing a
little more than we used to. We must get a call – I must get a call a week from some analytics company that wants to
film stuff, to do AB testing, is the ketchup left or right of the mustard. We've done, I think, a better job on our
multi-vendor mailer in terms of that. But I think we have more opportunities that we haven't even touched the surface
on. But I'm not suggesting that's going to be tomorrow afternoon. Marketing has definitely been told to try some new
things. And we have and they generally work. I view that more as something, if things start to slow a little bit, we have
some opportunities there. But we're, first and foremost, focused on just constantly driving quality and value on the
products and services we sell. And that's – we seem to have not figured out where the bottom of that is.
<Q - John Edward Heinbockel>: Okay, thank you.

quantified the impact on the gas profit. I think you said it benefited by a penny. I was wondering if you could give us
that same metric this quarter. And the second question I have is I think with some of the remodels that are going on,
can you just talk a little bit about category focus in the remodels and your expectation on what the returns and the comp
uplifts we might see?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think last quarter, there was not a big impact. It was a wash year over year. It's more than
a few cents, but not a heck of a lot. Now we really don't talk about it other than directionally, which way it's helped us.
Certainly, I think at least four fiscal quarters of the last five fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis, it's been up, more
outsized than normal up. And the second question?
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Remodels. Like trends in remodels, what would be the expectation that you see? Category
focuses and how that might impact comps or sales as we sort of go through this?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. And keep in mind, remodels, I think when traditional retail stores remodel, they're
doing a whole new front, new flooring and new lighting fixtures. I mean, a lot of our – our remodels are everything.
And we spend a lot of money on increasing refrigeration and frozen in the fresh foods area. As somebody mentioned
earlier, that continues to be a driver of our business. It's certainly something we're pretty good at. We constantly try to
figure out what locations that we don't have where we could put gas stations, although we're saturating that. There's
certain existing locations that are never going to have a gas station, but we still have a few left there. And we, of
course, have added some gas stations in a few other countries beyond just the U.S. and Canada.
So there's little things like that. There's typically half a dozen or so units a year where we're breaking out a wall, buying
some extra land, perhaps, adding 10,000 feet or 20,000 feet where it makes sense. And many times, it makes sense
economically when there's some government incentives on solar. That's small dollar-wise, but I'm just coming out with
some examples. So remodeling for us is just constantly – sometimes improving and updating something, but a lot of
times just adding some more stuff. More lineal feet or refrigeration is something that comes to mind in a bigger way
over the last few years.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: And then just one question on the ancillary businesses. Can you just talk a little bit about what's
happening in the photo business and trends in the quarter, and sort of what the expectations are there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, you probably have – are processing less photos than you used to. It's actually about
– the business itself, profitability-wise, is about flat year over year. Actual photos processed is down. We've enhanced
the business on a few other things with everything from canvas pictures to photo books to ink refill cartridges, toner
cartridges. But it's not a business that's going to come back tomorrow either. Of all the ancillary businesses, that's the
one that's – it's big, it's profitable. It's not as profitable as it used to be, and we'll continue to look at that space and see
what we want to do. But we still have it, and we still try to figure out how to improve it.

Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Hey, Richard, this is Meredith Adler. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about
what happened with the store openings this year, which I think missed your expectations. I know some slipped into
next year, but were there any common themes in that? And when you look out, because you've got a nice number of
openings for next year, do you think that there's any risk based on what happened in fiscal 2015?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure, there are going to always be risks. I think prior to fiscal 2015, for the few years
leading up to that, we actually got better attractive, getting closer to what we think is going to actually open. We put –
this is our original budget. Everything that – if – everything generally goes right and it's been green inked, if you will,
it's been approved internally, based on whatever permits and zoning issues and whatever, all the issues are out there, we
think we have a decent chance of opening it, we're going to put it in there, recognizing inevitably, there's always five or
eight of those units that are budgeted for months 11 and 12, if not a few more, that fiscal year. Maybe 10 units a year in
that last month or two months. And inevitably, a few of those fall out. I think that we'll get closer than we did this year
relative to our budget. Generally speaking, it's not because we decided not to do a unit that we weren't going to do it.
The only time that happens – or virtually every time that happens it's because something a big surprise. Doing
additional drilling, we found something on the sites that was a bigger issue. And that, by the way, is generally not our

Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you give us a little more detail
on the traffic trends, not only in this quarter, but over the last maybe few years? Are you seeing more of the growth
come from the middle tier of the membership base? Presumably, the most frequent members are tapped out, they can
no long – they cannot grow the number of times they're going to Costco. So, is it more still coming from the mid tier of
the membership population or is it more like the least attached members are getting a little bit more attached?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Maybe people who are in membership and operations know a little more than I do here. I –
and maybe there's some more opportunity – yeah, overall, over time, shops go up, as people are making more each
year, as they're having family, whatever those issues are. And so certainly, an older member, in terms of how long
they've been a member, that increases over time. But it's a lot of things. It's the merchandising, it's the frequency,
drivers like fresh foods and gas. It's that incremental shop because somebody all of a sudden needs a maintenance
prescription. They've gotten to the age where they're going to come in one extra time a year because of their timing of
their need for a cholesterol-reducing drug or whatever. So, it's a lot of little things plus a few of those things, notable
things like fresh foods and gas.
It's also Executive Membership. It's also the co-branded card and rewards. It really is all of the above. I don't – there's
different reasons. Clearly, when we have new members, whether it was new millennial members or 20 years ago new
gen, whatever, members, they buy less when they start, they buy more over time. I can't tell you what millennials are
going to do relative to their predecessor age groups overall, not just at Costco, but overall buying. If they have smaller
houses and they drive a little less, and they buy fewer sofas, that is not good for anybody. But, at the end of the day, we
think we're getting our share.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Okay. And my follow-up question is how have you noticed or how have you observed
your membership population respond to different types of promotions? And when I say promotions, I'm talking about
price investments, rewards through your card, maybe new merchandise offers. Can you give us what's been most – a
sense of what's been most impactful and how the response has been? Has it been to drive up basket? Has it been to
allow you to sign up more members? Thank you so much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, we're not going to share all the specifics. But at the end of the day, it's a little
bit of all of the above. We work every day to try to improve the value proposition to the member. We work every day
to try to upsize an item where it makes sense because we do want more things and more dollars in that basket. Maybe
something like the multi-vendor mailer with the couponing; that grew dramatically from what was originally a six or
eight-week summer item, summer couponing booklet to 11 or so times a year for three-plus weeks each. And over time,
we and our vendors figure out what works best and what starts to slow down. So those things keep getting tweaked.
So again, we focus on trying to improve the value. If we could sell you a bigger pack size at a greater value, we're
going to do that. And I think that's a catch, too. We don't just want to increase the size of something 50% and sell it at

the same price per ounce or price per number of units. We only want to raise it – for the most part, we try to raise it the
quantity when we can lower the price per unit to the member. And that serves us well and serves them well. So that's
our religion.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Sure. I'm thinking more about the card. Does that have as much influence in a member's
purchase decision or frequency as pricing or coupons, for example?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know if one has more than the other. We know that the Executive Members shop a
lot – take a group of 100,000 members that are similar in terms of shopping patterns and age groups and tenure as a
member. And both of those groups are growing at roughly the same rate each year. Get half of them to convert to
Executive Member and you see a dramatic change in their buying habits, but that's no change that we've seen over the
years. I think what surprises me personally is the continued penetration of that area. And maybe we've gotten a little
better in-store of doing that.
Clearly, loyalty programs work, whether it's our Executive Member program or our reward-based co-branded credit
card. One of the things that's long-term exciting for us is we feel that we can continue, even on our co-brand card,
continue to improve the value proposition to our member, which hopefully gets them in here more often. But that's
what we do every day.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Sure. All right, good luck with the upcoming year. Thank you so much.

Our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, Richard, thanks for taking the question, a couple here. First of all, just can you talk
about the new member signup trends in the fourth quarter? I didn't hear. If you did mention that, I apologize. I know
they were down slightly in the third quarter.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: They're actually up in the fourth quarter year over year, a combination of decent member
signups at existing warehouses, probably a few more international units in the quarter, on a comparable year-over-year
basis in the quarter. I think we're up a little over 2 million members in the quarter from a year ago in terms of new
signups.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, great. And then you mentioned when you gave the regional color and you said that
Texas was good. Can you talk about maybe trends in some of the specific energy markets, thinking like Houston,
maybe somewhere up in Alberta? Have you seen any moderation in traffic or ticket or what have you?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I just don't have that amount of granularity in front of me.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. And then the thought process behind repatriated cash from Canada, why now? And
then you've got a $1.2 billion note that comes due in December. Are your thoughts here to refinance that or pay it off?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: At this point we'll probably pay it off. Part of the repatriation is Canada is a very profitable
country, so we've built up cash balances. At some point, we determine – on an ongoing basis, we will determine
whether we feel it needs to be permanently invested up there or not, and at such time we'll make that decision. I think
we've done that twice. About a year ago we brought back a little over $1 billion. And in this case, it was a small
favorable from a tax perspective. A year ago, I think it was the third quarter or fourth quarter a year ago, it was slightly
unfavorable, but again, we determined – but small. We determined it was the right time to bring it back from a
reinvestment standpoint.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, fair enough. And then last question is just on CapEx, on the $2.8 billion to $3 billion
this year. It's almost double what you did maybe a few years ago. I understand you've got some of the investments

you're doing, the higher store growth. Is that a level that you think is one that we should assume holds for several years,
assuming you can open 30-plus stores per year? Or are some of the investments you're doing in IT and systems and
distribution, do those taper off a bit maybe in the out years? Just how are you thinking about that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I hope IT tapers off a little, but that's not the biggest piece of it. I'm certainly comfortable
saying it's going to be in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. Is the $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion this year likely to be $100
million or $200 million higher in the following year? Maybe, I don't see the $2.8 billion to $3 billion going to $3.5
billion next year. So yes, something in the high $2 billions is probably a good guesstimate for the next few years.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I actually had some follow-ups from some of the
questions that have already been asked, but I wanted to get some clarity. So I think Michael Lasser was asking about
the Visa card. And I guess real specifically, do you anticipate that card will actually drive membership growth,
Richard?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: When we get there, we'll let you know.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay, okay. And then following up a little bit on John Heinbockel and it's the technology.
When you're looking at your Executive Members, do you guys have clarity to the data? How many – are these
Executive Members using our ancillary services? What are they using, and kind of what the penetration rates are?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, absolutely, but we're not going to share what those are. Each ancillary business is a
little different. Some of them take a decade to really get some good footing. But they're all great values and yet another
reason why somebody wants to be a member, and we'll keep improving those values. So whether it's KS or organic or
commodities or these items, these are all things that I think that gives us a good competitive position.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And do you think there's an opportunity to drive additional ancillary business growth with
your core members?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Absolutely.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: [indiscernible] (1:05:21)
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Absolutely.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay, then the...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I would recommend that you try Costco Travel. You'll be amazed.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: I'm looking right now at a Costco car-buying program, so I hear that's wonderful as well.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That as well, I think we're approaching 0.5 million new cars a year on that. And there's a
reason we use our buying power, to get our members great savings on cars.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: And when you think about getting a little bit more involved in technology and the
relationship with your customers, is this an area that you would think could be a lever that could be thrown?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry, say that again?
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: When you're looking at data mining, knowing your customers a little bit better, marketing a
little bit more aggressively, I think you mentioned at the beginning, is this an area that would get a focus, do you think?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: At some point, we kind of – a little self-deprecating when we talk about that. At the end of
the day, there's a lot of opportunities to do a lot of that stuff. We kind of look at the 80:20 rule. We're doing a little of it,
which we're getting some benefits. There will be plenty of opportunities to do some of that in the future. But we – our
main focus is on driving value and a lot of those other things take care of themselves. And certainly, Craig Gelnick,
who's our CEO, has told people in e-commerce, people in membership marketing, try some things, and they're trying
some things. And we'll keep going in that direction.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Perfect. And I had just one last kind of follow-up, this is when Bob was talking about the
remodels. I'm just trying to understand, our local Costco is under remodel in the fresh department. And then if you look
at 2016 and 2017, is that the focus of the remodels? Are you expecting to do more of them? And is it focused on fresh?
It seemed like that's where the focus was. I just wanted to get clarity, and is it going up year over year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think, as a general rule, it has been going up, but it's up. It's a big number. And I don't
know if it keeps going up from there. I know the one across the street here, we again added 10,000 feet or 15,000 feet.
We expanded greatly, the walk-in coolers for customers in Produce and Dairy. When you're doing, in some of these
units, $200 million, $250 million, $300 million, you can drive some true incremental good sales by not only expanding
the – everything in terms of the traffic patterns, and the ingress and egress in and outside of the warehouse, but adding
some of these things like refrigeration, fresh foods, and it will still be – and continue to be a big number.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. So, you're doing more fresh remodels, fresh drives traffic. Is the focus in that fresh
area on organics or just general? Or is it weighted towards organics, do you know?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think in terms of CapEx-related, it's everything. Our organics is just a piece of that.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right, perfect. Thank you so much. I really enjoyed the answers, thanks.

Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Hi, thanks. You've gone over an hour, and I still have a couple of questions. So, wanted to
follow up on gas. What was the average gas price in the quarter versus last? And if you could give us the gallons as
well, that would be great.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The average price in Q4 was $3.65 a year ago and $2.88 this current fourth quarter, so
down 21.2%.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Great. And if that's the case, I guess, going back to gas profitability, I understand it's been a
tailwind, I guess it's that incremental drop, even from last quarter, that's really allowed the profitability to boost up
again. Is that – are we thinking about that right?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Actually, the price was – from a quarter ago, the price was up about $0.20 a gallon. But it's
– I think there's a little bit of a new normal. It's not just how it is year over year. It's when it's low, it's better from a
profitability standpoint and as relative to competition. I mean, GasBuddy has continued to say that we're the lowest
priced out there nationally. And I think we're still pretty – going to be very competitive. And we get a lot of good kudos
for that.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: So basically, you can keep your competitive advantage, but the penny profit might be better
than it used to be because the way the market...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think when prices are low, we make more than we used to on average per gallon or per
gas station, and that's good.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Great. And then the second question was going back to membership fee income, I think you
said it was 6% if you exclude FX.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: I believe that's 100 bips or maybe 200 bips below the trend the last year or two years. Is that
just fewer openings last year? Or, I think, last quarter, you mentioned signups per club was actually negative, but it was
a comparison issue. Just help us understand...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think overall, it's just fine. There's a little bit in Canada of the auto renewal issue when we
switched over. And we'll see that, again, the year hence over the next year, starting next year. That's a small piece of it.
I don't think beyond that, there's a whole lot there in that regard. There's always going to be the timing because when
membership fee dollar increases are – we use deferred accounting for it. And so that makes it a little more squishy
number. But overall, the number was in line with what we felt was pretty good.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: And with the auto renewals, if I can sneak a third one in, if I remember correctly, AmEx
was roughly 40% of the tender in the stores. So to think of the magnitude that they have in Canada when you did the
changeover, what was AmEx there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: There's one big difference. In Canada, the portfolio was not purchased. While I can't
guarantee it will be purchased, the contract states that it should be, and we're working towards that, or Citi and Amex
are working towards that end. That's a different scenario in terms of auto renewal. Up there, you basically have to
re-sign people up, they have to apply for credit, they get authorized, they have to re-sign up, opt in for auto renewal. I
don't expect that to be an issue in the U.S. at this point.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Got it. And the tender is roughly the same as here, that 40%?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it was a little less, but mind you, the market share of our provider up there
historically had a lower market share there relative to Canada than they do in the U.S. They have a stronger market
share down here.
<Q - Gregory S. Melich>: Okay, got it. Great, thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Why don't we take one more question?
Operator
Our final question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Thank you so much for keeping the flame burning just for another moment. First
question relates to Spain and just curious on your learnings from your first Spain opening and how you expect your
continental European stores to differ from your other international markets based on what you saw from that first unit.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Like any first unit with maybe the exception of Australia, which was off the charts high to
start with, you learn a lot. You learn what sells and doesn't sell. I think if I recall from when we first opened in Seville a
year and a half, two years ago, we had less – we had stronger non-food than we would have expected, and not a strong
fresh food. Usually, in a new market, you have got a stronger fresh food. Just given our great success in countries like
Korea and Taiwan and Japan, we have to remind ourselves that Korea and Taiwan, they were not very good for several
years. You start off with slower sales in most countries other than Australia when you first a – when we first enter the
market. And that was consistent.
Probably the worst economy we started was in Spain. But we're seeing some traction. Membership signups are just fine
and membership renewals have been just fine. But it's – one data point does not a story make here. Madrid certainly is a
much bigger market than Seville, and we've got, again, one unit coming next month and a second one in and around
Madrid coming, I believe, next spring, certainly sometime in the middle of the calendar year. So that will be more
telling, in our view, than anything we've seen so far.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Great...

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We continue to be very confident that we've got a good model and it works. And we're
patient as well.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: A quick second question. On the online and e-commerce piece, Instacart, I know, is a
particularly prominent partnership among the ones that you've got, and it's a concept that from a – in terms of the
number of retailers you're doing business with and how long that's hung in, seems to be gaining some traction. Any
sense as to how that relationship has evolved, in particular, how the economics look for you relative to some of the
alternatives?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, again, we're not going to disclose any specifics. We have a good working
relationship with Instacart, certainly with Google Shopping Express as well. And Instacart's in more cities, and
anybody you know out there that wants to buy from us, you call us.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Fair enough. And then, finally, I think Greg – one element of Greg's question might
not have gotten answered was gallon comps. You talked a bit about the gas prices, but I remember when gas prices first
started coming under press, gallon comps surged into double digits. Are you still seeing that with the prices down here
today?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm not sure if it's double digits, but it's certainly positive.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Got it, okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And we generally haven't given that out. Sometimes in a moment of weakness, I share it
with you guys. But the comps have continued to go in the right direction in terms of gallons.
<Q - Matthew Jeremy Fassler>: Okay, thank you so much.
