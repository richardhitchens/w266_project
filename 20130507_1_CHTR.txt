MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Charter Communications First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you.
Mr. Stefan Anninger, you may begin.
Stefan Anninger
Thanks, operator. Good morning and welcome to Charter's 2013 First Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, we issued a
press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results.

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that
accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our
Investor & News Center. The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thanks, Stefan. I am pleased with our first quarter 2013 results. They demonstrate that the strategy we have
implemented over the last year is starting to have a positive impact. Our revenue growth accelerated during the first
quarter to 5% even without the benefit of last year's election year advertising revenue.
We grew residential customer relationships by 56,000 and our expanded base of video customers grew by 4,000 in the
quarter while our limited basic video product which we no longer actively market, declined by 28,000.
Triple-play sell-in as a percentage of first quarter video sales was nearly 50% for the quarter, and as of today exceeds
50%. Triple-play customers continue to connect at an average entry of ARPU of $120, a significant premium to our
$90 promotional offer. 43% of our customer base is now on our new pricing and packaging structure, meaning that our
customer base is increasingly receiving a better product with more value.
We are now more competitive in the marketplace and can sell more products to our existing customers and to their
neighbors. Our commercial segment again grew by approximately 20%. Even with all the operating changes we've
implemented and the investments we're making, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 2.8% in the quarter.
We are essentially selling and providing a different service than we were a year ago, which is reflected in our revenue
growth. Relative to last year's first quarter we saw that triple-play sell-in rate improved by over 75%. We also achieved
higher sell-in ARPU across the average package we sold, given the higher product penetration per sale. We did have
lower gross sales compared to the first quarter of last year as we continue to rebuild our direct sales force and
reorganized our inbound call center sales force in the first quarter. But generally, our sales channel performance
improved steadily through the first quarter and has continued to do so. So sales are going up and as slide three of
today's investment presentation highlights, we're offering a better product and service which is more competitive and
which we expect to continue to drive deeper penetration in existing and new homes served, increased customer
satisfaction and lower churn, a reduction in the amount of transactions with our customers, and as a result, realize a
better return on the increased amount of capital we are investing.
Moving onto our priorities in 2013; on our last quarterly call, I outlined our four key areas of focus for 2013. I believe
we are performing well in each of these areas. Here's a brief update. First, we're actively leveraging our two-way
interacted high-capacity cable plant in order to extend the advantages we have relative to our competition. We continue
to make network investments and perform deferred plant maintenance in order to deliver quality service. We also
continue in our efforts in taking our plant all-digital by the end of 2014. Going all digital allows us to offer more video
content and higher data speeds through DOCSIS 3.0.
We've started in Texas on a hub-by-hub basis offering a substantial high-definition channel increase. Our plan is
working and we'll continue to roll that out across our entire footprint this year or next.
We've also recently received our CableCARD waiver from the FCC. The waiver is important as it will further reduce
our advanced set-top box costs and enhanced the return on investment associated with our all-digital effort.
The waiver furthers our goal to end up with a network and product infrastructure that allows boxes from multiple
vendors and smart TVs to connect to our network with downloadable security software. The second launch objective in
2013 is to further develop our product and feature sets. We're making good progress on developing a cloud-based user

interface and search service that will move key product and [ph] service (06:23) functionality out of the box into the
network and available across various devices and platforms.
Third, we continue to execute on our most important objective, improved operational performance to drive deeper
penetration of our video, Internet and phone products across our 12 million passings. That starts with providing an
improved product and service to our 5 million current customers to generate more satisfaction and revenue with lower
churn. That deeper product penetration and customer satisfaction directly translates to higher success in selling
products to the roughly 7 million passings which we have in our relationship.
Finally, we'll continue to grow our Commercial Services business in the $9.5 billion telecom marketplace opportunity
within our footprint by continuing to focus our sales and product development efforts in this space. So we're executing
well on our plan, and I believe there are more good things to come for Charter.
Now I'll turn it over to Chris to give additional details on the first quarter.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. When we implemented our new product offering and operating strategies in the middle of 2012, we
provided a general sequence of how we would see success develop in the metrics. First, through the quality of PSU
growth which we quickly saw through our expanded basic video and triple-play and from the penetration growth.
Second, through residential customer ARPU and accelerating year-over-year revenue growth which started in Q4 and
continued into Q1 of this year. And ultimately, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow where we expect a meaningful
first comparison once we have a full year of the same strategy and product offering in place.
As we look at Q1 2013 results, let me highlight what we're seeing within the metrics posted in today's materials.
Starting with the customer trends on slide four, we lost 24,000 video customers in the quarter, down from a gain of
20,000 customers a year ago. If you exclude limited basic losses, we grew video customers by 4,000, and relative to the
first quarter of 2012, we no longer actively market analog service or benefit from some of the aggressive packaging in
place last year.
We added 99,000 internet customers this quarter, less than the 141,000 gain a year ago, but reflects our strategy of
taking a more bundled approach and not having a $20 single play or $30 double play offer in the market as we did for
much of the first quarter last year.
In effect, we have a higher quality of product for the nearly 100,000 Internet net adds that we added this quarter. And
as a result, we grew our phone customers by 59,000, a 28,000 customer increase versus the prior year reflecting the
higher sell-in of triple-play packages at point of sale, which as Tom mentioned, is nearly 50% of video sales in the first
quarter.
You can see the early financial impact of the strategy most clearly in residential ARPU which is now above $107
versus last year's $105, and overall revenue growth of 4.9% which was increasing through the quarter.
Another way to express this is despite significant net adds in the first quarter of last year, in Q1 2012, we only grew
residential revenue by 0.9% as compared to Q1 of 2011. In the first quarter of this year, we grew total residential
revenue by 4.1%.
So looking at the detailed revenue line items on slide five, our video revenue grew 6.8%, really driven by four factors.
The quality of subscriber acquisition through higher sell-in of extended basic versus limited basic, our sell-in rate of
expanded basic is now 99% versus 81% a year ago, and our residential video base has grown to 90% expanded. We
also have a much higher level box placement, SD, HD and DVR all of which has revenue attached.
Thirdly, promotional rate step-ups partly offset by churn and rate increases which really started in March. And finally,
a higher amount of bundled sell-in which results in allocating more revenue to video than in previous quarters.

Internet revenue grew 11% driven by the addition of 250,000 Internet customers over the last year, and phone revenues
declined 21% with the increase in phone customers more than offset by revenue allocation out of this portion of the
bundle.
Our Commercial business grew by 19.6% where we were a bit light on install revenue but continued with subscription
revenue growth above 20%, or 25% excluding video. If you look at commercial PSUs, we showed an increase of 6,000
which includes 10,000 commercial video losses in the quarter. As some of you may already know, EBU reporting
reduces total reported bulk video customers when a basic cable rate increase, like the one we implemented in the first
quarter, rolls through our customer base.
So to be clear, our commercial video billing relationships grew in the first quarter and commercial video revenue also
grew year-over-year. And total customer relationships for commercial would have grown by 8,000 excluding the EBU
reporting effect.
Advertising sales fell by 9% in the quarter driven by a decline in political and the elimination of some barter contract
revenue which was offset in OpEx. Core advertising growth excluding these impacts is slightly positive in the quarter.
As slide six shows, adjusted EBITDA rose 2.8% in the first quarter versus the prior year. We're pleased with this result
given the amount of change still taking place in the business. And as a reminder, we're realigning our organization and
restructuring field operations and migrating to more in-house versus outsourced labor. We've revised our product and
selling tactics and are redirecting various sales channels. We revamped our sales commission structure and we're
catching up on deferred plant maintenance.
So on the expense side, total operating expenses grew by 6.1% versus the prior year quarter. The key items were
programming cost, which rose $24 million in the quarter. That equates to 4.9% on an absolute basis or 5.7% per
standard basic video customer. If you include the effect of higher limited basic losses and EBU accounting for
commercial customers under our rate increase, the Q1 programming increase per total video customer was higher. We
continue to expect full year 2013 programming expense growth in the mid-to-high single digits particularly on a per
expanded basic customer basis which is our focus.
Costs to service our customers increased by $36 million or 11%, reflecting higher spending on deferred plant
maintenance and labor. This spending can have an outsized impact on reducing truck rolls, and we started to see early
returns on these investments already.
Turning to slide seven. Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $412 million, reflecting a $72 million increase
versus the first quarter of 2012. CPE expending increase by $61 million versus the prior year to support to new
customer acquisition, upgrades and the migration of existing customers to our new pricing and packaging.
Support capital increased $24 million year-over-year due to investments in our fleet, back office systems, and real
estate, and commercial CapEx totaled $62 million, up $24 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily related to
line extensions to support growth. We continue to expect our total 2013 capital investments, excluding the impact of
acquisitions, to be approximately $1.7 billion.
Before moving on to the balance sheet, I wanted to make up two below EBITDA items in this quarter's income
statement. We had a $42 million loss in extinguishment of debt during the quarter related to early payment for Term
Loan C, which was held on the balance sheet at a discount due to Fresh Start Accounting. The loss is a non-cash
charge.
On income tax expense, we've typically run over $60 million per quarter in non-cash deferred income tax expense as
we have a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. In this quarter, the recent bond for bank refinancing
lowered the non-cash deferred income tax. We do not expect either of these non-cash items to be recurring.
Moving onto slide eight, we generated $118 million of free cash flow in the quarter, just above last year's first quarter
level driven by lower cash interest payments and higher adjusted EBITDA, offset by higher capital expenditures. We
finished the first quarter with $865 million of total liquidity and, during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of senior notes
due in both 2021 and 2023, most of which we used to pay down the Term Loan C.

Subsequent to the close of the first quarter, we priced a delayed-draw seven-year Term Loan E in anticipation of the
Bresnan closing. We amended and extended our Term Loan A. We amended, extended and upsized our revolver to
$1.3 billion. We issued a new seven-and-a-half year Term Loan F to refinance the Term Loan C and D. And we issued
$1 billion in 10.5-year senior notes, and tendered $900 million of 7.875% notes with a cleanup call for the remainder.
So our debt maturity schedule pro forma for these transactions and the closing of Bresnan is shown on slide nine. Over
95% of our debt now matures beyond 2016 and our pro forma interest cost will be 5.6% with an annual run rate
expense of approximately $820 million. As of March 31, our leverage was 4.8 times; we still expect to close Bresnan in
the third quarter, at which point we expect to be levered at approximately five times in the last 12-month basis.
As a reminder, our tax assets consists of an outsized tax basis $8.9 billion and $7.7 billion of NOLs as of December 31,
2012. We announced last week that Liberty has completed its 27% investment in Charter and as a result, we
experienced a cumulative 50% ownership change through the past three years as defined in Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Now, as today's 10-Q describes, we do not expect this ownership change to impact our ability to use
our loss carry-forwards in the future.
And on that note, we'll open it up for Q&A. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks so much. I was just wondering if I could ask a longer-term question because
it's one that comes up with investors quite often. Are – the way you were sort of modeling sort of a longer-term top line
growth for your firm is to sort of use the sequential lift you saw in the Bresnan properties as a proxy, nominally 2% or
3%.
The question I get most from the buy side is, they look at your sort of aggregate penetration rates and say, gee, they're
quite low relative to a lot of cable peers. Isn't the opportunity set much larger for you as you begin to turn Charter
around? And I know it's a high-level question, but if you could just comment on that, that would be very helpful.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, Jason, this is Tom. I don't want to give you a long-run forecast of what we think
our revenue is potentially. But what you say is true, Charter's less penetrated than Bresnan is and so, from a potential
point of view, it has more upside. Whether you can realize that or not though is the million dollar question. And the
answer to that is, there are logistical impediments to growth and it's hard to grow faster than a certain rate of growth,
even regardless of what your base is. You see that in the commercial space, if you look at how big it is relative to our
penetration of it, it's growing rapidly but it's hard to take that up by an order of magnitude.
So I think that Charter has growth in front of it for years to come; whether we can logistically grow it faster than
Optimum West or Bresnan has grown, is hard to say.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak of Pivotal.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys, two for Tom. Could you give us your thoughts on having Liberty
Media as your largest shareholder with board seats? And then do you otherwise have a more favorable attitude towards
M&A given that presence, your tax advantaged position and the attractive debt mortgage? And then I have one
follow-up.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we're happy to have Liberty Media as a shareholder and as board members, as
shareholders, I hope they're like any of our shareholders in that they have expectations for the company's business plan
as we all do. And I think when you look at Charter's prospects, we do have a big runway in front of us. We are levered
appropriately for the kinds of business we're in to get good returns from our growth.
And we have a significant tax asset. And so, as investors, they're like all investors, I hope they understand our plan and
they do.
As board members, they are experienced operators in this space and not only here but around the world, so they bring
us a level of expertise that's really unmatched, and so we're pleased to have them. And in terms of our M&A approach,
Charter doesn't need to do M&A to be successful and we have an enormous opportunity in front of us and we're going
to take advantage of that. If we can find other opportunities that are similar to Charter's opportunity and we can manage
them and get them at an appropriate price, of course we're interested. We just did the Optimum West acquisition for
that reason and we'll be opportunistic, but it doesn't really change our point of view.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Fair enough. And then, Tom, can you talk about if you all are seeing any substitution for
OTT video providers. And I wanted to get your interest level if Aereo wins out in the courts in offering a low-end
alternative to multichannel, let's say, an Aereo-like service bundled with maybe a Netflix or an Amazon combined with
your data offering? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. Well, if you look at all the multichannel growth, there isn't much of it in the whole
space. And I think – and if you look at population growth and household formation, it's shrinking – multichannel video
penetration is shrinking which you could argue is over-the-top but I would argue that it's really more about pricing.
We've gotten very expensive bundles of video packages in our product mix that we as distributors can't do much about
at the moment and we've just gotten no relief from the FCC with retransmission consent.
So it's a difficult consumer proposition and the economy is still not great. We still have a lot of people unemployed and
underemployed and the labor force participation is at historic lows and so I think the big issue is price and economic –
macroeconomic forces in general that the value proposition or the desirability of the cable package or the multichannel
video package that we sell is still really attractive to most people. So I think most people that are using over-the-top
exclusively are doing it more out of economics than some value proposition in terms of what they really want to watch.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: And would it be interesting to you to do an Aereo-like service bundled with Netflix for
those low-end subscribers that are economically challenged combined with your data offering?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, look, if Aereo prevails, it means that there is a way to put broadcast TV on
televisions inexpensively in places where there is poor reception and that's what cable was historically long ago. And
so, there is an opportunity there. Whether it can be exploited and whether it's legal are big questions. Whether it would
dramatically change the business, I don't think it would. I do think that content would migrate away from broadcast and
move into multichannel bundles. Most of the broadcast companies own other product that's cable exclusive or
multichannel satellite and cable exclusive. So I really don't see it as a game-changer regardless of whether it's legal or
not.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik of UBS.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: A couple of quick questions on CapEx. It looks like the increase we're seeing year-over-year
is being driven largely by the CPE and the all-digital conversion. So, Tom, could you just refresh our memories in
terms of what you think is the sort of long-term capital intensity of the business given Time Warner Cable and Comcast
in the 2013 to 2014 range. And as you laid out the all-digital conversion in 2013 and 2014, can we assume that we can
start to move towards that sort of longer-term level as we move into 2015? Thanks.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we've said that we think that in the long run, the business becomes less capital
intensive and that last year was really the zenith of our capital spending as a percentage of EBITDA, of revenue – same
thing really. And that, so going forward, that it will be less and I think that's true absent some change in the whole
dynamic of the business or some acquisition on a per sub or per dollar of revenue per sub basis. Capital intensity should
decline and there are bunch of forces that are loose that make that so, when the network is completed.
Charter is actually doing capital expenditures and operating expenditures on its network coming from what I called in
the script, deferred maintenance. What that means is that we've been walking at our plant and expensing that walk out,
and finding problems with the physical infrastructure and fixing them which – some of which get capitalized. So you
are spending capital and OpEx at a higher level that really reflect some years of neglect that happened as a result of the
restructuring of the company. But, in general, the plant is in great shape and it's highly capable and a fully functioning
two-way operating capable infrastructure.
And so, I don't see continued significant investment in our network infrastructure. Going forward, though, CPE is
getting less expensive on a per box basis, our waiver furthers that in the sense that each box that we're going to buy is
going to cost less and each – and the opportunity to stand up additional vendors and to hook to smart TVs directly all
will reduce CPE intensity relative to the amount of TVs we have connected to our network.
And we also have some additional capital costs that we've been incurring in the short run as we restructure the
company from a company that outsourced a lot of its labor to a company that's insourcing its labor. The reason we're
having to spend capital is even though we're pulling from the same labor pool for contractors and employees, we have
to equip our own internal employees with new trucks, test equipment, et cetera. So we have a year and a half now of
spending, or year and a quarter since I've been here, that reflects that kind of change in structure. At some point, we
normalize that and we don't have any outsized spending relative to our labor force. In fact, the labor component of our
total cash outlay has become smaller because we've capitalized some of it. So the general answer to your question is
and the direction of it is, yes, we are moving toward more normalized ratio of capital to revenue over time.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: I do have a couple, but I did want to follow up on that, you said moving to more
normalized ratio of CapEx to revenue. What might that more normalized ratio be? And then further, Tom, do you
expect that cloud-based user interface will have a material impact on the business? Is that evolutionary or
revolutionary?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. The answer to your first question is, normal is a function of how fast you're
growing and we have ambitions to grow our business more rapidly as a result of its penetration position relative to the
rest of the industry. So we shouldn't be seeking to have the same capital intensity as every other company, but as a
general proposition, it's improving. The second part of your question?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Cloud interface...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Cloud interface revolution, evolution? What it does is allows us to have state-of-the-art
user interfaces like our competitors that are over-the-top, and to put those interfaces on multiple devices including the
TV and control the TV from those devices, so it allows you to search using a touch screen or a mouse and then to pull
up content that you want to have and have that content appear on your big screen in the form of video-on-demand or a
linear channel. And that is actually an improvement to the over-the-top products. And if you look at our actual content
inventory, it's not much different than what the over-the-top providers are making.
So in the sense of control and ease, it is a – it's a big differentiator from where we are using a remote control device on
a grid guide on a TV. And the – but the beauty of it is, that it allows all of our boxes that are already deployed,

regardless of their processing power and age, to be capable of using the cloud-based infrastructure. And what it means
is that the intelligence comes out of the box and moves into the network. And the client, so to speak, the set-top box can
become a thinner client which means again less capital intensity on a set-top box basis and a better user experience and
it eliminates the need to replace your entire box inventory with higher processing power boxes, which could display
graphical interfaces.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: So we'll call it a revolutionary evolution, I think.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. I mean it's a significant opportunity. And – but the beauty of it is it makes every
box you have state-of-the-art.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. I have one for Chris and one for Tom. Chris, on the quarter, last call, you
were nice enough to tell us about your pricing plans for the year. You talked, I believe about a 2.3% lift to your revenue
per customer, kicking in in the second quarter. But I didn't know if the price moves you made came earlier than you
had planned or anything you can help us to decompose the 2.2% increase year-over-year in ARPU or the $1.50
sequential, whatever you think is the right way to think about it?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Right. So the rate increase, if you take a look at the different rate increases that we
took against the product sets was 2.3% on 5 million customers for the full fiscal year 2013. And we saw one month of
that already inside of Q1 through different rate increases rolling through. So it really was at maximum a third of kind of
your run rate effect. So that's the right way to think about it.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Great. And that includes the price – the promotional price sets you guys called out?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: No. That is a separate and apart from promotional rate step-ups that take place upon
customers rolling off their promotional offers.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: I see. And then, Tom, you guys have mentioned the CableCARD waiver a number of
times over the last couple of quarters and I know you haven't changed your CapEx outlook but you seem to have called
out the benefits of that. Could you maybe just spend a minute on why that's important and how that changes the speed
and capital cost of the all-digital rollout?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. So the reason we haven't changed our capital guidance is we assumed we'd get it.
And we thought we could manage to it even if we didn't at least in this next fiscal year. But in the long run, what it
allows us to do is to buy less expensive boxes, and the simplest part of the equation is that, right now, we have to buy a
box that has a form factor in it, that allows the insertion of a CableCARD and we have to buy a separate CableCARD.
And that physical infrastructure in the box costs money and it's significant on a per box basis, and we get that savings
right away. In addition to that, the downloadable security infrastructure that we're going to stand up will allow us to
hook TVs directly or devices, DVRs, any device, any CE device with a chipset in it, will be able to be activated with
downloadable security by the cable company, by us. That means that not every device we have will require us having
any CPE at all in the house, and as more smart TVs proliferate, you're moving to a world where a lot of CE devices that
act as televisions or PCs will be able to be connected on a cable ready basis, so to speak, no capital involved on the part
of the cable company.
And finally, there's been a duopoly of security, conditional access we call it, between Cisco and Motorola, and it will
be opened. Both of those companies recognize that and that makes other vendors easier to sell products into this
industry, which will mean that any CPE devices that are needed between the cable company and another device like a
TV will be less expensive if there is a more competitive environment.

Next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick of JPMorgan.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: One quick one and a little bit longer. So can you, number one, define for us what the single
play limited video is as the percentage of the base, and do you see a point where churn-driven sort of basic video
declines start to moderate? And then second, can you detail more for us the differentiated offer you started in additional
markets in Texas? And is that leading to any acceleration in uptick? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I'll take that. I can take that.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, do you want to do the first piece?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Look, Phil, the simple answer is that we have 90% of our video base is now expanded
basic, so that by default means that we have 10% which is limited basic. We've provided you the single play
penetration percent which inside of Q1 is now 37.7% and what we've not done for a whole host of reasons is to provide
single play Internet versus single play video. But I think it is fair say that the vast majority of the limited basic
customers in that 10% of our video, the vast majority are traditionally single play. But there were some in there that
were coming through as a result of low-end triple play offers that the company had made in the past which then rolled
off into promotions inside of Q1 and that's part of the reason you see higher churn on that base as well. So I think the
amount of the drop-off that we've seen in the past couple of quarters is a function of that. So it may be somewhat
accelerated as to where, as Tom would call it, your stasis becomes over time.
The other piece that takes place is that you naturally are migrating that customer base into new pricing and packaging
into a more full video product, so it's not just churn. It's also migration into the proper video product. And then you're
selling, as you replace churn over time, you're selling at a 99% sell-in of expanded video. So I think we've seen an
accelerated amount of reduction in that limited base through all of those, but particularly given the roll-off of the
promotions that we were selling at this time last year and as we get into a proper year-over-year comparison, we expect
that base to continue to decline but maybe not quite as rapid of a rate.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: That's helpful. So thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And Phil, in your Texas question, we're going from a situation where we had a lot of
analog televisions still on our network there and we're turning it off completely and launching, I believe, 140 channels
of HD, approximately, simultaneously with that reduction in turning off of the analog product. Most of the way we've
marketed our way in with a very high digital penetration and we're finding that that combined with the offers we have
in the market there and the focus we had on it, that our sales on a year-over-year basis are accelerating. I mean,
essentially, we have a better product there now, significantly better product than we had historically and so it's early.
But we're pleased with the results we see so far.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: That helps. Thanks, guys.

You have a question from the line of Vijay Jayant of ISI Group.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Yeah, this is David Joyce for Vijay. With some of your peers having significant triple play
promotions over the course of the past year that are, in some instances, turning into increased churn, we were
wondering how that situation might play out for you, given that you've got lower penetration, wondering if you might

not have the same experience. If you could talk to that please?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Our goal is to reduce churn through our strategy and that's our expectation. And the
reason we think it will work for us is because we're putting a more valuable product in the home than customers have
historically had. It's all digital, it's two-way. It's lots of high definition TV, linear and on-demand. It's very fast Internet
service, 30 megabits at the slowest speed that we saw incrementally and a very feature-rich phone product, and it's
value-priced and it's value-priced if you keep it together as a service offering in the future. And we believe that that
product is valuable, that consumers recognize it and it can't be replicated by our competitors easily. It's superior to
satellite in that it's a two-way interactive product. It's faster than DSL and the phone service is more fully featured and
less expensive than you can buy from an incumbent phone company. And packaged, it's a better economic value than
you can buy the component pieces from individual companies.
So if you look at our satellite competitors and look at their ARPU and you look at what the full package that we sell is
and its value proposition, there is a significant opportunity for us to grow and to retain the customers that we connect.
So we don't expect it to increase churn.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: That's great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack of Nomura.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Thanks. Could you just talk a little bit about, you talked about the economy and sort of
price sensitivity and the over-the-top discussion. How is that impacting customers' interest or appetite from moving up
the speed tiers? And also, as you think about the price increase you just instituted, will that also have a negative impact
based upon people obviously looking for cheaper products out there? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, the answer to that is, yes, we took a modest price increase of about 2.3% across our
customer base and we were conservative with it for that reason even though our costs are for programming are rising
more rapidly than that. And we think that our price, if you look at what people are subscribing to already and our
relative market share of that, that we can stand up a better product than our competitors and that better product can be
priced from a value proposition in a better way and that we can take share. That's our business proposition. But if we
had a growing economy, and we had people going back to work, the opportunity for growth would be greater.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Okay. Tom, just to circle back on the M&A discussion. When you think about potential
acquisitions out there, is contiguousness or demographics important to you thinking about urban versus rural assets?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, no, I guess is the simple answer. I think at some level, if the asset is small enough,
the demographics matter, but any cable operation of size that covers a significant part of the country will tend to have
average demographics and I think that average demographics creates an opportunity for a well-run cable system.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from Shing Yin of Guggenheim.
<Q - Shing Yin>: I had a follow-up to an earlier question about the limited basic subs and a related question. So on the
limited basic subs, you said you lost 28,000 customers in the quarter. I wanted to clarify whether that is a net number,
that is net of any that you may have recaptured or upgraded to an expanded video product. And if so, can you give us
an idea what the recapture rate was in the quarter and has typically been over the last several quarters?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure, so let me answer that one first before we go on to the second question. So it is a
net number, it's a net loss number and the way to think about what we offset is that we sold 99% expanded inside the

quarter which meant that we were permitting 1% sell-in of the limited basic relative to that being a substantially higher
number last year. So the goal is to sell expanded basic and so the vast majority of gross disconnects were not offset by
new connects into limited basic.
<Q - Shing Yin>: I see. That's helpful. And my second question was, from the trending schedule, your percentage of
customers who are non-video increased to 22% in the quarter from 17% a year ago. And I just wondered if you can
give us an idea of whether that reflects a larger number of customers within your markets who maybe are not choosing
to take video at all? Or are you actually seeing more customers take your Internet product but choose video from
another provider? And if so, who are you primarily losing these video subscribers to?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. I'm not sure that I would argue that we're losing video subs to someone else as a
result of Internet sales. I think we're replacing DSL in satellite homes with Internet-only customers, is my view of what
the primary driver of that is.
<Q - Shing Yin>: And so does that suggest that when they switch over to your Internet product, they're actually
keeping their whatever video service they previously had?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yes. Yes, and our goal, obviously, is to improve our video product and our brand and our
reputation in the video space so that we can improve that conversion, but we have a highly valued, highly well-branded,
recognized data product and it's having significant, successful traction in the marketplace. Our video product is rapidly
improving, but doesn't have those attributes yet in the mind's eye of the consumer. And so, there is more work on video,
but I think we can get there.

Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Thank you. Just one question to clarify another question. The $107 per customer
relationship, just to clarify, does that include commercial customers or not? And then, looking at your NOLs, what's
your current expectation for the percentage of your share base that's going towards change of control post the Liberty
acquisition? How close are you to possibly tripping that and what agreements do you have with 5% holders to avoid
jeopardizing the tax asset?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. So on the first one, it's residential revenue per residential relationship, so it's a
clean number. And on the second question, we did push through the 50% cumulative three-year change in ownership
and, despite that, we do not believe that the value of our tax assets is impaired. There is some fairly good disclosure
inside of the Q as to why that's the case. It's a function of both the price at which that transaction closed, as well as
additional realized built-in gain, but net net, we don't believe that we're at all impaired in our ability to use those tax
assets.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza of CRT Capital Group.
<Q - Shagun Singh Chadha>: Thanks for taking the question. This is Shagun for Lance. So all the investments made
in network, sales, marketing and promotion were made last summer. Would that make 1Q the thrust in terms of
EBITDA margin compression? Or should we expect at least some margin compression in 2Q as well and then for it to
ease in the back half?

<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi. So, I think the fact is we're not going to be giving lots of EBITDA margin
guidance, but if I just trace you back through the changes that we made, the changes that we made were really started in
Q3. They included both the way that we went to market, product pricing and packaging as well as the accelerated
preventative maintenance and starting to do some of that deferred plant maintenance that Tom was talking about. And
that really accelerated through the fourth quarter of last year and it's continuing today.
So I don't think that if you try to take a look at the business the way it's being operated and what we're selling and the
customer base that we have, you're not going to begin to have a really clear year-over-year look until you can at least
get into Q3, but even then, you are going to have a mixed customer base that is a function of both legacy as well as new
pricing and packaging customers. Today, we're at 43%, that is not an inconsequential number. So 43% of our base is
now in that new pricing and packaging. And the higher we can get that number over time, the more like-for-like it
becomes as well as our operating practice on a year-over-year basis. So I think you need to think about all those things
when you think about the investments going in both in the P&L as well as the capital expenditures.
<Q - Shagun Singh Chadha>: Got it. Thanks. And then one question regarding CapEx, 1Q CapEx was actually
slightly below what we were expecting, although we are expecting it to be down on a full year basis. I was just
wondering if any capital expenditures were pushed from 1Q into 2Q? Or is this really the run rate we should be
expecting going forward? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Look, I don't know your model. So I'm not going to try to comment on it, but we
spent $412 million in capital expenditures in Q1. Our estimate still is $1.7 billion for the full year. It's a function of
growth, it's a function of scalable. It's a function of commercial. There is a lot of moving parts inside there. So I'd rather
not go much further beyond that than what we've already talked about.
<Q - Shagun Singh Chadha>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stefan Anninger>: Hi operator, we're going to take one more question, please.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Amy Yong of Macquarie.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Two quick questions. Can you talk about the video revenue growth of 6.8% in the quarter, and kind
of parse out what drove the growth, mix, revenue allocation and price increase, and how we should think about the rate
of growth over the next few quarters? And then just quickly on Bresnan, can you help us think through some of the
synergies that we should be thinking about?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. So, Amy, on video revenue, I gave a fair amount of color both in the prepared
remarks as well as what you'll see in the release and the 10-Q today. So I don't want to be overly repetitive, but we're
selling a different product. So you're getting more revenue at acquisition. We're putting more boxes on to these homes,
both for new customers as well as they migrate. We also have been more re-disciplined at promotional rate step-up. We
took some rate increases and then finally, I gave a sense that there is as, we sell in and migrate customers to new
pricing and packaging, there's effectively a reallocation on the bill that's taken place on bundled customers out of
phone, and that's by design, and a little bit into Internet and video.
So all those things put together – I'm not going to provide a waterfall because it's extremely complex when you take a
look at acquisition and which package and is it single, double, triple play and migrations, whatnot. So it would be
inappropriate to do that, but that's the right context to think about it.
And Bresnan, I will handle that very quickly. We've not disclosed anything about integration that we expect to have
synergies. I think the reality is it's operated the way that Charter is operating its plant today and it's going to market in
the same way that we do. And so, we think it's going to fit it very well. So it's less about trying to drive cost synergies
and more about trying to grow the business and grow penetration and grow the amount of ARPU, co-relationship and
the amount of cash flow per home passed by doing both on a revenue side as well as lower transaction cost and

improving the capital efficiency along the way.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, and I think the one thing I would add about Bresnan is that it's already more capital
efficient than Charter because capital was spent to get that plant ready to be marketed like we're currently marketing
Charter.
