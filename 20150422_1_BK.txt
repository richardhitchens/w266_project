Now I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Valerie, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. As you can see, we're achieving the
results consistent with the goals that we shared on Investor Day. For the first quarter, earnings per share were $0.67,
which was up 18% year-over-year.
Now, focusing on our year-over-year comparisons on an adjusted basis, total revenue was up 4%, total expenses were
down 2%, so we generated more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage.
Now, the stronger U.S. dollar reduced both our revenue and expenses but had a limited effect on net income, and Todd
will cover that more in a moment. Our return on tangible common equity in the quarter was 20%.
Now, we also returned significant value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the
quarter. Simply put, we're executing against our strategic priorities, and it's showing up in our numbers.
Now, let me remind you of what those priorities are and how we're doing against them. And our first priority is driving
revenue growth. During the quarter, revenue in Investment Services benefited from continued growth in both clearing
and Global Collateral Services. As we've been saying, we're investing in both of these areas to deliver enhanced
capabilities to our clients.
Our cross investment services, and in asset servicing in particular, we've been quite targeted about the business we are
taking on versus going after market share. We're focusing on deepening our client relationships, delivering the highest
value to our clients and growing profitably. And I think our results are showing just that.
Now, you also recall that late last year, we created the Markets Group to bring together existing capabilities from a
number of different areas. We've been repositioning the business by exiting various activities that no longer fit our
strategy while investing in foreign exchange, security planning, collateral management solutions for our clients.
Now, these initiatives are already improving our performance and reducing our costs. So for example, our enhanced
electronic foreign exchange platforms are capturing more client-driven volumes. And when volatility increases, as we
saw in the first quarter, we clearly benefit. So the Markets Group has stronger foreign exchange results, stronger
collateral management and securities financing activity, while simultaneously exiting derivatives positions and
reducing the capital and costs associated with it, good overall results that help improve the company's operating
margin.
Turning to Investment Management, to further diversify our assets under management, we're building out our retail
distribution capabilities and investing and expanding our Wealth Management platform. The inflows from these retail
distribution initiatives are in fact improving, but not yet at the point of being able to offset the active institutional equity
outflows that we and the entire industry have been experiencing.
Now after quarter-end, we reached an agreement to sell our Meriton Boutique, which is our German-based boutique,
and this is part of our business portfolio review process to identify opportunities to better redeploy our capital. The sale
will allow us to focus on those boutiques with global scale that most benefit from being part of BNY Mellon and where
we see the greatest growth opportunities. And we expect the sale to close at the end of the second quarter, and our
Investment Management operating margin should improve with this divestiture.
On the investment performance front, during the quarter, we strengthened our capabilities and they were recognized
through two rankings. In the first quarter, as a testament to its continued growth and success, the Dreyfus/Standish
Global Fixed Income Fund hit the number one ranking in the World Bond category for long-term investors, and it's

been consistently a top performer. And our Wealth Management business was named the 2015 top National Private
Asset Manager and top Private Bank Offering for Family Offices by the Family Wealth Report.
Now, our second priority is executing on our business improvement processes, where we have been taking action from
top to bottom, transforming our company through our continuous improvement process. It is reducing structural costs
and risks and improving client productivity and service quality.
Now, let me share some examples. We are simplifying and automating our global processes. We're continuing to
optimize and streamline our technology infrastructure, particularly in asset servicing, leveraging a common architecture
to reduce our costs and increase our agility so we are delivering new solutions to our clients even faster. And we
mentioned last week that we're succeeding in reducing our annual infrastructure spending, and that trend continued in
the first quarter.
Now, we're also shrinking our real estate portfolio in consolidating locations, and we've been able to accelerate some of
our efforts which allowed us to come in better than expected in our net occupancy expense line.
Now, also as part of our business improvement process, we're improving our return on technology investment. Today,
we have best-of-breed applications in most of our important business activities such as tri-party, clearing, payment,
settlements and collateral management. Our technology is well-regarded by industry professionals, and we are
particularly proud of our most recent acknowledge, now one of which was the Anita Borg Institute recently named us
as the top company for women technologists for achieving the highest overall score for all companies evaluated, and
this recognition helps us attract and retain top talent in the industry.
Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. The results of the 2015 CCAR demonstrated that
under severely adverse scenario, our projected minimum Tier 1 common ratio and our common equity Tier 1 ratio
under stress were the most resilient among all of the 14 Advanced Approach bank holding companies. So we are
well-positioned for all stress scenarios and feel confident that we can continue to execute on our capital plans going
forward.
Now, we also fully recognize the importance of our organization to the financial marketplace and that our reputation is
an asset that we must uphold every day. To further protect and enhance our safety and soundness, we are investing and
focusing on compliance, risk management and control functions. We've recently resolved some very important issues
on that front, and the actions we've taken will significantly reduce the probability of future issues.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying our capital effectively. So during the quarter, we
repurchased 10.3 million shares for $400 million. And our capital plan calls for early repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of
common stock over a five-quarter period.
And finally, our fifth priority is to attract and retain top talent. We've been executing against an integrated talent
management strategy across the entire company and have been focused on developing talent from within, as well as
infusing expertise with key strategic hires in areas where we benefit from new perspectives and capabilities. We
recently promoted several individuals identified through our talent management process to greater responsibilities,
including our newly formed BNY Mellon Technology Solutions Group, global fund accounting, middle office solutions
and our European bank.
Additionally, we added key external talent, including a new chief auditor and a new board member, who is our fourth
new director in less than a year. Fresh perspectives, ideas and the right team composition make us stronger.
So in summary, we're executing against our priorities and firmly believe we are on track to achieve the earnings,
expense and operating leverage goals we outlined for you on Investor Day.
So with that, let me turn it over to Todd.

Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document and start
with page six that details our non-GAAP or our operating results for the quarter.
As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.67. That's up 18% versus the year ago. Revenue in the first quarter was up approximately
4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting growth across all of our key businesses, with particular strength in
asset servicing, clearing services and foreign exchange. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially,
as the business improvement process is helping to increase efficiency and reduce our costs. Our ability to drive revenue
growth and control expenses resulted in a little more than 500 basis points of positive operating leverage
year-over-year.
Now, let me point out that we've estimated that the stronger U.S. dollar reduced our revenue by approximately 200
basis points and reduced our expenses by approximately 300 basis points and had a slightly negative impact on total net
income. The business most impacted was Investment Management, while currency had less of an impact on our
Investment Services business' net results.
We've added new foreign exchange metrics on page six of the news release, and that's going to help you capture the
impact of the two currencies. If you look at that, you'll see that the pound was down approximately 9% year-over-year
and euro was down 18%. So I'll discuss briefly the estimated impact to each of our business units as I cover the
segment results.
Income before taxes was up 16% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax margin
increased approximately 300 basis points to 30%, and that's up from 27% in the first quarter of 2014. Return on
tangible common equity was 20%.
Page seven shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain our underlying performance.
We had 7% year-over-year AUM growth and $17 billion of new net inflows during the quarter. You'll also note that we
experienced net outflows in equities in the quarter, while our LDI business continued its rapid growth. Our Wealth
Management business also is performing well, benefiting from our investments in promoting our brand and the
expansion of our sales force. Average loans and deposits continue to trend up.
Turning to page eight, you can see our financial results for Investment Management. As I previously noted, Investment
Management was most impacted by currency translation since we have a large number of our boutiques outside of the
U.S. and it results in about 42% of our revenue actually being non-U.S.
First quarter investment management and performance fees were $850 million. Investment management fees were up
1% year-over-year or 7% on a constant currency basis, reflecting the higher equity market values, the impact of the
Cutwater acquisition and strategic initiatives. We had performance fees of $15 million, that compares to $20 million in
the year-ago quarter.
Other revenue was $47 million in the first quarter, up from $16 million in the first quarter of last year and $7 million in
the fourth quarter. Both increases primarily reflect higher seed capital gains. The sequential increase also reflects
reduced losses on hedging activities within one of the boutiques.
Net interest revenue increased 6% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting the higher loan and deposit levels
mostly at the private bank. Revenue growth on a year-over-year basis was up 4% in Investment Management but
adjusted for the currency translation, we estimate it would have been up about 9%. Earnings were also negatively
impacted. Income before taxes, excluding amortization and intangible assets, was up 6% year-over-year and 7%
sequentially.
Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page nine, you can see that assets under custody and administration at
quarter-end were $28.5 trillion. That's up 2% year-over-year, and that's really driven by higher market values, net new
business and partially offset by the stronger U.S. dollar. Linked-quarter AUC/A was flat. Adjusted for currency effects,
year-over-year growth would have been roughly 5%.
The market value of securities on loan at period-end showed strong growth on a year-over-year basis, securities on loan
were up 10%. They're now at $291 billion. And that's due to the expansion and the receipt of securities as potential

collateral, as well as the impact of new clients joining our lending program and existing clients increasing their lending
activity. Average loans and deposits were both up significantly here as well. The key broker-dealer metric of tri-party
repo balances grew 9%. All of our clearing metrics recorded pretty good gains, with DARTS volumes and average
long-term mutual fund assets each showing double-digit growth.
Moving on to depositary receipts metric, we've had a focus on exiting some of the low-activity programs, the ones that
are at the lower end of our client base, as well as programs that do not meet our profitability criteria. This continued
with the routine closure of programs due to corporate actions has resulted in a net decline in the number of sponsored
DR programs in the portfolio.
On page 10, you can see detailed segment reporting for Investment Services. The key variances are reflected in fee and
other revenue in our consolidated results on page 11, so let's move to that page, where you'll see that asset seed
servicing fees were up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects net new
business, largely driven by Global Collateral Services and securities lending as well as the increase in market values.
The sequential increase primarily reflects higher client expense reimbursements and higher securities lending revenue
and Global Collateral Services fees. Both increases were partially offset by the stronger dollar.
Clearing fees were up 6% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The increase from the first quarter of 2014 was
primarily driven by higher mutual fund and asset-based fees and higher clearance revenue driven by higher DARTS
volume. The sequential decrease primarily reflects fewer trading days in the first quarter.
Issuer service fees were up 1% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Both increases reflect higher corporate actions in
DRs. Additionally, corporate trust fees seem to have stabilized. Treasury services fees were up 1% year-over-year and
they're down 6% sequentially. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonally lower payment volumes.
FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 68% year-over-year, and it's up 52% sequentially. For this
line item, you can also refer to the table at the top of page eight in the news release to see the details I'm discussing. FX
revenue of $217 million was up 67% year-over-year, that's 32% sequentially, reflecting higher volumes and volatility
as well as DR-related activity.
Other trading revenue was $12 million, and that compares with revenue of $6 million in the year-ago quarter and a loss
of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Both increases reflect higher fixed income trading revenues. The sequential
increase also reflects reduced losses from the hedging activity by one of our investment boutiques.
Investment and other income with $63 million was $39 million lower year-over-year, and that was driven by lower
leasing gains. One final impact on the currency impact on our Investment Services business, while less impact than we
see in Investment Management, we estimate that both revenues and expenses would've been up by an additional 2% on
a constant currency basis. Pre-tax income was not meaningfully impacted.
Turning to net interest revenue on page 12 of the financial highlights, you'll see that NIR on a fully tax equivalent basis
was unchanged versus the year-ago quarter and up 2% from the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, the increase in deposits
drove growth in our securities portfolio and offset the impact of lower yields. The sequential improvement reflects the
benefit of putting more cash to work, as you can see, in loans and securities, which also increased our margin for the
first time in years. The net interest margin for the quarter was 97 basis points, 8 basis points lower than the year ago
and 6 basis points from the sequential quarter.
On page 13, you'll see that noninterest expense decreased by 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The
year-over-year decrease reflects lower expenses in all categories except the sub-custodian expense, which is
volume-related, and other expense. And now, I should point out that other expense includes the impact of the new
European Union single resolution fund, as we're accruing our estimated annual contribution requirement. The lower
expenses primarily reflect the favorable impact of the stronger dollar, and we're seeing the impact of our business
improvement process here as well.
Total staff expense decreased 2% year-over-year. As you might have seen in our annual report, we elected to freeze the
defined benefit plan and we replaced it with a defined contribution plan. In the first quarter, we recognized a $30

million benefit related to the curtailment of the defined benefit plan. For the full year, we expect to have a positive
benefit to the DB plan itself, resulting in a $10 million net credit, and that includes the curtailment gain we just
received.
In addition, we expect to have about $12 million of additional expense in the back half of the year for the participants
that were formerly in the defined benefit plan. As a result, you can expect benefits to increase about $30 million in the
second quarter.
Our head count was 900 lower year-over-year. There was a sequential increase of 200, and that reflects the on boarding
of employees related to the January Cutwater acquisition, the lift out of the Deutsche Bank private equity and real
estate administration business, and new hires to support several large client on-boarding initiatives. The decrease in
total staff expense was partially offset by higher incentives, reflecting better performance as well as a lower adjustment
related to the finalization of the annual incentive awards and the impact of long-term stock awards vesting for
retirement eligible employees. Both of these last two items typically occur in the first quarter.
As a reminder, the first quarter usually has a spike related to our internal awards, and we would expect incentives to
decline in the second quarter by somewhere in the vicinity of $65 million based on performance.
On our last earnings call, I told you that occupancy cost should rise related to the sale of One Wall Street as we move
into our new facility, which would result in double rent in 2015. This increase was not reflected in the first quarter
because it was offset by the outsourcing of maintenance costs, a stronger dollar and the subletting of some vacant
space. For the full year, we still expect occupancy costs to increase as we previously indicated, as we take further
actions in our real estate portfolio.
Turning to capital on page 14. With respect to our capital ratios this quarter, the fully phased-in common equity Tier 1
ratio under the Advanced Approach declined from 9.8% to 9.1%, and that was driven by an increase in risk-weighted
assets primarily related to operational risk.
Now, as we've highlighted in previous periods, our operational risk model is impacted by external losses incurred by
other financial institutions. This quarter, one notable external loss in the payments phase flowed though our model and
added approximately $11 billion of risk-weighted assets and, therefore, negatively impacted our ratio.
I want to add here and let you know that in the second quarter, we expect to have a benefit to our risk-weighted assets
as we believe we will be deconsolidating many of our Investment Management funds, as we intend to be an early
adopter of the recently issued consolidated accounting standard, so we effectively expect to reverse the impact of what
we saw in the first quarter.
Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio increased to 4.5% as we generated capital and reduced the average balance
sheet size slightly. Our estimated LCR is already over 100% and compliant with the fully phased-in requirements,
which is 80% and will step up to 100% over the next couple of years.
Now, a few final notes about the quarter. As you'll see in our release, our effective tax rate was 24.4%, but that includes
2% benefit related to income with the variable interest entities, which if you included that in our numbers, our tax rate
would be in line with the guidance of about 26%, so I think that's the appropriate way to look at it.
I'll also point out that we have increased our tax advantage investments, including energy credits, which are now
having the effect of reducing our tax rate but also reducing our pre-tax income and, therefore, our operating margin. So
if we were to gross up the revenue from the tax credits and report the impact on a tax equivalent basis, our pre-tax
income would have been higher by about $64 million and our operating margin would have increased by approximately
120 basis points. We have elected to disclose this impact on a footnote on page 25 of our news release rather than
include it in our financials, but we think it's important as we make these investments and you see a reduction in some of
the pre-tax.
Also in the earnings release on page 11 are some investment securities portfolio highlights. You will see that the net
unrealized DNR portfolio was $1.7 billion at quarter-end. That's up from $1.3 billion at the end of December. During
the quarter, we transferred $11.6 billion of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity securities, and we also

purchased additional held-to-maturity securities during the quarter. Our strategy is designed to reduce the volatility of
our capital account from interest rate fluctuations.
Now, I'd like to discuss a few points to factor into your thinking about the second quarter and the year as we look
ahead. Net interest revenue is expected to be slightly higher in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter of
2015, as we benefit from the change in the asset mix and day count. We would expect incentives to decline in the
second quarter from the first quarter as they did last year. We expect Investment Management to continue to be
impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar due to its non-U.S. presence, while the impact of the overall company is
expected to be nominal. The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 25% to 26%, and we anticipate
proceeding with our capital plan, subject to market conditions and any other factors.
To summarize, we are achieving results consistent with the goals we shared on Investment Day, executing against our
strategic priorities and on track to continue to hit our Investor Day targets.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Todd, and, Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ashley Neil Serrao>: Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Ashley.
<Q - Ashley Neil Serrao>: Gerald, a two-part question on head count. One, I was hoping you could help me just
reconcile your commentary from the shareholder meeting where you noted that the company looked good on a
revenue-per-employee metric, but then at the same time, you reduced head count by over 1,000 positions over the
course of last year. And, two, as we think about the potential if we could leverage technology across the franchise, why
shouldn't this decline in head count continue?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, as you know, last year we took an increasingly aggressive action on the head count
side and were able to get some structural changes to our head count. We saw actually a continued positive trend in the
first quarter of this year except for the fact we've acquired a couple of pieces of business, and we've been building up
some capabilities for some new clients in certain key areas.
Clearly our goal, as part of our business improvement process, is to drive down the labor component of our company
and use technology as the strategic asset. So, one of our goals is to get the revenue per employee up, the employee
expense down and use technology as a strategic asset to get there. So, that's clearly part of our plan is to reduce that
employee head count for revenue.
<Q - Ashley Neil Serrao>: Great. And my follow-up is for Todd. On the balance sheet and reinvestment of cash, how
much more runway do you have there? And then, can you give us a sense of the duration and reinvestment yields here?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Ashley. Why don't we start with durations? So what we've effectively done is we've
got about half of the duration of the portfolio or call it half of the rate sensitivity of the portfolio and held to maturity
and about half in the available-for-sale accounts. And the duration of the total portfolio is probably around 2.5. So
we've softened the – dampened the volatility pretty substantially to our OCI for movements and interest rates.

We still are structured to see a pretty significant benefit from a rise in interest rates. So if we wanted to – in our net
interest income as well as in fee waivers and in other parts of our portfolio. So if we wanted to, we could probably
continue to increase the portfolio a bit. LCR is not necessarily a limiting factor here because we can increase the
duration of our HQLA assets, which is effectively what we've done here. So I would say there is a little bit of room
there, Ashley, but not a lot.

Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, guys. Just another stab at the head count question and investors are
claiming that your firm has too many employees relative to comparable peers and the difference isn't explained by
business mix. I think, though, if you adjust for the sale gains you had last year, it looks like the comp-to-revenue ratio
has been tracking just a couple of percentage points higher than your closest peers.
So maybe there's a little work to do there. You acknowledged the plan, but I think the sensible question's whether there
are underlying explanations like lower costs, offshore support or outsourcing of others that you don't do, maybe labor
intensity of the businesses you have that they don't. So I just wanted to give you an opportunity to speak to that.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. So, Luke, thanks. There's a couple of things that you should factor into your thinking
on a comparable basis. One, we've been insourcing our application developers where others have been either
outsourcing it or moderating it. So we're actually getting more capacity for less dollars in our technology application by
insourcing those capabilities, and we laid out some of those numbers for you last week and in prior weeks.
The second issue is we do internally transfer agency businesses, both in the U.S. and in Europe, whereas our principal
competitor actually does it through a joint venture or outsources it. Transfer agency services are very labor-intensive.
And therefore, if you were to combine the outsourcing or joint venture arrangement with our competitor, you'd
probably find a larger head count on a percentage basis than we may experience.
Last but not least, we do have things like corporate trust and clearing services and treasury services that some of our
competitors do not have. They do have a labor component associated with it, but they're also good operating margin
businesses. So I think that's where the comparable basis starts to bring in the question, the head count versus revenue.
That's why we're focused on the revenue per employee, and I think we compare very favorably to other institutions.
Our goal is still to improve in that category, and our goal is to still improve the operating leverage of our company.
That's what we laid out on Investor Day. That's what we're committed to delivering.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Great. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I wonder if you might take a stab at
breaking out employees by business or maybe consider adding some disclosure to that end in the future.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Okay, we'll give it some thought. Thanks.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Quick question on FX. Pretty solid this quarter, nice bounce back
from last quarter. Was DR switching to a tailwind here this quarter or was that neutral? And did some of the
adjustments that you made to that business that you referenced in your prepared remarks help to impact that revenue
line here this quarter?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Todd, go ahead.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: You had a couple of questions there, Brennan. In terms of DR, DRs were a little stronger
in the first quarter and some of that was timing from things that we've seen in the fourth quarter. So we did get a benefit
of that and there's some FX related to corporate actions in DRs, and so we did get a pickup there. And then some of the
FX was substantial increases in volumes which is somewhat market-related as well as us trying to capture on the
systems more of the volume. And then the remainder of the pickup was market-driven with some of the events in the
Swiss and the higher volatility that we saw in the first quarter.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Okay, thanks for that. And then, I know you referenced that you expect
Asset Management margins to improve on the German divestiture, but is it possible to quantify the impact to that
margins there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Curtis, do you want to...
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: The marine business was not a huge contributor to our overall pre-tax and was a modest
contributor to both revenues and expenses. The strategy around our divestiture ended up being that we really do have
strong fixed income capabilities in Europe and other boutiques, and the business didn't drive a significant amount of
pre-tax such that it made sense to continue to have as much of an offering in Germany as we had there. So it's not going
to be a dramatic impact on margins but absolutely positive.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, thanks very much.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Great. Good morning, everyone. Todd, question for you on the balance sheet, actually, a
couple of questions there. So, your comment earlier around putting some of the excess cash to work, I was wondering if
you guys could quantify that. We obviously see the mix of the balance sheet kind of moving out of the cash and cash
sitting in the fed and securities portfolio. How much, I guess, of the actual deposits you guys could consider moving
over time, and should we, I guess, take that maybe as a sign of confidence that you guys are starting to see some of that
non-operational cash becoming operational in your view and that's why you're doing that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think, A, there's greater clarity or there is perfect clarity now around the – I
shouldn't call it perfect. Better clarity around the LCR, Alex, which gives us some confidence in how the HTM account
would be traded under the LCR. So we have put prudency limits around how far we would go with that. So if you can
see in the quarter, the cash declined by about the size of the increase in the securities portfolio.
We do have a very stable core deposit base well in excess of the amount of securities that we have in the high-quality
liquid assets and in the HTM account. There is probably a little bit more room for that. I think most of what you'll see
us do now is work on both the assets in the non-HQLA to see if we can bump up the yields a little bit and the assets in
the HQLA with the same push.
But we're kind of sticking – we're at 97 basis points in NIM. Our guidance was 95 basis points to 100 basis points in a
zero rate environment, and I'm going to try to stick with that, Alex. I think that's probably the best estimate of where
we're going to be there.

<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got you. And then a follow-up on just the overall size of the balance sheet. So this is
the first decline in average earning assets of the size we've seen from you guys in a while. Just curious, I guess, where
is the decline in deposits coming from? What kind of client base is that? Where is it going? Just to get some better
sense of the moving pieces there.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It is not – as you look into the details, Alex, you'll see it's not in our deposit base. The
deposit base is about flat to up slightly. Where you see it is in other borrowed funds and, occasionally, we do put
securities out on repo and we'll take advantage of some interest-earning opportunities. There were less of them so we
brought down the balance sheet by $10 billion. So that was self-induced by our treasury team.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Hey, a couple of questions, one on just on SLR. You made a little bit of progress this quarter,
just wanted to understand how much of a benefit the deconsolidation of those investments you mentioned earlier were
going to have, if you could refresh our memory on that, as well as opportunity to improve maybe sooner rather later
with pref issuance.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. In terms of the deconsolidation, we think it's probably in the ballpark of about 2%
of the assets. So if it's 2% and we've got a 4.5% ratio, you can kind of do the arithmetic, about 9 or 10 more basis points
there, Betsy. It's not a huge mover but every little bit helps and, obviously, there's no cost to doing that.
As we disclosed in our CCAR, we're giving some consideration to doing a preferred, and preferred could be an
additional – it's a cheaper source of capital, obviously, than common, and it may be something that we could do on our
path to compliance if we felt it was appropriate based on what we see happening to the deposit base. The deposit base
is relatively stable. It might be up a little bit since the end of quantitative easing. But I think there's going to be some
shifting around, and the future of the deposit base is going to be a function of how the Fed actually conducts its
monetary policy.
<Q - Betsy Graseck>: Right. Okay. And then just separately on clearing, we had heard from JP that things get tougher,
there's the possibility they might fade the clearing business. I mean, how do you think about that? How do you think
about the future of clearing? Is there any efforts to potentially put clearing into a industry-shared entity?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Why don't I take part of it and then I'll turn it over to Brian Shae. So, Betsy, as you know, we
have two forms of clearing businesses. One is the institutional side, the broker-dealer clearance business, where we
have a very significant market share. It's always been the basis for some of our tri-party collateral management
capabilities. It's allowed us to build our collateral management and enhance it on a global basis. So it's been a core
business for us, and it's a differentiator for us in the marketplace.
As you may know, the Federal Reserve is our client in that space as well on the reverse repo program. So we see it as
an important activity. We're mindful of the fact that central clearinghouses and other market participants want to utilize
some of those activities, but today it's a good earner for us. We're investing in it, and it's allowing us to bring to market
new capabilities.
And our other clearing business, which is really a financial advisory solutions platform, i.e., Pershing, we see that as an
incredibly strategic asset for the company growing very, very nicely. Wealth managers, private banks, advisors around

Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, I was wondering if you could talk about – we've
gotten to the point or it seems like we may have seen that turn in professional legal and other services. You guys have
taken care of a bunch of the litigation, and I'm just wondering if you can give us a line of sight there. That's been the
second biggest category. It's been a pressure on earnings for quite a while. Are we at an inflection point there? Are you
at the point where you can at least feel confident that we've kind of peaked or starting to turn down?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think, Ken, there are a couple of items in there. A lot of our purchased services are things
like data sources and information that we use to run our business. Our procurement activities are actually helping us
drive some of those services down. We think there actually is a little bit more room there.
In terms of the management consulting and some of the consulting expenses that we're incurring related to some of our
major platform initiatives, those will probably be running at the rate that we're seeing now or in the ballpark. There was
quite a spike in the fourth quarter. We wouldn't expect that to recur but they could be in the same level that they're at
today.
Legal's a little bit early to call. There should be a peace dividend with our settlement, so we might see some benefit out
of that for some of our litigation defenses which also fall on that line. So, I think in the short term, I'd look for it to stay
down at this level that we saw it come down from in the fourth quarter. There might be some room going out but, at
this point, I don't think I'd really give guidance to a big number yet.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And my second question, maybe one for Curtis just on the – in the Investment
Management business, Todd, hearing your points on the effect of FX but the growth rates, even adjusted for the three
individual Investment Management lines, are somewhat subdued, meaning it implies that the fee capture rates look like
they're still under some pressure with your mixing still into LDI and out of active equity. Just wondering if you could
kind of shed some additional light on just continued optimization there and what should we expect as far as the outlook
for fee capture?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah. So fee capture, when you blend assets with fees that are very different in each
asset class. And so, what we have seen is the fee capture declines really have been a result of the success of our rapidly
growing LDI business. So LDI, again, the U.S. LDI and European and UK specifically LDI businesses are somewhat
different.
The biggest part of our LDI business is in the UK and Europe through Insight, and they have continued to garner assets
as pension plans are derisking. That business is actually a quite active business as you're trying not just to manage
against an interest rate liability but also an inflation liability. They earn both base fees and performance fees. So when
they perform well, their fee realization is actually meaningful higher.
But again, what's happening on the total fee capture is that the declines – we covered this at Investor Day, you may
remember, Ken – that it really has a lot to do with the fact that our LDI business is growing so rapidly. But again, it's
not a passive business. It's very much an active business, and much of our performance fees over the past many
quarters have been from our LDI business.

Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I have one question with three parts. At the annual meeting, new director Ed Garden said
that Bank of New York is focused on being best in class in everything we do. So first, are you benchmarking versus
best in class? Second, what is the best-in-class number for ROTCE and the margins for Investment Management and
Investment Services? And third, when you look at best in class, wouldn't it be more appropriate instead of looking at
revenue per employee to look at net income per employee? And on that measure, it seems like you rank below peer.
Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks, Mike. We certainly inspire to be best in class in everything we do and to be
recognized as the industry leader in the areas we operate in. We do metric ourselves against a variety of different
institutions and a variety of different metrics to try to achieve those goals. We've challenged our teams across the
company to aspire to those metrics.
For the public consumption, we give you broad metrics. It's tough to give you every single metric that we're operating a
company within, and so things like fee-to-expense ratio across Investment Services you see continuous improvement
there. The revenue per employee is admittedly a broad metric, but it's an indicative metric of one of the things we're
trying to work towards. We look at client surveys, client satisfaction surveys, we measure those. Those, as we shared
with you at the shareholder meeting last week, are extremely high scores. We want to get to 100%. I'm not sure we'll
ever get there but those are some of the things we're trying to work towards. Things like straight through processing
rates, accuracy rates are all things that we measure in Investment Services.
The Investment Management side, we look at the investment performance of the boutiques and the asset classes versus
their fee realization. So we have a lot of metrics across the company where we're aspiring to the be best in everything
we do. Will we always get there? It will be a challenge to get there in every single category but that's certainly our
aspiration.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. One follow-up then because last week you did mention the revenue per employee, and
after getting back to my desk and looking at net income per employee, you didn't look quite as good or like you
under-performed peer. So why is revenue per employee the right metric to look at instead of net income per employee?
And also, when you sell your German boutique, will that help that metric and can you elaborate on that sale because
that seems new?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Mike, whether it's revenue per employee or net income per employee, I think they
are a metric. But I think the metric ultimately that you need to follow is what is happening to our operating margin and
how are we performing because if we insource or outsource, whichever way you go, there's good reasons for one
company to do it one way versus another doing it another way. Ultimately, it's got to drop to the bottom line.
And I think what you've seen in our performance this quarter, a 300-basis-point increase in our operating margin is
pretty substantial and we continue to focus on driving the margin. We think the strategies ultimately will pay off. We
think the insourcing of our application developers, not only do we have the intellectual property close to our clients,
which can make us the best in class in terms of providing technology solutions, we also have it at a lower cost because
we own it. And that's being reflected in our technology costs, which are declining.
So I think that's how ultimately you have to measure us because it's just too hard to tell exactly what's going on with
head count and how people compute it and whether they've got contractors in versus full-time employees and so forth.
In terms of Meriton, I'll turn that over to Curtis.

<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah, thanks. One thing I would want to make sure that we highlight is that we – in
addition to selling Meriton, we also acquired Cutwater. There is actually a net reduction in staff as a result of that, but
it's not going to meaningfully change any of the metrics that you're looking at, Mike. So that really was a strategic
repositioning of our portfolio.
Again, we had more fixed income capability in Europe than we felt like we needed, and we also want to grow Insight's
terrific LDI capabilities in the U.S. So partnering them with an excellent firm at Cutwater really was what we thought a
fantastic move. So I just wanted to make sure we capture both of those.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. And I think Meriton is part, in and by itself, it's not going to move the needle a lot.
But as we pore over the portfolio, as we change our derivatives businesses, we streamline our capital markets activities,
as we exited the futures clearing margin, as we exited two corporate trust activities in Japan and Mexico, now throw
Meriton into that. As we continue to pore over what makes sense, in aggregate, they're starting to move the needle.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Maybe just following on that path on the actual cost saves from strategic actions and maybe if
you can just update us on the aggregate level of cost saves on a year-over-year basis that you expect from consolidating
some of the back office platforms and asset servicing like moving to one platform in custody.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. So, Brian, this is Brian Shae. We continue to drive forward with our business
improvement process, which you know was transforming for success. And as Gerald mentioned earlier, we're going
across the board. So from a business excellence perspective, Todd just talked about the business portfolio review
actions and Meriton was the latest in a series, we continue to drive more leverage across the franchise in terms of
enterprise teamwork. We're executing on a global location strategy to reposition people to lower-cost locations. We've
talked about the insourcing of technology development, which not only improves our speed to market and intellectual
capital leverage, but it also reduces our costs and reduces our dependency on contractors and consultants.
We are moving forward with platform consolidations. In the latest quarter or in the last month, we completed the final
stage of our corporate trust re-platforming to our target platform, and that will enable to us to retire another large
historical legacy platform in the company.
So there's lots going on, but the key message I'd say is, one, we gave you a target in Investor Day. We're going to meet
that target, and we're on track to meet that target. And the work that we're doing is not onetime cost-driven. It's
sustainable, continuous improvement, and so we believe we can continue to drive improvement in this process over the
long term.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And, Brian, I would just add that we've learned the lesson of announcing a big program and
then delivering on the program. And unless it shows up in the operating margin in the operating leverage, it doesn't
count. And it's showing up in the operating leverage and the operating margin, so our margin went up by 300 basis
points since the first quarter of last year. Our fee-to-expense ratio has improved in Investment Services, and we've
produced over 500 basis points of operating leverage. Those are the facts.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And I would add to that, Brian, all the actions that we're taking to streamline the
organization and the transformation that Brian just talked about make us a little simpler, a little less risky, but there also
continue to be significant regulatory requirements for us, the resolution planning meeting, some of the data
requirements that are substantial. So the regulators continue to increase the bar, and we need to be prepared to be able

to fund those investments. And some of this will drop to the bottom line and some of it will enable us to fund the
increasing demands from the regulators.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Great. Thanks. So that remains the wild card on a regulatory front from an expense
perspective. And then just to follow up, this might be too early to try to figure, but you talked a little bit about the
Nexen platform at the shareholder meeting. Maybe if you could – is there a way to quantify the competitive advantages
you think you'll be able to get from that – from new product rollout, some of the internal sourcing that you just
mentioned, say over a two or three-year period from a revenue perspective?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I wouldn't want to give you a specific revenue target, but I can say that we're
committed to being the investment industry technology leader. Part of the insourcing strategy that we mentioned is not
just around being more cost-effective. It's about transferring domain business knowledge into the technology
development team in a way that creates a competitive advantage.
Nexen will be a visible manifestation of that to our clients. It's sort of a next-generation technology platform that's
going to allow us to connect the various applications across the various businesses and deliver a more seamless and
state-of-the-art intuitive platform to BNY Mellon's clients. It is based on a secure private cloud-based platform which
accelerates our speed to market for new capabilities and actually reduces our cost of infrastructure. It has an EPI
marketplace essentially allowing seamless integration with our clients so we'll be an easier firm to do business with and
integrate with from a technology perspective. It will be completely mobile in the way that we deliver. So any mobile
device anywhere, anytime, people will be able to connect through Nexen.
It has the equivalent of an app store which means that we're going to be able to easily integrate third-party providers of
choice into the platform so that we reduce our clients' vendor management and integration costs. And ultimately, it will
be the delivery vehicle for our big data solutions, which we're already developing and delivering to clients in the area of
liquidity management and collateral management but will allow us to deliver insights to our clients.
So we're rolling this out internally beginning this quarter, and we'll start rolling it out to customers in the second half of
the year for selected businesses and over the course of 2016 we'll roll it out more broadly to the broader client base.
Hope that helps.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yes, yes. No, that's good color. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. Question on money market lay. I'm curious if you feel like you
have the product offering set where you want it to be as we transition next year and what kind of sensitivities you think
you're looking at in terms of client balance migration, prime funds to treasury funds, and what kind of fee give up and
fee waiver give up that might be – that we're thinking gets recaptured that might not be based on how clients migrate.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Hey, Glenn, it's Curtis. Let me give you the view from the Investment Management
perspective and maybe Todd or Brian can talk about it on the other side.
So, first of all, you are seeing people reposition their money market offerings as we get closer to next year's floating
rate NAV for institutional prime funds, and we've actually been spending a lot of time on that as well. And so not ready
to announce anything just yet, but I think it's fair to say that the industry will position itself for what we do believe will
be a shift in assets. There's a lot of people who currently- institutional clients that use fixed NAV prime funds that will
not able to have them be in a floating status, so we know assets are likely to move.
We continuously survey our clients and not just across Investment Management but the whole company. We're
obviously very large player here. And we do believe that between a third and 50% of clients will shift to treasury funds.

And so to answer your question about that means from a fee waiver perspective, it's very significant where interest
rates are when that occurs. Fee waivers are more challenging in treasury funds. And so if in October of 2016, interest
rates haven't moved, there will be a negative impact from fee waivers from that activity.
One of the other things that is somewhat offsetting to that, though, is you've seen some banks begin SLR, having an
impact, changing their views on deposits. And so we have absolutely seen hedge funds and other clients who would
have left deposits on bank balance sheets move those to money market funds, and so we're actually – in the first quarter
across our platform and within Investment Management, we saw balances remain relatively stable. The seasonality
would have suggested that they would have been down somewhat. So there's a growth in money market funds
occurring as a result of regulation, so there's sort of some countervailing forces at play here.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So I think, Glenn, for the company as a whole, that if interest rates were to stay at zero and
you did see a movement from prime and, again, what Curtis just indicated is the movement you're seeing into treasury
funds, not necessarily coming from prime right now, it's coming from bank deposits. But if in the event – as we move
forward with money market fund reform, we would expect prime to go to more towards treasury. And if interest rates
stayed at zero, that would be a negative for us because there's lower yield in treasury and, therefore, they're going to be
a modest increase in fee waivers as a result of that. If interest rates normalize, then the recovery track of fee waivers
would be as we've described.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Got it, okay, appreciate it. And then just one little catch-up on occupancy costs. You
mentioned that we couldn't see the double occupancy costs in first quarter. I just want to make sure they were there but
they were offsetting items. Because I just want to make sure we're modeling second, third and fourth quarter correctly.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I'd love to – let me clarify that, make it absolutely clear. So, yes, we are paying the
double rent. We have a little benefit from currency translation. We also had a little benefit from our outsourcing of
maintenance which falls to that occupancy expense line. And in addition, some of the costs associated with the move
have not been reflected in that line. So I think the best guidance I could give we had indicated that we thought the line
would be up about $30 million for the full year. It's probably best to think of it at about that amount.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Yeah. Good morning. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the deposit discussion. Obviously,
given leverage constraints across the industry, it's sort of a difficult problem for everybody. How do we think about it
long term? Is it more that, hey, we can't really tell our client what's to do because we don't want to lose relationships
and push deposits down like a JPMorgan, and longer term, the economics with higher rates, you kind of get to a
crossover point where you actually earn your cost of capital on those deposits?
Is that sort of the strategy or is there something more proactive you can do to push down leverage and move into money
markets? So just wondering if there's any kind of constraints on money markets for a lot of corporate treasurers if they
have a risk of being locked up for 30 days and things like that.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, why don't I start and I'll turn it over to Todd. One, it's a very dynamic situation.
There's supplemental leverage phases in and we work our way towards it. Obviously, the level of the balance sheet
becomes increasingly more important.
We'd like to earn some money on those deposits in the short run. We're watching our deposit base and our client
activity. We clearly want to try to drive the deposit base towards operational deposits, which have a more favorable
treatment. We're educating all of our teams around the company around client activity and whether it's operational
deposits or not and, therefore, the value associated with them. That helps us engage with our clients better and really
drive better outcomes for our clients and ourselves.

So it's a very dynamic situation. We're very engaged with our clients on it. Where we think it's appropriate, as we've
done in Europe where we're charging for deposits, we are but we're modeling this and watching it carefully.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. And, Jim, I would just add to that that it's hard to predict how deposits are going to
move until you are clear about what Fed monetary policy is going to be. So if they drain in a traditional way, which
would be through reverse repo, then we would think deposits would run off and it would be price-based.
Another alternative is literally just to price them, so there are going to be non-operational deposits, which mean they
aren't very attractive under the LCR, and I think banks will be not willing to pay a lot for them, especially if they're
somewhat constrained by the SLR ratio.
In the event that interest rates rise and those deposits want to stick with institutions that are very strong institutions,
there'll be a crossover at 60 or 70 basis points that looks pretty attractive as a return on capital, even just leaving it at
the Fed. So there might be a point where you probably raise some preferred or capital just to keep them on the balance
sheet and make that actually a zero-risk return but a decent return on regulatory capital.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks for that. That's very helpful. And then maybe a quickie on the net share count.
I think last year's buyback I think net of employee stock issuance, it was about, I guess, at 35%, 40% dilution. Is that
the way to think about it going forward or should we think about the employee issuance as more of a fixed cost and as
the buyback increases, the net share count reduction improves?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It's relatively stable, so you'll see a little bit of a higher one as the buyback increases but
not a lot. So you should still, I think, think in the same terms that you just mentioned that there will be share issuance
with the employees.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And that's kind of a ballpark, okay.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Thank you and good morning. A couple of questions on Investment Management, specifically
on the multi-affiliate model. Appreciate your comments so far on Meriton and Cutwater and Insight. Just more broadly
across the affiliate portfolio, is there additional streamlining you're thinking about? Are there capabilities that you're
looking to add or maybe some affiliates that are subscale? Just more broadly, how are you thinking about the affiliate
portfolio? Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. So one of the things that we announced recently was the formation of actually a
new investment boutique from start with the state of Texas as a cornerstone investor. We actually launched a firm
called Amherst Capital, and it's designed in many ways to benefit from a lot of the regulatory change that we're talking
about where banks are having to hold more capital. Much of the changes in real estate finance have been impacted by
that, and so that boutique will actually manage funds in real estate finance as a result of this change.
And so that's an example of the kind of thing where we are continuously looking for places where we believe our
clients can earn some very attractive returns relative to their liabilities and relative to their needs. And one way that we
manage our portfolio is by starting new things, launching new things, and it was a great thing to have a very
well-known sizeable institutional client launch that with us.
On the other end, the Meriton sale very much was looking at our portfolio and seeing the great growth that we've seen
from other investment firms in our mix. So both Insight, Standish, El Sentra, Newton even have some very good
European fixed income capabilities.

So when we feel like our capabilities get to the point that there is a more attractive owner of the firm, we have sold it.
In the past, we've closed firms that became subscale or didn't deliver the investment performance. We're always
looking to find those investment capabilities that we think are excellent, that fit needs that we think our clients have and
that are in line with market trends, such as the one I describe around Amherst.
It's a continuous process. I will tell you that we are not traders of our investment boutiques. I want to make sure that we
don't send that message because the truth of the matter is we're trying to have an investment lineup that satisfies the
complete solution for our vast global client base. And again, the Meriton enterprise by itself is not a core strategy of
ours to sell firms but it really just made more sense to do something different. The Cutwater acquisition, again,
expanding pension derisking capabilities into the U.S. is a major market trend and that's why we made the acquisition.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Makes sense. Thank you for the color. And then just turning to the equity capability which
stands out a little bit from an otherwise strong franchise. On those terms, are there product gaps that maybe you're
looking to fill? Is it a question of current products maybe being out of favor or mainly a performance issue? I know
you've done some work on distribution. How is that coming to fruition?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Thanks for that question. It's a good one. Again, most of the assets under
management that we have are with institutional clients who are very disciplined around rebalancing. And so as equity
markets have performed well, the client base that we have is very thoughtful about managing their overall asset
allocation.
And so rebalancing has absolutely been a big part of the trends we see not just this quarter but in previous quarters. We
look across the industry and some of what we see in retirement channels and in retail channels, there's been less
volatility. There are absolutely inflows into some equity products. And a lot of the investment we've been making in
our Wealth Management business and in our U.S. retail intermediary business have been around being able to capture
those flows. And just year-over-year, I can tell U.S. retail across all products had a very nice uptick, about 60%
increase in sales, and our Wealth Management business is also showing some very nice growth.
In active equity, we have seen some impact at the institutional level where clients have moved from active to passive.
I'll tell you that about a third of what we've seen in our business in this quarter was a move from active to passive. So
that's a dynamic at play as well.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. At the Investor Day, you talked about an
11% to 12% range for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. Clearly, even with the reverse of the operational risk here,
you're going to be a bit below that. Are you still thinking of that 11% to 12% range at the right number or do you think
it's kind of shifted down?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, Geoff, I think as I'd mentioned in my prepared remarks, the impact of the increase in
the operational risk capital will be offset by the deconsolidation of certain assets as we believe we're going to be an
early adopter of the consolidation standards. So that will bring us back closer to the 10% range, and then there will be
some natural accretion of capital as we both increase our SLR requirement.
And we'd like to be about – I think being optimal is being about 2X. So if we have 5.5% of SLR-based leverage capital
that would probably put us at about an 11% or so for our common equity Tier 1. So I'd still keep it pretty close to the
range of 11% to 12%.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: And then just a quick question on the numbers. There was a big increase in non-controlling
interest to $90 million, and there was also a big step up in the income from consolidated Investment Management
funds. It sounded like you were saying there was some sort of hedging effect that drove that, but I just wanted to make

sure I understood what was going on.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. This refers back to the consolidation of the variable interest entities that we're just
talking about for the balance sheet. So effectively, what happens where we have a small interest in the fund, we have to
consolidate the entire fund. And as we consolidate that, we recognize the revenue not only of our own small interest but
of our clients. And then we take that – so in the first quarter, it did very well. So it went up substantially and our clients
saw much more in the form of revenue than we've typically seen.
And if you go through the balance sheet, you'll see there is a deduction on an after-tax basis of that minority interest.
And so what it looks like is we have a large pre-tax income and, therefore, have very low tax rates and – that's not our
income, it doesn't get included in the tax rate.
So in effect, it's best to just take the way – the way we report our numbers on an adjusted basis. That's why we didn't
say our revenue grew 6%, which was what the GAAP number was. It actually grew 4% because we took the client
revenue out of the revenue line. As we adopt the new standard, we'll get a lot less noise from that because it will
eliminate most of what you see coming through there.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Great. Thank you very much.
