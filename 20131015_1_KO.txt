Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning everyone. We delivered sequential volume growth in the third quarter while
capturing global nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage value share for the 25th consecutive quarter. We gained volume
and value share across core sparkling and juice drinks, sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. Importantly, we were able
to do this in combination with a 2% increase in price/mix. Excluding the impact of structural items, we generated
comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 4% and strong operating income growth of 8%.
Our broad diversified product portfolio, a disciplined approach to extracting and reinvesting savings, and our global
geographic reach are enabling us to effectively navigate a still uncertain macroeconomic environment. History has
taught us that when we invest through difficult times, we emerge even stronger. This quarter, our system delivered the
highest number of servings ever reported in a third quarter, both for brand Coca-Cola and across our portfolio. In all,
we delivered 181 billion servings, thanks to global volume growth of 2% driven by 2% global growth in brand
Coca-Cola.
This record number of servings speaks not only to our system's worldwide strength but also to the opportunities ahead
of us as we engage with the next generation of global consumers. Our global still brands also delivered solid results,
growing 3% and gaining global value share. These third quarter results bring our year-to-date volume growth to 2%
cycling 5%.
In line with our expectations for the third quarter, we delivered sequential volume growth in many key markets,
including North America, China, India, and regions across Europe. That said, clearly the global economy remains
challenged, as noted by the International Monetary Fund last week, which trimmed this forecast for global output for
the sixth time since early last year. And as we've all noted, emerging markets have become increasingly more volatile,
further exasperating a challenging global landscape.
Hence, disposable income and consumer spending have become challenged and consummately have impacted the
overall growth of the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry. Yet despite these ongoing headwinds, our business remains
healthy, and we continue to invest in the strength of our brands. We are fully implementing our productivity and
reinvestment plans and together with our global bottling partners, we continue to advance our system. All of this leads
us to remain confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in line with our long-term growth
model over time.
Looking first to our operations in North America, brand Coca-Cola grew an impressive 2% in the quarter, leading our
total beverage portfolio to 2% growth on top of 2% growth in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date volume growth in
North America is even as we cycled 2%.
Sparkling beverages were even in the quarter, with sparkling price/mix increasing 1%. Year-to-date sparkling price/mix
is up 2%, as we remain committed to a rational pricing environment. We also remain focused on consistent investments
in packaging innovation, in immediate consumption growth, and increased teen recruitment, all of which are yielding
positive results.
Specifically, packages like the 1.25-liter and mini-can packs have increased our household base by more than 1.8
million in the last year. In addition, Coca-Cola has generated over 19 million incremental immediate consumption

transactions year-to-date, and importantly, Coca-Cola remains the most preferred beverage brand amongst teens by a
two-to-one margin.
Still beverage volume grew a solid 5% with volume and value share gains across the energy juice and juice drinks,
water and tea categories. In sports drinks, we gained volume share while maintaining value share. As these results
indicate, our revenue growth management strategies are working and enabling our system to provide consumers the
brands they love, the convenience that they crave, and the value that they need, while also expanding our top line.
We continue to outperform the industry, gaining volume and value share across both sparkling and still categories. I'm
also pleased to share that we are making progress on the evolution of our North America system as our North America
team continues to advance discussions with existing and prospective partners who are eager to be part of this dynamic
franchise system.
Turning now to Latin America, our volume growth was even in the third quarter, cycling 5% growth, and coupled with
a double digit increase in price/mix, due primarily to continued and disciplined focus on price and pack architecture
enhancements, as well as inflationary environments in some markets. Across the region, we gained nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink volume share, making this the 25th consecutive quarter that we've maintained or gained volume share.
Similar to what we have experienced in other markets, we are seeing a slowdown in economic growth in Mexico and
Brazil. Falling GDP growth rates have led to slower growth rates in personal consumption and consequentially in
nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.
As in other instances where we've witnessed economic slowdowns in recent years, we are expanding our marketing
efforts while actively working with our bottling partners to invest in these markets and to offer consumers attractive
price-pack combinations. Examples include the expansion of returnable glass bottle distribution and initiatives to
ensure affordability tied to magic price points. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, we experienced solid performance with
volume growth of 4% in the quarter
Moving on now to Europe, we again witnessed diverging results with 3% volume growth in Northern European
countries offset by a 5% volume decline in countries that make up Central and South Europe for a net decline of 1% in
our European business in the third quarter. In spite of this challenging environment, we gained volume share in core
sparkling across the entire continent while continuing to strengthen our competitive positions across the nonalcoholic,
ready-to-drink beverage industry in our Central and Southern European business unit.
Price/mix increased 8% in the quarter, including the impact of the consolidation of Innocent. Our Share a Coke
campaign was extremely well received. We placed over 2.5 billion customized packages into the market to drive teen
recruitment and further bolster immediate consumption.
Lastly, our operations in Germany continue to perform well, delivering 3% growth in the quarter, cycling 3%. This
performance was fueled by high single digit growth in brand Coca-Cola, and double digit Coke Zero growth. Sprite and
Fanta also contributed to growth in the quarter in Europe.
The Eurasia and Africa group grew 4%, cycling 11%, as we maintained focus on broadening distribution, honing our
marking efforts, and strengthening brand loyalty in the more than 80 countries that make up our business in this
dynamic region. Volume growth grew 4%, led by brand Coca-Cola which grew 3% and Sprite, which grew 4%.
Still beverage volume grew 3% in the quarter. The Eurasia and Africa group maintained volume share in nonalcoholic,
ready-to-drink beverages while growing volume share in sparkling beverages and juice and juice drinks. Both the
Middle East and North Africa business unit and the Central East and West Africa business unit maintained their strong
first half volume performance in the third quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, the Eurasia and Africa group is up high single digits, cycling 10% growth and has been an
important contributor to our year-to-date performance.
Our Pacific Group delivered 5% growth in the quarter, improving sequentially from the second quarter and cycling 4%
from the prior year quarter. Sparkling beverages led with 5% growth as brand Coca-Cola delivered 7% growth and

Sprite grew 5%. Still beverage volume also grew 5% in the quarter, while cycling 7% growth.
As noted, our second – as noted during our second quarter call, we anticipated a better second half of the year in China,
and I'm pleased to report that we were able to deliver 9% volume growth in the quarter, led by 8% growth in sparkling
beverages. Earlier this year, we began to evolve our strategies in China, to reflect the current economic and competitive
environment, and also to position ourselves for continued sustainable profit growth.
Our business in India delivered 6% growth in the quarter, cycling double digits. We achieved this growth while
increasing prices across our juice brands to offset higher cost of goods. In addition, volume grew by strong double
digits in September, once the impact of the extended monsoons abated. Brand Coca-Cola again led the way with 22%
growth in the quarter.
We are pleased with these results and with our solid volume and value share gains across sparkling and still beverages
in India. Looking ahead, we have strong marketing programs planned for the fourth quarter of this year, and into next
year. I'm particularly excited about two iconic marketing programs that will ignite consumer passions across key
markets. Specifically, the Olympic torch relay recently departed from ancient Olympia as it begins its relay journey
across Russia. And the FIFA World Cup trophy tour is also underway with stops planned in 89 countries where
passions for football run high.
Further, throughout our company's history, we have always been at the forefront of cultural change, informing the
conversation, inspiring our youth to act, and bringing resources to our local communities all across the world. This
legacy has framed our thinking about forging effective and lasting partnerships, creating shared value and making a
positive societal difference in areas that are of critical importance to our business, specifically water, women, and well
being.
Returning to our global performance, we benefited from marked sequential improvement in several key markets. We
achieved robust and widespread growth of our flagship brand and we delivered solid financial results. Our efforts to
enhance the health of our system are working, as evidenced by our broad based growth, improving execution, and
strong cash generation.
At the same time, we also acknowledge that we have more work to do, as we will no doubt face headwinds as we work
towards our 2020 Vision. Nevertheless, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry is a vibrant and rewarding
business to compete in and our business has consistently grown, and I can assure you that the underlying forces that
shaped our 2020 Vision just a few years ago remain very much intact today. Together with our global system partners,
our roadmap is enabling us to strategically invest both through good times and challenging times to deliver long-term
sustainable performance.
I'll now turn the call over to Gary.
Gary P. Fayard
Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results underscore several key points. First, the
global economy is still struggling to recover with increasing volatility across emerging markets. Second, slowing
economic growth clearly impacted consumer spending and overall nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry growth in the
quarter, and third, in spite of these macro trends, our strategies and solid execution enabled us to once again capture
global value share and to deliver solid financial performance.
As Muhtar said, we grew our global volume 2% in the quarter, while at the same time, delivering solid financial results.
While we are pleased with this sequential volume improvement, we remain focused on further advancing our volume
growth trajectory over time. Concentrate sales were slightly below unit case volume growth in the quarter, but were in
line with unit case sales year-to-date.
Moving on to our financial results, each of our geographic operating units contributed to comparable currency neutral
operating income growth in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral net revenues were even, both in the quarter and

year-to-date. Excluding the impact of structural items, this will primarily be the Philippines and the Brazil bottler, net
revenues increased 4% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. We realized a healthy 2% global price/mix for the quarter,
and 1% price/mix year-to-date. Importantly year-to-date price/mix was positive across each of our geographies with the
exception of the Pacific due to geographic mix.
Also as you know we consolidated the Innocent brands in Europe, which helped our price/mix in the quarter but just to
be clear our global price/mix was 2% without the Innocent brand's benefit. As expected, our gross margins moderated
somewhat this quarter due to geographic mix. We expect our full year gross margins to be relatively in line with our
year-to-date comparable gross margins.
Excluding the impact of structural items, we achieved 5 points of favorable operating expense leverage for the quarter,
while we continued to support our brands through increased marketing investments. Our operating expense leverage
now stands at 3 points year-to-date, and we expect low single digit leverage for the full year. As a reminder, we are
cycling the reversal of expenses related to one of our long-term incentive plans in the fourth quarter of last year.
Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter and 5% year-to-date, excluding the impact
of the structural items operating income grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Therefore, we now expect our full
year operating income to be generally in line with our year-to-date performance. On a comparable basis, the impact of
currency was a 5% headwind on this quarter's operating income results, a full point more than we expected due to the –
and this is due to the weakening of many of the emerging market currencies. We now anticipate continued currency
headwinds will have an unfavorable impact on operating income in the 5% to 6% range in the fourth quarter.
Comparable earnings per share grew 4% in the third quarter despite currency headwinds of about 5%. Year-to-date
comparable earnings per share also grew 4% despite headwinds from currency of about 4%. We generated $7.7 billion
in cash from operations year-to-date and have repurchased $2.7 billion of our shares in line with our plans to
repurchase $3 billion to $3.5 billion this year.
Equity income came in lower than in the prior year quarter, due to the ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions
around the world. We expect equity income will continue to be impacted by these factors.
Let me now provide you just with a couple of reminders as we look to the balance of the year. Looking forward as
mentioned in our second quarter earnings call, we anticipate the bottling transactions, including the impact of the
deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations early in the third quarter, will have a 3% structural impact on our
full year 2013 net revenues. Likewise our full year operating income results should see a 1% negative structural impact.
In closing, we are strategically navigating through these challenging macroeconomic times, investing in our business to
steadily strengthen our competitive position, and to drive balanced growth and long-term sustainable performance.
Operator, we are now ready for the questions.

<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Muhtar, I was hoping for more granularity on emerging markets, given the Q3 slowdown,
particularly in Latin America, which was in contrast to improvement we saw in China and India. So, can you give us an
update on the macro environment as you look around the world? And also some of the strategies you mentioned you
were implementing. Are you gaining traction at this point from a market share standpoint, and should we expect to see

volume performance in emerging markets improve as we look out going forward from here?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Dara, good morning. I think first it's important to realize that there's different
timing across the world to some of the volatility in macroeconomics, and particularly, what's interesting for us, which is
disposable incomes. So, I think China has already had a slowdown and is beginning to recover. We see that, and there's
always also a lag between the GDP per capitas and disposable incomes. So, also important to realize that they don't all
happen at the same time. The numbers don't correspond to each other, one-to-one. And so we do see an improvement in
Southeast Asia in parts of – certainly China, where things have stabilized and things – you know, people are beginning
to normalize their sort of habits.
And, you know, in the last sort of three months, four months, we have seen a flight of currency from emerging markets,
market stock exchanges and countries back into North America. That's had impact on disposable incomes in Latin
America, in Eurasia, in countries like Turkey and certain other countries in North Africa. So, yes, those – and you can
track stock exchange indexes and you can track disposable income growth or slowdown. They're all very related and
we do see that the world is not just one city or one sort of element of volatility. There's different pockets of volatility
happening at the same time. And what we are fortunate with is a great portfolio. A wonderful portfolio, where, you
know, India slowed down, maybe 7 months, 8months, 9 months ago. We see some comeback in terms of disposable
incomes I'm talking about, and China is the same, Southeast Asia – ASEAN similar. Philippines also pretty much in
that camp. And then we certainly also see that we still got some headwinds maybe in other parts of the world. So there
is some tailwinds coming and some headwinds coming, and we continue to invest in our brands. And when you look at
our performance, you know, we have sequential improvement in many parts of the world, particularly, you know, when
you look at places like India, places like China, ASEAN, even also developed markets such as Australia and also South
Africa.
And our African continent, I haven't mentioned that. Countries that are in Sub-Saharan Africa, that are usually sort of
south of 80 per capita, again, grew in a very healthy manner this past quarter, about 5% up, and we expect Africa to
continue to generate good results and economies in Africa seem to be pretty buoyant and seem not to be too impacted,
but, of course, they are at a very slow level of their per capita development as well. I hope that helps.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Yes, that's helpful. And then some of the strategies you're implementing, do you think it's
helping to drive an improvement in market growth at all, or drive market share gains and do you feel comfortable that
emerging markets trends have bottomed in general at this point, and we should see some improvement going forward
or is it still too volatile to call right now?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I think it's pretty – as I said, different pockets showing different results, but we have a
very, very sharp focus on – I was, you know, down in Latin America recently a month ago. I visited many countries in
Africa recently as well as in Asia, that we have an incredibly sharp focus on brand price pack channel architecture, new
price points, lower price points, more focus on affordability, more focus on returnable packs and smaller packs,
individual packs that help continue to keep the drinkers base growing, which is key and essential to when economies
also start turning up and when disposable incomes start heading north.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Great. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Muhtar, critics have said the Coke's growth story is over; reflected in the stock price pointing to
the slowing emerging market growth you were just talking about, declines in Diet soft drinks. Some say the pricing in
the US is irrational and an inability to grow in big markets like US and Mexico. Can you explain why you still see solid

growth ahead for the company, and what the company is doing in terms of innovation, productivity, you mentioned
price pack earlier to drive that growth, and why the critics who declared the growth story is over are wrong. Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, thanks, Bill. First, philosophically, you know, from a strategic vantage point, the
whole story of balanced growth we believe is still very intact. Balance being growth in Western markets, growth in
emerging markets, balance being growth in sparkling and growth in still beverages. And you see that happening in this
past quarter as well. So, we've grown in markets like the United States, which we believe is a long-term growth market.
I mean, when you think about it, 14 of the last – of the last 14 consecutive quarters, we have grown in all but one of
them. And now we've generated, again, 2% growth with 2% growth of brand Coca-Cola.
So we – Australia grew. Many important markets in Western Europe grew. Germany grew again 3%. Countries in
Northwest Europe generated good healthy growth for us. So – and then emerging markets. Yes, there's some headwinds
that are happening in the emerging markets, but we believe they are very temporary. The whole demographic, the
whole investment, the whole story of 1 billion new middle class still holds very strong in our opinion, by 2020 over this
past decade that we are in – this decade that we are in, a billion new middle class. That bodes very well for the industry
we are in, and we believe we can continue to generate very healthy good growth. We believe we can continue to
generate very healthy price earnings. I mean, I'm sorry, price/mix, and we believe that therefore in this – like in this
past quarter, which was where we did see a lot of headwinds, we generated 4% revenue growth and 8% currency
neutral operating income growth. And we believe that there's – we had a lot of headwinds.
So as economies begin to move, I think we'll see a lot of improvement, and I will ask Ahmet as well to make some
comments on this and if need be also ask Steve to add his commentary.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thank you, Muhtar. Bill, you mentioned a few items. I will just focus on a couple of them.
Emerging markets, as you would know, if you look at the history that it goes through cycles. So, it has a cycle of, you
know, years and years of growth and every now and then you have economic headwinds and you manage through that.
But the emerging growth, the emerging markets growth economically certainly, isn't over and we have a formula,
which pretty much closely shows that as personal consumption grows, we actually grow with it.
Now, having said that, in some of the emerging markets where there might be personal consumption and macro
headwinds, we could still grow, like India because we have very low per caps, and we have significant investments in,
you know, feet on the street, infrastructure, brands, we're just really building our business and India showed that again
this year.
So that's what I would say about your comment of the emerging markets. The growth story there is far from over for a
long time to come.
And I guess the rest were about US pricing and decline in soft drinks. So maybe I should just pass that on to Steve.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yeah, thanks, Ahmet. First, I'd just underscore on the broader question what Muhtar said in his
prepared remarks that in this quarter we delivered the highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter. So,
I think that bodes well for our growth story going forward. But with regards to our North America pricing, which I
heard you ask Bill, and in particular sparkling price, we feel good about delivering positive price/mix in the quarter of
plus 1% in line with our strategy to consistently earn at least 1 to 2 points of sparkling with consumers.
The US Coke system remains committed to taking rationale pricing, and we've done this very well over the past several
years.
In fact, we achieved 2 to 3 points of price/mix in sparkling beverages and across our total portfolio in both 2011 and
2012. Year-to-date, we're 2% sparkling price/mix, which we feel good about. But I think it's important to remember,
we've always said that we're going to focus on consumer-centric pricing.
And if I can give you an example of that, the average price today of an 8-ounce serving of Coca-Cola is $0.25, exactly
$0.25. This is up over 5% versus 2 years ago and it's up nearly 10% versus three years ago, which compares very
favorably to the US inflation market. And this tells me really three things: First, at $0.25, we do not have an
affordability issue. Coca-Cola remains a very affordable indulgence. Two, we have been able to earn price above

inflation in the United States, and three, we still have plenty of room to continue to take price.
But now addressing the third quarter in particular, we acknowledge we did strategically invest in select promotional
activity in the back half of the summer through the Labor Day holiday. Given that we essentially didn't have much of a
4th of July holiday and Memorial Day holiday, this Labor Day acted much more like a 4th of July holiday. But these
investments were tied to specific occasion-based brands and packages to help drive incremental household penetration,
which they did, attract more consumers into the category, which happened and is very much in line with our long
standing North American strategy.
And all of these activities that we did, all of them to take price in the marketplace, I think, set us up very well to take
more price in this quarter and going into 2014. So we are very confident that the pricing environment in North America
remains very rational and that we'll be able to continue to earn price in the marketplace in this quarter and going
forward in the next year.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, just let me roundup that question with one final remark, Bill, and that is that once
again, if you take our world average per capita of around 90, just under 90, and you take the most populous nations of
the world that are less than half of that per capita, India, China, Indonesia, way below that number, way below half of
that number, we believe there's – and many other parts of the world as well, in Africa, the youngest billion, we believe
that there's – we believe the critics, whoever they are, are wrong. I don't understand that sentiment. We are growing,
while others are not at the moment, and our business and balanced portfolio is built for times like these, so we see this
as a time of opportunity.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Hey, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: A question about Mexico and excise taxes. I guess it's been in the press over the last,
especially more so over the last couple of weeks and in speaking to some of your bottling partners in Mexico
specifically, it seems like they are sort of more resigned to the potential that it's going to be a reality. So, I guess if you
could talk a little bit about just how you see the situation unfolding in Mexico, and to the extent that we get – or you get
an excise tax increase, how you plan to – or do you plan to do anything differently in Mexico in response to it? Maybe
some thoughts about elasticity and then finally just any concern that there's spillover into other markets, would also be
helpful.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, look, Bryan, firstly, let me just address that by saying regressive taxes do not work,
period and wherever we have seen them being implemented, in some cases, they have been taken away by the
government after two years or three years. Basically, like in Denmark, they are not working wherever else they have
been implemented, and so the consumer suffers in the end. It's proven time and time after again.
We have made our case to the government. We have tremendous respect for the government of President Pena Nieto,
and we need to understand that – and we've made our case that this really does not have anything to do with health
policy. In order to address the health policy properly, we have to come and work together with government and with
civil society to raise the awareness and to create programs that really work, that really drive physical activity, and
therefore just a regressive, discriminatory tax on one part of the food industry just is not going to work and we are –
currently, that's all I would really like to say because the discussions are in progress, and I don't want to comment any
further.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Are there any preparations for – I guess just trying to understand, if it does become a reality,
do you have plans in place to deal with it if it does occur?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Look, I just don't want to comment on it at this moment. As I said, there's a lot of
discussions going on, and it would be wrong for me to publicly comment on any of those discussions and therefore,
we'll deal with whatever the result is in the most effective way. I can assure you that we will continue to prosper as a

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Faucher from JPMC. Your line is open.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you very much. Muhtar and Gary, you guys talked about the price/mix number
improving sequentially, which was good to see. So, Gary, I guess, can you talk a little bit about how you see this
playing out over the next sort of 12 months to 24 months, where you have the negative geographic mix offset by the –
sort of the positive mix on a per case basis is the bottler territories, where you own the bottler it gets better, like North
America, versus the absolute level of pricing. How should we look at those factors sort of competing against each other
to try and map something out?
And then one other housekeeping question, which was your comments on operating profit for the year, could you just
revise those and – or restate those, just because there was some confusion about whether it was currency neutral or
non-currency neutral, what have you? Thanks.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Okay, John, let me see how well I can do on this and then you can come back and ask.
But, first, going to price/mix, and just as a reprise in general on price/mix, generally what we see – and I'm going to
take this in steps – generally what we see is you see pricing, so you see rate and mix, positive rate and mix would be
positive across almost all of the groups. You would then see negative – generally you would see negative geographic
mix, and it's basically a function of higher growth in emerging market countries than developed market countries,
which would give you a negative geographic mix.
Then on top of that – and you are absolutely right – then where we own bottlers, and they're growing, that gives you
then a positive price/mix because they're finished products versus concentrate.
So, a couple things, so, if you go back to the second quarter, I talked about margins, and I thought margins would
moderate because of geographic mix, and in the follow-up to a question as I remember, I said because we expect North
America to actually perform better and that will actually hurt margins because it's a finished product business, where
margins are lower. But it helps price/mix, and what you are seeing today is well price/mix in America was even for the
quarter. We are getting positive price/mix from our finished product businesses. Going forward, and not talking about
specifically about 2014 because we are still in the midst of planning 2014, and we'll give you a full review on our views
on next year in the February call. We are planning to take appropriate pricing that would – and Steve referred to taking
pricing in North America as well. So, we are expecting to take pricing. So going forward, what I would expect to see is
that we should have a positive in rate going forward. We should have a positive in mix going forward. We should have
a positive from finished products going forward, and we should have a negative from geographic mix.
So that's the kind of – and if you add all of that up, it should be a positive price/mix, and that's what we would expect
and that's what we would expect is what's in our long-term earnings growth model is positive price/mix long-term.
Now, let me see if I can turn to operating income. When I was talking about operating income, it was definitely
currency neutral. It was ex-structural. So let's be very clear on both of those, currency neutral and ex-structural. So,
operating income was 8% currency neutral, ex-structural for the quarter and 6% year-to-date currency neutral

ex-structural. And what I said was, we now expect the full year to be generally in line with the first half of the year. So
somewhere in that ballpark and that is a net of currency neutral and net of the structural impact, because I can tell you
with the structural impact, you know, it would – it's a point of negative structural impact and so that would take our
year-to-date from 6% to 5%, for example. So just to be clear, ex-structural, currency neutral.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay, so, and I'm not trying to trick you into guidance or anything here, but you know, it
basically sounds like you're saying sort of currency neutral, ex-structural, mid-single digits year-to-date, so, therefore
that implies to Q4, but then you talked about the currency impact, so, as we are looking at those should basically offset
to, sort of, get you to like slight operating profit growth for the quarter?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, well without giving guidance. What we are basically saying is that the full year, we
think ex-structural and ex-currency, it ought to be in line pretty much with where we are year-to-date.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Okay.

Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks, good morning. I had one follow-up question on North America and then a question
about Europe. So, in North America, you know, there's been a lot written about the decline that we've seen in Diet
sodas, and Steve, I'm not sure if you went through that and whether you shared some of the similar concerns that people
have written about the decline in Diets and, you know, sort of your perspective on whether the artificial sweetener issue
is impacting the category at all, and kind of from your strategy in dealing with that situation.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Steve, you want to address that.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yeah, thanks Judy. First, I didn't talk specifically about Diet. I would underscore that we have
a very wide portfolio in North America, led by brand Coca-Cola, which is twice the size of Diet Coke and brand
Coca-Cola, as you know, grew 2% in the quarter, which we are very pleased with.
Diet Coke is like a lot of Diet products in the United States, and not just beverages but across the whole array of food,
are under a bit of pressure as people are questioning ingredients, ingredient safety, and so forth. But we believe very
strongly in the future of Diet Coke, the number two sparkling brand in the United States. We've got terrific programs
against it. We are actually seeing increased incidents in the past quarter between 19 -year-olds and 24-year-olds. We
think a lot of that has to do with the exciting new promotions with Taylor Swift, some of the new packaging we are
bringing to the marketplace, and increased focus on Diet Coke. But there are headwinds. There are headwinds that we
are facing, and we face headwinds in a lot of different areas, a lot of different places, and this is just one of them. But,
you know, last year it became the second best selling sparkling in the United States and we are continuing to focus on
it.
Coke Zero, also a part of our zero calorie portfolio, grew mid-single digits in the quarter. So, we are very happy about
that. We have got a great program around Coke Zero. College Game Day just kicked off. It's really becoming ever
more relevant with young males. So we are confident that throughout our whole portfolio, we are offering consumers
exactly what they want, when they want it, how they want it, at the right prices that they want it, and we will continue
to focus on any of the headwinds around Diet Coke, and we are confident it has a bright future in this country.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just on Europe, the improvement that we saw in Northwest Europe and
Germany as well, I guess to what do you attribute that to, perhaps weather getting much better in the quarter as opposed
to, you know, the macros and consumers and kind of what you guys are doing to really rejuvenate growth in those
markets?

<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Well, Judy, this is Muhtar. First, I think it is important to understand that, and I've said
this in the past, that economies are performing at a different pace in the continent of Europe. Not everywhere is really
bad, not everywhere is really good. And so you still have very challenging consumer sentiments in Spain, in Italy, in
Greece, in Portugal, in the south, in Southeast Europe in what used to be termed as the Balkans and Romania, Bulgaria,
former Yugoslavia. It's a very challenging environment. And then you've got a better environment in Northwest Europe
and then certainly the best environment still in Germany. And so based on those, our business also reflects some of
those conditions, and so it's a pretty good mirror, actually.
And I will ask Irial to comment on Germany, you know, and why, you know, we have been consistently performing in
Germany and growing our business and, again, there's tremendous sequential improvement versus the first half in many
countries of Northwest Europe and Scandinavia and also Northwest European countries. Irial?
<A - Irial Finan>: Thanks, Muhtar. And this actually goes back to one of the earlier questions. I think in Germany,
where you've got an economy that's doing okay, where you've got actually really good marketing married up with
continued excellent execution, and you bring all that together and you get great results. And for me in Germany, it
gives me great confidence about the future of our business, quite frankly, because we are seeing where we've put in the
hard work, where we do the right things in the business, we do get good results. And Germany is just an example of
what can happen, quite frankly in many markets around the world as the economies turn and improve.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Ahmet, do you want to comment on that?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yes. I just wanted to- hi, Judy. I just wanted to add to the others that we had a very, very
strong Share a Coke campaign across Europe this summer that worked extremely well. We are ever more closely
aligned with our bottling partners, really driving growth, and just on the macro, I would like to add that there's a clear
divergence between north and south. So north continues to do better and south continues to do worse. So, our business
in the north certainly is reflective of that.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, can you just talk about the timing of some of the refranchise in the US, because I think we
talked a lot about it earlier in the year, and it's kind of hit a lull recently. And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think it's on target as we have said – reported previously, where we make very
sound and significant and good progress in discussions with some of our existing partners as well as discussions
ongoing with some other prospective partners. So, we are on target, if not a little bit ahead, and I think you will hear
more about it in the coming sort of period ahead of us. And I will ask Steve just to maybe shed some more light on it.
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yes, thanks, Muhtar. Bill, I mean the one thing I would really underscore is, we absolutely
have not hit a lull. Don't take the absence of public commentary to mean that we are not making very good, very
constructive progress. All our bottling partners, both current and prospective, are extremely excited about this business
in the United States, about the opportunity to continue to be franchise partners in the United States, to grow the
business in the United States, and we are making very exciting progress, and we will have more to report in the coming
months.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks so much. And then just on the SG&A cost, can you just give us a little bit more
color on, you know, what drove some pretty significant efficiencies, which is obviously great, but, you know, was the
advertising ratio flat or up and then maybe what drove some of the other improvements on that line item?

<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Talking about productivity, Bill?
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Yeah, productivity and SG&A broadly. Yeah.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Gary? You want to speak on this?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Sure, Bill. Yeah, within the quarter we continue to invest in marketing, so marketing is
actually up in the quarter and up year-to-date. We had significant productivity savings in the quarter. We have some
previously announced productivity programs that we announced back in 2012. Those 2012 programs will go through
2015 and really focused around productivity and then reinvesting those back into the business. They were focused on
information systems, marketing, supply chain, innovation, operational excellence, that sort of thing.
I can tell you – we'll give you a full update on it at the year-end call, so I can give you the full year. But we are making
very good progress against the goals, and you will see that on the February call when we go through a full update. But,
and we've got hard savings and soft savings. So, let me give you some examples of what's happening and it's adding
into the productivity and some of the leverage that you are seeing. So, in things like supply chain, if you buy things
cheaper – hard savings, and we are doing a lot around supply chain and actually getting a lot of hard savings and those
you are seeing being reflected.
In marketing, if you can buy media cheaper, then we just buy more media, basically that's what we are doing. So, we
are reinvesting back into marketing and being able to buy more media, you know, for the same price, if you will. So as
I say, we will give you a full update on all the productivity programs in February at our year-end call. But we're making
excellent progress and you are seeing a lot of that. This was coming through the G&A line, with, as I say, within that
marketing – SG&A marketing being up for the quarter and year-to-date.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Got you. Was there any benefit from the incentive compensation accruals – either this quarter
or maybe end of the fourth quarter as well?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Very, very little. There's a huge cycling of last year in the fourth quarter, as I've mentioned
earlier, but there's very little – I mean, there's a little bit but nothing of significance in the quarter this year.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi, guys, thanks. Just one quick thing and then a real question. So, I just want to underscore
something again, because it's a key controversy, and look, I will be fair. I think what Steve said a moment ago was
music to a lot of investors' ears, and I want to just replay it to make sure I understand. So did you say that the past
couple of months in North America from a price, from an investment perspective, were little bit more of a blip and that
we should expect something like higher pricing that we saw in 2011 and 2012 going forward in North America?
<A - Steve Cahillane>: Yeah. Thanks, Ali. I think that's a fair interpretation of what I said. This was a very different
summer. It's been a difficult year, starting with the fiscal cliff, and sequestration, and payroll taxes and so forth, and
then the summer was very sluggish. And it's very important in our business to keep consumers engaged with our
brands, to make sure that we are in the households, to make sure that teens are being recruited and so Labor Day acted
very much like a 4th of July or a Memorial Day, whereas typically it would not. It would be the end of summer and
Labor Day acted more like the only summer. So, it was more promotional than you would have seen. It would be more
promotional than what we would expect going forward, but those things happen from time-to-time. And we think that
the pricing environment will continue to be very strong, very rationale, and because of all the investments we're making
in our brands, we feel that we have the opportunity to earn even more price going forward in the marketplace and that

would be absolutely our intention to do that.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. That makes perfect sense.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Ali, I just want to add one thing. In terms of the Nielsen data, yes, that is exactly the
reflection, but don't – you know, underestimate, we took very healthy pricing in [ph] ICEE (53:41) also in the quarter,
and so overall, that's how you get to the one price/mix positive on sparkling, and so don't let that point go unnoticed at
the moment.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. And then a broader question, and I don't know how
often you revisit this, but what do you think the company has to grow volumes between now and 2020 to deliver on the
2020 Vision, given some of the recent slowdown in volumes? And I guess in that context, do you think as a company
you have to acquire more to reach that vision?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I'd say that first, we believe that our long-term growth model with appropriate mix which
we believe we can take, and we can generate, it would definitely get us to our 2020 Vision of – from a system revenue
point of view of doubling our business with the base of 2010. So that is the sort of trajectory, if you like, and we are on
track in terms of moving ahead to doing – achieving our goal. The second piece is we will always be looking for any
kind of bolt-on acquisitions that may make sense, but that's the extent of what I would say that right now we would be
looking at, bolt-on acquisitions and that's sort of, if there's an opportunity, we will look at it seriously.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: And from the difference of volume versus price/mix to reach the system doubling goal, has that
shifted at all between the two?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Sorry. Say that again.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Well, so to double the system sales by 2020, there's perhaps an ingoing assumption of what would
be from volume and what would be from price/mix. Has the recent global slowdown shifted that mix at all between
volume growth and price/mix growth to reach the doubling of sales?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I don't think materially. If you look at our long-term growth, sort of corridor of volume
plus what we have been achieving, I think the balance is still there.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: The same as it used to be.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Thanks very much. Very helpful.

Thank you. Our next question is from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi, thanks, good morning. First question on China, can you talk about the acceleration,
the pickup in volumes there, whether that was driven by any change in pricing or promotional levels and what your
outlook kind of a normalized run rate, because that region has been just so lumpy in terms of volume growth, kind of as
we go into 2014, where's a base case of volume growth?
And then my second question is, looking at the buyback program, the stock is on track for two years of relative
underperformance, and we haven't seen that for a while, and yet your target for buybacks hasn't changed since the
beginning of the year. So, I'm kind of surprised with the balance sheet you have, with the weakness in the stock and
certainly, Muhtar, with your resounding confidence about the long-term outlook, you are not getting more aggressive
on the buy back here. Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I will have Ahmet just comment on China. Then maybe Gary can finish off the
second part of the question sure.

<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Wendy. You might remember that in our last call, we talked about the fact that we
were evolving both our organization and our strategy in China, and what we see in the third quarter really encourages
us, that we had not only 9% growth in total, but also 8% growth in sparkling. And that pretty much delivers on the
expectation that we have said, that we would expect sequential improvement from the first half results in the second
half of this year, and we expect that sequential improvement from the first half results to continue into 2014.
To your question on pricing promotion, we did not have any significant marked pricing promotions in the marketplace.
It was basically a combination of A, beginning to implement parts of our new strategy in the marketplace; B, the same
Share a Coke promotion as we are scaling up these wonderful global assets in all parts of the world. And then our new
team beginning to gel together, connecting with our bottling system, and really improving execution. So, we are
encouraged by those results, and we expect to continue to, as I said, improve sequentially from the first half results.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Okay, Gary?
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, Wendy, relative to share repurchase, let me first – let me just start with a preface that
don't particularly agree with you on saying our share price has relatively underperformed for the last two years, but,
absent that, a couple of thoughts on share repurchase. Our view on share repurchase is that share repurchase is value
neutral. It is not something that grows value. It does for the short-term, holder, because maybe you can get a bump in
the share price but for the long-term holder, it is not something that's value enhancing. It is much more like a cash
efficient dividend which is the way we treat it and that our priorities for cash are number one to reinvest in the business,
to grow the business. That would include bolt-on acquisitions, et cetera. Number two would be dividends, which we
have increased for the last 51 years, 10% this year. And third, excess cash would be put into share repurchase, and just
because we don't need the cash in the business. So it's a return of cash to shareholders.
But leveraging the balance sheet to do something that we would view as value neutral, we don't think is the right thing
to do. So, we continue to just perform exactly in line with the targets that we set at the beginning of the year. Thanks.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Thank you.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial, and Jackson. We delivered sound third quarter results within an ongoing
challenged macroeconomic environment. While we saw sequential improvement in the business, we remain
constructively discontent and resolutely focused on further advancing our growth trajectory. Our 2020 Vision and
long-term strategies remain firmly intact, and together with our global bottling partners, we are investing in our brands
and our capabilities to further strengthen our system and to drive sustainable growth and value. As always, we thank
you for your interest, your investment in our company, and for joining us this morning.
