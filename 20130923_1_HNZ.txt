Good morning. My name is Georgie, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the H.J. Heinz Company First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. The listen-only call is being
recorded at the request of the H.J. Heinz Company.
I would now like to turn the call over to Marcos Romaneiro, Senior Vice President, Global Finance. Mr. Romaneiro,
you may now begin your conference.
Marcos Romaneiro
Good morning, and welcome to the Heinz first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. I'm Marcos Romaneiro,
Senior Vice President, Global Finance, and I'm here with Paulo Basílio, Chief Financial Officer.
Today's presentations include forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Securities Law, which are based on
current expectations subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, which are not a guarantee of future
performance. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors including the Risk Factors section of our
Fiscal 2013 Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as
required by law. Our remarks will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the GAAP
numbers in our recent 10-Q filing and allow for consistent period-to-period comparison of the business.
Our 10-K and 10-Q are available on the Investor Relations page at heinz.com. Heinz first fiscal quarter includes a
completion of the merger agreement and the commencement of our strategic initiatives to simplify and streamline the
organization to drive future growth. Together, these two events unfavorably impacted operating income by more than
$600 million in the quarter.
Additionally, cash flow was reduced by $577 million of one-time deal related costs with significant changes to the
balance sheet as well. Paulo and I are pleased to provide you with additional information on the quarter, and Paulo will
conclude the call with a few comments on our expectations for the year.
The merger was completed on June 7 and the company's former shareholders received $72.50 in cash for each share of
common stock. The total consideration paid was approximately $29 billion including the assumption of the company's
outstanding debt. This was funded through a combination of equity contribution of $16.5 billion and the proceeds from
long-term borrowings of $12.6 billion.
The merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting as required under U.S. GAAP. This resulted
in a new accounting basis for the company established during the quarter. As we review the 10-Q, you'll find that many

elements of our first quarter results are presented in two periods: predecessor, representing the portion of the quarter
before June 7 under the previous accounting basis; and successor, which reflect the post-merger accounting basis.
Our comments today will combine predecessor and successor periods to enable a more direct comparison to prior year
results.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Paulo Basílio.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Heinz's first fiscal quarter of 2014. The accounting
events reflecting Heinz's first quarter resulted in a complicated 10-Q. But we will do our best to simplify this report and
provide more perspective on the underlying business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, the company's total sales
were $2.6 billion, a 5.2% decrease versus prior year. This included a decrease in volume of 4.5%, partially offset by an
increasing price of 0.6%.
Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted sales by 0.9%, and we have a 0.2% unfavorable impact from divestures. The
volume decrease was driven by several factors. First is our strategic decision to realign the timing of promotional
activity in the U.S. and UK. We believe the full negative impact from this decision has been reflected in the first
quarter results, and we expect more favorable comparatives for the rest of the year. Other factors impacting volume
include the timing of sales in the UK related to Project Keystone go-live in May, and lacking one extra month of sales
in Brazil in fiscal 2013 as they conformed their accounting period to the company's fiscal period. Excluding the impact
of the factors I just described, volume decreased by about 1%.
In addition to volume, gross profit was unfavorably impacted by $345 million in additional cost of sales from the
step-up of inventory value from acquisition accounting. We expect the final $40 million from the step-up to impact the
second quarter, as the underlying inventory is sold to customers. Also, within gross profit, they incurred $8 million of
one-time costs related to factory, productivity initiatives in China and UK.
The step-up of intangible assets for the accounting basis change increased the amortization expense by $4 million.
However, these were offset by a decrease in pension expense, representing a purchase accounting adjustments to
deferred pension costs. Excluding this one-time impact, gross margin was comparable to the prior year.
Operating income reflects lower gross profit and a total of $252 million in merger related costs. Including professional
fees, severance and the acceleration of stock options and compensation plans from change in control provisions. This is
partially offset by lower marketing spend, including a decrease in non-working dollars and G&A expense, reflecting
reduced executive and headquarters compensation costs, driven by our [ph] strategic initiatives (06:29). Excluding this
one-time impact, operating margin was comparable to last year.
Below operating income, we incurred incremental interest expense of $73 million related to the new borrowings, which
was more than offset by a gain of $118 million of interest rate swap agreements entered into prior to the merger, to
mitigate exposure to variable rate debt.
In other income, the company recorded a loss of $129 million from the extinguishment of debt required to be paid upon
closing, as a result of the change in control. Income tax added $125 million to net income, reflecting the reported net
loss. Heinz received $104 million benefit from the impact on deferred taxes of a 300 basis point statutory tax related to
rate reduction in the UK, which was offset by $100 million non-cash tax expense on repatriated earnings.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Marcos to provide a few comments on – commentary on first quarter results by
geographic segment and on our first quarter cash flow.

Thank you, Paulo. Turning to North America Consumer Products, sales decreased by 7.1% due to volume. This reflects
the strategic decision to realign the promotional activity. We expect more favorable comparisons for the balance of the
year. Volume was also impacted by a decline in the frozen nutritional meal category, despite maintaining our volume
share.
Operating income decreased $157 million, or $17 million, excluding the inventory step-up adjustment. This was a
result of lower volumes partially offset by reduced SG&A, primarily from marketing spend. Excluding the step-up
adjustment, both gross margin and operating margins were comparable to prior year.
Looking next at the U.S. Foodservice segment, sales decreased $10 million, or 3.1%, reflecting a shift in promotional
activity along with weaker volume trends in the QSR industry. Operating income decreased $41 million, driven by the
negative impact of the inventory step-up adjustment and lower volumes. Excluding the inventory step-up, operating
income decreased by $7 million.
Turning to Europe. Sales decreased $51 million, or 6.5%, as strong performance in Russia was more than offset by soft
category sales in the UK, Italy and Continental Europe. UK volume was also impacted by the decision to realign
promotional activity and by sales timing related to the Project Keystone go-live in May.
As a category leader taking action to return the beans and kids' meal categories to growth, Heinz recently launched a
new ad campaign and packaging makeover, reminding parents that, For kids that are full of Beanz, it has to be Heinz.
This is an example of our strategy to reallocate non-working dollars to working media. Operating income decreased
$129 million, or $23 million, excluding the inventory step-up adjustment. This was a result of lower volumes partially
offset by reduced marketing spend.
Looking next at the Asia/Pacific region, sales decreased $12 million, or 1.9%, as unfavorable exchange translation rates
decreased sales by 3.3%. Volume and pricing both increased 0.7% driven by Indonesia and China. Operating income
decreased $52 million, but increased $6 million excluding the inventory step-up adjustment. This was a result of higher
gross profit and lower SG&A.
Finally, in our Rest of the World segment, sales decreased $17 million, or 6.1%. Volume decreased 4.9% as a result of
the one extra month reported in Brazil in the prior year, and pricing increased 2.3%, largely in Brazil, partially offset by
continuing hyperinflation in Venezuela. Excluding these two factors, volume would have increased by 8% and pricing
would have increased by 7.5%. Foreign exchange translation rates decreased sales by 3.5%.
Operating income decreased $10 million, or $3 million, excluding the inventory step-up adjustment driven by the
comparison to the extra month of the results in the prior year in Brazil and lower results in Venezuela.
Now turning to cash flow. Cash from operating activities was negative $646 million compared from cash from
operating activities of positive $49 million in the prior year quarter. This decrease was driven by unfavorable one-time
impact totaling $577 million along with unfavorable movements in accounts payable and income taxes, partially offset
by favorable movements in inventory.
Cash used for investing activities totaled $21.6 billion compared to $73 million in the prior year quarter. This change
reflects the merger consideration, net of cash on hand, of $21.5 billion. Capital spending was $129 million compared to
$84 million the prior year quarter, driven by an $88 million lease buyout under the change in control provisions. We
expect the full year CapEx to be lower than prior year level.
Cash provided by financing activities totaled $24.5 billion compared to cash used for financing activities of $243
million in the prior year quarter. The merger was funded by equity contributions totaling $16.5 billion, approximately
$9.5 billion of proceeds drawn under senior credit facilities, and $3.1 billion upon the issuance of the notes, partially
offset by $4.2 billion in debt repayment and $315 million in debt issuance costs.
At July 28, 2013, the company had total debt of $14.7 billion, and cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion. We expect
these cash and cash equivalents will be utilized to liquidate accrued obligations under the merger agreement, pay
preferred stock dividends, meet seasonal working capital requirements and fund future restructuring expenditures.

As a reminder, Berkshire Hathaway has an $8 billion preferred stock investment, which requires a 9% annual dividend.
Beginning with the next fiscal quarter, the company expects to make quarterly cash distributions to fund this dividend.
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Paulo for a few closing remarks.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio
Thank you, Marcos. We have made a lot of progress to establish the foundation and begin our journey to make Heinz
the most profitable food company in the world. On August 9, the company announced the beginning of a restructuring
plan that will result in a reduction of the number of corporate and field positions across the company's global business
segments.
The company is undertaking the restructuring as part of its ongoing cost reduction efforts with the goal of driving
efficiencies and creating fiscal resources that will be reinvested into the company's business. As of the date of the 10-Q
filing of September 11, we expect that 1,200 employees globally will be impacted by this restructuring and Heinz
expects to incur total charge of approximately $160 million in severance costs. We expect ongoing annual savings of
$150 million per year, which will begin to be visible in the second quarter, and will reach the full year run rate early
next calendar year.
At the same time, we will have moved up our [ph] F'18 presentation (13:48) in North America and now expect this to
be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2014. This will be a key enabler in driving efficiency and consistency
across our business. We also expect our recent launch of zero-based budgeting to drive more efficiencies and savings,
as we've seen as in other companies as well. We are also expanding the creation of global teams across procurement
and into other functions, from logistics to human resources to drive consistency and cost effectiveness.
We would like to thank you for participating in today's call and we look forward to sharing future updates. Have a great
day.
