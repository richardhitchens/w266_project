MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Express First Quarter 2014 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And also as a reminder, today's
teleconference is being recorded.
And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Mr. Rick Petrino. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard Petrino
Thank you, Tony. Welcome. We appreciate all of you joining us for today's call. The discussion contains certain
forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are based
on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and
earnings supplement which were filed in an 8-K report and in the company's other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the first quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement, and presentation
slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website
at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO who will review some key points
related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff
completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well, thanks, Rick. And good afternoon, everyone. Our performance this quarter showed strong earnings per share
growth driven by disciplined control of operating expenses. Another quarter of write-off rates near historical lows and a
strong balance sheet that has allowed us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of share
repurchases over the past year. We delivered 16% EPS growth despite having modestly lower revenue growth
sequentially, and these results highlighted once again the flexibility of our business model.
During the quarter, we took several important strategic steps, including rolling out our OptBlue program to expand the
coverage amongst smaller merchants, launching a new credit card, Amex EveryDay, designed to capture a greater share
of everyday consumer spending and expanding loyalty partner by introducing the program in Italy.
All of these steps are part of our broader strategy to reach new segments of the market, and make the American Express
brand more welcoming and more inclusive. Additionally, in the quarter, we were pleased that the Fed did not object to
the capital plan included in our 2014 CCAR submission. And we were also pleased to sign the formal agreement for the
Business Travel joint venture that we announced last year.
I'll discuss each of these items in more detail later on the call. To begin now with our financial results for Q1, as you
can see on Slide 2, FX adjusted billed business growth was 7%. This increase was the primary driver of our FX
adjusted revenue growth of 5%. Both of these growth rates represent a modest deceleration versus Q4 levels, which
occurred predominantly in the U.S. market, and was more pronounced among our U.S. small business and corporate
card members.
Net income of $1.4 billion was up 12%. The increase was driven by a combination of greater revenues and continued
tight control of operating expenses. Over the last four quarters, we repurchased more than $4 billion of our common
shares, that translated into a 4% decline in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. This then allowed us to
grow our diluted EPS by 16%.
These results call to mind the presentation we made at our Investor Day in February of last year when we laid out
several scenarios illustrating our ability to achieve our on average and over time earnings targets in a variety of
economic environments. Given the slower revenue growth we experienced during the first quarter, our strong capital
position and disciplined control of operating expenses were particularly important contributors to our financial
performance and helped drive the 16% increase in earnings per share to $1.33. These results also brought our ROE for
the period ending March 31 to 28%, above our on-average and overtime target of 25%.
Let's turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter, starting with
billed business on Slide 3. Overall billings remained solid with an FX adjusted increase of 7% versus 9% last quarter.
The sequentially slower growth was primarily in the U.S., where billings rose 6% in Q1, compared with 9% during Q4.
As I said a minute ago, this decline was more evident among our small business and corporate card members.
Additionally, volume growth rates appeared to be influenced in part by the severe winter weather. I would add that
while we are always cautious about drawing conclusion from intra-period trends, we were encouraged to see that U.S.
billings growth increased over the second half of the quarter as the weather improved.
Outside the U.S. where volumes continued to grow at a faster pace than the total company, billed business was up 10%
year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, growth rates across international regions were generally consistent
with the prior quarter and we did see a small uptick in EMEA from 6% in Q4 to 7% in the current quarter.
Turning to billed business by segment, on Slide 4, volumes continued to be particularly strong in GNS, up 15%
year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis. GNS growth continues to be highest in the JAPA region powered largely by
China and Japan. You do see across both the regional and segment view of our billings that the stronger U.S. dollar
continued to put downward pressure on our billings and hence revenue growth, as has been the case for the last five
quarters.

To give you a better sense of the drivers here, we have provided on Slide 5 some background on the major
concentrations of our billed business by international currency. The first row shows the approximate range of billed
business in each market as a percentage of total billed business. While the bottom row shows the year-over-year change
in that foreign currency, compared to the U.S. dollar. Overall, in Q1, this mix translated into approximately a 1
percentage point reduction in both billings and revenue growth.
Moving on now to loans, the other key revenue driver. We see on Slide 6 that loan balances grew 3% globally. U.S.
loans were up 4% from a year ago. Both of these growth rates are consistent with what we saw in Q4. I'll also note that
the total level of loans declined $3.2 billion versus Q4, which is in line with normal seasonal trends. We are pleased
that our loan growth in the U.S. continues to outpace the industry average.
Putting all the pieces of revenue together you see on Slide 7 the total revenue grew 4% on a reported basis, and 5% on
an FX-adjusted basis. Consistent with our spend-centric model, this growth was primarily driven by the discount
revenue growth that was generated by increased spending volumes. The other primary driver of revenue growth was an
8% increase in net interest income as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and an
increase in average loan balances.
One other point I would make about our revenues was that the sale of our publishing business last year continues to
depress the growth rate of other revenue, and impacted total revenue growth this quarter by a little less than 1%.
Turning now to provision. You can see on Slide 8 that our credit metrics remain near all-time lows. Worldwide lending
write-off and delinquency rates increased slightly in the quarter consistent with seasonal trends. As a reminder, our
objective is not necessarily to have the lowest possible write-off rates but is instead to achieve the best economics on
our portfolio. Therefore, at some point we would expect that lending write-off rates will increase somewhat from
today's low levels.
Slide 9 shows the trends in our lending reserve coverage levels. We believe that our coverage levels remain appropriate
given the risk level inherent in the portfolio. The fact that our delinquency rates have become more stable and our loan
portfolio is growing resulted in a smaller reserve release in the first quarter than a year ago.
The smaller reserve release more than offset the benefit from lower write-offs this year, and drove total provision of
17% compared to a year ago as you can see on Slide 10. The increase in the charge card provision in particular is
primarily due to a reserve build in the current year versus a reserve release in the prior year, along with higher card
member receivables. I'll also note that beginning this quarter we have reclassified fraud losses from provision for losses
to operating expenses in order to be more consistent with industry practices. This had the effect of lowering provision
and increasing operating expense, though we have reclassified prior periods for this change to keep everything
comparable.
Turning now to expenses. On Slide 11 you can see the total expenses were down 1% versus the prior year. Clearly,
maintaining disciplined control of expenses, particularly our operating expenses, was a key driver behind our strong
earnings performance during the quarter. To comment on a few specifics, you see that while marketing and promotion
was relatively flat in this quarter, going forward we do anticipate that investment levels will increase as we move into
Q2. For rewards expense, you see growth that was relatively consistent with our billed business growth during the
quarter.
The key story around expenses is obviously operating expenses. And we provide more detail on these on Slide 12
which shows a 4% decline in total operating expenses versus the prior year, with lower expenses seen across every line.
We did benefit from the timing of certain items this quarter. I would also remind you that the sale of our publishing
business continues to suppress operating expense growth by a little more than one percentage point.
That said, our operating expense decline this quarter went well beyond our goal for the full year of keeping growth to
less than 3% as you can see on Slide 13. Of course, we remain committed to our annual target. But we would not
expect to see similar declines in the remaining quarters of the year.

To turn more broadly now to our marketing and promotion efforts to grow our business, Slide 14 shows that these
expenses were relatively flat versus a year ago in Q1. As you can see on the chart, marketing and promotion is typically
lower during Q1, and ramps up beginning in Q2. We continued to see many attractive opportunities in the marketplace
including those for new customer and merchant acquisitions. To be specific, during the quarter, we launched Amex
EveryDay, a new credit card that rewards card members for how often they use the card, not just how much they spend.
The rewards structure incents card members to use the card for everyday purchases at the places they frequent most.
We are excited about the potential of the product to attract new customer segments to our franchise.
At our Investor Day in February, we introduced OptBlue, the next step in the evolution of our merchant acquiring
programs in the U.S. OptBlue gives small merchants the convenience of working with our network of third party
merchant acquirers who have the flexibility to give them one pricing construct, one monthly statement, one settlement
process, and one contract that covers all of the major card brands the merchant chooses to accept. In February, we
reported that we had signed six merchant acquirers to the program. Since then, we have continued to add partners and
believe OptBlue will provide a significant lift to our small merchant acquisition efforts as it is rolled out.
And we continue to target a portion of our investment for longer term opportunities. In particular, focusing on two large
initiatives. Reloadable Prepaid, our products that help you move and manage your money, and Loyalty Partner, our
rewards coalition program. These initiatives continue to ramp up as evidenced by this quarter's launch of our Loyalty
Partner program in Italy where we now have over 3.5 million collectors as of the end of March. A common theme
across all of these new initiatives is to have the American Express brand be more welcoming and inclusive, to be
meaningful to more people and more merchants.
To return now to the financials. Turning to Slide 15, you see that during the first quarter, our effective tax rate was
35.1%. This is the second quarter in a row that our tax rate has been somewhat higher than the recent past. Tax rates, as
you know, often fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, due to a variety of discrete items. More importantly, over the longer
term, we have seen a modest increase in our average effective tax rate primarily because of the changes in the
geographic mix of where we generate income. Additionally, in 2014, we are being impacted by certain changes in tax
laws, including the delay in the renewal of the active financing exemptions and the loss of the R&D tax credit. In the
past, we've mentioned that we expected our average effective tax rate to be in the low-30s range. When you look at the
trend, we now believe that our rate for the full year could be closer to the mid-30s.
As a last note on tax, I would point out that our tax rate in Q2 2013 was just 29.6%, which was unusually low and was
driven by certain discrete tax items, a challenge we will face in this year's second quarter, will be growing over the
impact of this lower rate.
Now let's turn to capital. The substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant degrees of
flexibility as shown on Slide 16. This quarter, we were able to return 73% of capital to shareholders, while also
strengthening our already strong capital ratios. We have worked hard to continue to strengthen all aspects of our capital
planning processes and last month we were pleased that the Fed did not object to the capital plan included in our 2014
CCAR submission. The good news from the Fed underscored both our balance sheet strength and our ability to remain
profitable under hypothetical severe stress scenarios, while also reflecting the strength of our overall planning
processes.
In fact, in the Fed severe scenario, we had the highest pre-tax income as a percentage of assets among all bank holding
companies and our Tier 1 common ratio both before and after capital actions was in the top quartile as you can see on
Slide 17.
These results gave us the leeway to increase our dividend by 13% beginning in the second quarter, and to repurchase up
to $3.4 billion of shares during the last three quarters of 2014 with up to an additional $1 billion during Q1 2015. That
represents a payout ratio that would be among the highest of all the CCAR participants. Our capital plans focus on
three important priorities, supporting our growth strategies, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning a
significant amount of the capital we generate to our shareholders.

One aspect of a strong balance sheet is maintaining a good mix of funding sources. And as you can see on Slide 18, we
have improved the diversity of our funding sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several
years. At this point, we believe our funding mix should be relatively stable going forward.
Before concluding, I want to provide an update on the plans for our Business Travel joint venture. As a reminder, our
Global Business Travel organization provides corporate customers with 24/7 support for travel in more than 135
countries. The agreement we signed this quarter entails our partners investing $900 million and the company
contributing the assets of our Business Travel business to the joint venture. The new structure should provide greater
resources to grow the business as a separate entity while maintaining important linkages with American Express.
We still plan for the transaction to close by the end of the second quarter. However, as is the case with most sizable
transactions, there are regulatory aspects that could delay the transaction-closing date. In fact, we could receive
regulatory approval very late in the second quarter which due to the complexity of the closing process, could push back
our second quarter earnings release date. We will keep you posted on the timing as we progress through the second
quarter.
More importantly, we expect to realize a sizable pre-tax gain which we currently estimate to be between $600 million
to $700 million prior to considering any costs related to the transaction. As we have said before, we plan to use a
substantial portion of any gain, net of transaction costs, to position the company for the future. This will include
supporting some of our newer growth initiatives including Amex EveryDay and Serve, as well as initiatives to increase
the efficiency of the organization, among other efforts.
When we release Q2 results, we plan to provide additional detail to give you a clearer understanding of our underlying
performance, the resulting gain on the transaction and associated costs, incremental spending in growth and other
initiatives as well as the expected impact the JV will have as we present our results in the future.
So in summary, coming back to our first quarter results, our strong earnings performance makes us feel good about the
flexibility of our business model. We generated EPS growth above our on average and overtime target driven by
disciplined control of operating expenses, our strong capital position and continued low write-off rates. While billings
and revenue growth slowed modestly from the fourth quarter, our financial performance was solid.
Looking forward, we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver significant
value to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.

<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah, good evening, guys. Thanks. Wanted to understand your thought process on the
spending trend in the quarter and how the shift of Easter into April affected the year-over-year comparison.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I guess I'd say a couple things about the spending trend. As I said, the sequential
decline was clearly stronger amongst the small business and corporate card member segment. I think it's also important
to point out that the sequential trend across the quarter and while that's something we're always very cautious as you
know, Craig, to draw too much attention to because there's inherent volatility when you look at any short-term period
but we did see the second half being stronger than the first.
And I would say in the first few days of April, we haven't seen anything that contradicts that general trend. We do lots
of internal analysis where we make a number of adjustments to how we look at our spending, considering exactly what
the days or the week are in each period, trying to use historical patterns, around holidays to make adjustments, and so
when I made comments about trends, they are considering all of those adjustments. All that said, there is clearly some
art to doing something like an adjustment for a holiday like Easter that moves around quite a bit from year to year. So
we take what we think is a fairly sophisticated approach to those adjustments but there's some subjectivity to it.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Yes. Good evening. Jeff, it looks like the March data suggests some slight uptick in
year-over-year loan growth in the U.S. Are you seeing any signs of increased consumer appetite for debt or are we just
still in a holding pattern?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, when you look at our loan growth, Don, it's actually been pretty consistent for the
last few quarters at around 3% to 4%. Globally, it was 3% this quarter, a little higher in the U.S. at 4%, and when you
look as you know, at the industry data, the industry's been kind of bouncing around flat. Sometimes down a little bit. I
think the February year-to-date numbers were up about a half a point in the U.S. So we've certainly been pleased by the
fact that our loan growth was holding steady at a little bit above that industry average. But frankly, you don't see
anything in our first quarter results that suggests any particular acceleration of that trend nor do we see it yet in the
industry data we've looked at.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Yeah, thanks. Jeff, I know you indicated that we shouldn't expect to see OpEx remain at this
kind of down 4% year-over-year level going forward but if you don't see a meaningful acceleration of a billed business
growth particularly with the modest headwind we have now from kind of higher tax rate, is it reasonable to think you'll
have to remain kind of well below the cap of 3% growth if you want to hit the on-average over time targets for EPS
growth this year?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think, Mark, that's a very good question and really goes to the flexibility of our
business model. And as I said in my earlier comments, I would actually take you and other folks back to the February
FCM when we showed that we have quite a number of levers that we can pull and have a history of pulling.
So certainly I would stick to the remarks I made a few minutes ago that the 4% decline year-over-year you see in the
first quarter is not indicative of what you'd expect – should expect the next couple quarters. There were some timing
items. But we are very committed to using the flexibility of our business model to achieve our earnings targets. I think
we have a pretty strong track record pulling various levers. And how much we let operating expenses and other

expenses grow over the remainder of this year and will certainly be heavily influenced by the economic environment
we see.
We don't try to outguess the economic forecasters and we build plans based on consensus GDP forecasts. The
consensus has actually come down slightly in the last 90 days but we certainly hope that that's wrong and we hope the
economy shows strong acceleration from here. But we think we have the flexibility in our business to react to whatever
environment we face.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Okay. That's helpful. In the earnings supplement there was a comment that indicated U.S.
Consumer Travel sales declined 7% year-over-year. Question I have is, is that a trend you expect to continue? Were
there any signs of weather affected that? And do you generate higher fees on the consumer side than you do on
business travel?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: You have very sharp eyes for someone who only had an hour to stare at the voluminous
amount of material we put out. So yes, you're correct. The Consumer Travel business shows a decline of about 7%.
That's actually driven by the fact that we sold a small part of that business that provided the packaged vacations. It was
such a small transaction not particularly material so we didn't bother to call it out last year but that actually is what the
loss of the revenue associated with that business or what drove the 7% decline.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Okay. Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. I guess just focusing on the volume trends going forward, I mean, when we think
about – and maybe even revenue growth. When we think about the trends going forward, are there any investments that
you're making that might start paying their dividends some time from second quarter onwards? And I guess broadly
speaking, when I look back in time, it seems like that 8% target hasn't been hit for a while. And I guess over the past
several years if not more, it's probably only been hit once. So can you just talk about conceptually how you, guys, think
about that revenue growth target going forward? Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, we continue, Sanjay, to think that the 8% revenue target is an appropriate target on
average over time in an non-average and over time economic environment. You are quite factually correct. But if you
look at the last few years, our revenue has tended to be a little bit below that level. I would point out that despite that,
we've shown much better performance on the EPS side due to the flexibility of the business model I just talked about.
We certainly have an economic environment over the last few years that has not gotten to the global economies or in
particular, the U.S. economy's long-term average trends. Certainly when you looked at the original GDP consensus
forecast for this year, they started to approach those long-term averages.
It appears based on what economic data is out there so far, that's probably not going to be the case the first quarter and
that is probably reflected somewhat in our results. But we would not in any way want to back off from the
appropriateness of that 8% target and we continue to believe that as the economy returns to more normal growth rates,
you will see us head towards that.
The other part of your question, we certainly are always balancing across our investment portfolio, things that are going
to help us in the near term, the medium term, and the long term. And we have made a number of incremental
investments and we did some stepped up investing towards the latter part of last year and those are things that as you –
if we follow normal patterns will help us as we get further into 2014 and beyond. You also, as I mentioned in my
remarks, saw us launch a few, a new product in the U.S. market EveryDay just at the end of the last quarter. We just
relaunched Serve at the end of last year. Those are things that, again, as you get later into 2014 and beyond, you will
begin to see meaningful contributions from.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.

Operator
Mr. Carcache, your line is open.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Hi. Can you – hi. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Hi. I had a question, a follow up on the JV gain. I believe that your reported expenses would
decrease significantly once you deconsolidate that Business Travel segment and start accounting for it under the equity
method. So I guess my first question, is that right? And then more broadly, how would that JV gain impact how we
should think about your commitment to that, you know, the operating expense growth below 3% through the end of this
year?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So both very good questions, Bill. So first, just maybe too it sounds like you've got –
maybe I should be clear for everyone. So as we execute on the joint venture transaction, that will shift our accounting
to the equity method which means that all you will see in our P&L will be our proportionate 50% share of the joint
venture's earnings each quarter. We won't report any revenues. We won't report any expenses. So that means you will
see the travel and other commission's revenue line come down significantly because that line, the predominant thing
that's in that line today are revenues from the Business Travel joint venture. And then most of the expenses of Business
Travel appear in the operating expense category.
So both of those assuming we hit our current timeline beginning in the third quarter, you will no longer see the
Business Travel amounts in those rows. We will, as we get closer – as we get to an actual close, give you the real
specifics on that. But that's the structure or the methodology if you will that everyone should keep in mind as they think
about what our financial statements will look like going forward.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay. Thank you. If I may, with one follow-up, can you talk about whether it's reasonable to
expect that you'll fully complete, you know, the buy-backs up to the full amount that was in your capital submission?
And then along those lines, can you talk about how you're thinking about the stock at these levels? I think in the past,
you guys have thought about capital return as capital return and haven't, I believe, been in so much focused on the
price, but I wanted to see if maybe you could update us on the thought process.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yep. So let me take those two questions. So certainly, we are committed to the amounts
that the Fed did not object to in our CCAR submission. There is a very small portion of the total each year that is a little
tricky at the end because what the Fed actually approves, not to get too into the details here, is a net repurchase amount,
net of the proceeds we get from option exercises. So as we go through the year and we get to the fourth quarter of the
CCAR year which is really the first quarter of the calendar year, we make an estimate of what we think the option
exercises are going be that year and then we conservatively size our share repurchase in that last quarter to match that.
So if you did all the math you'd see I think we were about $60 million or so below for the four quarter period what was
approved in our 2014 CCAR. That's just sort of, not to get into details too much as I said, but that's just the mechanics
of the process. We do our best to estimate what's going to happen but option exercises are not always the easiest thing
to exercise.
More importantly, and more broadly, you are correct and we do very much remain committed to the philosophy that we
believe we should have a well-capitalized and strong balance sheet. We believe we should pursue all the internal capital
spending and external opportunities that we think are prudent and offer good returns for our shareholders. But once we
are done with those two things, we don't believe we should sit on excess capital and so we will return capital once we

have hit those first two objectives to our shareholders through a mixture of dividends. And our dividend for the sector
and for our profile we think is a competitive dividend. And then we use share repurchase to return the remaining
capital.
We think we have a tremendous track record of growth over many, many years as a company. We continue to believe
we have many growth opportunities going forward. And so we believe it is a good financial proposition for our
shareholders to continue to return capital to our shareholders and we are not, therefore, very indifferent to modest
swings in the price. I would also just make the observation that our stock in a normal economic environment is not a
particularly volatile stock and so just not to figure greatly in our repurchase efforts. I guess as a last comment I just
remind you that mechanically as a public company, there's all kinds of constraints under which we buy back shares. So
practically you end up with more of an averaging in approach when you're returning the large amounts of capital that
we return to our shareholders.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Mr. Bruce,
your line is open. Please check your mute key. Okay. We have no response from that line. We'll move along. Next
question will come from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Good afternoon. Question, the GNS business continues to show very strong spend growth, 15%
been trending at that level. But the revenue growth is only showing this quarter at 5% in that segment. And I'd just like
– do you think that GNS can continue to grow with those types of rates? And shouldn't revenue – why is not revenue
growth matching the spend growth?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, a couple of comments. First, just a mechanical comment. Remember, what you
actually see in our statements is what we refer to as GNMS.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Which is a mixture of our GNS business and the proportionate share of the little over 20
countries where we do the proprietary acquiring of the merchant portion of the economics. So it's really the GNS
growth rates are not the same as the GNMS growth rates. All that said – and we don't break the GNS growth rates out
publicly, separately. All that said, when you look at that GNS billings number, I try to always remind people that while
we're really pleased with that 15% number, a portion of that high growth is driven by China. And China, as you know,
is a market where, because of the regulatory environment, it is very difficult for any player to get a lot of economics out
of the billings. We are pleased with what we've been doing in China because we think, without any capital expenditure,
we are building awareness and presence and brand in China that we believe we will find ways to monetize over the
longer-term. But in the near-term, China is a market that produces a significant number of billings in our GNS business
and very, very little revenue. So the GNS revenue is below that billings number, but you can't see it when you look at
that GNMS number.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Okay. Then my second question is just on the OptBlue. We've heard from some contacts that,
that product is very well received by the market. I know it's only a handful of merchant acquirers offering it today. But
can you comment on what your expectations are for OptBlue? Do you expect to have that in the hands of most
merchant acquirers at some point? And then, it does offer a lower discount rate? And are you comfortable with the
economics and the strategic value of OptBlue, as you've seen it operate now for a few months?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, all good questions. So the first, let's start with the facts. So when we first talked
about this in February, we talked about the fact we had six merchant acquirers on board and we've been very pleased
since then to add several more. And we think we are on a track to really get most of the industry on board and we were
very excited about that. It is very, very early in the process. So we all need to watch and see how this plays out in the
coming quarters and couple of years. But I would say, all of our early experiences are positive and very reinforcing of

the plans we've set out at that February financial community meeting. Now you are correct, that there are some
tradeoffs here. But we also pointed out that while we are in effect offering a, this is sort of my term, a wholesale
discount rate to the acquirers there are also certain incentives that we have traditionally paid to acquirers that go away.
So that helps fund a portion of that wholesale rate, it will just show up in a different place from a financial perspective
but helps offset it.
Yeah. The other much more important thing is that we believe this program has the potential in the U.S., over the next
several years, to make a very, very material dent in the coverage gap that we have in the U.S. And we think that is very
powerful for our issuing businesses and can drive incremental volumes that will make this a very positive tradeoff for
the company and for our shareholders.
<Q - Bob P. Napoli>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Just a follow up on the topic we were just talking about. You indicated the discount rate
is a little bit lower but I'm just wondering lower than what? Because when we look at your all-in discount rate,
obviously you're skewed I would expect to some larger merchants. So are you suggesting that the overall company
discount rate is negatively impacted by this? Or just the like-for-like small merchant?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, that's a good question, Betsy. So to be very precise, my comments were really
directed at the economics with the very small merchants who are part of the OptBlue program. Now, obviously any
change with any merchant does affect the company's overall rate but it is important to realize that while the merchants
that we believe we will gain through this program are very important from a coverage and a perception of coverage
perspective. In terms of the percentage of our total billings that these very small merchants generate, that is a very, very
modest portion over our overall billings and therefore, the impact on the company's overall discount rate, these changes
is very much moderated by that mathematics – that mathematical reality if you will.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separately, you indicated earlier in the call that the U.S. billings growth rate
was negatively impacted by weather and that you ended the quarter better than the first couple of weeks of the quarter.
Could you tell us what January, February, and March were in terms of year-on-year growth in billings?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I – Betsy, we don't like to break it out that specifically by month. I would just stick
to the comments that the second half of the quarter was certainly stronger than the first half and we haven't seen
anything in the early part of April that contradicts that trend. I would also just make the observation that partly because
of the close loop, we have a tremendous amount of information by merchant, by type of merchant, by industry, by city,
by day that allows us to do quite a detailed analysis of the impact of some of the most severe weather by city and by
day that you saw in the country and that's what makes us feel quite comfortable. In my commentary that there certainly
was some weather impact in January and February here.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Then just lastly on the expenses. You indicated that there was some timing issue there
and we shouldn't expect obviously to have this sub zero 4% shrinkage in OpEx on go-forward basis. Is there anything
that you have planning now to do that would be incenting incremental billings growth for 2Q and 3Q? Or really to get
into that, kind of activity we have to wait for the closing of the Global Travel Business?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I guess I would say we generally are not targeting our spend decisions in terms of
the benefits of spending. We do quite as precisely as you just suggested by so that we know the benefits and how
they're going to appear by quarter. We generally are making investment choices that we think will help us over longer
time periods. Certainly as we pointed out in my remarks as you get into Q2 you would expect to see some incremental
spending in a number of areas supported by the Business Travel. We did just launch the EveryDay Card at the end of
March so we're really just in the introduction phase of that.

The Serve product is in its very early days since we just relaunched it with vastly improved functionality towards the
latter part of last year. And there are probably a few steps you will see us taking that are just another step on our
journey of becoming an ever more efficient company with a really good solid cost structure and some of those things
will drive some one-time charges. So all of those things are targeted at helping us as we move into the latter parts of
2014 and beyond. But I wouldn't want to suggest that there – we're as precise as saying they're going to help us in any
specific quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Yeah, thanks. I had a follow up to Betsy and Craig's question again about the trends in the
first quarter of spending. And could you tell us the recovery in the second half of the quarter bring you back to sort of
fourth quarter growth rates in USCS? Or is there any other color you have in terms of where the spending was weak at
the first half, aside from geography?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, certainly. So a couple of comments. Gosh, I don't want to get so specific that I'm
calling out specific numbers based on a few weeks. To step back for just a second and provide a little bit of context. I
mean if we look over the last several years at our billing rates and our revenue rates, you will find some modest
volatility quarter-to-quarter where we go up or down a point or two and it's not necessarily indicative of a long-term
trend. So that's why we're cautious about even now talking about within a quarter or within a couple of weeks, trends
that are overly specific.
In terms of the specific geographies and industries, I think it's all the things you would expect. So if you pull out a
weather database, you'll see specific days, in New York and Boston and Chicago and St. Louis, of extreme weather.
And when we look at what happens in those places, you see some pretty extreme results in those cities on those days.
When you look at things like airline billings, and lots and lots of public commentary about massive – in fact, that I
believe, record number of flights that my old industry managed to cancel in January and February, that's lost revenue to
the airlines, which is why they're talking a lot about how much revenue they've lost. Frankly, it's also lost business to
us. So those are the couple of things I'd probably call out that are in the specifics of things we looked at.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: And the travel aspect of that would be the reason you call out small business and corporate
spend, as opposed to consumer in the quarter?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, that's certainly a logical connection. I mean, at some point all of this starts – we
can't understand the psychology of every one of our card members. So at some point, I want to be careful here because
it gets to us making some educated judgments and I can't prove that to you. But those fact pattern would appear to fit
together to us.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Okay. And then, my basic question was just I wonder if you could share any incremental
thoughts about the European regulation? And given that we've been through now the Parliament process...
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: What you're thinking in terms of vulnerability of GNS business in Eurozone or the U.K.?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, well, certainly the – those discussions are something that we are following closely,
we are very engaged in and we spend a lot of time trying to help all of the players involved there understand the real
economics and the real competitive dynamics of that marketplace. Just to level set for everyone, I would remind people
that we're somewhere to you the – maybe I should use a cricket term, but I don't know cricket. We're somewhere in the
middle innings, right? Because, first, the commission published their draft proposal. The Parliament came out just a
few weeks ago with their version of their recommendations. The next thing is that the European council come out with

recommendations and then there's sort of the equivalent of a conference committee in the U.S. where they all come
together. We are very engaged and certainly there are some things we think in the regulation that are – have the
potential to have some real unintended consequences and achieve results that are probably not what the regulators
intended.
And those are the kinds of things we have a lot of dialogue with them about. All that said, we do business in many,
many countries around the globe with many different types of regulatory regimes and, quite frankly, our business
model varies from country-to-country. So we are used to, and a little experienced, in dealing with evolving
environments and evolving our business models. This is a situation that is very important to us. We're watching it very
closely, but we're going to just have to see how this all plays out, which we think will continue to take some time.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: So you don't expect final resolution this – by summer or something?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No. Not to go out on a limb and guess politics, but we don't. We would say at this point –
and you are correct that originally they were trying to get this done by April or May. That is clearly not going to
happen. Our view would be the earliest you could get to a resolution is probably much later this year and certainly it
could extend beyond that.
<Q - David S. Hochstim>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Thank you. Jeff, I do understand the cricket terminology. [indiscernible] (53:28).
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: You'll have to educate me on what I should have said.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Right. I do have a couple of questions. The first one was just to clarify the reclass of fraud
losses out of provisions into operating expenses. Looking at – I don't know if you disclosed the specific number for this
quarter, but it looked like the run-rate was about $70 million or so a quarter. Is that correct, or maybe you disclosed the
actual number for this quarter and I just missed it?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, you're correct that the run-rate tends to be $70 million to $80 million a quarter. I
think we often talk about fraud on a basis-point level because our fraud rates, when you just look at industry data, are as
you know, about half the industry. But yes, the $70 million to $80 million is a good run-rate. I don't know, did we
disclose a specific – number more specific? That's a – it doesn't vary that much from quarter to quarter usually.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just the other question was, in terms of the amexoffers.com,
there was the program where you can basically just go online, check for offers, save them to your card, and be able to
redeem them. It looks like AmEx offers are basically ranked on individual relevance. So I'm kind of curious if there
was anything that, from a timing perspective or technology perspective, that resulted in this kind of coming together
relatively recently. I mean, is this tied into your big data projects and trying to mine some of your consumer data to
make more relevant offers? And that was one question, and the second part of it is how big do you see this program
becoming potentially?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, certainly we think that our ability to put together an offer ecosystem is particularly
strong because of our closed loop, and can be a particular source of value both for our merchants and for our card
members. And of course, our card members value it the more we can customize for them what we offer them. And of
course, we're getting better at that every month, including using your location to be very specific to what we offer you.
And we have seen growing interest on the part of merchants in using that ecosystem to help them drive business. So we
are, I think, quite excited about our ability to continue to expand our efforts in this area and our ability to use it, as one
of the many key tenants we have to create value across our entire network of both card members and merchants.

<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay. And then – and I'm getting a little bit specific here but just on a different note with
your EveryDay Preferred Credit Card, you referred to this program, and I was looking at some of the rewards
associated with the Preferred card, and they do seem somewhat rich depending on how you use them. But is this a sign,
because I think some other card issuers also have been amping up the rewards if you will on some of the card offers.
Wells Fargo has clearly indicated they want to grow their card business. I mean, is this a sign that we are seeing
competition at this point now that's going to eventually just reduce the profitability of the products across the board? Or
do you feel that these are just very specific to a certain target demographic, and so as a result of that we shouldn't read
into this more broadly that there's going to be a rational competition?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, certainly – I guess I'd make a couple of points. One, remember that our goal is to
engage our card members in the reward program, because that is really how we generate the most loyalty, the most
spend, and the best bottom line result for us. So an irony here is, as a general statement, it can be a very positive thing
for us when our rewards expense goes up. We've also done a lot of work over the last few years, and you continue to
see us every quarter really expand the range of redemption offers, because people have lots of different preferences and
lots of different likes and dislikes, and we've found great receptivity amongst our card members to that growing range
of offers, which I think sometimes makes trying to do the kind of comparison you just described a little trickier because
you don't necessarily know the redemption patterns. In some ways you can look at our rewards costs each quarter, and
that does give you a macro view of how it's trending relative to billings.
In EveryDay Preferred, clearly we think we have a proposition here that is going to be very attractive to a segment of
the market that fits our long-standing risk profile that we're after, but frankly a segment of the market we probably
didn't have the right product for. And certainly, offering the right product to that demographic has to include having a
competitive fit of rewards. But I guess I'd be a little cautious about extrapolating from that one data point anything
overly broad about rewards in general.
<Q - Sameer Gokhale>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: I think, operator, we probably have time for one last question.
Operator
Thank you. That question will come from Daniel Furtado with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dan L. Furtado>: Great. Thank you for the opportunity here. Earlier in the prepared remarks you said you're
working on products that are "more welcoming more inclusive". Is – and focusing on some new customer segments, is
a way a layman should read this is simply that you're looking to move slightly down the credit spectrum as the
economy has improved or how should we read those comments?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I don't know if I'd use – focus on the word credit. I like to think of this as, if you
look at this company over the last 30 years, 40 years, we started out with a credit card that was targeted – or charge
card, that was targeted at a very, very small group of customers who traveled a lot and stayed at certain types of hotels.
And there has been a steady evolution over decades of us moving beyond that additional very narrow customer
demographic, moving beyond a very narrow merchant demographic and moving towards everyday spend, moving
towards a broader customer base. We added lend products, et cetera.
And so when we look at things like the EveryDay card, the prepaid products, the OptBlue program to expand merchant
coverage, all of those things to us are part of a long-running trend in this company to extend the franchise and the brand
which we think is so powerful. But that doesn't mean that we're changing the risk profile or the credit profile of the
company. We think it means having the right product for different parts of the market and matching that with ways that
we can provide value to merchants.
So I – yes, we see a real opportunity here to continue to expand the footprint of our brand, but this is not about
changing our risk profile. For the EveryDay card this is for people who already would have qualified for other products
but frankly we didn't really have a product that they thought was relevant for them. That's what we're trying to do.
