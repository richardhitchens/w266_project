MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for standing by and welcome to Accenture's First Quarter Fiscal
2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for
your questions. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Ms. K.C. McClure. Please
go ahead.
K.C. McClure
Thank you, Tom, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our first quarter fiscal 2012 earnings announcement. As
Tom just mentioned, I'm K.C. McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are Pierre Nanterme,
our Chief Executive Officer, and Pamela Craig, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to
review the news release we issued a short time ago.
Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. Pam will take you
through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational
metrics for the first quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on market positioning and progress against our
growth strategy. Pam will then provide our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2012 and we
will take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.

As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursement, or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call are forward-looking, including the business outlook. You
should keep in mind that these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, and that such
statements are not a guarantee of our future performance. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to
general economic conditions and those factors set forth in today's news release, and discussed under the Risk Factors
section of our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of those measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news
release or on the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, K.C., and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased to tell you about the excellent results for the first
quarter which demonstrate that we continued to execute very well against our growth strategy.
Here are a few highlights. We delivered strong new bookings of $7.8 billion. We grew revenues 14% in local currency
to $7.1 billion, with all five operating groups and all three geographic regions delivering double-digit growth. Earnings
per share grew 19% to a record $0.96. Operating income was $981 million, our highest ever, with strong operating
margin of 13.9%. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with a cash balance of $5.1
billion.
And we continued to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and the payment of a semi-annual cash
dividend of $0.675 per share, which was a 50% increase over our prior dividend. As you can see, we [ph] did perform
(03:51) very well in Q1 and we are particularly pleased that our growth was broad-based across all dimensions of our
business.
Now let me hand over to Pam who will review the numbers in greater detail. Pam, over to you.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre, and happy holidays and thank you all for joining us today. I am pleased to tell you more about
Accenture's fiscal 2012 first quarter financial results. We delivered strong bookings and revenue growth in Q1
including, as Pierre mentioned, double-digit local currency revenue growth across our broad base of business in all five
operating groups and all three geographic regions. Our record revenues for the quarter drove record EPS results as well.
Unless I state otherwise, all figures are GAAP except the items that are not part of the financial statements or that are
calculations. New bookings for the quarter were $7.8 billion, and reflected a positive 3% foreign exchange impact
compared with new bookings in the first quarter last year. Consulting bookings were $4.2 billion, outsourcing bookings
were $3.6 billion.
Now let me give you some detail on bookings in the first quarter. In management consulting, we had strong bookings,
in large part because of increased client demand for projects that deliver near-term and structural cost take-out,
especially for sourcing and other parts of the supply chain. Bookings also reflected demand for services on large scale
business transformation programs. And we continued to see clients seeking to drive new revenue through improved
sales and marketing effectiveness. Overall, we see our clients taking proactive action in focused ways to respond to the
current more volatile market conditions.

Turning to technology consulting, our bookings moderated in the quarter, but our skills are in high demand. Clients
continue to value our independence and track record as they seek strategic help to further optimize global IT operations
and leverage cloud-based solutions to reduce fixed costs and increase business agility.
Systems integration bookings continued to reflect strong demand for ERP and custom systems, including large scale
transformation programs and the use of newer technologies. Clients continue to extend such solutions across the
enterprise and to expand their capabilities in mobile, data management/analytics, and social to improve processes and
customer relationships.
Turning to outsourcing, in technology outsourcing, we see more demand for application outsourcing that is
broad-based. We signed many new contracts in the quarter across multiple industries and notably in Europe, as well as
expansions for scope and volumes on existing client contracts. This trend reflects clients' needs to reduce ongoing
systems costs so they can direct more IT spending to new technology areas to support changes in their businesses.
BPO bookings in Q1 were very strong for a second consecutive quarter. Demand was most pronounced in North
America and in our industry-specific offerings, especially in our Resources, Communications, Media & Technology,
and Health & Public Service industries.
And demand for our global delivery network continues to grow, as we are leveraging it for increasingly complex work.
Across the globe, clients are tapping our global delivery capability, not only to take advantage of cost-effective
delivery, but also to tap specialist skills in ERP, specific industries and newer technologies. The work we are doing in
the GDN is increasingly more sophisticated and made up of longer-term committed relationships for maintenance,
development and enhancements.
In summary, we had a strong bookings quarter with $100 million or more in bookings at nine clients around the world.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the first quarter were just under $7.1 billion, an increase of 17% in U.S.
dollars and 14% in local currency from the same period last year. These revenues reflected a positive foreign exchange
impact of nearly 3% compared with Q1 last year. They were also above our guided range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion as
our foreign exchange assumption given last quarter was 3% as well.
Consulting revenues were $4.1 billion, an increase of 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. Outsourcing
revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 21% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency.
Now let me give you some highlights of revenue growth in our operating groups. The Products operating group had
local currency revenue growth of 17%, driven by strong and well balanced growth across the broad set of Products
industries in both consulting and outsourcing and around the world. Our core ERP transformation offerings continue to
be the backbone of Products. In addition, we saw strong demand for our services related to sales and channel
management solutions and supply chain. Notably, we are growing the number of clients where we have deep
relationships globally.
Communications, Media & Technology revenues increased 16% in local currency, with growth that was also
broad-based geographically and across the CMT industries. Outsourcing growth was very strong and was driven by
clients' continued focus on improving their operations, particularly in supply chain, procurement, finance and customer
care, and by demand for additional support for mobility solutions. Consulting revenue reflected our clients' continued
focus on increasing operational effectiveness, improving customer service, and launching new products and services.
Resources revenues grew 15% in local currency, also with strong growth in both consulting and outsourcing. This
revenue growth was driven by ERP and global operating model programs, with particularly high growth in energy and
natural resources, and in several of our priority emerging markets.
Health & Public Service revenues increased 11% in local currency, reflecting strong growth in health again this quarter,
including our connected health and health administration offerings. Our repositioning in public service continues, with
our focus being to help our public service clients drive efficiencies as well as to support human services clients to
modernize their systems.

In Financial Services, revenues grew 11% in local currency due to very strong growth in outsourcing across all
industries. This growth reflects clients' focus on near-term cost reduction and operational effectiveness, as this has
become an even stronger imperative across our Financial Services industries globally. We did see modest consulting
growth in Financial Services, driven by strong growth in insurance across our geographic regions. This growth was
partially offset by lower year-over-year consulting revenue in banking and capital markets which we had largely
expected.
In summary, we were pleased with the strong and balanced revenue growth delivered in Q1 by all five operating
groups.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin was 31.8%, down 40 basis points from 32.2% in Q1 last year. Sales
and marketing costs were $837 million or 11.8% of net revenues compared with $731 million or 12.1% of net revenues
for the first quarter last year, a 30 basis point decrease. General and administrative costs were $433 million or 6.1% of
net revenues compared with $386 million or 6.4% of net revenues for the first quarter last year, also a 30 basis point
decrease.
This all resulted in record operating income for the first quarter of $981 million, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin,
compared with $827 million or a 13.7% operating margin for the same period last year, a 20 basis point expansion. As
a reminder, we manage our business to operating margin. Although our payroll costs grew slightly faster than revenue,
we worked to offset that through tighter management of non-payroll costs. Our margin was also impacted by favorable
foreign exchange movement.
Operating margin improved in Health & Public Service and in Products due primarily to improved contract profitability
in those operating groups. Operating income decreased and operating margin fell from a high level in last year's Q1 in
Financial Services, reflecting lower contract profitability, higher business development costs, and higher costs related
to recently closed acquisitions.
Below operating income, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.3%, flat compared to the same period last year.
Net income for the quarter was $712 million compared with $606 million for the first quarter last year, an increase of
18%.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.96 compared with $0.81 in the first quarter last year, an increase of 19%. This $0.15
increase reflects a $0.12 increase from higher revenue and operating income in local currency, a $0.02 increase from
favorable foreign exchange rates, and a $0.02 increase from a lower share count, offset by a $0.01 decrease from lower
non-operating income.
Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with global head count of about 244,000 people
and we now have approximately 146,000 people in our global delivery network. In Q1, our utilization was 87%, up
from 85% in Q4. Attrition, which excludes involuntary terminations, was 12%, down from 14% in Q4 and 15% in Q1
last fiscal year. Lastly, we expect that at least 60,000 people will join our company around the world this fiscal year.
Now let's turn on our cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $394 million, resulting from cash generated by
operating activities of $475 million, net of property and equipment additions of $81 million. For the same period last
year, free cash flow was $31 million. The higher level this year included in uptick in client prepayments. Turning to
DSOs, our days services outstanding were 32 days, up from 30 days last quarter and down from 33 days in the same
quarter last year.
Our total cash balance at November 30 was $5.1 billion and compares with $5.7 billion at the end of August. The Q1
ending balance includes a negative impact of approximately $257 million, reflective of how much other currencies
moved versus the U.S. dollar between November 30 and three months prior.
Before I turn things back to Pierre, I will comment on our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders through
share repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed approximately 5.3 million shares for
$285 million at an average price of $53.36 per share, including 3.4 million shares repurchased in the open market. At
November 30, we had $5.8 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.

Also in November, we paid a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share for a total of $475 million. This
represented a $0.225 or 50% increase over the dividend we paid in May.
In summary, we had a strong first quarter and are off to a good start in fiscal '12. I continue to be very proud of our
Accenture people and their exceptional ability to drive our business in a way that serves our clients and shareholders so
well.
And now here's Pierre to give you some interesting color on how we are executing our growth strategy and delivering
business value for our clients around the world.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, Pam. Now I would like to talk about how we are leveraging marketplace opportunity to drive growth,
particularly in the context of the current economic environment. Of course there continues to be volatility in the global
economy largely due to uncertainty around Europe's sovereign debt challenges. We're carefully watching the actions
that governments in Europe are taking to strategize markets, restore confidence, and create conditions that would
support a return to economic growth. While Europe works on these issues, other parts of the world are exhibiting
positive economic growth, especially our priority emerging markets.
Moving forward, we will continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment very closely and assess the implications
for our business. In this context, we are executing a growth strategy that resonates with the needs of our clients. We
have a relentless focus on industry and technology differentiation and accelerated geographic expansion.
Our clients continue to invest in transformation and realize that they must address major structural issues resulting from
the long-term trends we previously identified, globalization, regulation, operational efficiency, to which we can also
add consumerization. This is driving demand for our services.
Let me give a few examples of the work we are doing for some of our largest clients at the very core of their
businesses. For one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, Accenture is the partner of choice on many
projects, including a [ph] new key (18:11) infrastructure rationalization program across more than 30 countries.
We are helping one of the world's leading mining companies develop and upgrade its core ERP system. The program is
designed to significantly improve and standardize processes to drive business value across the entire organization.
And just this week, we announced an agreement with a leading U.S. property and casualty insurer to provide claims
management support on a software-as-a-service basis to be delivered from the cloud. Accenture's claim management
services will enable carriers to add valuable capacity and better align costs with the volume of claims activity.
In terms of industry and technology differentiation, we continue to invest in our priority industries. In the
communications industry, through Accenture Network Services, we are helping our clients manage the rapid growth in
mobile and broadband network traffic, while improving customer service and operating efficiency.
Another example is how we are helping clients across the utilities, energy, chemicals, and natural resources industries
accelerate enterprise-wide business value through Accenture Advanced Enterprise services, which links
industry-leading processes to a preconfigured ERP solution leveraging leading technology platforms.
Geographic expansion remains key to the execution of our growth strategy. I'm particularly pleased with the progress
we're making in our ten priority emerging markets, which in Q1 grew at a significantly faster rate than the rest of
Accenture. And just as important as our growth in these markets is the quality of the relationships we have with our
clients there.
In addition to helping global clients expand into emerging markets, we have developed major client relationships with
leading companies in these markets, several of which are already our diamond clients.

To further support our growth strategy, we continue to invest in our brand, which is among the top 50 in the world. Last
month we launched a new global brand campaign featuring clients and how we are helping them create significant and
tangible business value. The new campaign is bringing our high performance delivered brand positioning to the next
level. And of course we continue to manage our company with rigor and discipline to drive profitable growth.
With that, I will turn the call back to Pam who will provide our business outlook for the second quarter and the full
year.
Pamela J. Craig
Thank you, Pierre. As a reminder, each quarter we provide an outlook for the next quarter's revenue and an update on
our annual outlook for the full fiscal year. As our fiscal Q2 takes shape and we turn into calendar year '12, we
recognize, as Pierre said, that we are operating in a macroeconomic environment that continues to be uncertain and
volatile, with a particular focus on what is happening in the Eurozone. We are vigilant about any impact these and other
developments may have on our global business.
So with that in mind, let me share our view on Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year. For the second quarter, we
expect revenues to be in the range of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. This range assumes a foreign exchange impact of
negative 1% for the quarter. We have broadened the revenue range we see for the quarter in order to allow for some
flexibility and timing of the start of new work in the calendar year.
Now turning to the full fiscal year, we now assume a foreign exchange impact also of negative 1%. As you know, we
form this assumption based on how the rates have moved over the last couple of weeks, and we have seen them bounce
around in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%.
Taking into account our Q1 results, what we see for Q2 and how the pipeline is shaping up for the second half, we
continue to expect our fiscal year '12 revenue outlook to be 7% to 10% growth in local currency. We've had strong
bookings over the last two quarters, and we have some work to do to shape more business for the second half of our
fiscal year and into the next.
We continue to expect new bookings for the fiscal year to land in the range of $28 billion to $31 billion. We continue to
target the same level of bookings in local currency and support the same overall range, even with our updated
assumption for foreign exchange. Within that, we also expect system integration bookings to moderate somewhat going
forward, and there may potentially be a further lift in outsourcing bookings over what we expected three months ago.
We continue to expect operating margin to be in the range of 13.7% to 13.9%. You should expect some fluctuations
quarter to quarter as we've experienced in the past. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the
range of 27% to 28%. We now expect our earnings per share for the full fiscal year to be in the range of $3.76 to $3.84,
down $0.04, reflecting our updated assumption for foreign exchange.
Finally, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, property and
equipment additions to be about $500 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion.
We remain committed to return a substantial portion of the cash we generate to shareholders. In fiscal '12, we continue
to expect to return at least $3 billion through dividends and share repurchases. We now expect to reduce the weighted
average diluted shares outstanding by closer to 2% due to our current view on the phasing of repurchases over the year.
I would like to give credit to our experienced leadership team and to our people overall as our business right now is
well balanced and well positioned for the future. We remain focused on executing our growth strategy with discipline,
maintaining a world class balance sheet, and generating strong free cash flow, while staying close to our clients and
working with them on their most critical business needs as we drive our business forward.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. K.C.?

Thanks, Pam. I would ask that you each keep your questions limited to one question and one follow-up to allow as
many participants as possible to ask questions. Tom, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang. Please go ahead – representing
JPMorgan.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi, good afternoon, can you hear me?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, hi Tien-tsin.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi there, sorry about that. Just wanted to make sure you could hear me. Just – good quarter,
good color commentary as well, thanks for all that. Just I guess I observed definitely an uptick in cost take-out projects
that you were highlighting there, Pam, in terms of your bookings commentary. So – and my question there is is there
enough of this cost-cutting work to do to offset this transition away from perhaps some of the discretionary work that
you typically see or some of the transformational projects that you might see? I'm just trying to understand this
transition, assuming this path continues and what that might mean for the bookings trajectory.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, there's plenty of cost-cutting work and I would suggest that much of it is indeed
transformational, given that there's a lot of structural costs to be addressed as well. But let me let Pierre give some color
too.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, when we are talking about cost take-out, probably you would have in mind the work
associated with the outsourcing and that kind of work. When you're talking about cost take-out, you have a large
variety of activities we are doing from [ph] an energy (27:13) standpoint and especially I'm thinking about all the work
we are doing in technology consulting with all the technology rationalization, if you will. I'm thinking about all the
work we could do in management consulting in term of driving more operating model efficiency.
And I'm thinking of course about all the new technologies if you will, and innovation we're putting in the market which
are contributing to cost take-out improvement. And I'm thinking about some cloud-based services we are providing to
clients which, through different business models, we're contributing to cost take-out with not only one part of our
business, but it's the full range of our services we can bring to bear.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Understood, understood. And just as my follow-up I guess, I think you mentioned, Pam, the
wider range for the second quarter revenue guidance? What's driving that? It sounds like you're buffering for a little bit
of transition for the calendar year?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I mean our business runners don't see it but I just thought that it was a good idea to just
put a little in there, and so I just put a little in there on the bottom, so...
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Understood, thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Just in case start-up on a few things is delayed a bit.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Tien-tsin.

Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Hi, guys, hey, hi there. Hey, it's great to see the bookings off to such a great start. Congrats
on that. I guess where the questions are going to turn from an investor standpoint is all about whether discretionary
services spending is beginning to show signs of softening? Yesterday, as you know, Logica in Europe attributed its
struggles to a weaker economy in Europe. We argue that a lot of those issues are company-specific coming out of
Logica, but still it raises a question about whether the consulting market demand scenario in Europe is starting to fade.
Can you comment on that, please?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean to get started with that, I mean we are very pleased with what have been our bookings
in Q1 in term of consulting, and we come in very strong. And again, I think at the end of the day, all depends on your
positioning and what you do with clients. And as you know, positioning has always been to be much more on the kind
of CEO corporate agenda, driving work around what we are calling transformations, i.e., programs which are critical
for the company to drive better performance. And I think this is what we continue to focus on and it's – with the right
mix of work from the consulting and the outsourcing. So so far, we do not see a significant shift in the buying pattern
of our clients.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Just to add a little more specific industry color there, Rod, I commented that we did see some
consulting off a little bit in Financial Services and banking capital markets. But we also see a lot of opportunity in more
imperative-based projects in Financial Services. So it is interesting how that's shifting, and the only other industry
where we maybe see that a little bit is chemicals.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay. I mean clearly your Q1 bookings were great, but I guess are you seeing any
indication that the pace of bookings is starting to temper, or that that could happen over the next year, given all the
macro volatility that's going on around the world?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: At this point we don't see a significant change in client behavior. We see that budgets may not
go up very much, but we also don't hear about them going down. What we talked about before in Tien-tsin's question
on cost optimization really is paramount, and really that plays to our strengths in terms of getting to real outcomes on
business cases there.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, and, Pam, just real quick on that, would you expect your outsourcing revenue growth
rate in fiscal 2012, particularly in the back half, to be meaningfully better than your consulting revenue growth rate?
Are you still expecting a relatively balanced revenue growth mix across consulting and outsourcing?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: The way we see it today, Rod, is that we do expect the consulting growth rate to continue to
moderate somewhat and we expect the outsourcing growth rate to be double digits.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Great, thanks, guys.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: [ph] They are better. (32:12)
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: No, no, not contracting, contracted. Sorry.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, the revenue that we have under contract, yes...
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Correct.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: ...which we call our visibility, and basically as we sit here today versus last year, we have 13%
more under contract than we did last year.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: About the same pace as coming out of the fourth quarter it sounds like, right?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Okay, and then the head count adds for the year, was the 60,000 a gross or a net number?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: That's the gross number of the people we expect to join our company this year.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: And any mix contribution there, offshore, global delivery versus on-site, or is it balanced
across...?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: We're expecting to continue everywhere. I mean we do have hiring down a little bit, but that's
in part due to the improved attrition – or largely due to the improved attrition. So – and we do have some people joining
us from some acquisitions. So it's all in the mix.

Next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys, great job with the quarter. I guess my question's on the MEA – actually let me try
again, EMEA, constant currency revenue growth rate was 10% and that accelerated from 8% last quarter, so I guess it's
a little bit of a head scratcher given all the negative headlines we've heard. So I guess what's driving that
outperformance there, and is there some sustainability in that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, first of all, Bryan, welcome back. It's great to have you back and I'll let Pierre take the
question since it's Europe.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I mean of course Europe is always a little bit unpredictable so probably that's why
you've been taken by surprise. But there are probably more fundamental reasons that indeed as you know, we're
working with large companies. So at the same time we're of course watching carefully, we are watching carefully
what's happening in Europe from a macroeconomic standpoint. But we are putting the same attention to what's
happening with our clients.
And many, if not all, of our clients operating in Europe are operating on a global basis. So they are not totally
dependent if you will, on the economic environment in Europe per se. And we have many projects and programs we are
delivering around the world which are indeed located in Europe and which is reflected in this 10% growth.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, great, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is just on outsourcing in general, just from
your comments and looking at the bookings the last two quarters, they're really booming. So I guess what's driving kind
of that change that we're seeing such a big delta in outsourcing, and maybe where is that strength coming from? Is it
across the board in the segments? I know we talked a little bit about it but it's just a little bit surprising to see it come on
that strong.

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I think it is indeed coming across the patch. And I think it just reflects – I mean first, the
nature of the client demand in terms of cost take-out, and I think what we are providing both from an application
outsourcing or BPO standpoint is extremely relevant to – in response to the client's need. And second is the positioning
we have taken in both BPO and AO, where we continue to drive a lot of innovation compared to the competition.
I think in BPO, we have now extremely good solutions, we're calling fourth or fifth generation BPO, where we are
bringing more value in the BPO services to avoid commoditization. And as well if you think about the application
outsourcing, we are much more service level-based, business case-driven, so I think as well what we are proposing is
more relevant for our clients.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: And just the way our global delivery network has really gotten so strong in terms of our ability
to deliver more and more of these services, as I mentioned in my comments.

<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. Would you mind just touching for a moment on the actual timing you're seeing in
terms of decision making? Maybe just touch on budgets, how they're shaping up in terms of where they – when they
should be decided? Are you still expecting January, February, maybe even March, or just give us some sense around
that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Darrin.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Hi, Darrin.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Hi, guys.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Hi. Now – and when you look at it and as you can imagine, we're looking at this
extraordinarily carefully around what are the velocity, speed to decision and so forth. And as we speak and when you're
looking at Q1, we've not seen a significant change in clients' behavior.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Okay, well, that's helpful. So you – I mean I guess bottom line is you expect probably
February timeframe then, right? January, February timeframe still to help you guide in your planning?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, we are not seeing any sort of blips in the way clients are stopping or starting projects,
right, we're just not seeing anything in that. But as I mentioned, we did allow for a little bit just in terms of how the
revenue kicks in after the start of the calendar year just in case something like that does happen.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Right, right, right. No, it's just the type of contracts perhaps. And then on the public sector
local currency growth rate, I know that health is in there also, but still 11% was pretty impressive considering an
environment of I guess just fiscal tightening around the globe. I think it's also been somewhat better than we've seen

<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I'll start and then let Pierre go then. But we are really, really focused on this repositioning as
we've been telling you for several quarters now. And I think what is paying off for us is focus. And we are really
helping or working with governments around the world on helping them get more efficient, right, helping them get
much more efficient in terms of the services they're providing to their citizens. And we've really narrowed it down to a
few offerings and it is starting. I mean we're still doing it, right, so we're not done. But we're really pleased with the

Next we'll go to the line of Moshe Katri with Cowen. Please go ahead.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi.
<Q - Avishai Kantor>: Yes, hi, it's Avishai Kantor for Moshe. First question, telecom seems to be up very strong,
21% sequentially, and BFSI up a strong 15% sequentially. Can you elaborate on the drivers for that?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Sorry, you said telecom's up...
<Q - Avishai Kantor>: I'm sorry. Operating income in telecom and BFSI in telecom was up 21% sequentially and in
financial services was up 14.7% sequentially, the operating income in those verticals. Can you elaborate on that, what –
where the driver is?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, there's a – just as I mentioned before with operating margin, there's a lot that goes into
that. Generally contract profitability is the major driver. And then there's a few other puts and takes that go into that
every quarter. We did have – just in terms of this quarter versus last year, we had – last year you may have seen, we
took a benefit from bad debts. This year we did not have that. So there's just lots of things that go into that. And there's
nothing notable in those two operating groups.
<Q - Avishai Kantor>: Okay, and then on a sequential basis, revenues in Europe were up much stronger than the U.S.
which grew only 1%. Any – can you talk about that a little bit?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I'm not sure I have your sequential 1%. I mean there's always – the quarters are different, just
in terms of the seasonality of our business, so sequential generally doesn't make sense. And so I'm not sure there's
anything too much you can draw from that.
<Q - Avishai Kantor>: Okay. And then last question, any change in visibility compared to prior quarters?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Not really beyond what we provided in the comments. The bookings were strong and
generally we see clients' budgets continuing to shape up for next year as we expected. So there's nothing really major to
point out there.

We have a question from Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, good afternoon. I understand you manage to operating margins but I did want to hear
more a little bit more color about the gross margins. Utilization rates were up and attrition was down. Could you just
talk about again why gross margins were down, and then what you expect the trends to be over the next quarters? And
then I have a follow-up, thanks.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Okay, great. Hi, Keith. Well, I mean I'm going to stick to the story in that we manage the
business to operating margin. I mentioned to you that payroll was up a little bit in gross margin, but it was down a little
in sales and marketing. And as I mentioned, most of our people to the degree when they're not charging contracts,
spread their time between those two lines in terms of the activities that they do.
So I think that you just – again, we manage the business to operating margin and I think we were – the contract
profitability was good. We had compensation increases that went in on September 1. We're absorbing those well.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: So there really isn't too much to add there right now.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Then if you're absorbing those compensation, would you expect the gross margins to go up
over the next couple quarters?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I mean – you know, again, we manage the business to operating margin. There's a lot of
puts and takes. There's contracts that are beginning, contracts that are ending. I mean there's just so much that's going
on in a given quarter. So as you know, we did give an annual outlook for 10 to 20 (sic) [10 to 30] basis points
expansion in operating margin and that's what we're working to do.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, all right. Well, I will cede the floor then. Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Keith.

Nathan Rozof with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Hi, guys.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hey, Nathan.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: So maybe a first one here for Pierre here because I'd like to turn it back to Europe. Are you guys
seeing any noticeable or perceptible shift in clients' adoption of offshoring in particular? And if so, if you could kind
speak to the drivers of that or how they are leveraging offshore more and how it's impacting your business?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, definitely this is a trend which is as well touching Europe. I mean this offshore
adoption, if you will, already been very vibrant if you take the U.K. or the Nordic countries. So the question has always
been what's going to be the level of penetration in more the Latin countries? And we're starting to see more adoption of
offshore or nearshore as well.
And as you know, we have a number of delivery centers, some are more nearshore, other are more offshore. So we
have the possibility to leverage of course our offshore centers such as India. But as well we can work from Romania,
even from Morocco or other places. So we have a full range of possibilities when it comes to offshore so we can deal
with language, with culture, as well as with time zone. But clearly we see a higher rate of adoption from an offshore
standpoint.

<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Okay, great, thank you for that. And then I wanted to turn it quickly back to the bookings
number. Pam, I think you mentioned that there were nine clients who added at least $100 million in new bookings. I
just wanted to check to see if there were any very large or chunky bookings closer to the $1 billion range like we had
seen last quarter that may have also benefited bookings this quarter? Thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, we didn't have any giants like that and otherwise probably won't comment any further,
but there weren't any like up close to $1 billion.
<Q - Nathan Rozof>: Great, thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thanks. And also I just want to say that I'm still sticking to the 10 to 30 basis points. It was

And next we go to the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please go ahead.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Hi, Ashwin.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Hi, Pam, hi Pierre.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Hi.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: So it was solid quarter, good execution in tough times, congratulations on that. Not that
much of a surprise in your comments for the quarter itself, but I wondered if you could go over the topic of vendor
consolidation? Continue to hear that Accenture continues to gain wallet share versus competition including especially
mid tier companies that may not have a full range of services. And I just wanted to ask what inning are we in here?
How strong a driver could this be over the next couple of years?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, thank you, Ashwin, you for the question. And I think this is a driver for our growth as
we can see these vendor consolidation moving forward for very good reasons from our clients. If you want on firsthand
to rationalize your IT cost and second, drive more transformational programs, you need to rely – you can lower number
of providers which are able to support you on a much more global basis.
So all this – especially when you're working for large companies, large and global companies like Accenture, so this
one, the consolidation is still moving forward and is still a driver for our growth, and a way for us to increase our share
of wallet in our existing clients.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Okay, and then on currency, I mean the impact of currency is of course expected. But does
the continued volatility change how you hedge the risk or whether you try to contractually offset some of it, or even
where you hold your cash, because there was that cash impact on the balance sheet this time, right?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I mean – well, first of all, we're not going to be changing anything we do. What we do
do is we do hedge certain balance sheet risks where we need to. But what was reflected in the cash balance is reflected
in the cash we need around the world to run the businesses in those countries, and sometimes it goes one way and
sometimes it goes another. And that's just the way it goes. We also are going to continue to hedge part of the work in
our GDN where we have revenues and costs in different currencies, and we're going to continue with that practice.
We're very pleased with how that's going.

Next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - David Grossman>: Great, thank you. Pierre, you talked very positively about emerging markets and sorry if I
missed this, but what percentage of revenue is emerging markets and what rate is it growing, and how does the
competitive landscape look?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: We're not giving the information to that level of detail, but I can just mention two things.
First, I'm very pleased with the progress we're making with our priority emerging markets. But again, we've been
extraordinarily focused on growing in that part of the world and putting all that together. And second as I mentioned
before, we've been growing in those markets at significantly higher rates than the rest of Accenture.
<Q - David Grossman>: And how about the competitive landscape, is it materially different than what you're seeing in
the other geographies?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I mean of course you need to face local competition, but it's not different from what we
are facing in most of the markets. At the end of the day, the market is split between the large and global companies like
us, the local providers, and what we're calling more the Indian pure players as well, which are providing a kind of
different kind of services. So what we are facing in those markets is the same competition we used to face in the other
markets, so I think we're actually well prepared to compete in those markets.
<Q - David Grossman>: I see, thank you. And just one for you, Pam, it looks like the impacts of currency on revenue
and EPS were more or less proportionate. Does that relationship generally hold true or does it really just depend on
other factors?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, it generally holds true, I would say.

We'll go to the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi, my first question here is just on utilization. I see it's at around 87%. Are you running that
a bit too hot? I think you talked about maybe potentially bringing it down. Is that an inhibitor at all to servicing any
business or how should we think about that in relation to the margin as well?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: I don't think it's too hot, right, I mean it's maybe on the border of getting too hot, but we don't
believe it's too hot. The mid 80s% is where we look for it to be. And it's really been tracking in that area, and I think
we're doing an excellent job of supply and demand balancing right now.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: And then just secondly, and thank you for that, just so I can characterize your position right
now, it sounds like there's nothing really that you're seeing in the marketplace. Would you say that your optimism was
just towards the demand environment is just as strong as it was last quarter, and the element of conservatism may be
coming from headline rather than what you're seeing in the market? Maybe you could just frame that for us.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I mean good question indeed. I think we know we're entering fiscal '12 in a position of
strength. This is what we mentioned last quarter. We're very pleased with our Q1. We are remaining extremely close to
our clients. And what we see as we speak is indeed the kind of services we are providing are extremely relevant to
respond to needs of our clients.
Now on the other hand, we are very thoughtful and we're watching carefully what's happening in the marketplace and
especially in the macroeconomic environment and especially in the Eurozone. And this is what we're providing in our
guidance and in our direction is I think exactly the right balance between the confidence in ourself and the services we
are providing, and just being aware of what's happening outside.

<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: I'm going to squeeze one last one in here, Pam. How should we think about the depreciation
of the rupee as we look at your margins? I know you have a larger global delivery model, but maybe you could just talk
to that. Thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, I mean movements of the rupee really only have a modest impact on our margins,
because even though we have a large head count in India, it's really not proportional to our total costs. And we do offset
them partially by hedging. So the whole intent is to try to minimize that impact on our overall global results.

Go to the line of George Price with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - George A. Price>: Great, thanks. Can you guys hear me okay?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yes, hi, George.
<Q - George A. Price>: Hi, congratulations. Nice quarter, particularly very strong bookings. I guess I know that some
questions have been asked and it's been circled around, but I want to press a little bit more on the guidance. In keeping
the 7% to 10% range in light of the strong first quarter results and the second quarter guidance, just doing a little
preliminary work on what it – for the year, at the upper range of the constant currency guidance range, I mean it implies
a fairly significant deceleration in the second half of the fiscal year maybe to around like the 7% kind of range in
constant currency. And obviously even lower if we think of the low end of the constant currency guide of range.
If we think outsourcing is going to grow faster than consulting, given what we're observing and your comments, then
potentially a real deceleration in consulting. And so notwithstanding that, I know you want to be conservative in light
of what we're seeing in the macro environment, but I guess it just kind of – if you could give a little bit more color on
that because it just feels beyond just conservatism.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I will start and Pam will give more color on this as well. But again, we want to be
thoughtful and balanced in our judgments. So again, we have a strong start and we are very pleased with where we are.
We have strong bookings which is giving us some visibility. However, we know that there are remaining uncertainty
and volatility in the marketplace. And when we are putting all of this together and we need to apply our judgment, then
we believe that the guidance we are giving from 7% to 10% is the right one, given where we are and what we know and
what we are starting from. But, Pam, you can further comment.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I'll probably just sort of repeat what you said. But I think similar to last quarter, I mean
we look at this very seriously. We look at puts and takes, and so Q1 was even stronger than we expected. Q2, we have
factored in some prudence in case there are some slight level of calendar year delays. And then as you look past Q2, we
recognize that GDP forecast globally has maybe inched down a little bit, right, when you think about places like the
Eurozone, the U.K. and Japan. And as I mentioned, we do have some work to do to replenish the pipeline. So we're just
kind of trying to take all that into account and be thoughtful and prudent about how we see it.
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay, I guess just kind of segueing to that comment on replenishing the pipeline and the work
that you have to do, I guess what's driving that? Obviously you're pulling a lot out of the pipeline in terms of booking it,
and that's great. But in terms of having to replenish it, I mean what's driving – is there just slower decision making on
things coming in? I mean a little bit more around that would be helpful.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Yeah, I mean I think coming off of two strong quarters of bookings, right, then there's
replenishment work to do. That's just a given. And then as I mentioned, we also see some shifting from consulting to
outsourcing from how we originally did our plan this year. So that's what we're focused on.
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay, last thing if I could, was fiscal 1Q '12 the first quarter for year-over-year decline in the
banking and capital markets consulting work? You mentioned that that actually had a year-over-year decline. Was this

the first quarter that we saw that? And was that driven by consulting predominantly in Europe, or did you see that in the
U.S. as well? Thank you.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: We did not see it in the U.S., and I believe this is the first quarter. I don't think last quarter had
a year-over-year consulting decline. We can confirm that with you, but I don't believe it did, if memory serves me.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, I don't think it...
<Q - George A. Price>: Okay, great, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.
<A - K.C. McClure>: Tom, we have time only for one more question, then Pierre will wrap up the call.

Final question today will come from the line of Dave Koning with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nathan J. Novak>: Hey, guys, this is actually Nathan Novak on the line for Dave.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Great, you're back.
<Q - Nathan J. Novak>: This is sort of just piggybacking off that last question, but in the financial services vertical,
the last couple of quarters, profitability has been a little worse than let's call it the last – or the prior seven quarters.
What would it take to materially change to get that back up to 17%, 18%? Is it a mix shift thing compared to some of
the other verticals, or could you talk a little bit more specifically about the drivers there?
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Well, first of all, I think Financial Services has exhibited very strong profitability in the past.
So they're probably a little bit more in the pack now. And I think that as you mentioned, operating groups go through
different cycles, right, in terms of their business, and big stuff starting up and that sort of thing. And I think we have, as
I mentioned in the comments, right, we just have lower contract profitability right now. And they're focusing on
business development. And we also had some acquisitions that we're integrating and had some cost related to those.
<Q - Nathan J. Novak>: Excellent, thanks a lot.
<A - Pamela J. Craig>: Thank you, Robert (sic) [Nathan].
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah, thank you. And as you know, Financial Services is very close to my heart, so I can
work with the current leadership to make sure they will show good gain.
