MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Kathleen McCabe
Good morning. This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our
earnings release, financial supplement and strategic update, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP
measures that appear in the earnings release and the strategic update. This presentation may not be duplicated or
reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we're going to cover on this call,
we're happy to extend the Q&A a few minutes as needed to ensure you get your questions in. In a minute, I'll take you
through the 2016-2017 outlook and plan, but before I do so, let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.
Clearly the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that,
Equity Sales & Trading and Investment Banking were strong and Wealth Management and Investment Management
were solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring of FIC, conducting a large
reduction in force in December, reducing our compensation to revenue ratio, launching a large-scale firm-wide expense
initiative, more on that later, significantly reducing our WAs and FIC to $136 billion, well below our target of $180
billion, and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business. Finally, we've put in place the leadership team to drive this
going forward over the next several years.

On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as our President. He brings highly complementary skills and will help
take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales & Trading; Dan
Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management; and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented
bench. Finally, Sam Kelly Smith will run Fixed Income and Commodities, working for Ted. In light of these changes, it
was expected that Greg Fleming would pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he has
done and wish him well for the future.
Our bench in Wealth Management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O'Connor have over 40 years
experience in that business. Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held, as well
as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management and, of course, it is a business I have a very long
history in.
Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I'm delighted we made these
decisions and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now, our entire focus is on driving results.
Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the investor relations website. After I go through these, Jon
would take you through the quarter in more detail, then we'll both take your questions.
Let's start with Slide number 3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business mix is much more balanced
with complementary franchises in the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management. In
our Institutional Securities business, we've maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and Equity Sales
& Trading as illustrated on Slide 4. In Equity Sales & Trading, we're first among global peers as of the third quarter
year-to-date. We've built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of Colm and Ted with full-year
revenues ex-DVA of $80.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In banking, we continue to see strength and finished second
in global announced M&A and number one in IPOs.
Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full year profit margin
of 22% with pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth
Management. We grew our U.S. banks net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However,
in Fixed Income and Commodities we failed to improve on our financial results.
While we've been reshaping FIC for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool coupled with the steady
increase in capital requirements led us to take further significant action at year end. Through our recently announced
FIC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see.
Through the year, our funding cost benefited from the realization about funding tailwind as the debt we issued was of
much tighter spreads than the post crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated going
forward.
We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full-year ISG compensation ratio ex-DVA of 37%,
below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our annual
buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital returns to shareholders in the years ahead,
subject, of course, to regulatory approval.
As you can see on Page 6, our ROE for 2015 excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits was 7% on a capital base of
$67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously, that gap is a function of both earnings and
equity.
On Slide 7, we lay out the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include capital
sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth, and capital return to the shareholders. These, of
course, are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management.
Since 2012, we've made significant progress in de-risking our balance sheet on flat assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We
continue to accrete common equity despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust
equity base coupled with the de-risked balance sheet and a transformed business mix provides a strong foundation to
support our current plan.

As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of
5.8%, a well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of
our strategy as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison, in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma common equity Tier
1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6% and our pro forma supplemental leverage ratio was just 4.2%. We
await clarification on the impact and timing of the G-SIB buffer in CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we believe we
will be near the end of supervisory changes and therefore our capital is appropriately sized to support our business
going forward.
Turning to Fixed Income and Commodities on slide 10, notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital
required to support FIC, further regulatory changes in recent years, and a prolonged difficult environment led us to
believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We've reset the long-term RWA target for FIC at $110 billion
and are setting an SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we're confident that going forward, this business
will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time, where possible, excess capital will be returned to
shareholders.
On Slide 11, we give more details on the FIC restructuring. Given the cyclical and in some cases structural challenges
facing fixed income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downsize
head count by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent
installation of a new management team with the objective of credible sizing of the business going forward.
Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in microproducts
specifically in corporate credit, connecting to our Investment Banking franchise, as well as the mortgage product, and
in macro products such as structured rates and certain electronified FX product, which we will appropriately resource.
Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities, and in partnership with Wealth
Management against our core client base will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.
Now let's turn to expense discipline beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our number one priority is to
control what we can control, given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target at 39% and
finished the year at approximately 37%. Partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We
intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also set 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment
Management.
Turning to slide 13, in addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we've launched a major company-wide
initiative called Project Streamline, an effort led by our CFO, Jon Pruzan, and COO, Jim Rosenthal, which is designed
to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are
shown here.
Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs, and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too
many legal entities, too much duplication of operations and processes, and too many employees based in high-cost
centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in
the coming quarters.
The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our
target expense ratio ex-DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year at 77%. Expense management is critically
important. As such, we've set a new target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions
over the next two years. In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear,
we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like lending and
Wealth Management. However, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.
Now let's turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong, high-quality loan demand on our Wealth
Management client base. We've significantly reduced client penetration in Securities-based lending and residential
lending over the last three years. But, we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers. For example, only
1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans would drive $20
billion of lending growth through 2017.

A highly-scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation
payouts such as net interest growth. Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To
provide granularity, we lay out three areas where we see obvious potential margin improvement, assuming stable
markets. From today's level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through, one, loan and deposit
growth, two, expense discipline, and, three, normal course of business growth. In addition, it's worth reminding
investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transition, we put in place a retention program that amortized over
9 years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019, and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.
Now let's turn to Slide 17. As I've said earlier, we believe we have sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory
approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we've done in the last four years.
Let me now turn to slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017. Over the past several years, our
returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses and penalties, the need to build a strong capital base
resulting in material capital growth every year, the cost of integration of the largest acquisition in Wealth Management
history, the challenging fixed-income markets against which we've carried outsized capital levels, the restructuring of
our merchant bank, and of course, the enormous costs and capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory
environment.
We see the next several years very differently. We've identified $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the
bank strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in Wealth Management and for the firm. We expect
equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues assuming global economic growth. And we believe investment
management is now positioned for growth. Most importantly, we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance
sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution, or, where that is not possible, reinvestment into our higher
return businesses. As a result, we're setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material new capital
requirements, no outside new litigation expenses or penalties, and a global economy that evidences growth, not turmoil.
Either way, in a flat revenue environment we will reduce run rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning
in 2017. Let me now turn to Jon, who will briefly touch on the fourth quarter, then together we will take all of your
questions.
Jonathan Pruzan
Thanks, James. Good morning. I will keep my comments brief, so we have ample time for Q&A. The fourth quarter of
2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways, with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns
driving clients to the sidelines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter.
In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our equities, Investment Banking, and Wealth
Management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $7.9 billion
excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q 2015. Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion. Our effective tax rate
was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our
tax rate, excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter, was 32.5%.
Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security businesses, overall revenues
ex-DVA were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter on quarter. Non-interest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter.
Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion, down 7% quarter-over-quarter.
Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%.
Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13% driven by lower litigation costs.
In Investment Banking, continued strength in our M&A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped
to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues, up 3% sequentially.
Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million, but down 7% from the post-2008 high we achieved last
quarter.

Turning to underwriting, equity underwriting revenues were $352 million, up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily
reflecting increases in IPOs. We continued to see pressure from volatility in Fixed Income underwriting volumes and
revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees partially offset by
investment-grade bond fees.
The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in Equity Sales & Trading, as clients
remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex-DVA revenues for the quarter
were $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially. For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters as
we gained share across regions. Our prime brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership with revenues up
quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients.
Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year.
Fixed Income and commodity sales and trading continued to underperform in a difficult environment characterized by
spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter, revenues were $550 million
excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter. Revenues and Securitized Products and credit continued to be
negatively impacted by the environment. Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially while FX was down,
driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement.
Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the
sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our two large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see
less seasonality in our first quarter FIC results going forward. Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46
million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credit spread, as well as
Commodities.
In our Wealth Management business, we continued to see steadiness. For the quarter and for the full year 2015, we saw
average revenues per day of approximately $60 million with no day below $50 million. Revenues for the quarter were
$3.8 billion. Excluding the impact of deferred compensation plan investments in both periods, revenues were
approximately flat sequentially.
In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy with net interest income increasing 4%
from the third quarter and full the year net interest income of $3 billion, up 26%. Funded lending balances in Wealth
Management grew approximately $3 billion, or 6%, during the quarter, and $12 billion, or 31%, year-over-year.
Growth in NII helped offset some of the quarter's headwinds including the 5% decline in asset management revenues,
which was a function of the third quarter's lower S&P level. We continue to see muted overall activity in transactional
revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.
On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense
associated with the DCP investment gains mentioned earlier. Non-compensation expenses were up 6%, driven by
typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex severance, down slightly versus 3Q 2015, though
up year on year. For the full year, PBT margin was 22% in Wealth Management.
Deposits in our Bank Deposit Program were $149 billion at year-end, up $10 billion versus the third quarter reflecting
normal seasonality in deposits as well as clients moving to cash in a volatile market. In investment management,
revenues were $621 million, up significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by traditional asset management which was
up 5%, as well as stronger performance in merchant banking and real estate investing where revenues were $211
million versus a loss in the third quarter.
Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and backdrop. So far this quarter,
market indices around the globe are down, with many off to their worst start in history. If they remain down for the rest
of the quarter, we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particularly in our private investing
businesses.
Now turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $788 billion at December 31, down from $834 billion at the end of
the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion, down from $827 billion in 3Q, as clients moved to the
sidelines and activities slowed, particularly in the second half of the quarter. Our global liquidity reserve at the end of

the quarter was $203 billion compared with $191 billion at the end of the third quarter, driven by typical seasonality in
deposits. Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down
from $434 billion in the third quarter, driven by reductions in market RWAs and a slower client environment.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our
Board declared a 15-cent dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased 2.1 billion of common stock or 59
million shares.
Turning to outlook, in the first two weeks we have seen a significant rise in volatility across markets and asset classes
and an intense focus on the China economy, market, and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a
reasonable start in sales and trading, as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and
keep their risk positions close to home.
M&A has remained active. We're cautious, however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&A activity.
The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The Capital Markets pipeline is healthy, but market volatility could
delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It's way too early to predict how the
rest of the quarter unfolds, and we are tightly managing our risk positions along with our clients.
With that, we will open the line to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Sure.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Just a quick one on the reduction – or it actually is not. It's a lie. It's not a quick
one. On LRD and RWA and FIC that you laid out in the deck, so what should we think about as far as timing?
Obviously, you laid out the year-end 2017, but is there a way to think about the curve over the next two years as we
progress? And how should we think about the revenue that would be tied to that capital and how it might be recycled
throughout the organization if not returned to shareholders?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good opener, Brennan. Let me start by saying, firstly, we've laid out RWA targets
over, boy, I think the last three years. And going back, I seem to remember it, a number of, like, $392 billion or
thereabouts in – around the third quarter of 2011 in FIC. So, we're light years from that. And last year, we thought we'd
achieve $180 billion. And as you can see, we ended materially lower than that.
On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can't really help you. We're going to do it
opportunistically. We'll do it with sort of minimum damage. We don't want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We
have some natural roll-off. So, we feel very comfortable with these targets, and it's fair to say we haven't disappointed
in the last few years. That hasn't been our issue in FIC.
As it relates to the capital, with just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up
that much capital. It just means the business doesn't need that capital. Our view is that we were overcapitalized, that our
balance sheet was too big in the business, given the revenue and business opportunity. We now – and we were over
expensed, frankly, by taking out 25% of the head count and with that the expenses on compensation the Project
Streamline that we're now working on some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR
exposure, we will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business.
How that is redeployed is a really good question. Obviously, over time, we expect we'll deliver that back to
shareholders. That's the current plan. We don't control all of the pieces of that plan. We're a regulated institution. We

have been through CCAR or SCAR, I think, five times. And every time we've asked for a buyback or dividend, our
request has been met. It's fair to say that we'll continue to ask for buybacks and dividends. And where we can't use that
capital, if it's sort of trapped capital for some period of time, which some of it may be, there are clearly other businesses
that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth
Management.
Clearly, we can use the capital to support growth in those businesses, as indeed we've had very high returns in our
equities franchise. So, I don't know if that's helpful, but it's hard to lay out a more specific timeline for the balance sheet
and RWA runoff than what we've given here with the end state and with the year-end 2017.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: No, that's fair, that's fair. Thanks, James. I guess, is there any way that we could
think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about revenue? Because, obviously, if you're
going to take that much capital outright, you're going to have a very different business. You talked about focusing on
some of the strengths, a few business lines. Maybe you could help us think about which businesses you're going to be
deemphasizing and how much revenue you think realistically could come out as a result of that and then, finally, how
that translates into margin for the business overall.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I don't think I can give you the margin translation at this point. And let me
address some of the other issues. And then, I'm sure Jon may want to add to it and you'll be hearing a lot more from
Ted and the leadership team probably in the first quarter at one of the investment conferences.
I think the basic position we're in was we had more balance sheet and more capital in the business than we were
generating revenues on. So, we don't think there's going to be a great revenue diminution from this point given where
we finished 2015, which frankly as we said and we're very candid about, was disappointing. What we're doing is
reducing the parts of Fixed Income where frankly we didn't see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 months and 24
months.
We've always had – as we said in the call, we've always had a good micro business, a good credit business. That
remains good. We've been very good in the more sophisticated structured rates. We're reducing, obviously, our
exposure in liquid rates. We've never been a major FX trader and we're focused on the major currencies there, not the
non-G10 currencies. And then, regionally, we've sort of picked our shots through distressed and high yield and various
other places around the globe where we think we need to be overemphasized relative to under. The net of it will be
more of a U.S.-focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro products.
And I don't know, Jon, if you want to add at this point any more details on that.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yes. The one thing I would add is just to give you a better sense of some of the things that
we are getting out of. As James mentioned, most of that is not in the U.S., things like sovereign CDS, some of the
non-core European currencies, Asia-distressed trading, some bespoke correlation products as well as all the work we've
done on our commodities business in terms of the oil merchanting businesses as well as the announcement regarding
our European power and gas last year. So, a smaller footprint, less capital, less expenses and better margin.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: And on a personal note, Brennan, I have to apologize. I have called you Brendan, I
think, three earnings calls in a row. So, my apologies.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: No worries, James. That's all right. I've been called worse. And then, finally,
another one here real quick. When we think about your ROE goal, right, ultimately which you referenced early on in
the deck many times as 10% and then we think about 2017 showing the 9% to 11%, can you maybe square how that's a
little bit different? Just – is it that the transition may not be complete by 2017? How is it we should think about that?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: We're – our goal remains to achieve returns above our cost of capital clearly whether
our cost of capital is actually 10% right now, but let's take that for granted for a moment. Our goal is to achieve returns
above that. Clearly, we can't be that precise. I mean, this is a highly variable set of revenues that we have in these
businesses as we're seeing in the markets today versus Friday, for example. So, that's why we're expressing it as a
range, but you'll note the midpoint of that range is indeed 10%. We're not backing off of the goals.

In fact, for the first time, we've put a timeline against it. And as we laid out what the key drivers of that, obviously, it's
with the appropriate caveat, which you would expect if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are
unforeseen. If the markets completely collapse here, if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very
differently to our capital plans than what we intended, it gets harder. On the other side, if we have stronger revenue
growth, we meet our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we're confident about -- certainly about the range and our
target is the midpoint of that range.

And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and then one follow-up.
Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. I guess, a follow-up on FIC, just curious what you think the net of
all the moves might be in terms of how you think about your GSIB buffer and then how it might factor in, just in
general, to your ability to return that excess capital. I heard your comments about redeploying if you're not allowed, but
it seems like your RWA reduction and then the costs that go along with it is kind of what builds the buffer. But just
curious to get some detail on that.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: In thinking about capital, I mean, problem number one is having enough capital. At
4.2 supplemental leverage ratio, which was just, I think, the beginning of 2014, I'm looking at Jon, he's nodding, 2014.
Clearly, we weren't there. When – so problem number one has been solved. We've clearly got enough capital on any
metric that you measure.
Problem number two is then if you continue to accrete capital, what is the central buyback dividend and total payout
ratio that you'd put against that? And then, the opportunity number three is, as you reshape the business mix and move
to less capital-intensive parts of the business, you're by definition throwing off more capital than you've had the day
before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital?
As to refer Brennan's question, this isn't going to happen tomorrow, Glenn. It's going to happen over, as we said, a
couple of years. So, it's not like we're going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow, but we're setting ourselves
up for increasing returns over the next several years, at the same time is making investments across the rest of the
business. So, I don't know if that helps you, but where it relates to the GSIB buffer, we know what our buffer is. What
we don't know is how the Federal Reserve through the CCAP process is adjusting its models. Once they put the CCAP
offering, my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models, which will temper that buffer to create a net
number, which is lower than the buffer for all the banks. That's my current understanding.
Obviously, we have to see that play out. My understanding is that Federal Reserve had models which were, by
definition, harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance. But that was driven by not having the
GSIB buffer put in place. Now that it's in place, the models will be refined and the net impact is what we would be
looking at. So, the combined net impact of the GSIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with
the amount of capital we're accreting we still accreted capital last year gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence
here that we're going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: From your lips, all right. Just to follow-up on – a quickie on the corporate loan
commitments. If you could give any color about the total or the funded loan book, how much of it is energy? Any
reserves against that? How are you feeling about that book in general?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: In general, on the corporate loan book, I think, the focus areas have really been around
energy and probably event, particularly in the single B market. We have seen – on the energy complex, we have seen
credit migration in that portfolio. And as a result, Glenn, we've increased our allowances. We've seen an increase in

some of the negative marks that we take through our interim statement as well as increasing our hedges. And we would
expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for a while.
In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it's about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded. This is energy now. That's
down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment-grade – or, excuse me, is
to investment-grade counterparties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded.
Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&P. In terms of our statistics, that portfolio is
about $4.4 billion. Broken down, $1.7 billion of that is funded to non-investment grade borrowers and about $2.7
billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about 2/3 to investment-grade borrowers.
In terms of the reserves in the allowances, remember, the $16 billion total energy book, approximately 60% of that is
held for investment, while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is marked-to-market and it primarily
flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of the income statement. It's been marked to the current
environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We're watching for
signs of a contagion and we're hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So, I think that's the color on
the energy exposures.
On the event, again, it's been – we've seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It's primarily been focused in
the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation and downdraft. But
again, it is only a handful of loans, a few of which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few which we still hold.
The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth
quarter results. The BB and investment-grade markets held in pretty well, although the pricing has widened. We see
investors wanting to put capital to work in that market, but they are being more selective. They're looking at
higher-quality names and extracting larger new issue concessions.
But in terms of outlook, we continue to underwrite new commitments, predominantly in the BB space and the
investment-grade space, and that reflects the current environment. So, again, those two areas of energy and event,
we've been highly focused on and containing and managing net position as best as we can.
Outside of that, we haven't really seen much contagion. Wealth Management book still stays – looks pretty good,
remains stable, strong credit quality, no real changes in that – those metrics. Commercial Real Estate portfolio also
hasn't seen real signs of weakness.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. Thanks for a lot of details. Good.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. Just to follow up and stay on the topic of corporate credit and more broadly
than the sort of energy E&P type stuff that you talked about where you gave good color. In your experience, what are
the leading indicators of credit deterioration that you drill down on broadly away from energy and the commodities
complex? How are they looking right now? And is there any reason that you can think of as to why this would be
different this time?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: That's a good question in terms of relative and historical performance. I think we've
obviously been in a very benign credit environment for a while. We are starting to see some pressure in the energy
complex, as I said, across the other metrics, particularly for us given the health of our customer base in the retail side;
we haven't seen much stress in those areas. We are increasing the allowance for loan losses this quarter. It's up to about
$70 million, clearly, a portion which is energy. So, we are seeing a churn in the credit cycle. But again, from our book
and the way that we look at it, it's really been focused in on the energy complex right now.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up question on Wealth Management. Looking
at your slide 16, the net interest income growth in a range of 75 basis points to 175 basis points of margin contribution,
if – I seem to remember that you've baked in the forward curve to those assumptions. So, where would we be in terms
of that range, if short-term interest rates stay where they are currently as opposed to actually incorporating the forward
curve?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I think the right way to think about that, those numbers I would say do not require any
incremental rise in rates from where we are today. If the forward curve is realized, we will get some incremental
benefit, but those margin targets don't require incremental rate movements. They do require the growth in loans that we
laid out on the prior page, and we've had very good momentum in that lending book. But it doesn't require the forward
curve to hit those margin targets.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you so much.

Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Good morning.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: So, my first question is on the $1 billion cost saves. I'm just trying to gauge what's incremental
versus just roll-off of onetime as in 2015. So, I guess, the first question is how much litigation and severance cost did
you incur in 2015? And then, two, of that $1 billion in cost saves, how much of that is roll-off of the 2015 ligation and
severance cost versus incremental business rationalization?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, of that $1 billion, as James mentioned, that assumes no individual one-time
significant charges. There's obviously an element of litigation that's part of our business. We were happy to see the
litigation expense go down in the fourth quarter. But in terms of breaking out those individual numbers, we have
historically not done that. But again, it does require no major single individual event.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. Just so I'm clear, because I think you guys put out the numbers in your Qs of just about
$500 million of litigation costs through the third quarter and about $115 million severance, so that's close to $700
million in costs. Are you...
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. I apologize. So, the – so, again, the $550
million number you're referencing was in the third quarter.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Yes.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Year-to-date, as I said, our litigation came down materially in the fourth quarter. And the
severance, of the $150 million was across the firm in the fourth quarter. Presumably, we won't have the same level of
severance, so part of that severance would be embedded in that $1 billion dollars.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. So, and what about the litigation? Are you assuming it's roughly the same going forward
or are you assuming it comes down from that, at least, that $555 million we had as of the third quarter?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I think we believe that the most significant items related to the credit crisis are largely
behind us. This quarter, it was good to see litigation come down. And so, I think there is an embedded assumption
along those lines. But again, it's a lumpy and unpredictable line item.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Okay. And then my follow-up, just on the lending balances, I'm just trying to reconcile the
current target versus the prior target. So, you had – you expected $180 billion in total U.S. bank assets by the end of
2016. Does that still stand? And then, how do we think of 2017?

segment, so it's not a total lens on the bank. We'll be coming back to you with more detail throughout the year, but in
terms of the 2016 number, that loan growth that you see out of Wealth Management would be consistent with those

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So, I appreciate the detailed guidance certainly as part of the broader strategic review. It's
always quite helpful to us. But some of the early feedback that I just wanted to relay suggest that there's – investors are
struggling and quite candidly, we're struggling to reconcile the walk to 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different
guidance components. And if we think about a backdrop where there's 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency
ratio, 32% tax rate and flat preferreds and non-controlling interest, it gets you to about $6 billion of net income to
common. And if I even take just a low end of that 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66
billion, which suggests payouts in excess of 100% over the next few years. So just wanted to get an understanding as to
what elements or components of that analysis might be flawed or need to be tweaked? And how should we – and what
capital return assumptions are embedded in that 9% to 11% ROE target range that you've highlighted for 2017?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Let me try to take a swing at this one. So, as we laid out on the page, first of all, the
compensation, the billion dollars-plus of compensation and non-comp savings are assuming a flat revenue environment.
So, if we get out two years and we're flat to today our ratio will be 74%. As James mentioned, we do expect revenue
growth throughout this period, and therefore the efficiency ratio should be lower than the 74% because we do have
operating leverage in the business, first and foremost.
And so, I think that is probably the biggest disconnect in your math. You can see in the revenue bucket – or the modest
revenue growth bucket, we do have improvements in different business segments. And then, in terms of the capital
base, ideally, we believe we have sufficient capital. We have been accreting capital over the course of the last several
years. We would expect to probably accrete a little bit more capital over the coming period, but we would like to try to
clearly slow down the accretion of capital since we have – we believe we have the appropriate amount of capital for our
current plan.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, thanks. And, Jonathan, since you spent a lot of time talking about capital and
obviously it's going to be contingent on the feedback you get from regulators and presumably they would be inclined or
incentivized to reward actions to reduce your systemic risk footprint or expose your system with more risk-intensive
activities. Based on your discussions, have you been given any indication that it would be perceptive to higher payouts
for those that are willing to shrink more aggressively in those areas?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I don't want to get ahead of predicting how regulators are going to think about this. We
did what we think is right for our business. Our job is to generate returns for our business. However, arithmetically, if
you have met all of the capital targets, by definition if you change the structure of your business and throw off
additional capital that you now by definition don't need that ought to be available for returns. Do I think that there's
going to be one-time major dividend in the next 12 months to 18 months? No, I don't think that's possible. But do I
believe that we're going to be in a position where we increase our returns? Absolutely. And you've seen banks that have
generated payouts above 100% for this reason. They're accreting more capital than they need for their business. That's
before you get to banks that have actually restructured their business in the face of the new business reality. So again, I
don't want to get ahead of them. That would not be a smart thing to do, but I do think our strategy is pretty clear and it's
certainly consistent with where the regulatory push has been.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. Your 9% to 11% ROE target, you have a timeframe on that for the first time ever. Appreciate
it. But what is that on a tangible ROE basis?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Mike, we've got about a little over $9.5 billion of goodwill and intangible, so on our capital
base somewhere around 100 basis points, 125 basis points above those numbers, just math.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: All right. So the target on a tangible basis is 10% to 12%?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: We have an ROE target of 9% to 11% for all of our common equity.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Okay. And what's the meat behind this target? Is it just a target that sits there or is management
paid off this? What's the follow-through from this target to the organization?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Not totally sure I understand your question. All of our employees who are bonus
eligible are paid in stock. The stock has generally performed somewhere in line with ROE and price to book so
everybody's affected by that. The most senior management team receive, as part of their compensation, performance
units which are directly affected by ROE and total shareholder return. So that's very specific for the senior team. But
we're not doing this to frankly drive up our personal comp. We're doing it because we think these businesses should be
run with returns at or above 10%, and nobody in this world predicted the last four years or five years of what's gone on
the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses. When I took this job our
capital base was $40 billion. Today it's $69 billion. We're in a tremendous E position, and the challenge has been to get
the R moving consistent with that rate of growth of the E and what we've done here is to frame it for our investors,
because understandably they want to know what is a realistic timeframe, just as Steven's question before, what is a
realistic timeframe? How do the pieces add up mathematically to get you there? Are they believable? Are they
plausible? And we thought, Mike, it would be smart to lay out what we think is a realistic timeframe. That kind of
range, 9% to 11%, 2017, the pieces are – we are definitely taking out expenses. Some of them are in the bag, if you
will, and some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we've put in place. We believe there is
revenue growth across many parts of our business over a two-year period.
And we believe we're sufficiently capitalized, given the world that we operate in. So, if you add all those pieces
together, putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework, rather open ended, seemed to be the right
transition point for Morgan Stanley. In the last several years, we couldn't have done that, because we couldn't address
some of the issues on the right-hand side of that slide.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: As a follow-up, slide 13. I mean, you addressed compensation by each of the three main business
areas, but you didn't give any meat on the non-comp expenses. Can you just elaborate on any specifics there?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'm sorry, say that again? We addressed the compensation? We didn't give meat on
what?
<Q - Mike Mayo>: On the non-comp. Slide 13, location strategy, leverage technology, consolidate and processes,
outsourcing, what sort of expense savings could you get from the non-comp areas?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I think what we wanted to frame was the total comp ratio – I'm sorry the total
efficiency ratio of 74%. And embedded in that was $1 billion of expense savings which will be a function comp and
non-comp. We're not going to break those out in detail on this call. We are very confident about that, as we were
referencing with Steven. There are a number of these things which obviously just go away through reality, like the

severance costs. There is the elevated legal expenses we've carried in the last several years, which we think is unlikely
to be carried forward. There's the restructuring we did, which frankly just changes the run rate of your salaries, benefits,
medical and the bonus pool for those individuals. And we've already initiated a major effort under this Project
Streamline. And some of those pieces began this week.
We started with changing our so-called contingent employees through our consultants in far away markets where we
have achieved the objective of what they were being put to work. We've now reduced some of those numbers. And all

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Thanks, guys. James, just on the FIC side of the business, post-restructuring, I know
it's tough to gauge, but when you mentioned, when you look at the revenue environment and kind of where you're
running right now, you wouldn't expect much of a drop-off. Just wanted to understand, is that relative to the second half
of 2015, like, total 2015? Or is there any way to gauge it from a return on asset, like what you expect in FIC going
forward?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: No, I think about it in terms of the full year. Obviously the second half, revenue run
rates of $500 million were incredibly low. But we look at what the total market size is, what our share is, and what our
expected share is, and the expected market size in the next couple of years, and that's where we say we believe we're
right-sized for revenue rate equivalent to 2015. We obviously will be trying to do a lot better than that, but we think
that's a plausible outlook.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then, Jon, just on the – I guess you mentioned with
the weak markets, some of the impact that you can see in Investment Management. So, I guess just two things on that.
Last quarter we saw that kind of negative accrual I think on the Asia private equity or Merchant Banking fund. Just
what type of exposure does the Investment Management business have to those types of products that we could see
those swings?
And then in Wealth Management, I feel like the transaction revenues have been pretty weak for a while and that's more
of an industry trend. But just wanted to figure out, are we stabilizing here? Meaning, are there pressures there,
somewhat coming to a slowdown?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. A couple of questions. I think on the Investment Management question, the way I
would try to think about it is there are basically two major components of how we make money in that business. One is
just our fee revenues for managing money. And obviously that's going to be a rate – that's a rate times volume equation,
so if the amount of money we're managing goes down, that will be impacted by the markets that we're seeing, but that
line is pretty stable.

The second line, as you said, is the investment line. And when I refer to the investment line, I'm talking about the
segment reporting we do in our supplement. That number was negative $235 million last quarter. We said that was
predominantly driven by a reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund, or funds. This quarter it was $100 million. That return
to a positive number was driven by all of our, or most of our, investing businesses both private equity infrastructure and
Real Estate. So it was more balanced.
We said in the third quarter, when we took the reversal of carry, that that eliminated the vast majority, or excuse me,
the majority of the carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses. We obviously have a carry accrued in other
businesses. And that's disclosed in the Q. But the exposure certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was
under stress in the third quarter had no material changes – had no material changes this quarter.
That was the first part of your question. I think the second on transactional revenues, those numbers have been
subdued. Clients are cautious. Whether that's a floor or not is hard to tell, given the volatility, but we think – we think
that those numbers hopefully have stabilized.

<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, maybe for you, Jon, on
page 3 of the supplement you break out the regional revenues. Looks like if we don't adjust for DVA, the revenues
were basically flat in the Americas, up double-digit in EMEA and up high single digit in Asia. How are you thinking
about that revenue mix heading into 2016, given all your comments about some of the challenges emanating out of
China and some of the growth challenges in Europe?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'm sorry; I'm just turning to page 3. Before getting that page in front of me, I think the
results this quarter, we did see Asia was down, but it continues to be a strong and important part of our business. We
did see weakness in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter in Europe, given the concerns and uncertainty around
Brexit and some of the immigration issues. We still think that Europe, although it's showing some signs of growth in
certain areas, it's going to be a fragile economy and the drivers of our business will be the U.S. and Asia.
In terms of the third, page 3, again, I don't have it in front of me just this minute but that you should also know is a
managed – the way we look at the business is on a managed basis. And so those revenues don't necessarily tie it back to
the tax rate that I talked about earlier regarding the geographic mix of earnings.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. Thank you. And then a little closer to home, how are you thinking of – it seems
that you're assuming that lending both in the corporate side of things, as well as within Wealth Management, is going to
continue at what appears to be roughly similar growth rates as you saw this year. But I guess I'm curious how you're
thinking about what appears to be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny, both in areas like leverage lending but also in
commercial Real Estate which – where you've grown quite visibly over the last two years to three years, as you've
pushed on your bank growth program.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: So, Matt, I'm not sure I – I wouldn't agree with that statement. I think historically over the
last couple of years we've seen good growth in both the ISG lending product as well as the Wealth Management
lending product and those have been the key drivers along with deploying our deposits away from securities into these
loans. Those have been the key drivers of the NII growth historically. I think going forward; I would tell you that the
primary driver of the lending growth is going to be Wealth Management. The growth assumption is in the ISG part of
the business are much lower than they have been over the last couple of years, that we built those portfolios up. So the
key driver is going to be the Wealth Management area.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay, and then just riffing on that theme, James, you mentioned less than 2% of your
Wealth Management clients have a mortgage with Morgan Stanley. What's your target over the next two years to get

that ratio to?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I don't have a target here. We could break out sort of mathematically how it separates
and get back to you, but I don't have a target off the top of my head. Obviously, it's very low single digits. It's not in the
above 10%. You can see the numbers on the chart, which just show mathematically what the total residential lending is
$21 billion, up from $16 billion, so I guess that would imply we'd be at about 2.4%.
<Q - Matthew Hart Burnell>: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Thanks, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. When we think about the 3% to 5%
revenue growth with net ROE target, some items, like NII, should increase without the backdrop changing, and
hopefully will be above that. So, on the other hand, Investment Banking has been operating at a high level, as you
highlighted. A choppy market can impact those businesses. So, just thinking about what type of Investment Banking
revenues or environments are in that 3% to 5% revenue growth. And it sounds like you guys are a little bit more
cautious on the near term there. So is that fair? And then how are you thinking about those businesses broadly, relative
to their cycle?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Sure. I think, first, I'd highlight it's a 2017 ultimate target. I think, as you say, the Wealth
Management is being really driven by the lending growth and some of the other initiatives we have there. In terms of
both equities and Investment Banking, listen, we think that we can continue to gain some share there. We have good
shares in those businesses, but the backdrop is a constructive one where the revenue pools are up modestly. If we're in a
situation where revenue pools for these products decline precipitously, these are – that's not the backdrop that we set
these assumptions. So, a little bit of share gain, and a little bit of revenue or pie growth.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, great, helpful. And then, just within the Wealth Management comp target, that
improvement to less than 56% is that entirely driven by leverage off of higher margin revenues like NII? Or are there
other core comp expense reductions that can occur within GWM that we should be thinking about?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Yeah, I think it's a mix. I mean, clearly, more non-compensable revenues is helpful for that
target, but as we've said for the totality of the firm, we are very focused on expenses and comp and there are some other
levers that we can use here other than just the growing non-compensable line item.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, good morning. You mentioned how much you've brought the Fixed Income RWAs
down from $390 billion to like $188 billion at the end of last year and down to $136 billion now. And I know you can't
comment about this year's CCAR, but I guess it just strikes me that given the huge progress you've made on bringing
down the FIC RWAs, it doesn't seem like the CCAR process was mitigated somehow. And I wonder if you can talk in
a general way, again not about this year's submission, but to what extent are the adverse CCAR results driven by the
Fixed Income businesses? Or is it throughout the business? And if the CCAR process this year were static with last
year, would the reduction in RWAs that we've seen this year have a positive impact on CCAR?
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, I can take that. Jon, you may want to add something. CCAR is a function. There
are five different ratios under the normal scenario and then the severely adverse scenario. Where we had an issue to the

extent we did was on the total leverage ratio, which we addressed with our [ph] top (01:07:57) preferred securities. So I
think, listen, CCAR was submitted last November-December, I think.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: January.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: The cycle got moved out this year, an extra three months to April. So the world we're
in 15 months ago, our RWAs were significantly higher. They weren't where we finished the year at. So it's sort of an
apples and oranges. Back then we presented the firm as it was then. This April we'll be presenting a different firm,
although there are various cut-off dates when balance sheets are set and so on.
So I don't really want to get into, and I know you didn't ask for a specific projection on CCAR, but all we can do is put
ourselves in a position where it's clear we have sufficient capital and any incremental changes we make to the business
or any incremental earnings that we accrete by definition become excess capital. Whether that flows on a dollar for
dollar basis, obviously is something to be considered when we submit our thing in here from our regulators.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi. Just had two areas. One was you talked about funding benefits, I think it's [ph] point
four (01:09:22) at the beginning, tailwind from lower funding costs. I just wondered if you could talk a bit more about
how much that was for 2015 and also where we would see it, because I did notice that net interest income in IS was
very strong in Q4. I didn't know if that's related, so if you could talk about that.
And then the last area was really slide 16 and the deposits assumptions. I had thought that there was a big strategy to
increase the deposits. I think I had a number in my head of $200 billion. Has that changed? Or is it just that you're not
putting that, or you're not assuming that those are lent within your 2017 kind of roll forward? Thanks.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Okay, so, Fiona, the two parts of the question, I think on the funding question, there's
obviously a lot of components that go into those lines, including the size of our balance sheet, secured versus
unsecured. What we said, just to give you some – to try to cuff it, we did about $21 billion of new unsecured last year
and those came in at rates that were significantly below where the historical debt had been issued. Our average
maturity, or WAM, on our unsecured stack now is about six years, so we were sort of retiring five-year debt and putting
on slightly longer, but we saw our credit spreads were easily 100 tighter than where they were before. That process
went on throughout the year. We obviously didn't refinance all the debt on day one, so we'll continue to get the benefit
from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that I think addresses question number one.
And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try
to do this year, in 2016, is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have differently liquidity values.
We think we can support the lending growth that we've highlighted in the strategy, excuse me, in the strategy deck
without growing our deposit base, but clearly that is a goal and in 2017 that will be a requirement to support our future
lending growth. We've talked about some of the digital strategy and cash management products that we're rolling out.
And that will hopefully drive the deposit growth in 2017 and beyond.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Thanks. Can I just go back to the first thing and what the explanation then for the net
interest income in IS is?
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: I'm sorry...
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: For fourth quarter. Institutional Securities.
<A - Jonathan Pruzan>: Again, I'll come back to you on that one, Fiona.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Now, I think we've – this is probably our longest call. I'm glad we got everybody's questions in. And we look forward
to talking to you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.
