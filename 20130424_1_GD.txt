MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name
is Sue, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a
question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being
recorded for replay purposes.
I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Erin Linnihan, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan

Phebe N. Novakovic
Thank you, Erin. I hope to be reasonably brief this morning. The press release and related charts are pretty
straightforward and tell a rather compelling story. We reported revenue for the quarter of $7.4 billion, operating
earnings of $824 million and overall operating margins of 11.4%. This resulted in diluted EPS of $1.62 compared to
consensus of $1.50.
Free cash flow was fairly strong across the business, particularly for a first quarter, at $429 million or approximately
75% of net income. This was considerably better than the cash performance in the first quarter of 2012 and
considerably more than we had anticipated in our plan.
Given the defense market environment, this quarter compares favorably with the first quarter last year. Revenue was
down modestly 2.3%. Operating earnings are essentially flat. Margins are up 10 basis points. Net income is up $7
million, and diluted EPS is up $0.05 or 3.2%. On a sequential basis, there's significant improvement even if we look at
the fourth quarter before non-recurring charges. On a non-GAAP basis without charges, the operating margins in the
first quarter were 10.1% compared to 11.4% this quarter.
Let me give you a little bit of detail on the results of our operating segments and hopefully provide you some color.
First Aerospace, Aerospace revenue is up $155 million, almost 10% against the year-ago quarter and profit is up $39
million, 14.4% on a 70 basis point improvement in operating margins. I am pleased to report that Jet Aviation made a
contribution in the quarter. In short, nice operating leverage.
From a market perspective, we're seeing adequate interest in both new and existing product lines. The backlog and
orders in the quarter make me comfortable with the revenue projections I gave for Aerospace for the year. We have
some opportunity to outperform our guidance; so far, so good. At Combat Systems, revenue declined $358 million
against the year-ago quarter but operating earnings were up $12 million, almost 6% on 13.8% margins.
However, it is well to remember that there was an accounting charge in the year-ago quarter for this segment. On a
non-GAAP basis, ignoring charges, margins are flat. Sequentially, even after the fourth quarter non-GAAP adjustment,
margins improved by 130 basis points, from my perspective a very good operating performance despite reduced
revenue and continued struggles in Europe. With respect to backlog, the significant international order activity we
expected in the first quarter has slipped to the right. We are still actively negotiating these transactions and have
confidence they will close.
We expect Combat Systems revenue to improve steadily during the year quarter-over-quarter, but still fall short of the
revenue guidance I gave you at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, operating margins will be better than my
earlier guidance. Margins for the year should be in the range between 13.5% and 13.8%, but could be somewhat lumpy
on a quarterly basis, depending on the timing of further restructuring charges in Europe.
Marine group. The Marine group continues to perform effectively. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue is
up $21 million, 1.3%, and earnings and margins are down, as expected, as a result of the conclusion of the highly
profitable T-AKE program last year. In all other respects, program earnings held steady or are up slightly.
Operating margins are at a respectable 9.8%. This group is expected to be highly consistent during the remainder of the
year with respect to both revenue and operating margins. At IS&T, revenue is up modestly, $7 million, but earnings are
down against the first quarter last year on lower operating margins. This was as planned.
The operating earnings at 7.6% represent a significant improvement over the fourth quarter last year on a non-GAAP
basis, ignoring the charges. We are working diligently to improve margins and expect stronger margins in the second
half of the year. Our order activity remains good with a book-to-bill of 1:1. Let me conclude my remarks by saying we
had a strong quarter, we beat consensus, and frankly, beat our plan. We're off to a good start and our internal focus on
operations is gaining traction.
I'll turn over the mic for a few minutes to Hugh Redd and he can provide a bit more detail.

L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to cover a few miscellaneous items before the
question-and-answer period. First, net interest expense was $23 million for the quarter versus $39 million in 2012. For
2013 we expect net interest expense of approximately $90 million, reflecting the full impact of the debt refinancing
completed late in 2012.
At the end of the quarter, we had only $165 million of net debt, down about $450 million from year-end. The effective
tax rate was 30.7% for the quarter, which reflects the impact of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012
which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. For 2013, we still expect an effective tax rate approaching 32%.
Finally, with respect to pensions, we continue to expect cash contributions to the plans to approximate $600 million for
2013. The bulk of the funding is expected to occur in the second half of the year.
That concludes my remarks and, Erin, I'll turn the time back over to you for Q&A.
Erin Linnihan
Thanks, Hugh. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to
participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue. Sue, could you please remind participants
how to enter the queue?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: On the Aerospace side, I was wondering, Phebe, if you could give us an update on the market
demand as you're seeing it, and really honing in on the 550 and 450, where backlog is today, and just color as you see
demand going the rest of the year. I mean, how are you thinking about production in that context?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks, Joe. As you all know, our book-to-bill has been below 1:1, but I think this is
important to understand. With respect to Gulfstream that data can be misleading. It's the mix of orders that are
important. And a significant, in fact a preponderance of the orders in this quarter were for the G550 and G450, where
we need them. So we carefully watch that portion of the order book to determine production rates. We're solid for the
year and have not made a judgment about next year's rate on these aircrafts. To the extent the rate is down for next year
on the 450, 550, and we have no reason to believe at the moment that it would be, but to the extent that it is, it will be
overcome by increases in the 650 and 280. So, in general, we are very comfortable with where we see our backlog and
our new order activity.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Very good. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Carter Copeland, Barclays.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hello?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just, I'm going to resist the urge to ask about the Aerospace margins and instead ask a bigger
picture question, Phebe. You've now had another quarter under your belt here to do business reviews, think about what

you want to do with the company from a strategic perspective. And I wondered if you might share with us your
perspectives on risks and opportunities you've identified over the last quarter or how things are shifting in your mind
and just your general sort of high-level thoughts on what direction you want to take the company in?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me answer that by giving you sort on an overview of how I see our portfolio and
businesses developing through the long-range planning process. Gulfstream will grow significantly in that timeframe,
and their margins will have improved.
Marine group will grow on increased revenue in submarine market throughout that period. IS&T has obviously
significant margin opportunity. And for Combat, we have sufficient international interest to bridge to a more robust
Army spending when the Army needs to recapitalize.
So, in general, I like where we – I like the offsetting cyclicality that we have embedded into our businesses. And in all
respects, we see a very clear way forward. Does that answer you?
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yes, it does.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question is from Jason Gursky, Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Just a couple of quick questions, one on the sequester and just generally talk about your
thoughts on sequester, and then, secondly, on cash deployments and update us there on your thoughts.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think that there is a enormous amount of specificity in the press about sequester
and the machinations that are going on in Washington. So there isn't much specifics that I can add, other than give you
some clarity about our business. Getting the full year FY 2013 funding bill was a major upside event for our planning.
That said, the final sequester impacts by program have not been communicated to us by our customer. If I think about
where, at least for 2013, we're likely to see some impact it would be in the Combat Systems' shorter cycle programs.
And that's why I think that the revenue may be a touch softer than I had anticipated.
But in general, we do not see sequester as a significant threat to 2013. Most of our sales are in our backlog. Cash
deployment – thanks, Erin – I think about cash deployment in three basic buckets: dividends – and this is for this year –
dividends; share repurchases; and strengthening our balance sheet. In March the board announced a 10% dividend
increase, the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases, that yielded a 3% yield. I think that was very wholesome.
And with respect to dividends. What you need to expect from us is consistency, predictability, and sustainability. I
think that that's important.
Share repurchases – you're going to see us throughout the remainder of the year act accordingly in shareholder friendly
ways with respect to share repurchases. And then given the charges in the fourth quarter, we need to strengthen our
balance sheet a touch. I don't see any acquisitions on the time – on my current time horizon but that doesn't mean if
there's something small and in our core that we wouldn't be interested in looking at it. But at the moment I've got
nothing, and that's fine. We continue to want to focus internally.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Thank you.

<Q - Yair Reiner>: Great. Thank you. Well, I can't resist asking about the Aero margins. Can you talk about the puts
and takes in the quarter? Obviously, a very strong performance there. And then, how we should think about the trends
sequentially for the balance of the year. Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: There were two primary drivers of our performance. One, Jet had a good quarter and
made a good contribution in excess of their plan. And second, we made progress on the 650 manufacturing margins in
dealing with the retrofit issues that we talked about during the last call.
As we begin to smoothe the transition between green deliveries and outfitting, we'll continue to see better margin
improvement. So as I think through the year, it's premature to increase our guidance. We need to work through the
remainder of our retrofit issues, which ought to clarify by the end of the second quarter.
And with respect to Jet, they have remedied and fixed their underlying operational problems. The key there to a
long-term value proposition is volume and completion. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about the
quarter-over-quarter and for the year. We've got some upside, but we're not ready to declare it yet until we get through
some of the retrofit issues. Okay?
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Thank you. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question is from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hello?
Operator
Please go ahead, your line is open. You may be on mute. Please go ahead, your line is open.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Let's take the next caller, please.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take the next question from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
Operator
Your line is open, Robert.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Yeah. Thank you very much. Actually I thought I'd rather follow up on Joe's earlier question on
Aerospace and the demand environment. I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing, particularly for the 450
and 550 and also what your, sort of, lead time is for an order to-date, because I think in the past you said you'd feel
comfortable with an 18-month lead time on those jets. Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Our pricing is holding up nicely on both the 450 and the 550 and we have sufficient
visibility into the year to be very comfortable with our production rates. And as we move into next year, we've got to
assess where we are in terms of the 450, 550. But to-date we're very comfortable. So we're slightly underneath that, the
window of 18 to 24 months, but not materially and not to any extent that would make us concerned. As I mentioned
earlier, it's really the mix. And we analyze that portion of the backlog in order to determine our production rates. So, so
far it's steady as she goes.

<Q - Rob Stallard>: Has there been any improvement on the G280 pricing?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We have some improvement as we begin to move that in, that airplane into the market
more robustly. We've got a fair amount of demand there and we like where we are. G280 is generating an awful lot of
interest, as we expected it would.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question is from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Phebe, if we could go back to Jet for a moment, I'm wondering with all the restructuring
there if you can frame for us what the business looks like today, the mix of business between Corporate Jet MRO and
completions, and relative size versus what it looked like when you first acquired it, and how that should then trend
going forward, so we have a better understanding of how that's supposed to look.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. So Jet is a smaller business than when we acquired it, primarily because we failed to
integrate Jet in a timely fashion. We have now solved all of the underlying performance issues, particularly – and not
on the MRO side, but particularly on the completion side. So the mix of business going forward there – this is how I
think about it – there is always a fair amount of volatility, particularly in Europe with respect to maintenance. And you
saw that we restructured that maintenance business to reflect the demand, and so far the demand for service is holding
up fairly well, given our expectations.
So, going forward, the issue for us is completions, both of Corporate Jets and then the large-body and narrow-body
major completion projects that we're perfectly capable of executing, and now that we've got the Gulfstream discipline
embedded and inculcated throughout Jet, we're likely to perform very well on. So I'm optimistic about where Jet sits.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Is there a...
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Next question -
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Go ahead.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: I was just going to say, is there a way to think about the mix of completions versus MRO?
Since you bought the business, clearly some of the other corporate jet manufacturers have gone elsewhere. But you still
have your captive business. You still have the heavy jet business. And so...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, We do. And I think you'll see completions becoming a larger part of the backlog
going forward, and that has addition – I like that because it's got additional margin and cash generation opportunity.
So, as a mix, we're likely to move more into completions and with a steady undercurrent and undergirding of service,
which I – the service industry or the service business, which I think we have right-sized appropriately.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: When do you think you'll hit your target margins there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think, we've got to bring in the revenue – some additional revenue. And when we
do that, we'll – probably, in the next year or two, we ought to be able to see some real upside.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Thank you very much.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Phebe, I wanted to try to dive into Combat a little further. Perhaps you can walk us through the
major moving pieces that drove the larger than expected revenue decline in the quarter.
And then when you sit back and look at the longer-term view on this segment – it's come down somewhat significantly
off the peak, but is still a much, much larger business than it was a long time ago. When you consider all the different
inputs to the scenario analysis, maybe you could share with us sort of a range of potential outcomes where you think
this business bottoms given what could happen with sequestration and what you're expecting internationally, et cetera.
Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, so revenues for the quarter-over-quarter, or the year – quarter – first quarter 2012
versus first quarter 2013 were lower. But I have to tell you that was well within our expectation, and with respect to
both earnings and revenue, Combat Systems outperformed their plan. So our plan was built on a presumption of softer
orders and – softer sales in the first quarter and then building through the year.
I have factored in now the impact of sequestration into Combat estimates. And so we may see a touch lighter overall
sales for the year, but not much. So I think we have stabilized with respect to our current order book and the key for us
is executing and delivering into our backlog some of the large international orders that we're continuing to work. Once
we get those in, then we'll be a little bit easier to give you some additional view, and others, some additional clarity
around the long-term prospects.
But Combat, we're not going to chase revenues and I think I mentioned that to you all on the last call. And we'll right
size our business to the revenues that we have currently, hence our good margin performance. What we'll promise you
all is margin expansion and cash generation. And you got to meet the market where the market is. That said, we have
very, very nice and robust international orders that ought to bridge until the Army begins to recapitalize.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Just quickly I guess on the Combat is, I just wanted to ask a question. You haven't explicitly
said it, but I assume you're still comfortable with your current earnings outlook that you provided back in January. And
when you say a touch lighter for Combat, what – how does that vary to the minus 6% you talked about back in
January?
And then, I just wanted a little clarification on the international order, because I thought it was really one order, but the
way you referred to it was multiple transactions. So can you help us think through some of what you're pursuing there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. We're looking at about, perhaps around an 8% versus 6% decline for the year. And
I'm very comfortable with that estimate. I think we've de-risked with respect to sequestration. If you recall, it was not
part of – sequestration and the impact of it was not part of our original guidance.
But operating margins are expected to be higher and so it's going to leave us pretty much on track with respect to our
operating earnings. The – we have a series of transactions, international transactions that we're continuing to work the
Ts and Cs on. And while I'm a little reluctant to give any specificity on when we expect to have them closed, we see no
reason that they won't close. And hopefully, and most probably, it will be in the second quarter.

Thank you. And your next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hello.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hi, Phebe. I wanted to pursue Gulfstream a little bit more – a little more detail. I assume
there wasn't any forfeiture income this year. And if you could compare the Jet profit to what it was last year. And then
I'm guessing the book-to-bill was above one if you just looked at it for 450s and 550s. And then just if you could tell us
how many 650 deliveries there were.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We had fewer defaults in this quarter than we did in the first quarter of 2012, which then
reduced our liquidated damages for this quarter, which is a good thing, in my mind. The 450 and 550 continue to be at
around 1:1. So we're comfortable in the quarter with where we are with respect to that. And your final question was –
remind me?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: 650.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: 650. We're not going to give you breakouts on our large cabin of what constituted the
large cabin sales by line. I don't think that that's healthy or helpful because we end up in a giant variance analysis. But I
will tell you that the preponderance of orders in the quarter, about 80% of them, were in the 450, 550 for large cabins.
So I hope that helps you.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. And then the other part of the question was how did Jet's performance compare to last
year's first quarter, the completions business? How much better was it?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Outstanding. We were breaking even last quarter and this quarter we made a considerable
amount of money so – for Jet, so I'm very pleased with where they are. The issue is just to keep it going.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: You don't want to quantify considerable any more?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning. Phebe, on sequestration, you obviously talked about 2013, not much of an
impact because most is in backlog. It would look like you still got about 25% that you have to secure through the
course of the year that could be subjected to sequestration, if you could comment on that. And then as we think about
2014, any initial thoughts on what we could be looking at in terms of the revenue environment for the Defense
businesses given sequestration?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. For 2013, I have given you my estimate of the impact from sequestration. While we
haven't had a lot of specificity from our customer, what we've been able to see is we've got a touch softness in Combat.
But if you step back, both with respect to IS&T and almost the entirety of our platform businesses, the sales are in
backlog, so 2013 is looking solid. And I don't see much of a risk to that at all. With respect to 2014, the President's
budget request was good for us in several respects. All of our shipbuilding programs were well supported and the
support for Stryker, the double-V hull exchange over the next five – or over the five-year plan, was especially
encouraging. Also, the Army's communication network modernization appears to be budgeted at a higher level than it
has in the past.
So while there is no way to estimate the extent of sequestration or additional budget cuts since, who knows how that's
all going to play out. But as we stand now, we like what we saw in the President's request. And I'll tell you something.
When I think back, putting my old budgeteer hat on, there are two kinds of programs that tend to be impacted in a
down environment – a revenue-constrained environment. Those are troubled programs and developmental programs.
And with respect to both, we are in very good shape. Our programs are all green, very, very good, solid performance,
and that's frankly the best antidote to the budgeteer's scalpel.
And in addition, new starts, we are comfortable where we are in the programs that are moving from development into
production. And so I got to tell you, I think we're pretty well positioned. As I said, performance sells.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Your next question, please.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very, very much.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Good performance, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So, to get back to the Aerospace margins, I mean, pretty clearly, you have – while you didn't
give us the numbers, you're going to have had more deliveries than the three G650s you did. So you had an adverse mix
shift.
And just kind of backing through an estimate of the numbers, it looks like profitability would have been better
year-over-year on the large biz-jets. Maybe give us a little more color, is that – given presumably you're in the midst of
rework there on the G650, it looks – either the 450 and 550 margins improved for the fourth quarter or the G650 was
considerably better. Is that correct? And maybe just -
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, let me walk you through some of that. The 450 and 550 are mature programs but
we're continuing to reap the benefits of process improvement. So our margins will continue – they have increased and
they'll continue to increase. With respect to the 650, we're moving down the learning curve in the green manufacturing
process, which is exactly what we anticipated.
And the uncertainty, where we don't have great clarity yet, is what is the running rate on margins and completions. But
with respect to 450, 550, margins were better, and the 650 on the green deliveries, we're coming down that learning
curve very, very nicely. And then we'll stabilize going forward as we work that retrofit imbalance through the
completions process.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Peter Arment, Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Phebe. I guess my question was very similar to Cai's. I guess another
way to characterize it is, I guess when your rework imbalance is completed in the second quarter, should we think that
– not to get ahead of ourselves on margins, but the mix in the second half of the year should look better than the first, is
that fair?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We will build through the course of the year, yes. But I'm not – I don't want to get you
guys there until we've really worked through this retrofit, because there's still risk out there. We're confident that we've
worked through the majority of it, no surprises. But until we rebalance green with completions, we're just not ready to
give you higher – or change our guidance. And we'll take a look at doing that at the end of the second quarter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: I appreciate that. If I could just squeeze in one last one, just on, unrelated but is – what is left
on the share buyback authorization?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Nine-point something million shares.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. Thanks very much, Phebe, congratulations.

Thank you. Your next question is from Bill Loomis, Stifel. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Hi. Thank you. Phebe, so just to be clear, the $6.60 to $6.70 guidance you gave, which did not
have sequestration in January, that that's post sequestration and the impact which you said is mostly some portion of
Combat, that now that would include sequestration?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, because as I pointed out, the softness was in – is in revenue, but our margins will
expand in Combat and so our earnings will be – operating earnings are going to be right on mark.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: And on the IS&T side on some of the shorter cycle, like Services business, you don't see a
sequestration impact or any pullback in business on that short cycle Services side?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. And in fact, our Services business is running better than 1:1 book-to-bill. And I like
how they're positioned. Let me give you a little bit more color with respect to Services. With – for the most part we find
competitions very, very wholesome. But there's a phenomenon that's occurring in the Service business that can be fairly
troubling to the overall customer satisfaction. And that is competition for price. We were not going to be – participate
in a race to the bottom.
In those instances where we don't believe there is sufficient price permitted in a particular bid or contract, we're going
to walk away. We've done that on occasion, but continuing to provide our customer with very good services and
products. And it's awful hard to do in an abnormally constrained price environment. So in those instances where we
can't live up to our promises, we're going to walk away. And I think that's appropriate and healthy.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Okay. And then – fine, just a quick one on Combat. You said a portion of Combat is going to be
impacted by sequestration, obviously not the longer cycle stuff. Can you just give us a little more detail on what is that
portion that might get impacted by sequestration that you're concerned about?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It's going to be in the shorter cycle products, some that fluctuate with the demand for the
war. Those tend to be more at risk if the supply is in excess of the demand. But as I say, it's not material and does not

Thank you. And your next question is from Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: I was hoping you could give us some color maybe on the sequential pattern of revenue
through the course of the rest of the year just so we're on the same page. I think the top line is something we've been
struggling with for a few quarters now, maybe just to baseline what the profile, in particular of Combat, is through the
course of the year to get to that $7.4 billion.
And then secondly, Phebe, is it fair to think that you're now comfortable with the portfolio and with what
sequestration's impact is so that share repurchase would really get restarted here with more aggressive fashion?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So with respect to Combat, we are, as I mentioned in the first quarter, above our revenue
plan and our earnings. And what we had anticipated performing to throughout the course of the year was a building,
quarter-over-quarter, of revenue. You may see some lumpiness in margins as we take the rest of our restructuring
charges in Europe. But we'll see a nice solid build quarter-over-quarter.
With respect to where we find ourselves in the cash and the balance sheet and the risk in the environment, as I said, we
had anticipated a very light order for cash. It came in much stronger but toward the end of the quarter. Once we were
comfortable that the cash was being generated as we were anticipating toward the end of the quarter, then we ventured
back into the market, but fairly late in the quarter. So, going forward I think you can expect us to participate in share
repurchases in a shareholder friendly manner.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay, thanks again.

Thank you. And the next question is from Ron Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Yeah, hey, good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Just maybe a bigger strategic question around Gulfstream. You had a lot of questions so far
on that. When you think about the 450 and 550 line, as you probably know, there has been some noise that there has
been some discussion about updating those planes or replacing those planes with something; how do you think about
that? When is the right time to do it? And if you can give us any color around how you think about that challenge.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, as you know, we several years ago, instituted a fairly disciplined R&D program to
refresh and replace our platforms, our airplanes as we move forward. We'll continue – we are continuing that. And we
will make announcements about any potential new planes when we're ready, when we know that with great certainty
that we can give you clarity around what it is and, more importantly, when it will be available. And we're not there yet,
and I'm not going to speculate. I don't think that does anybody any good.
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Yeah, no. Sure. And then maybe just one last question. On the mid-size, right, this quarter
you guys delivered five, compared to two last year. Can you give any description around what Gulfstream is seeing in
the mid-size market? Is there any pick-up, does it just happen to be timing and a little bumpy and that's why we got

more? What's going on there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. I'll tell you that the 280 is generating an awful lot of customer interest. It is a great
airplane that fills that niche. And frankly we got very, very robust sales pipeline, and we like what we see. So I...
<Q - Ronald J. Epstein>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: ... anticipate 280s to grow throughout the year.

Thank you. And your next question is from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: You resized the corporate staff, cut it by about 10%. And we've seen one or two other
business units that have followed suit. Do you expect most of the other business units to take this mandate and run with
it as well, and could you kind of elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the cost side to make the business more
affordable?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Both at the corporate headquarters and throughout our businesses, each one of our
businesses, we have an obligation to – through continuous improvement and some restructuring internally, to drive
costs out. And we've done that at the corporate headquarters and fairly significantly.
Many of our business units are already in the process of undertaking efficiencies in their back office functions as well
as in their production lines. But overhead, going after overhead is critical to margin expansion in a down environment.
So you can believe – and better believe – that we're going to be very, very focused on taking costs out, and we've done
it. And we'll continue to do it.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Just a follow-up on that. Does that lead to more business opportunities, and maybe you
could highlight one or two? Or does it end up just showing up on the bottom line?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think it's both. It clearly helps margins, but to the extent to which you can bring
down your prices, you're increasingly competitive. And we have done that across every one of our portfolios – across
all of our portfolios in almost all of our lines of business. So I see cost cutting and continuous improvement efficiencies
as central to our ability to win more business and increase our margins, and frankly, provide a superior product to our
customer.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Sue, I think we'll take one more question, please.

has head count reductions over the last five years. And I guess, just wondering if the next three to five years is going to

be materially different from that perspective. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We reduce head count in response to the business environment that we're faced with. So, I
certainly won't preannounce any restructuring, but you can rest assured that we will tackle our – all aspects of cost as
we go forward.
