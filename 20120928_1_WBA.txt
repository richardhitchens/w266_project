Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with some
perspective on the year and a review of our results for the quarter and the fiscal year. Second, I'll discuss the overall
strength and performance of our business. And, finally, I'll take a strategic look ahead to fiscal 2013. Then, I'll turn the
call over to Wade for a more detailed review of our quarter and full year performance and key considerations for fiscal
2013.
I want to begin today by putting fiscal 2012 into perspective. This was certainly a challenging year, capped off by a
tough fourth quarter, but a very important and strategic year for Walgreens. As you know, we started the year with the
critical decision to exit the Express Scripts network. This decision, despite the short-term ramifications to our business,
was absolutely the right one for our shareholders long term. That said, as you are aware, we were ultimately able to
reach an agreement with Express Scripts last July that met our core principles. With this now behind us, we are focused
on the many opportunities ahead, starting with our truly game-changing relationship with Alliance Boots to create the
first global pharmacy-led, health and well-being enterprise. As we've said before, this relationship will accelerate our
five core strategies. It creates an unmatched supply chain. Together, we will have the largest retail pharmacy
distribution network in the world and be the world's single-largest purchaser of prescription drugs and many other
health and well-being products. And, finally, it provides us with a platform for global expansion beyond the U.S. and
Europe, into new markets around the world.
We believe replicating this combination will be difficult, if not impossible, giving us tremendous first-mover
advantage. We also recently launched our innovative new loyalty program, Balance Rewards, which is our next step in
making Walgreens the first choice for health and daily living. This required replacing our decades' old point-of-sale
system with new state-of-the-art technology across the entire chain, and we continue to expand our well-experienced
stores, reaching 350 across the chain. As you know, we're combining cutting-edge design with an improved product
assortment including an enhanced mix of healthcare, beauty, fresh food, and private brand solutions to meet more
closely the needs of our communities and create an experience unmatched in the industry.
Finally, we continue to participate in the consolidation of both the traditional pharmacy and specialty pharmacy
markets with our recent acquisitions of USA Drug, Crescent Infusion, and the assets of BioScrip. These were key
strategic opportunities with top-notch talent and we welcome their team members into the Walgreen Company. As I
said at the open, it's been a very important and strategic year for Walgreens. We now have the structure, strategies, and
talent in place to drive both short-term and long-term performance.
With that, let's get into the numbers for the quarter. I'll begin today with our quarterly results. We'll be presenting
numbers on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and Wade will walk you through the details and the specific
adjustments later in the call.
As you saw in our release this morning, we reported fourth quarter sales of $17.1 billion, down 5% from $18 billion a
year ago. GAAP operating income or EBIT for the quarter was $586 million, down 53.7% compared to $1.3 billion at
the same time last year. Recall that GAAP figures from last year's quarter include the gain from the sale of Walgreens'
Health Initiatives, our pharmacy benefit manager. Adjusted operating income or EBIT for the quarter was $838 million,
down 12.6% from $950 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.39 in the fourth
quarter, compared to $0.87 last year, down 55.4%. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.63, down
4.5% from $0.66 in the same quarter last year.
Turning to our performance for the fiscal year; sales were essentially flat for the year even with our strategic decision
with regard to Express Scripts which represented about 11% of our prescription business in the prior year. This
performance illustrates the strength and diversity of our business. For the full year, we posted $71.6 billion in sales,
compared to $72.2 billion last year, down just 0.8%. It's important to note that overall sales would have increased by
1.2% without the impact of drug – generic drug conversions throughout the fiscal year, which affected sales by $1.4
billion.

GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, down 20.6% from $4.4 billion in fiscal 2011. Adjusted operating income for
the year was $4.1 billion, compared to $4.4 billion in 2011, down 6%. Our full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share
were $2.42, down 17.7% from $2.94 last year, again including the gain from the sale of WHI. On an adjusted basis,
earnings per diluted share were $2.93, flat compared to $2.93 in the same period the previous year. Finally, cash flow
from operations for fiscal 2012 was a record $4.4 billion, compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2011, and free cash flow
was also a record at $2.9 billion. And, we continued to return significant cash to shareholders throughout the year, with
$1.2 billion in share repurchases and $787 million in dividends.
In the fourth quarter, our gross profit dollar growth was down 4.6% or $234 million. Gross profit dollar growth was
down year-over-year as a result of the continuing impact of Express Scripts. SG&A dollar growth was up only slightly
in the quarter, increasing $12 million or 0.2%. After adjusting for the impact of Alliance Boots, SG&A dollar growth
was down $41 million or 1%. After adjusting for the LIFO provision, gross profit dollar growth declined $162 million
year-over-year. Although the adjusted gross profit dollars grew less than adjusted SG&A dollars, I'd like to underscore
that we were able to offset more than half of the gross profit dollar loss from Express Scripts with good SG&A control.
In fact, as you'll recall, we said that the impact of Express Scripts, after adjusting our costs, would be $0.21 for this
fiscal year and we delivered on that.
Now our multi-year agreement with Express Scripts signed in July means we are, once again, participating in their
broadest retail pharmacy network. On September 15, many of our valued customers started coming back to Walgreens.
As always, they will have the benefit of convenient access to the pharmacists they've known and trusted. We're pleased
to be back with plans and employers we've been partners with in the past, such as WellPoint and many others.
Although we're still very early in the process, with only 12 days of welcoming customers back to Walgreens, we're
encouraged by the early results.
I look at the pace of return process like this: to me, there are really three buckets. First, there are people who will come
back right away. They are our most loyal patients who value our convenience and who've had long relationships with
us and that's who's been – who we've been seeing in the first couple of weeks. The second bucket includes the people
who will need a little convincing and that's what we have our marketing plans in place for, including our $25 gift card
to transfer their prescriptions back as well as our Balance Rewards program. The third bucket is a little tougher and
we'll see how the return works there over time. We'll certainly have a much better read on customers returning to
Walgreens over the next three to four months as more employers and health plans are able to communicate the changes
to their people and as new plan changes take effect at the first of the year.
Now, I know some of you may want specific numbers on returning customers. However, as I'm sure you can
understand, these numbers are competitively sensitive. Therefore, we think the best and most accurate way to track this
and our underlying business in the months ahead is through our monthly sales and prescription comps. This is because
our comps reflect not only returning customers, but customers who have switched from one plan to another as well as
new business and that's how we'll be tracking our progress as we focus on growing our prescription market share
overall. Moving forward, we think we are very well positioned to gain market share not only through Express Scripts
members returning to Walgreens, but also through many other partners who have been – we've been quite successful
with in broadening and deepening our relationship throughout the past year. In addition, we have probably never been
better positioned heading into the Med Part D season this fall.
Now, let me turn to our innovative loyalty program, Balance Rewards, as we continue to enhance our customer
experience. We launched the program online in early September and nationally on September 16. We've seen great
responses to launch, signing up nearly 12 million customers in stores, online, and by mobile, and we are significantly
ahead of our forecasts. As the initial couple of weeks show, we took the time to do loyalty right and we've launched a
program that provides real value for Walgreens and our customers. Balance Rewards is unlike any other program on
the market. It's linked to our Well brand strategy and designed to foster long-term loyalty among our customers, rather
than simply providing cash back for purchases. It's designed to be more engaging, more aspirational, and more
explicitly anchored to health and wellness. Compared to other programs, Balance Rewards provides more value for our
customers. Our points are valid for three years, they gain more value the more a member earns, and they can be used
instantly at the cash register as soon as a member reaches 5,000 points. Balance Rewards points can be earned and

redeemed at all Walgreens and Duane Reade stores and online at Walgreens.com, while in other retail programs,
customers can only earn benefits in the stores. And, finally, Balance Rewards members receive points for healthy habits
like "Walk with Walgreens". To develop a program that would lead the industry, we depended on a talented team with
deep expertise in loyalty and learned from Duane Reade's highly successful program. We'll continue to enhance our
program, exchanging best practices with our new partner, Alliance Boots, which has the leading loyalty program in
Europe. Overall, we believe this will be the largest, most powerful, and most successful loyalty program in retail.
In the quarter, we also made progress on our strategy to expand into new channels and markets, closing on the first
phase of our transactions with Alliance Boots. With a 45% stake in the company, we've begun the real work of the
transaction, with the goal of becoming the leader in global pharmacy-led health and well being. We closed a very
successful $4-billion public debt offering, replacing our bridge facility. We capitalized on strong demand in the market
to get attractive rates across our maturities and up-sized the deal a bit to lock in additional long-term capital.
We also established our shared Board governance structure, placing representatives from each company on the other's
Board of Directors. In addition, we recently realigned our organization to accelerate our strategies and to support our
partnership with Alliance Boots. As part of that reorganization, Wade takes on an expanded leadership role at
Walgreens; a global role as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and President, International. In this
broader role, Wade will lead the development of our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots and other potential
international partnerships.
As I've said before, this partnership gives us the platform to accelerate our key growth strategies. We have
cross-functional teams from both companies, who are looking for ways to bring together these two iconic brands. We're
already sharing best practices in areas such as loyalty and e-commerce. We're also exploring opportunities to capitalize
on Alliance Boots' expertise in owned brands and beauty, while at the same time-sharing our knowledge in pharmacy
operations. Working together, we also have the opportunity to create an unmatched supply chain with the scope and
scale no competitor can equal. We've begun setting up joint ventures to realize $100 million to $150 million in
combined synergies from the partnership in the first year and more than $1 billion in combined synergies by 2016. To
support the joint ventures, we've set up six new global synergy teams in coordination with our partners at Alliance
Boots and both companies have committed a number of key leaders to these teams. And, finally, we have the
opportunity for global expansion beyond the U.S. and Europe. You may have seen most recently that Alliance Boots
announced their intent to acquire a 12% stake in Nanjing Pharmaceutical Company, the fifth largest pharmaceutical
wholesaler in China. We also see tremendous opportunity in Asia and other parts of the world as we move forward with
this strategic partnership.
In closing, fiscal 2012 was a reflection of the hard work, tough decisions, and strategic investments that have
established the foundation for future growth and value creation for our customers, our shareholders, and all of our
stakeholders. As we turn the page on this year, we have tremendous opportunities to continue to accelerate our
strategies and expand our purpose to help customers get, stay, and live well around the world. As a result of the
decisions and actions made this year, we now have the structure, strategy, and talent in place to drive our operating
performance forward into the future for some time to come.
Thank you. And, with that, I'll turn the call over to Wade.
Wade D. Miquelon
Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us on the call. This morning I'll take you
through our quarterly results and update key considerations for the final quarter of fiscal 2012.
As you can see with our results today, we have begun reporting our performance on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted
basis and we plan to continue to do that as we go forward. Why are we doing this? A few reasons.
First, we believe our adjusted numbers provide good additional perspective of our normalized underlying business
performance. Second, these adjustments are very consistent with how many of our key competitors and peers report

their business so it provides for better a comparison in that regard. And, third, with our recent and large Alliance Boots
transaction, we feel that now is a good time and helpful time to initiate this change. And, lastly, many in the investment
community have commented to us that this additional perspective would be value-added.
Our non-GAAP adjustments include a LIFO provision, hence converting earnings to FIFO, special charges or gains
such as costs associated with large acquisitions or divestitures, and finally amortization related to acquisitions and
divestitures.
For the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.39 based on 895 million shares diluted. To get to the adjusted EPS for
the quarter, you need to add back the LIFO provision which was $0.10 per share; the special charges related to the
closing of Alliance Boots investment and this $0.09 charge includes transaction expenses, interest expense and the
effects of share issuance and non-deductible expenses for tax related to the transaction; and finally, $0.05 for existing
acquisition-related amortization in the quarter. The sum of these yield an adjusted EPS of $0.63 for the quarter and, as
Greg stated earlier, this result is versus an adjusted EPS of $0.66 in the year-ago quarter. Also keep in mind that since
we will be reporting Alliance Boots using equity method accounting on a one-month lag, no Alliance Boots income is
included in our reported net income on a GAAP or adjusted basis this fiscal year or fiscal quarter.
Compared to the prior year's quarter, the strategic decision to not be part of Express Scripts pharmacy network as of
January 1, 2012, impacted our quarterly results by a net $0.06 per diluted share including cost controls and a total of
$0.21 per diluted share for the fiscal year, consistent with our previously stated estimate.
For historical perspective, we are providing both GAAP and adjusted EPS data for the last 12 quarters and three fiscal
years. Note that GAAP EPS for fiscal 2012 is $2.42 versus $2.94 in fiscal 2011, while the adjusted EPS of $2.93 in
fiscal 2012 was equal to the adjusted EPS of $2.93 in fiscal 2011, and as you can see, the adjusted data is helpful in
understanding the normalized business performance.
Now let me provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. As you may already know, comparable
scripts in the quarter were impacted by the loss of the Express Scripts business. Comparable prescription sales
decreased by 12.8%, comparable front-end sales decreased by 1.3% over a strong prior-year period, and total comp
sales decreased 8.7%. Comparable prescriptions filled decreased 8%, and comparable prescription sales were down to a
much greater degree, primarily due to the increased introductions of new generics.
This slide clearly illustrates the impact on comparable store script numbers for the latest three quarters were we not part
of the Express Scripts network versus the prior year. The comp store script trends were down 8% in the fourth quarter,
which was a sequential improvement over the third quarter which was down 9.1%, while the two year stack was
essentially flat.
Moving to our front-end, traffic in the quarter decreased by 3.2% and basket size increased by 1.9%, and the front-end
comp decreased by 1.3%. The primary drivers behind these decreases were the impact of Express Scripts and the move
to rebalance our overall promotional spending which we believe is directionally right. While we achieved a solid
margin benefit, we will continue to work to strike the best balance between sales and profitable growth. Here also the
two-year stack was essentially flat.
Turning to margin, our FIFO gross margin was 29.1% in the current quarter compared to 28.5% last year, a
60-basis-point improvement. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of new generics and were partially offset by
reimbursement and specialty pharma mix. The front-end was positively impacted by OTC drug, household, and
personal care categories, offset by e-commerce mix which has solidly contributed gross profit dollars but at a lower
margin than our balance of the business. We are pleased with the performance of Walgreens.com as well as the
drugstore.com acquisition which continues to exceed our baseline expectations.
Taking a look at our longer-term gross margin trends, it's important to note that this quarter's 60-basis-point
improvement was against a 20-basis-point decrease a year ago. The margin trend is reflective of the impact of our new
promotional and pricing strategy in health and daily living and the impact of generics on the pharmacy.

On a GAAP basis, two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends continue to improve, in part driven by cost
interventions we took to help offset the loss of Express Scripts business in the quarter. Net of the special charges
related to Alliance Boots and the acquisition-related amortization, SG&A in the quarter was down $41 million behind
excellent cost control. Two-year stacked adjusted SG&A trends dramatically improved versus a year ago with 3.4%
growth in the fourth quarter of 2012, down from 15.2% last year. The current quarter's decrease was primarily a result
of lower comparable store expenses and lower headquarter expenses which were partially offset by SG&A related to
investments in the business.
With respect to managing our store labor expenses, I want to personally extend a thank you to all of our team members
for again pulling together this quarter and the entire fiscal year. To get to our adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can
see that our reported SG&A dollar growth of 0.2% included 120 basis points of Alliance Boots transaction-related
costs, resulting in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of negative 1%. These costs are primarily related to legal and advisory
fees.
This slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar trend for the past eight quarters on a GAAP basis and the next
slide will show the same information on an adjusted basis. The trend in the adjusted gross profit dollar growth data
shows the impact of the loss of Express Script customers. Gross profit dollar growth slowed from a positive 3.2% in the
first quarter versus a negative 3.2% in the fourth quarter and please bear in mind this wide range of gross profit dollar
growth as you think about our quarterly performance in fiscal year 2013.
Even though we're winning back Express Scripts customers, this quarter comparison will be difficult until we cycle the
first of the calendar year. Following the same construct, this slide shows SG&A growth trends for the past eight
quarters on a GAAP basis and the next slide shows the same information on an adjusted basis. The adjusted SG&A
dollar growth trend again highlights the effort made by the company to offset the loss of the gross profit dollars related
to Express Scripts. Adjusted SG&A dollar growth slowed from roughly 4% to 5% in the first half of the year to a
negative approximately 1% to 2% in the second half of the fiscal year.
The fourth quarter showed slightly higher adjusted SG&A dollar growth versus the third quarter but this was primarily
due to added expenses for new investments in the business that I referred to earlier. Focusing on our income statement,
this quarter included a LIFO provision of $132 million versus $60 million a year ago. The key driver behind the higher
LIFO reserve was overall brand pharmacy inflation which accelerated significantly in the quarter to almost two times
the rate a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the year was 3.3%, up from 2.4% a year ago. Net interest expense was
$37 million including the impact of the Alliance Boots acquisition, up from $15 million a year ago. Our effective tax
rate was 35.8% versus 36.7% last year. Average diluted shares outstanding were 895 million shares. The change in
shares are primarily due to the impact of share repurchases, partially offset by the one-month impact of the 83.4 million
shares issued due to the Alliance Boots investment versus 911 million shares a year ago. And, shares outstanding at the
end of the fiscal were 944 million shares.
Cash and cash equivalents were $1.3 billion versus $1.6 billion a year ago, with the reduction largely driven by our
commitment to return cash to shareholders and invest in strategic opportunities. Overall, working capital decreased by
15.9% versus a year ago, heavily benefited by lower inventory levels. Accounts receivable decreased by 13.2%, while
accounts payable decreased by 8.9%. Improvements in inventory management, both in underlying performance and
adjustments to manage the Express Scripts situation led to a 12.5% decrease in total inventories. On inventory, total
FIFO inventory decreased by 7.3% in the quarter versus a 0.8% decrease in total sales, and FIFO inventories decreased
by 9.3% on a per store basis. Now, also remember that some inventory will build back as Express Scripts customers
return to Walgreens.
During the fourth quarter, we generated $768 million in cash from operations, up 112% from $362 million a year ago,
and we continued our strong cash flow trends. Free cash flow in the quarter was $320 million. For the fiscal year, we
generated a record $4.4 billion in cash from operations, up 22% from fiscal 2011, largely driven by a solid operating
performance and strong working capital management. And, for the fiscal year, free cash flow was also a record at $2.9
billion and up 19% from the prior year.

As one of our core capital allocation priorities, we continue to return surplus cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter
we returned $194 million in dividends. For the fiscal year 2012, we returned $1.9 billion, including approximately $787
million in dividends and $1.2 billion through share repurchases. Given our Alliance Boots transaction, we do not
anticipate additional share repurchases in the near term.
This fiscal year, we also increased the quarterly dividend rate by 22.2% to 27.5 cents per share, consistent with our
previously stated goal of returning cash to shareholders through dividends with a targeted dividend payout ratio of 30%
to 35%. We are proud to have paid a dividend for 319 straight quarters, more than 79 years, and we have now increased
our dividend for the 37th consecutive year. For the past five years, Walgreens' annual dividend rate has increased from
$0.38 per share to $1.10 per share, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of nearly 24%.
Let me transition now to Alliance Boots and our fiscal year 2016 goals. We continue to believe that the strategic fit,
financial returns, and step-wise execution of this partnership is going to be a great thing for our stakeholders. As Greg
said, our efforts to deliver real synergies, enhance capabilities, and change the strategic landscape in the U.S., Europe
and other geographies around the world are off to a very solid start. We shared our Walgreens-Alliance Boots 2016
goals with you on the day of our strategic partnership announcement and I want to briefly revisit those with you now.
At that time, we showed you a LIFO operating income goal of $8.5 billion to $9 billion. To stay in sync with our
go-forward adjusted reporting framework, we are also providing an adjusted operating income goal of $9 billion to $9.5
billion for fiscal year 2016. In addition, we provided a fiscal year 2016 goal of approximately $7 billion of operating
cash flow. With further financial model refinement, we are changing our fiscal year 2016 goal to be approximately $8
billion. All other stated goals remain the same, such as our $0.23 to $0.27 fiscal year 2013 accretion goal excluding
special items; our $100 million to $150 million fiscal year 2013 combined synergy goal, leading to a combined synergy
goal of $1 billion or more by fiscal 2016; and at the end of fiscal 2016, a combined net debt of $11 billion or less.
While we realize that this accounting period is complex given items such as the transaction-related charges and the
one-month reporting lag, our pro forma financial information filed with our debt offering and our next quarter earnings
release should help to provide more clarity. We are anticipating that in fiscal year 2013 we will have approximately
$0.05 of special items associated with the transaction, such as advisory fees associated with legal entity establishment,
expatriate moves, and key dedicated resources. Also, during the first quarter in fiscal 2013, we will recognize
approximately $25 million of expense related to the inventory step-up component of our Alliance Boots investment
which is amortized over the first inventory turn in addition to other transaction-related amortization.
This slide illustrates the rate and maturity schedule for our recent $4-billion debt offering. The offering was extremely
well executed and well received by the market. The weighted average rate for the $4 billion was just over 2.2%, with a
weighted average maturity of 8.7 years. Our current balance sheet debt portfolio is $6.4 billion which has a weighted
average maturity of 6.8 years with an average rate of approximately 2.75% including our interest rate swaps and
assuming current LIBOR rates.
Our capital allocation policy has changed only modestly. We intend to continue to invest in our core strategies such as
our new stores, Well Experience journey, loyalty, and the multi-channel experience. And, we will continue to invest in
strategic opportunities to support and reinforce our core. We will continue to return cash to shareholders in the form of
dividends. And, finally, our intent is to continue to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet.
In closing, while we've had some challenges in the quarter, we had many significant milestones which set us up very
well for the future. Overall, we were pleased with our year. Given these challenges, we still had solid margins,
exceptional expense management, record cash flow, and returned significant cash to shareholders. But, importantly, we
continue to move our business forward against our key strategies including our continued investment in our Well
Experience pilot stores which hold strong promise moving forward. We invested and successfully deployed
best-in-class technologies such as our new POS system. And, we expanded our omni-channel leadership in health and
well being. We launched our new Balance Rewards program which is off to a strong start. And, we dramatically
accelerated and enhanced our private brand portfolio.

We continue to expand in community pharmacy services through new and enhanced offerings such as our 90-day
launch, broadened vaccination and immunizations, and we formed deeper partnerships with many key players including
managed care, pharma, PBMs, hospital systems, physician networks, and employers. And, we also embarked on a truly
watershed journey for our country as Walgreens and Alliance Boots work together to create what we believe will
become the global leader in the pharmacy-led health and well being space. With combined retail stores and distribution
touch points of more than 180,000 in 26 countries, I believe we are well positioned to change the paradigm in our
industry as the world's largest, most relevant and importantly most innovative player in our space. Together, we are
well positioned for growth, uniquely positioned to leverage our mutual capabilities and assets for our customers and
suppliers, and confidently positioned for delivering synergies and creating value.
No doubt, this year has been one with many ups and downs given the stance that we took for the long-term shareholder
value. And, for all of you who stood by us, I want to thank you for all of your support. We will continue to work hard
to deliver on our commitments to you.
And, with that, I turn the call back over to Greg.
Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Thank you. Good morning. Wade, on your exposition on the net number for the impact from
Express Scripts, I think you've talked about there is a lot of labor taken out and other costs but I assume mainly labor.
And, I think you've talked about as that business can come back that that could be leveraged at a rate where the variable
costs, the labor doesn't have to come back at the same rate. Could you just give us an update on your thinking in that
regard?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah. That's absolutely true. Most of the costs we took out will not come back. What we
will do is we will do things – where we see higher volumes of Express, we will put the proper labor back and
adjustments like that. But, for the most part, I would say that we have very strong leverage on it and most of the costs
will not come back.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. So, it's just going to be – as we're trying to model things mechanically, would it be – if
we came up to an estimate of how much cost was taken out, would it be fair to say maybe half of it would come back
once – a year from now or so...?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: With respect to store labor, we took for a 9%, 10% loss, whatever, in pharmacy sales. We
took out, I think, 2% or so of our labor. So, you have a ratio there of 4 or 5 to 1. So, we'll make the right interventions
to make sure that we have the right service levels and take care of our patients. But, really, a lot of the other efforts that
we did to be more focused with respect to projects corporately, efforts we made across COGS and other things, those
are sustainable interventions.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. And, the other question I'd like to ask before moving on to the next is, if you do the
adjusted EPS and add back the Express Scripts' impact, you get about a 5% growth this quarter, 7% for the year. And, I
wonder if you could expand upon are there any opportunity costs, let's say, lost front-end sales for example that are not
necessarily quantified but – that you either can expand upon or perhaps even quantify? Thank you.

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I think your math is probably fairly close. I think – one thing is obviously – there
have been some challenges in the overall economy, but I think as we go forward, I guess what I would say from this
point forward, I see that we have good tailwinds. I think we have the Express Scripts situation behind us and so,
whatever we win back, we'll win back but that will be a tailwind. We've got – as Greg said, we're very well situated
with many of the other players and we feel that we're going to be well versed to gain share. We've got the loyalty
program which has been invested in heavily upfront and now it's off and running very successfully. And we have the
Alliance Boots close and the initiation of the work behind us as well, and so now we move forward with them into our
forecast for growth and accretion. So I think you probably have a pretty good framework there and I think moving
forward I would just put that on top of it.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And, Andy, I would add, a lot of the work that we've done over the past year, such as our
effort to really accelerate private brand, the completion of CCR last spring, the enhanced products we're putting in with
fresh food, immediate meal consumption, so forth, all that we feel very good about being – delivering strong tailwinds
for us.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: The way you calculate the $0.06 and $0.21, that's a pharmacy-only? Or is that trying to
include front-end?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That includes the front-end as well.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. And just lastly, it's a technical question on the LIFO charge, was way higher than I
think I expected and probably everyone else and inventories were down a lot for the year, does this happen to be
something to do with the layers you got into were more inflationary? It's just sort of a much bigger swing that I
would've thought, if you could just give us an explanation of that? Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I mean it's pretty simple, is what I said. Even there's a – even though there is a lot of
different moving parts that happen in the calculations, the reality is that the brand inflation in the fourth quarter, and
particularly in July and August, I believe we had last year around 2.5%, in the quarter it was about 5%, so almost
doubling. So when you consider the size of our brands and brands in inventory those kind of movements have a huge
impact. That doesn't mean that we'll sustain back and forth, I think part of the point of going adjusted, especially the
FIFO is, is that it's a much clearer picture of how our operations and our business, and our profitability comes in, than
the LIFO. So it's an additional perspective that will allow people to see our business, both on maybe more of a
normalized perspective or this additional perspective, but also how others view it.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: So that's branded pharma or the front-end?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That was branded pharma. It was...
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: ...the – not the generic piece, but the branded pharma piece, in particular the inflation was
again basically double of what we saw a year prior and it really kicked up in July and August with three or four brands
in particular.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Got it. All right, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Andy.

<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Greg, I wanted to ask, you mentioned the three buckets, as far as how you look at the
customer recovery process. Could you comment, I guess, based on your past experience, what maybe the relative sizes
of those buckets are thought to be?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, David, it's kind of hard to say. I think certainly bucket one typically is the easiest
and most quickly to come back and, that's what I said on the call, we're seeing that. It really comes down to three
things; convenience, the relationship and service that these folks were forced away from and we think we win in all
three of those. I think we're extremely convenient, we think that we've had folks who, in that first bucket especially,
who've had relationships over the years and we give great service. I think we'll find out more and more as we get into
this.
There's a lot of things that come into that. As we've seen clients sending communication to their members. They come
back quickly. And that's the reason I said, as more plans notify their members, I think we'll see probably bucket two
become even easier for us. So it's hard to dimensionalize, but I tried to put it in those three buckets just so you can also
understand our spend because I think there's also some concerns or thoughts out there that we're going to get into a
price war for these patients. And we're certainly going to spend our marketing dollars strategically across those three
buckets and get the ROI that we need or we expect to get from that.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Thanks, Greg. And then just secondly, can you talk a little bit about the – what you're
seeing with reimbursements in the U.K. for Boots and what the prospects are there over the next 12 months?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, I think there is some noise along the lines of the reimbursement cuts that the U.K.
or England put into place last week. I think the main thing is that was absolutely budgeted and anticipated by Alliance
Boots. They've been in this – doing this for years and obviously that's an annual adjustment, so it was expected, so it
won't impact their budget or their performance and therefore, also won't impact our accretion numbers as well.
<Q - David Glenn Magee>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, David.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi, guys. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning, Ed.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Can I just ask a quick follow up on the U.K. reimbursement question before I get into another
question?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Sure.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Did you quantify what the impact is going to be on Alliance Boots there?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I would say, what Greg said, is that basically versus their budget and versus our
accretion number, there is no impact. There has basically been austerity measures every year, at least for the last three
years, in England and with respect to the formula and the claw-back and the provision and how they budgeted it, it was
pretty much expected.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: And, Wade, as we think about this business going forward, is this – and we're obviously not
all familiar with the U.K., but is this something that we need to really focus on pretty strongly around this time of the
year? Because it does seem like it was a decent size cut.

Page 11 of 17
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I can tell you that the Alliance Boots folks are far more expert than myself, but after deep
discussions with them and getting to understand it, it is – this is something that continues to go forward year after year
after year, but basically inherent in the overall – it's much more complex than on the surface than inherent model of
mix, the move toward generics, the other pay-for-service fees, they believe that they've got the forecast budgeted in
their model and they're very well predicting that. So it's something I would not concern yourself with, I would say that
it is in our next year estimate and it's also inherent in our 2016 goals with respect to their best knowledge.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And now that you've closed on the deal and you're almost a couple months in, thinking
more about synergies, that type of stuff, how do you feel relative to the accretion estimate that you gave initially? Is
there potential for upside?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, we're certainly – Ed, we're certainly confident in the number we gave, and for a
variety of reasons. The majority of that is cost opportunities and we've got the synergy teams in place that have been
working on this, frankly, even months before we closed to give us some real insights as to what's available. And the
more we work together and the more they spend time together, the more confident we get in the number. Do we think
there's additional opportunity out there? I think typically when you bring two organizations, like this, together certainly
you find additional opportunities that you didn't anticipate to begin with. But we want to make sure we deliver the
number we gave and we feel very confident we can do that.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And then on Express Scripts, I know you guys have been optimistic about the amount
of customers you're going to win back. Do you have some expectation there that you could share with us in terms of
what you think you'll get back for 2013?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, I think, it's – we don't want to get in the game of predicting the future because it's
impossible to fully predict. We've got a lot of history of being out of networks in the past. We've had some Express
customers come back over the past few months. We have a variety of data points. I think that, as Greg said, we're pretty
confident that a significant number of them came to us in the first place because they preferred our format, our location,
our service, our relationships. So that's the reason I think that we're going to see a significant number of them come
back.
I mean, initially you've seen obviously a lot of players doing very aggressive promotional things to try to maintain
them, but we're still seeing good customer flow-back. But at the end of the day, the reality is you can't promote forever
too, people will ultimately choose the pharmacy that's the best choice for them broadly. And I think as Greg talked
about the three buckets and sort of a time-flow through that of the ones that come first, but then others over time also
chose you for a reason and I think that we're going to continue to win back customers not only in the short-term, but
over many long periods of time. So this a very long tailwind, quite frankly.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And, Ed, that's the reason we think it's important to really focus on the comps, as I said,
because not only – obviously, as the ESI customers return, it's going to impact our comp, but there's a lot of moving
parts, folks are moving from one plan to another and certainly we'll be picking up the business there. But also – and I
really want to emphasize this, in addition to trying to work through it and reach an acceptable agreement with Express
Scripts, which we're glad we did and met our core principles, we were out working all year long with all of our other
partners to build relationships to grow our share there. And frankly, we feel very good with how we're positioned in the
total marketplace to grow our total comp.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And I assume that the more scripts you get, the higher the incremental margin on those
scripts are going to be and obviously there's some upfront spending on advertising and I've seen some other stuff you're
doing in the marketplace. So can you give us some sense as to what percentage of that business you have to win back
before you break-even to start and then start moving into the black?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, I would say this. I would just say that some of the estimates on the upside I've seen
are wildly and grossly exaggerated when you get the actual math of what it costs in promotional spend. And I think the
reality is, is that for the most part, it's incremental profit almost from the get-go. Yes, there's some marketing spend but
the reality is, is when you understand how it's executed and how the mix works, each script brings incremental value.

<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay...
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: So, again, I think there are some numbers out there, which maybe don't fully contemplate
how the spending actually works.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And just last question for you on gross margin. I actually thought that it would've been
a little better this quarter because generics did ramp and you mentioned your comparison being easier. I guess my
question is what are we learning about the generic wave so far? And then how should we think about the FIFO gross
margin over the next couple of quarters as the waves continues to grow? Is there still upside to do better from here over
the next couple of quarters?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yes, good question. I would say that kind of year-on-year our gross profit dollars [ph]
proxy (48:24) what we really look at, were basically roughly similar. We had some benefit from generics. We had a
little offset from some overall – we had very high 90-day growth, which is overall net gross profit dollar a positive and
a good payout, but a little bit lower there for the benefit we provide. And then some other general compression and a
little bit of year-on-year vendor mix but I think we feel that our rates are fundamentally very solid. I don't think we've
ever felt that we've had a commercial book that is stable across the players and has good solid long-term relationships.
With respect to the generic wave, we'll continue to benefit throughout fiscal 2013 but one thing we've also done
through many of our contracts is we've really worked hard to, I guess, I would say, put in constructs that allow us to get
good rates, not just through generic waves but beyond thereafter. So versus having a very volatile and riding the ups
and downs as heavily, I think that we've put in what I would call good sustainability into our rate structure and that's
what I think you're going to see for a long period to come.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And that, Ed, we think makes sense for the long-term. So to reemphasize what Wade's
saying is, we think that setting ourselves up so that we have predictable, sustainable reimbursements with our generics
over the life of relationship versus the high volatility we may get in the first six months and then not having control or
predictability throughout the life of the contract absolutely makes sense for us long-term. We also – I would add as well
is that we also work with a few of our key partners and made some minor market adjustments to help them be
competitive in the marketplace and therefore, also put us in a preferred position with them to help win business.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thank you, Ed.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Mark.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: So, the question on the generic drugs, maybe for Kermit. Do we still have the peak of the
profit period ahead of us on generics? And when do you think we start to roll off of the very strong margin period from
this wave of generics we're in right now?
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Well, Mark, we are certainly at the peak of the generic wave in 2013 as we look at our
fiscal year and we will begin to roll off as we get more into 2014 but certainly with the Lipitor, Plavix, Seroquel,
Lexapro, we're right in the peak of that generic wave right now and 2013 will be one of our better years.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Okay. And for Wade, just a little more follow up on the U.K. cuts there on reimbursement
rates. Is there some concern that this could kind of filter across to the wholesale business for Alliance as well as time
progresses? And with all the governments under fiscal pressure wouldn't there be some risk of those reimbursement
rates coming down kind of across Europe?

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, look, the austerity in Europe in healthcare and single-payer system is nothing that's
new. I think that the dynamics there and the reason the business performs very solidly there and we believe will
continue to do so are many. One is they run a very good business, very differentiated in terms of how they work with
not only their customers but also with their suppliers and so you see that in various agreements that are exclusive or
preferred. But separately, what you've seen across Europe and will continue to see is more and more governments
pushing for more generics versus brands as a key lever to save money and in Southern Europe, generic penetration is
only 30%, in Northern Europe it's at 50%. So they can make as a wholesaler as well as retailer, because the wholesale
can make better penny profit on generics, which can save governments money and is good for them. It's only the
wholesale chain because are so many independents is a vital part of the ecosystem of healthcare in Europe. You have to
have wholesalers and pharmacies are very valued but they play a very vital role in distributing and serving them.
And secondly is you are going to see that apart from that, continue to see more pharma companies to save money as
they get pressure from the governments, they're actually outsourcing more and more activities to the healthcare
distributors like Alliance and that's allowing them to really ladder-up and value-up because they can do things that are
more cost effectively for Big Pharma and so that's another win.
And then finally, the European wholesale market is not as consolidated as it is in North America. There's lots of smaller
players and so some of the tougher economies they're just having a harder time funding, keeping standards up and
service levels, whatever, and that gives Alliance an opportunity to continue to grow and continue to capture share. So, I
think the dynamics, again, this is not new to Europe but the dynamics actually in the wholesale business being a vital
part of the ecosystem and being such a low margin business actually has a lot of good momentum from this as well.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Okay. And, Greg, just a little more color on that third bucket, it sounds like it's going to be a
little harder to get those people to switch back. You had alluded to some plan changes and some other factors there.
What other things could we look for to kind of win back that third group that's difficult to transfer back?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, Mark, I think probably time but also as far as the plans, there'll be some plans that
have changed, are going to another plan that will pick up on the – after the first of the year. Absolutely, we think that's
the smallest bucket of the three, and that's where you have to balance – we have to balance what makes sense from a
return on investment on the marketing dollars that we want to spend and in how big that bucket is. So we think
obviously bucket one is the largest. We've had patients out there that have been coming back to our stores almost
weekly to ask have we settled? We had – they were the ones that have come in the first couple weeks and will continue
to come in. Bucket two we think is probably where we should spend our money intelligently. And then that third
bucket, as I said, I think it's the smallest of the three and then we just have to really decide how much we want to spend
there.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Sort of the way I view bucket three is those people may have gone to another pharmacy
where, for whatever reason, it was more convenient for them or a better format or better relationship and so they may
make that choice. But there is a huge universe out there of 80% of the population that may be going somewhere else via
Express Scripts that are other places that may find that we're a better choice for them. So I think what we need to do is
be pragmatic about which of these customers are the right return to get but I think that where we're going with all the
other initiatives that we would be myopic to only focus on that versus the larger universe of patients that we can go
after.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: And, Mark, let me add, we have a good communication plan in place to make these
patients aware. I mean we have direct mail, direct communication within our stores, our $25 transfer program. It's on
our reader boards within our stores and through both our mobile and our regular process, transferring a prescription
back is a very easy process. I mean patients – this is really easy for a patient to transfer their prescriptions back either
through our mobile app or to come in our stores and talk to their trusted pharmacist.
<Q - Mark Wiltamuth>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Mark.

Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to get into the working capital,
Wade, a little bit. And just, it looks like it was a pretty big benefit to your cash flows and just trying to understand will
some of this reverse next year? It looks like it was for the fiscal year over $700 million in the plus column for cash flow
from ops and you normally would use a little there, not every year but you do tend to use. And I was wondering if you
kind of give us some flavor on how repeatable that is?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, some of the inventory will come back, but I'd say that the bulk of our inventory was
actually real sustainable progress that we put into our business. So some inventory will certainly come back as the
customers come back. But we are – I guess, at 30,000 feet, I'd say that we are very focused not only on earnings but
also on cash and that's one of the reasons that we wanted to give supplemental information on adjusted earnings
because we really in some regard are very strong cash, cash EPS type company. And so again, I think that you're going
to see us continued to be very focused on cash receivables and payables over time tend to more follow the business and
sales without major adjustment in terms, but I think with respect to inventory, not only from a cash perspective, but just
as the team really works on providing the rise in stocks, so call it better service and better quality with lower cost and
capital employed we believe that we're doing things structurally that over time will help us continue that journey.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Scott, I would add that we have very efficient systems. And you saw the efficiency when
we took this product out and we don't expect excess inventory coming back as we begin to replenish based on volume.
We know specifically where this volume is and we'll be able to replenish accordingly.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So you think you'll be a user of working cap next year?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, what I would say is we're not going to give a guidance on it, per se, but I would say
that improvements like inventory and things when you adjust out the additional customers from Express Scripts et
cetera, we would assume that we will continue to make improvements.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Perfect. Thank you. Second question has to do with Express and just trying to understand a
little bit about how many of the 90 million scripts you actually think you'll have an opportunity to get back at. In other
words, we've seen TRICARE go one way. We've seen WellPoint go another, which is helpful to you. Do you have any
idea of those 90 million scripts, how many actually will have an opportunity to bring back?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I would say that outside of the DOD, without giving exact percentage, almost all,
right, percentage-wise. So we believe there's a big opportunity ahead of us. And again, we will see at what pace and
frequency we go.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So you think 65 million is a good, almost all that would, DOD is there, maybe there's a few
tag-ins, you think 65 million is a decent estimate?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Look, I'm not going to give an exact number but your math is probably not too far off.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay, perfect. Then the third question I have, I have lots of questions, but the third one I
guess I'll ask is just regarding guidance, there is none, also visibility into Alliance Boots. I mean clearly, we have, as
analysts, just a tremendous amount to try to take a look at here. And this U.K. thing I think obviously took some people
by surprise. Are you guys going to get the Alliance Boots team to talk every quarter? Or how do we look at this as
analysts where we own 45% of this business but there's really almost no visibility into what's going on with that
business? And then vis-à-vis guidance, how – is there any thought process of providing at least a little direction here? It
sounds like you think people are off quite a bit in how they're thinking about the incremental scripts. I didn't exactly
understand exactly what you said Wade, but how do you view this and what are you going to do for the investment
community to provide a little clarity as the company has gotten obviously very big, very dispersed and there's a lot of
moving parts? And then I'm done. Thanks.

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I guess, first off, we have to keep in mind that Alliance Boots is a private company
and it is an equity investment. So we don't have a controlling position and we need to respect that. I think that next
quarter you'll get a lot more information. You'll be able to see their numbers. We'll certainly have some history for you
and we'll have some meaningful commentary, I'm sure, on the state of the business. But I also do want to also just –
again, it's not a controlling entity and it is private. But I think as you see the numbers flow through next quarter and
again, the history of the commentary, the things we have, it will help to provide perspective. We certainly have their
last annual report, which I think is very comprehensive and detailed and the world hasn't changed dramatically from
that time. And you also have our most recent pro forma for their debt offering which I think gives additional financial
color.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Scott, we certainly understand the complexity of it. And I think that's one of the reasons
we tried to give both a GAAP and a little more clarity with an adjusted number on this call and we'll continue to do that
as we said. I also think our monthly comps and everything that we're trying to provide. But we understand the
complexity of it and we'll try to give as much as we can, but at the same time, as Wade said, they are a private company
and we have to respect that as well.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: With respect to your question on the ESI win-back, I mean, again, I think it's going to be
what is going to be. We're off to a good start, but it's just the beginning. So we'll see how time goes by. And I think it's
probably even impossible for us to perfectly predict because there is lots of moving parts. And I think another big
important part of the question is the preferred partnerships we work with many others, what happens in that dynamic.
And at the end of the day, it's all going to funnel into one overall comp number, regardless of where it comes from.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right, guys. Thanks very much. I mean for what it's worth I think it would probably help
your P/E a little bit if you gave a little bit more, so numbers weren't all over the place. Anyway, thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Scott.

Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Hey, guys. A couple of things, I assume in the monthly releases we get here for the next year
you will disclose the Express impact on script count, that will continue?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: No, John, that's what I meant to call, we're not going to disclose that, that's highly – that's
competitively sensitive information as I'm sure you understand. And frankly, in addition to that – which is frankly the
most important reason, in addition to that, it doesn't really show the entire picture. With all the moving parts and plan
changes and so forth as well as the opportunity to grow total share across the entire book of business, that's what we're
focused on. That's what this team is challenged to do is grow our total share. But the main reason is that's just
information that we don't think we want to give for competitive reasons.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So it'll be difficult for us to really track the recovery rate, right?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: What we'd rather – John, what I'd really rather you focus on, everybody focus on, exactly
what we're focused on is our total comp growth.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Because for us to just focus on one plan versus the entire market, you wouldn't want us
doing that.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think the comp actually gives a cleaner – leaping back into a cleaner estimate of the
progress we're making with them and others.

<Q - John Heinbockel>: So on that, if I look at the buckets you talked about, tell me if this is wrong, so you would
think that and I recognize September is a partial month, that October we would see a step-up in script count
sequentially obviously get less negative? And would we then see – do you think we then see another one in January?
We think about that second bucket that takes time and maybe people need to get literature for their new plan year. Do
you think that's the way it plays out? Or it's more gradual than that?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think you're going to see I think personally, I mean, and you never know but my opinion
is, is that you're going to see us kind of increase our comp obviously for at least two weeks and then you have the full
October and it's going to kind of – if there's going to be some slope of a line then when you get to January you'll have a
step-up and then you'll have a slope and a step-up.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. And in that second bucket, when do you think, based on what you just said, do you
think it's then, I don't know, early next year when you can truly gauge how much of that you're getting back and if
you're not getting back what you want, make an adjustment or do you think you get a read on that sooner than early
next year?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, as I said, I think in three or four months we're going to have a pretty good gauge as
to what's in all three of those buckets. Certainly, we're not going to wait for three to four months to begin the contact
and go after whoever may be in each of those three and again, we'll just make sure that we go at it intelligently. The
great thing is the timing of our Balance Rewards loyalty launch allows us to even more strategically approach and talk
to these folks. So we're going to – we'll know more in three or four months but certainly we're not going to wait for
three or four months to determine what our next step is.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: All right. And then just on Balance Rewards, so two things. Do you think that, is that likely
to impact front-end more than script count or the other way around and what do you think the trajectory on that is in
terms of the education process? Is that a more, I would think that's going to be a more gradual, even though you have
signed 12 million people up, they got to figure out the program, a more gradual trajectory or no?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: We think – first of all, the first question, we think it impacts both, pharmacy and the
front-end, and that's the way we designed it.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: But not one more than the other?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Pardon?
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Not one more than the other?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think we really want to focus on both.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And then as far as the gradual, we feel very good getting out of the gate early in 12 days,
being ahead of our forecast with nearly 12 million signed up.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Yeah.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think we're going to see a pretty vertical line here. We feel pretty good with the
momentum we have right now.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, John, I would say – and just to capitalize on what Greg said – in the pilots we did we
saw that we were able to basically move the needle in both and again it's a balanced program which is linked to well,
and it's hopefully a motive beyond just discounts but we did see that. I do think if you look by any other benchmark of
enrollment, what we've been able to do in a short period of time is multiples beyond any other program enrollment I've
seen and I think that speaks to the enthusiasm people have for what we've deployed.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, John.
