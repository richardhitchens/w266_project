H. Lawrence Culp
Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone. 2013 was a good year for Danaher. For the full year revenue increased 4.5% to
$19.1 billion with core revenues up 2.5%. Using the Danaher business system or DBS our team delivered solid core
revenue growth, operating margin expansion and excellent cash flow performance for the year. In addition, our new
product development and go-to market investments drove relative outperformance in many of our businesses. In 2013,
we believe we increased our market share positions at Hach, ChemTreat, Gilbarco, AB SCIEX, Leica Biosystems,
Kerr, Implant Direct and Videojet. Our focus and commitment for long-term growth investments position us well for
2014 and beyond.
Turning to the fourth quarter, revenue increased 3.5% organically. All segments grew at or above expectations led by
our Communications, Water Quality, Diagnostics, Dental Technologies, and Product ID businesses each delivering
mid-single digit core growth or better.
From a geographic perspective, high growth markets improved notably from the third quarter and grew at a high single
digit rate. In China sales increased high single digits with continued strength in Dental, Water Quality, Life Sciences &
Diagnostics. High growth markets now represent more than 25% or approximately $5 billion of our annual revenue, up
from $2.7 billion just three years ago. In the developed markets, the U.S. grew low single digits and Western Europe
was slightly positive for the second quarter in a row.
In 2013, we generated $3 billion of free cash flow and our free cash flow to net income ratio was 113%. This represents
the 22nd consecutive year in which we delivered free cash flow in excess of net income. We also strengthened our
businesses through acquisitions and deployed approximately $1 billion on 14 strategic bolt-ons in 2013 despite the
tougher M&A landscape. Given the breadth and depth of our strategic platforms, we remain confident in our ability to
deploy our $8 billion of available M&A capacity in a strategic yet disciplined way.
We continue to deliver solid margin performance even while funding long-term growth investments. Our gross margin
was 51.5% and almost 52% excluding productivity and efficiency initiatives in the quarter. For the full year, our gross
margin was 52.1% and our operating margin was 17.1%.
In the fourth quarter, our core operating margin increased 100 basis points while our reported operating margin
declined 40 basis points to 16.9% in part due to the impairment of certain intangible assets in our Communications
platform. Absent this charge, our reported operating margin would have been 17.5%.

We reported fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS of $0.96 inclusive of approximately $100 million of productivity
and efficiency investments, which we believe will provide about $75 million of savings in 2014. For the full year,
adjusted diluted net EPS was $3.42.
Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues increased 4% with core revenues up 4.5%. For
the full-year revenues increased 1% while core revenues grew 1.5%. Core operating margin expanded 150 basis points
while reported operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 16.6% due primarily to the previously mentioned
impairment charge.
Core revenue in instruments increased slightly. Fluke core revenues grew at a low single digit rate, an improvement
from the first three quarters of the year with demand strongest in the high growth markets. Of note, Latin America grew
in excess of 25% due in part to our increased commercial investments there. Also contributing to the step-up in growth
was the successful launch of our Ti400 thermal imager, a wireless high performance infrared camera with laser auto
focus capability that enables service engineers to quickly detect temperature measurements up to 1,200 degrees Celsius
and to communicate results back to their laptops or smartphones for further analysis. Products introduced in the last
two years are helping increase vitality at Fluke and accounted for nearly a quarter of Fluke's fourth quarter revenues.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined slightly as strength in Western Europe was offset by weakness in U.S.
government and computer verticals. In December, Electronic Products Magazine named our PA4000 Power Analyzer
its 2013 Product of The Year. The PA4000, the only T&M instrument so recognized is an advanced power testing tool
that helps electrical engineers perform critical current measurements with precision and accuracy.
Core revenues in our Communications platform increased low double digits with broad-based growth across most of
our product categories. Sales of Tektronix Communication Network Management Solutions increased more than 20%,
driven by demand from mobile service providers in the U.S., Asia and Latin America.
Arbor Networks ended the year with record bookings driven by its Pravail enterprise security solutions and the recent
launch of Arbor Cloud, an integrated on-premise in cloud-based DDoS Protection Service. During the first quarter,
Arbor will expand into the Advanced Persistent Threat market leveraging the security and analytics technology of
Packetloop, a company we acquired last year.
Sales of Fluke Networks' recently released TruView network and application performance monitoring software grew
significantly as enterprise customers look for faster, more efficient ways to monitor network performance and
troubleshoot problems. After a slow start to the year, we were encouraged by Fluke Networks' mid-single digit revenue
growth in the second half.
During the quarter, Tektronix Communications acquired Newfield Wireless. Newfield software provides mobile
service providers with a visual representation of their network's performance including call detail, traffic hot spots and
usage data. This technology combined with TekComms' network management expertise will enable providers to
optimize their networks and maximize their subscribers' mobile experiences.
Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 10% with core revenues up 3.5%. For 2013, revenues
increased 8.5% while core revenues were also up 3.5%. Core operating margin improved 80 basis points with reported
operating margin down 50 basis points to 22.5%, due primarily to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
Our Water Quality platform's core revenues grew at a mid-single digit rate with a double-digit increase in high-growth
markets and solid demand in the North American industrial market.
Hach had its best quarter of the year delivering growth in all regions and major product lines. The business again grew
at a double-digit rate in China due in part to heightened government investment in conservation and municipal water
quality projects.
ChemTreat had another outstanding quarter and continues to gain share as our best-in-class field engineers deliver
exceptional service and demonstrate the value of our solutions to customers. As we highlighted at our Investor Meeting
in December, development of our sales team in Latin America remains a key priority for ChemTreat where we have
doubled revenues in the past three years and grew more than 30% in the fourth quarter alone.

Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues increased at a low-single digit rate, driven by Payment, Point-of-Sale and
Environmental solutions. During the quarter we introduced Insite360, a cloud-based platform that allows retailers to
remotely configure and monitor their dispensers, inventory and point-of-sale systems from any PC or mobile device.
Insite360 helps retailers identify theft, detect environmental issues and prevent fuel run-outs in real time, thus
improving the economics and risk profiles of their businesses.
Earlier this month we acquired Outcast Media, a leader in digital out-of-home advertising for the retail petroleum
market. Outcast enhanced our Point-of-Sale product offerings and combined with Gilbarco Veeder-Root's Applause TV
will help advance promotion delivery designed to grow convenience store sales and enhance drivers' fueling
experiences.
Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues increased 5.5% with core revenues up 3.5%. For the full year,
revenues increased 5.5% with core revenues up 4%. Our reported operating margin increased 250 basis points to
16.7%. Using DBS, we have been able to improve margins while also expanding our long-term growth investments.
During the year we increased spending on commercial and innovation initiatives by approximately $120 million.
In our diagnostics platform, core revenues grew mid-single digits for the fourth quarter in a row. Beckman Coulter
diagnostics core sales grew at a low single digit rate with strength in immunoassay and clinical automation, particularly
in high growth markets. Clinical automation sales were up double digits as best-in-class automation capabilities helped
customers improve workflow, increase efficiency and reduce labor cost.
In China, we grew revenues approximately 20% driven by a combination of our expanding installed base and continued
government investment in healthcare infrastructure.
2013 was an important year of several milestones at Beckman as we resolved many of our remaining regulatory
challenges including FDA clearance for troponin on all of our immunoassay and integrated chemistry systems while
continuing to improve quality and delivery. Though it's still early, we are beginning to see the impact of the troponin
clearance as both our retention and competitive win rates have improved since September.
During the quarter, we introduced a new Vitamin D assay in Europe and Australia for our immunoassay platform and
also obtained U.S. FDA clearance for the next generation Beta hCG assay which is used as an early pregnancy test.
Today we're positioned better than ever to focus on retaining and winning new customers and to more actively increase
growth investments in the business.
Radiometer's core sales were up high single digits with growth in most major product lines and geographies. High
growth markets grew mid-teen, with China leading the way. Our instrument installed base continues to grow with
placements of our AQT point-of-care immunoassay analyzer increasing more than 50% and our blood gas instruments
up high single digits in 2013. We believe this momentum positions us well for our performance in 2014 and beyond as
we benefit from incremental consumables revenue.
Leica Biosystems saw broad based growth with sales up high single digits. All major geographies grew at a mid-single
digit rate or better with strength in Japan and the Middle East. Advanced standing revenues increased approximately
20% while core histology sales grew at a mid-single digit rate. We had a record year in the Advanced Staining
franchise with net instrument placements increasing at a mid-teens rate and believe we are still increasing market share.
Core revenues in our Life Sciences platform grew at a low-single digit rate led by the high growth markets. Sales were
up more than 20% in the Middle East and double digits in Latin America and Western Europe. AB SCIEX core sales
grew low-single digits with strength in proteomics and applied markets. AB SCIEX continues to broaden its global
reach, opening a new R&D center in Singapore during the quarter, AB SCIEX's first outside of North America. The
center brings development and manufacturing closer together while providing localized support for our Asia Pacific
customers. In addition, AB SCIEX opened a new technical support and regional office in Dubai to better serve
customers there in the Middle East.
As expected, Leica Microsystems' core sales declined at a low-single digit rate, primarily the result of a difficult
prior-year comparison due to the highly successful launch of the SP8 modular confocal microscope last year. Orders

grew double digits in the quarter with confocal microscopes up more than 20%. We're confident that Leica will return
to growth here in the first quarter.
Turning to Dental, revenues for the quarter and full year increased 3.5% while core revenues increased 3%. Operating
margin decreased 150 basis points to 13.7% due in part to the negative impact of sales mix as our technology
businesses grew faster than our higher margin consumables businesses. Spending on productivity initiatives and on
targeted growth investments for new products set to launch in 2014, including 25 new introductions next month at the
Chicago Midwinter show, also negatively impacted margins in the quarter. For the full year, operating margin was
14.6%.
Dental consumables core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate as demand for implants was partially offset by a
decline in professional consumables. We continue to have tremendous success with our digital dentistry initiative.
Since its launch in June of last year, we have sold more than 300 Lythos Digital Impression Systems which in turn
helped drive record order growth in our Insignia orthodontic case starts during the year. Insignia's digital treatment
planning tailors custom-fabricated brackets, wires and aligners to each aspect of tooth movement, thereby decreasing
office visits and treatment time while improving the patient experience and clinical outcomes.
Dental Technology's core revenues grew mid-single digits as double-digit core growth in North America and China
was partially offset by weakness in Western Europe. Our new digital imaging solutions continue to be well received in
the market, particularly our new i-CAT FLX 3D digital imager. Since the launch in the second quarter of last year we
sold more than 200 units, the equivalent of more than one per day. Additionally, KaVo's DIAGNOcam, a hand-held
radiation-free digital imaging scanner, won the German innovation prize for most innovative equipment product in
dentistry in a survey of more than 4,000 German doctors.
Moving to our Industrial Technologies segment, revenues increased 5.5% with core revenues up 3%. For the full year,
revenues grew at 3.5% while core revenues declined 0.5%. Our core operating margin increased 20 basis points while
reported operating margin declined 80 basis points to 17.3%, due primarily to increased spending on productivity
initiatives and the impact of recently-acquired businesses.
Motion core revenues decreased at a mid-single digit rate, as growth in industrial automation and North American
distribution was more than offset by a decline in our Defense and Engineered Solutions verticals. We are encouraged
by the sequential improvement we saw in orders, which turned positive in the fourth quarter for the first time in a year.
However, we anticipate core sales will remain negative in the first quarter of 2014 as Motion exits some lower-margin
businesses.
Core revenues in our Product Identification platform grew mid-single digits, led by high-single digit growth in our core
marking and coding businesses. Videojet had its best quarter of the year with strength in all major geographic regions.
Consumables revenue grew at a double-digit rate as our marketing initiatives and successful product introductions over
the past several years have helped expand our installed base.
At Esko and X-Rite, our innovation investments are helping accelerate growth with new products representing nearly
20% of total revenue in 2013.
One of the most exciting new product introductions is PantoneLIVE, a cloud-based color management solution that
helps brand owners accurately communicate color specifications across their entire supply chain, improving the
consistency of their brand image. During the quarter Asda, one of the largest supercenter chains in the U.K., became
the first retailer to implement PantoneLIVE.
So to wrap up, as we anticipated when we were with many of you last month in New York, we had a strong finish to
the fourth quarter contributing to a solid year for Danaher. Our team's commitment to, and application of, the Danaher
Business System drove relative top line outperformance, solid core margin expansion, and excellent cash flow
throughout the year. We believe the investments we have made to drive long-term growth and productivity, combined
with our robust balance sheet and optimism on the acquisition front, leave us well positioned to outperform in 2014.
We are initiating first quarter diluted EPS guidance of $0.76 to $0.80 and reaffirming our full-year guidance of $3.60 to
$3.75. We anticipate approximately 3% core revenue growth in the first quarter, which will be impacted by one less

Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Marquita, I think we are ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nigel Coe with MS [Morgan Stanley & Co.
LLC].
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, a good solid end to the year, Larry. Can you just maybe talk about January? I know January is
a fairly weak month for the quarter, but maybe just put that 3% in the context of what you've seen so far in January.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I think you're exactly right, Nigel. It's hard to say too much about January given the
nature of the month and how early it is, but I think we were particularly encouraged by the way 2013 ended, right.
From a geographic perspective, the strength was broad-based. I think the same can be said from a line of business
perspective. We probably had a better book-to-bill than we had the year prior, and I don't think there were any
unnatural acts that by and large occurred. So it was just good to see that sort of strength come into the New Year. I
don't think we've seen anything in January that would deter us. Again, we mentioned in the formal remarks that we are
short a selling day, which will impact us probably more so in consumables than in equipment. We know that Motion is
still going to be exiting some of the low margin business there. And I think all in, we feel good about things, but when
we say approximately 3%, I think we know that we clearly need a few more weeks behind us here to have a better beat
on the first quarter.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: But so far so good
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's great. I don't want to extrapolate or put words in your mouth, but given the seven day
pressure in 1Q given that Motion is still going through the rationalization of the product lines, does this point us
towards the higher end of that 2% to 4% for the full year, Larry?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: For the year?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I don't think we're going to change that 2% to 4%, but clearly getting off to a good
start here in the approximately 3% range would at least put us at the midpoint. If the macro scene is better, Nigel, I'm
highly convinced we're going to do well. Right, with our exposures, from healthcare to industrial, environmental
networking, an improved global scene will be very good for this portfolio, and we'll execute accordingly.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Great. And then switching to margins, and I just want to dig into Industrial. You mentioned in
the prepared remarks that productivity initiatives was one of the reasons why we saw some pressure there. But I'm just
wondering, are we seeing any pricing pressure within industrial markets?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, it's Dan. Good morning.

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: First of all, if you just normalize year-on-year restructuring, Industrial Tech margins were up
80 basis points to 90 basis points.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We had a higher – we had some additional opportunities we took advantage of it. In terms of
pricing, it hasn't – we definitely saw an impact probably late 2012. We've seen that continue where we're not getting
any pricing in equipment, generally speaking. But we we're still getting the kind of pricing you'd expect on the
aftermarket. But the period of the prior year you're getting 1 point or so on equipment and instruments, it hasn't gotten
worse, but since about a year ago it's probably overall kind of flattish for us right now.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Could you expand on the write-down on the Communications platform, talk about
maybe what that investment was about? I think – and typically how much you capitalize in R&D and sort of think
about it from an investors risk profile going forward, just a little more perspective there? Was it acquisition related at
all or pure new investment and why?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, I'll start and maybe let Larry chime in. It was investment in a company, relatively
early-stage company, that is continuing to perform reasonably well but behind the expectations we had at the time of
the acquisition. Because of that, the accounting rules indicated a write-down of a piece of the purchase price as
appropriate, so obviously we took that. Obviously the Communications platform overall has been very good – very
kind of high return for us. Probably will be a little bit more risk, and you're going to have situations like Arbor that play
out well ahead of schedule. This one we still believe in. It's tracking okay, but it's a little behind versus where we
thought it would be at this point.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, Steve, Dan's exactly right. I would just add to that that we do a number of these
things, these sorts of investments to augment our competitive positions really around the portfolio. And while you
never want to see an impairment, to have that business up double digit contributing is a good thing and a good thing
long-term. You look at a small investment that we made, that was really the seed corn technology, for Lythos, the
digital impression system we have up and running at Dental. We did something similar that was really the foundation
for what became AQT at Radiometer. So we have a number of these small bets that we make that we don't really end
up talking much about. As Dan alluded to a moment ago, clearly with the accounting rules we've got to call this out.
But I think it's just really part of the mosaic in terms of the investments we make organically and inorganically to drive
long-term competitive strength and profitable growth.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And since we're talking about that segment, what's your sense of the sustainability
for that low double digit growth in Tek Communications?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think we're in a very good spot there clearly in terms of the challenges we're helping
our service provider customers solve as well as the folks on the enterprise side, right? Network management
particularly with the mobile explosion is a continuous challenge. We're well positioned there. From an enterprise
perspective network management generally it does not get easier. Clearly a day doesn't go by with the cyber security
headlines being rewritten. So we like where Comm's, we like where Arbor, we like where Fluke Network is positioned.
I'm not sure we consistently sign up for double digit growth there. The TekComms business can be a little bit lumpy

but I think we like the long-term trajectory there to be sure.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then maybe just turning to margins on the Dental side, a little more color on
the restructuring and growth investments there? What – a little more sense maybe for the nature of that?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. I think maybe just a little bit of context. As we hinted in New York when we saw you,
I think we had a little bit better visibility at the end of 2013 than we had the last couple years, so we knew we had a
little bit more room to do some things and Dental was one place where we took advantage of that envelope. As we said,
it's about 100 basis points of cost that came forward. Most of that was on the productivity side just to continue to
sharpen up the cost structure there. But we're really in a sweet spot both from a technology perspective given where the
product pipelines are and a lot of that comes down in February at mid-winter. But also on the commercial side we
wanted to pull some things forward particularly in Asia all of which I think gives us a good start to 2014. And again the
mix bit of it was important as well. I think it's always good to see equipment show strength but there is a little bit of a
squeeze there from a margin perspective in the short-term.

We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hey, Jeff.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Just a couple of questions. Larry, just first on the deal front, can you give us a little more
color on where your comfort factor is? And the light in which I ask the question – you may or may not have had
interest but we saw a couple healthcare deals trade away in the quarter. Roper yesterday was saying a couple things
slipped through their fingers that others took at 20 times EBITDA. It still sounds like a very tough market to actually
get things done.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think we'd be the first to acknowledge that over the last four or five quarters things
have become more difficult in general. But I think our optimism, Jeff, is genuine because we're going to pick through a
number of different situations that populate the funnels really across each and every platform. And as we do that even
in this environment we think there are opportunities for value creation. We're going to stay disciplined. No doubt about
that. I think that we take some encouragement from the fact that we did deploy $1 billion last year across admittedly 14
smaller transactions but as Dan and I look out there as we go through the monthly reviews we do at the businesses I
think that we're well positioned financially and operationally to put that capital to work. But on the margin you're spot
on. It is a little tougher given the valuations particularly in the public arena than a year ago.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: So how do we think about kind of plan B on other deployment if the deals don't materialize?
And I was wondering also if Dan could maybe give us a little color like collectively, what the acquired multiple was on
those 14 transactions, kind of aggregated multiple and aggregated sales acquired?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, overall, about three times revenue and kind of a low double digit 11 times – I may be off
by 0.5 point kind of EBITDA sort of multiple. They are largely bolt-ons and tuck-ins, so our confidence with those tend
to be higher just because of the nature of what we can do on the cost side.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I'm just glad he didn't say it was 22 times there. Jeff, just back to plan B. I think the board
and certainly Dan and I and the team are highly cognizant of the earnings power that we have in what is an
underleveraged balance sheet, right? I think the bias that we have which is discussed and frankly reaffirmed at virtually

every board meeting is toward the inorganic investments that have worked very well for us in building a strong
company and driving a lot of value. Things are going to come in ebbs and flows here, but I think that balance or that
bias is intact, and we know that frankly just a few years ago after a somewhat quiet period, we were uniquely
positioned to go take Beckman on. Right, so again I think this is a live conversation with a strongly
shareholder-oriented board at every meeting, but the pronounced bias that we have is one we continue to think works

We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hey. Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So I think you guys, you mentioned $100 million in restructuring and the $75 million in benefits,
but I thought you said you did actually take some more here in the fourth quarter. Was that just offset with growth? Is
that just rounding error or can you maybe quantify what you did in the fourth quarter and talk about within which
segments you did it in?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: A lot of questions there, Steve. I'll try.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: It's basically fourth quarter restructuring, what was the absolute number and where do you take
it?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: The absolute number was a little over $100 million dollars compared to $120 last year. It was
higher in Industrial Tech and Dental, and it was lower in Life Sciences & Diagnostics. So if you look at the core margin
expansion LS&D, up 260 basis points. If you normalize restructuring, it would be more like 150 basis points of core
margin expansion. We spent a little bit more than $100 million in the quarter, but you could also see that we also really
stepped up some of our growth investments, so R&D was up 13% year on year in the quarter. It had been tracking up
around 8% or 9% through the first nine months. Sales and marketing a similar story, we were up 9% in the quarter
versus tracking maybe 6% or 7% for the quarters. And as Larry alluded to, given we saw some of the strength, there
was an opportunity to deploy some money that hopefully will benefit growth in the future.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So it's really – because that $100 million, I don't think that's necessarily new relative to
what you said in the third quarter. I was under the impression that you had a little bit of revenue upside in the fourth
quarter so you invested some of that away, but I guess what you're saying is you invested that in – this reflected more
in growth investments as opposed to productivity?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. I mean, R&D itself was up almost $40 million in the quarter. Our run rate would have
suggested more like $30 million.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And one last question just on the Life Sciences & Diagnostics margins were very strong.
What is Beckman now doing and what do you expect for Beckman margins next year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: For the full year, mid teens, a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter, although that is
somewhat seasonal. But as I mentioned we adjusted for the little lower restructuring, very strong performance. You

know, we're trying to get away from talking specifically kind of Beckman, but it's a big piece of the segment and we
expect that segment to again be one of the larger contributors to the year-on-year margin expansion here that we expect
in 2014.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Tracking well. More costs are coming out. We're very pleased with how the year trended in
terms of their effective margins.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Oh and sorry. One last one. Just on the days sales thing you said it's mostly – obviously mostly
hits in consumables so that's a higher margin issue?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Right.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Is there any way to kind of quantify the EPS impact of that or at least the profit impact of that?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, if you just assume one day impact on consumables no impact on equipment – there
probably is a little bit. But that would be – that would be 0.5 point of growth. 0.5 point of growth on $5 million is $25
million and that's a 50% follow through. That costs us a $0.01, $0.015 in the quarter.

We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Larry, a couple of the businesses that have been tougher – Motion you talked
about orders turning positive in the quarter, Tektronix is still down a little bit. Can you give a little color on what you're
seeing there? I mean is that flattening and turning positive dynamic just a comp issue or are you seeing anything
actually get better there?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, no. I think in Motion we were particularly pleased with the finish especially on the
industrial automation side. If you look we were up basically at a mid-single digit rate in industrial automation in the
quarter. Now, that's a portion of the business but that's really where a lot of our growth investments from a product and
a go-to market perspective have been made, Shannon. From a vertical perspective there it was broad based. Orders
were up double digit in the fourth quarter in the U.S.
I think in China we finally had traction from an execution perspective. So there's a lot here, frankly that we're quite
pleased with, on top of the multiyear margin expansion that, that team has put forward. At Tek not necessarily thrilled
to be down again in the fourth quarter but I think as we look forward given the historical lag effect around PMI we're
optimistic that we return to growth here in 2014. Things have been a bit bumpy as you know there. I think the China
space particularly on the export side has continued to be particularly challenging. But I think all in all Tek did a much
better job from an execution perspective in the tough environment in 2013. I think we held ground broadly and are
poised to get back on the positive side of things here in the New Year.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks. And then for the whole company, do you have what equipment and
consumables each grew in the quarter and just maybe any commentary on what you make of that in terms of customers
willingness to invest?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I think that's – I should have mentioned this earlier, Shannon. As you know, the book
of business here is about 60-40 – 60% equipment, 40% consumables. And where we've really seen the sustained

growth of late has been in consumables. And when we talked about say 2.5% core in the fourth quarter we thought
consumables would lead there and we'd be slightly positive on equipment with consumables at a mid-single digit rate.
To see consumables basically come in line but to have equipment come in a couple hundred basis points better than
that, I think is another one of the sign that we could take from the fourth quarter to say, this broad based geographic and
product pickup that we saw came in equipment and those are clearly more important decisions if you will on the part of
many customers. So we're going to look at that to see how sustained that is as we get started here in 2014. But I think
just that snapshot is one that's hard to interpret in anything other than a positive way.

We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks a lot. Yeah.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, Good morning, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Good morning. In Dental you discussed some mix issues in Q4 and some new product
spend but I guess if I look at the year as a whole the margin was about flat. How are you thinking about the mix items
into 2014? I mean, do you think we should see Dental incrementals pick up much or is this something that could
persist?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Julian, I think you saw an improvement through the first nine months of the year. Again, the
fourth quarter was impacted primarily by the higher restructuring but as Larry alluded to kind of the mix with the
equipment better than consumables. So given we have a little higher restructuring spend here in Q4 and we expect a
significant number of new product launches in the first half of 2014, I think that bodes well not only for the top line but
also for market expansion here in 2014.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. And then within Life Sciences, you had a 40% incremental operating margin last
year as a whole. Is there a sense in which I guess a lot of easy or early savings from Beckman have now been squeezed
out, and so you should see incrementals normalize pretty quickly this year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: They'll come down a little bit. But even our Radiometer, Leica Bio businesses, just given the
high consumable content there, also continues to be very good even in the more, quote-unquote, more mature
businesses in terms of their tenure with Danaher. We're still seeing good follow-through. But it won't be probably at the
level we saw in 2013.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Julian, I would just add to that, that if you look at the productivity investment that we made
in the fourth quarter, LS&D still accounted for about a third of the overall total that Dan noted earlier, down
year-on-year but still an important part of that spend, which I think speaks to just the visibility the team have on
opportunities. Beckman is not the only relatively new business we have there, so they're all keen to get after it to
continue to get those margins up, again because we think that segment ought to be a 20-percenter.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. Then just lastly on the, kind of, your own investments outlook, SG&A to sales
was flat last year. Do you think that stays sort of flattish this year, and just any color on your CapEx assumptions for
the year.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It should be. I mean, as we make – as I mentioned, our sales and marketing were up 6% or
7% for the year and we did a good job partially because of the 2012 restructuring actually having our G&A down a
little bit. A fair amount of the restructuring in Q4 was also targeting after G&A here in 2014. So it probably climbs a
little bit given the continued investment in sales and marketing. From a CapEx perspective, we're teed up for kind of a
low- to mid-single digit increase in CapEx, kind of PP&E-type CapEx.

We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey. On Motion, I might have missed this, but could you size for us the revenue impact on the
businesses that you'll be exiting in 2014? And maybe share with us a little bit about what the tipping point might have
been, what's the decision making as to exit those businesses?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I'll let Dan answer the first part of that. I think with respect to the second part, it was
really, really simple. I think these were below margin opportunities we'd gotten a hold of, that looked a little bit more
attractive at a distance than they did up close. So effectively, as you know, Deane, we've had a multi-year effort to put a
premium on margin expansion at Motion. I think we give the team very high marks in that regard and the walk from the
revenue, even though it impacts the print on the core revenue side of things, is the right thing to do and the team has
been at that for the better part of a year now.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Deane, so we were – Motion was down mid-single digit in the quarter. Absent this – the
business we've exited it would have been down low single digits, probably down a point or two. We expect that
dynamic to continue here in the first quarter. Business is getting better, it's still going to have about a 4 point to 5 points
hit on growth from the exit of the business but it should be largely completed – have a little bit in Q2, but basically
largely completed by the end of Q1.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then on China, the 20% up, was that an overall clinical or was
that at Beckman in particular? And maybe some color on there in terms of what the mix was. Are these
China-for-China products? And maybe a little bit about what kind of business you're seeing in China in Beckman.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I would say that if you look at Life Sciences & Diagnostics today, and I'll throw
Dental in there as well, I mean we're clearly beneficiaries of this China-wide infrastructure build in terms of better
clinical delivery. We see that in the Diagnostics businesses; we see that in Dental. And as well from a research
perspective, both at SCIEX and at Leica. We are still, I would say, Deane, in the early innings of driving the localized
product agenda that I'd like to see us execute upon in that segment. And we do have a pretty good Asian manufacturing
footprint there, a good bit of that is actually in Singapore. You heard me reference in the prepared remarks the AB
SCIEX footprint in Singapore, Leica Micro enjoys a similarly substantial position there. So we have work to do there,
but frankly, as these researchers and clinicians often return to China from their overseas educations and postings,
they're looking for the same sort of gear and in turn I think that's why you've seen Beckman and Radiometer, Leica and
SCIEX do so well in China the last several years. Is that helpful?
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Yes, it is. Thank you.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: You bet, Isaac. Good morning.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Yeah, first one on Dental, just wondering if you can maybe comment on what you're seeing in the
underlying patient volume trends in the U.S. and then maybe what's baked into your assumptions for patient volumes
this year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think that we certainly know that from a macro perspective, patient volumes have
been of late more sluggish than we've seen over the last 10 or 15 years particularly here in the U.S. Western Europe to a
slightly lesser degree. But I think our view, Isaac, as you well know is that we really want to drive innovation, couple
that innovation with better commercial execution so that we can capture that value that we're adding on a per doctor,
per operatory, per patient basis. And I think we've been doing that, lots of examples. Most recently this digital dentistry
initiative in Ormco, I think, is one where we're getting a lot of traction in that regard. And to the extent that we can do
that, that drives share, that drives value capture, and coupled with what we're doing in the high growth markets, I
mentioned China a moment ago, we think dental can be a good sustained mid-single digit grower for us.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe switching over to T&M, you mentioned some of the
investments you're making on the software side of the business which I'd assume is going to carry higher margins over
the long-term. So if we assume that the capital equipment side of T&M remains a little sluggish, is it fair to say there'll
be enough mix shift here on the underlying business to move the needle on overall margins in the segment?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Maybe on the margin, Isaac, but it's a 20% segment, and while some of the software
businesses can carry higher gross margins, they also carry some higher investment levels. I think it's probably more
about driving growth there than margin expansion.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Right. And that's one segment, Isaac, where the variable margins on the equipment are well
above the Danaher average. So we don't get as much of a pronounced mix there between core equipment and
aftermarket in whatever form it comes as we might elsewhere, i.e., Dental as was explained a few minutes ago.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. And then just last one if I could sneak it in on the M&A side, just given your earlier comments,
can you talk a little bit about where you think your funnel is strongest or maybe weakest for M&A by segment?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I would say it's pretty well balanced at this point, Isaac. As you know, we've been working
the environmental side of things pretty hard. That's an area where we'd like to do more. There's certainly spots within
both Industrial Tech particularly around Product ID as well as in T&M particularly if we can lever the Fluke brand
more broadly, that are high priorities for us. So we're working those hard, but I don't mean to shortchange LS&D or
Dental. They certainly have a good bit that they have their eyes on as well.

at 2014, do you expect a pickup in cash flow? We just need to transition after we sort of digest M&A to a more
sustainable percentage of net income which sort of means cash flow, is likely going to be flattish for another year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Andrew, the impact in 2013 was really not a lower – not explained by lower M&A activity.
It's a little bit of – I hate to sort of hide behind this but it's a little bit of an accounting dynamic. As you know, we sold
both our tools joint venture and about half of our Align share. We brought in close to $1 billion from those two

activities. Those things were below the free cash flow line. However, the $175 million of – $150 million of taxes we
paid on those gains negatively impacted our free cash flow. So if we didn't have those two discrete items our free cash
flow would have been up $100 million year-on-year.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And what should I think for 2014 then?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I mean I think if you sort of adjusted for that we'd have close to 120% conversion.
Amortization alone gets us 15 points of conversion. So something in that zone would be probably a reasonable guiding
estimate here for 2014.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you. And you said between 115% and 120%?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yeah, something in that zone.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And then the question on M&A. As you look at the opportunities, do you think it's easier for you
to do deals in sort of $1 billion, $2 billion size or do you have an advantage looking at larger deals given the fact that
you can extract synergies, you get to keep them and so the economics changes quite a bit you being a strategic buyer
versus [ph] B (54:28).
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think regardless of deal size each investment requires a certain level of work. I think
we have done large deals like Beckman. We've done some smaller transactions. Once you get past that dynamic I think
we feel pretty confident that both given the size of our financial capacity – again $8 billion of capital here in the near
term coupled with our operating capabilities both in terms of the quality of the team and the Danaher Business System
we are advantaged. And that doesn't begin to address the fact that we take a long-term view, right? And we cannot only
be patient but we bring that owner's mentality to building out the business and harvesting those top and bottom line
synergies. So we've been at this a long time and continue to believe that our organic strategy will complement what we
do organically very well and create value for shareholders and build a sustainable franchise along the way.

<Q - Charles D. Brady>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Charlie.
<Q - Charles D. Brady>: Just wondering on the Industrial Tech business, maybe a little more color on really what
you're thinking in core growth in 2014. I mean, Q4 this year was the best, well the only positive quarter of the year, the
best one in four quarters and you still have some of those businesses that really aren't going to be strong growers at
least in the first half of 2014. So maybe just a little more color on where you're seeing kind of a growth expectation on
core for 2014?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Charlie, as you recall what we said in New York as we thought for the full year Industrial
Tech would be up 1% to 3% – probably a little bit more of our cyclical exposure there. So if things spring back just
broadly I think we're well positioned. Maybe the industrial automation performance I highlighted a moment ago
suggests we're beginning to see some of that. But I think by and large what will drive Industrial Tech aside from some
of the headwinds you mentioned is the very strong performance we have seen and expect at Product ID. Videojet links,
the marking and coding businesses have done very well the last couple of years. We love what they're doing in terms of
finding opportunities to invest in growth and their execution around those investments. And while it's still early at
X-Rite and to a degree Esko those businesses both play important roles in managing some of the more complex supply
chain and brand management challenges that our customers, particularly in consumer goods space. So it's a ripe field of
