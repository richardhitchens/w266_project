David E. Simon
Good morning. Strong quarter, with excellent performance in our core business. We had strong progress on our growth
strategy, which includes redevelopment and expansion of existing properties to meet retailer demand and enhance
productivity, development of new Premium Outlets, and our continued smart acquisition strategy. FFO was $2.21 per
share, up 11.1% from the third quarter of 2012. Our FFO exceeded the First Call consensus estimate by $0.05 per
share. For the malls and Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 4.9% for the quarter, driven by tenant
sales up 3% to $579 per square foot, occupancy up 90 basis points to 95.5%. Our re-leasing spread was a positive
15.2% or $8.05 per square foot.
Retailer demand for space in our properties remains strong and healthy, driving our occupancy increases. Our retailer
sales growth continues to be ahead of GDP and more important to us, our existing leases are under market rent. And
keep in my mind we see almost no or very little correlation between tenant sales growth and our NOI growth. Due to
our ability to replace underperforming retailers, we have good visibility for strong NOI growth over the near term.
New development, just quickly, we opened three new Premium Outlet centers during August, all of which have
exceeded expectations. All were nearly 100% leased at opening and sales per square foot of all three properties are
trending above our portfolio average. The total net development cost of the three were $400 million. That's not our
share, but in total we expect a first year return of 10.5% on our cost.
We broke ground on Premium Outlets in Charlotte and Montreal. And we've finalized joint ventures, or are under
construction in: Eagan, Minnesota, which is in St. Paul/Minneapolis; and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in our
new partnership with McArthurGlen. On the redevelopment expansion highlights, the Shops at Nanuet opened in
October, a complete transformation into an open-air environment providing everyday shopping and activities plus
dozens of fashion and specialty retailers unique to the area. It's 98% leased; community acceptance and early reports on
sales have exceeded expectations.
We also opened a 105,000 square foot expansion of Orlando Premium Outlets in October. It's 100% leased.
Redevelopment and expansion projects ongoing at more than 35 properties in the U.S. and Asia. Overall, our
multi-year pipeline of new development or redevelopment and expansion projects is key to driving growth and NOI.
We continue to expect development investment at least $1 billion annually from 2013 through 2016. Go projects -- go
projects include Roosevelt Field, Houston Galleria, Woodbury, Stanford, Del Amo, just to name a few. In other words,
they are under construction.
International, just let me mention a few things. Finally, we completed the closing of our joint venture with
McArthurGlen. It includes ownership interest in five McArthurGlen designer outlets located in Vienna, Venice and
Naples, in the Netherlands, near Dusseldorf and one in the UK near Kent. We also own a 50% interest in their
management and development company, which has a strong pipeline of future projects and opportunities.
We're excited to partner together. Great platform for high-quality retail real estate in Europe and a strong team of
professionals. This partnership supports and extends our international growth strategy. Important industry synergies
will be taken advantage of in upcoming years, similar to what we've been accomplishing with Klépierre.
Total consideration for the recent investments is approximately $500 million at a cap rate of slightly north of 6.5%.
Klépierre announced their revenues a couple of days ago. We continue to believe we are well positioned to assist them

in delivering greater value from their platform. European retail recovery is just getting started and they are beating
financial and operational expectations.
Capital markets, Moody's Investors Service upgraded SPG's senior unsecured debt to A2, with a stable outlook. We are
one of only two REITs with an A ratings from S&P and Moody's. We completed a €750 million bond offering to
complement our McArthurGlen and Klépierre investment. It taps into a broad market, expands our access to capital,
provides a natural hedge. And strong demand enabled more favorable terms for lending for leading European real estate
players. Rate of 2.375% for seven-year notes.
Dividend, quickly, we increased our quarterly dividend from $1.15 to $1.20 per share, as a result of continued strong
performance and a raise of our taxable income estimate, a year-over-year increase of 9.1%. Total dividends paid in
2013 will be $4.65 per share compared to $4.10 in 2012, an increase of 13.4%. We will again raise our first quarter
dividend after our taxable income estimate is complete in the first quarter 2014.
Today, we're raising our FFO guidance to a new range of $8.72 to $8.78 of FFO per share. The primary driver of this
increase is strong operating performance across all platforms. This increases the midpoint by $0.10 from our last one in
July and $0.30 from the midpoint of the range from the beginning of the year in February.
Our commitment to shareholder return and our ability to execute has built an unprecedented track record of meeting or
exceeding expectations on a quarterly and annual basis for at least the last decade. Our nearly 20-year history as a
public company since IPO in December of 1993 is as follows. Total shareholder return of approximately 1,975% or
17% annually for 20 years. Our FFO grew in 1993 from $150 million to over $3.15 billion in 2013, using the midpoint
of our guidance range. Our equity market cap grew from $1.8 billion to approximately $58 billion today, and we're not
resting. The range of opportunities in front of us is exciting and we'll continue to focus and work very hard to produce
strong results.
We're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please
proceed.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning. Are you awake?
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Yeah. The coffee is kicking in and it's Friday, so it's always a good thing. To use a
favorite metaphor for Steve, we're going to tee off with you. On the Eurobonds, just sort of curious what the reception
was over there as far as – is there a dedicated REIT bond community? Or do people – are they generalists and do they
look at you guys as a real estate company or they look at you as a corporate America Fortune 500 company?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Alex, it's really the latter. The real estate market over there, the investment grade real
estate market isn't deep enough that there are people who are dedicated real estate bond investors. So, the interest was
very high. I think we met with almost 50 investors during a 4.5-day roadshow. Almost all of them ended up coming
into the deal. They are money managers, insurance companies, pension funds, really sticky, good, patient money. But
they certainly viewed us not only as a best-in-class real estate company, but as a major U.S corporate who has a
presence in Europe, but also gets 90% of its income from the U.S., which was an important diversification element for
them.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, should we expect you guys to issue in Japan, if
you're looking at, outside the country for long-term capital?

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: It's a good question, Alex. I mean, I would say this, right now, we have a multi-currency
tranche on our credit facility, and we do have yen outstanding that acts as a hedge against our equity investment in our
Premium Outlet portfolio in Japan. No plans at the present time to go to the bond market in Japan, but that's certainly
an option that would be available to us.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Thank you.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: David, a question on the outlet business. So with the recent openings, you're up to
probably 25%, 30% of NOI housed within outlets. And I'm sort of curious, one, will you sort of reevaluate at this point
sort of breaking that out as a standalone in terms of metrics, in terms of performance, just given the size and how good
it's performing? But also, as you think about the pie of Simon on page 19 of your supplemental, where do sort of outlets
go over the next five years from what you can see relative to the other pieces in there? And maybe you can talk about
sort of that range of opportunities that you see that you ended your comments with.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, now the fact is we really run this together even though we have separated some
personnel. The fact is we really run the business as one entity on the outlets and the malls. So we don't see any reason
to separate it out. And the fact is both are, we couldn't produce these results if both weren't producing very favorable
results.
They're both material enough, and -- material enough, so the fact of the matter is this is, our numbers are a real good
indication of what's going on in our business, whether you want to just look at malls or outlets. It's really – it really is,
requires to deliver -- both have to produce these kind of results to have it shown together.
Now, with respect to the outlet business, look, that's where our new development is focused. As you know we just
opened three, which is pretty good work. We've got a good pipeline of four, five, six others, couple of which are
already under construction. We've got another three or four that are in the pipeline. So that's going to continue to move
the outlet business percentage up.
On the other hand as I mentioned to you, we are under construction or about to be under construction in Stanford, the
Field, Del Amo, Houston Galleria. Just, I won't – I know Rick wants to list them all, but I will not let him. So just to
name a few, and I think that will, that will start to kick in in 2015, 2016, 2017. That will probably rebalance the pie
chart as we look back in three, four years from now. You there?
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: You can go ahead and ask me something else even though I know we instructed you not to.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Well as I was just saying the range of opportunities as you sort of, you ended your
comments with, that you're not resting on your laurels, you see a range of opportunities. Obviously, you've talked about
the development in the outlets and all the redevelopment that is happening. What other sort of scope should we think
about and how it impacts that, your pie chart or the company in terms of opportunities? I just wanted you to dig into it a
little bit.
<A - David E. Simon>: If I told you, then you would upgrade somebody and the price would go up. So, I would rather
just keep that to myself.

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Michael, this is Steve. Just to put a pin in it, though, over the last four years we've spent
over $12 billion in acquisition of assets. So, not an insignificant number.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, look, I think, as Steve said is, as we look back since 2010, and these are gross numbers.
We've purchased about $12.8 billion -- these are gross. So, it includes debt assumption, all this other stuff, not
necessarily our share. But we've acquired about $12.8 billion, we've disposed about $2.7 billion and we've developed
$1 billion of new stuff ground up.
So, again, I know it gets lost in the sauce, but we're always very focused on upgrading and reconstituting the portfolio.
And we see it, look, we see international growth ahead of us, Michael, if that's what you're asking. And in the U.S.,
we've got the expansion pipeline, which is overwhelming. I mean literally nobody in our industry is doing what we're
doing, expanding our existing great assets, nobody.
And also complementing that is all the new development we're doing in the outlet business, of which, as you know,
we're executing consistent with the returns that we've done historically. Toronto is great, St. Louis is great, we're under
construction in Charlotte, Montréal based upon Houston is great, Vancouver now that we're in the McArthurGlen
partnership, that's going to be good. We got a couple of new sites that we're working on, some ourselves, some with
partners, Tampa is an example, so on.
So there is a lot to do. And how the pie chart changes, we'll see. But the fact of the matter is we see pretty good growth
organically just assuming we can execute the way we have in the past.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Our next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Good morning.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: David, we understand that you've joined some of your mall peers to do a beta test of same
day delivery with Deliv. And I'm remembering back to a conversation we had maybe 10 years ago, where you had
talked about Domino's Pizza and the fact that they weren't in the pizza business, but they were really in the 30-minute
logistics business and wouldn't that be cool if the mall could figure out how to do that. Is that effectively what you're
trying to accomplish here with this beta test and is that really the future of the mall in order to compete with the
Amazons of the world?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I do think the mall has a unique advantage in that it's already got the infrastructure,
physical infrastructure to satisfy consumers that want same day delivery. Now it sounds great, it's a little more
complicated than that. But to the extent -- one of the things, having spent yesterday with our mall team just kind of
going, not property-by-property, that we look forward to in a couple of weeks, but the thing that I am focused on in our
mall business, and when I say mall business I include the outlets, is that we have to make, we've always made retailer
service a priority. So Rick and I are as good at sucking up to retailers as possible. Okay? Sometimes Rick is better than
I am, but we both can suck up when required.
The one thing we don't do the way I would like us to is I really want to, I want to provide better service to our
consumers, the actual shoppers. And whether that's -- something we instituted last year was just surprise and delights,
come to the mall and we're going to give you a free cup of coffee or we're going to schlep your bags. We're going to
make your visit really better. Think about the hotel level of service at a good hotel when you're checking in and they

are taking care of you to make your stay pleasant.
With that said, we do think delivery or schlepping, you remember we started [ph] Your Sherpa (21:30), probably not
politically correct, but whatever, but we started this years ago. We were actually too far ahead of our time, but the fact
of the matter is we want to increase the level of customer service that we provide to our shoppers. We think this is
consistent with that, whether this venture will do that or not, we don't know. We're going to continue to experiment.
We've got a whole smorgasbord of things that we're investing to do that. And the sole purpose is to make the consumer
visit more pleasant, which is a huge focus for us this year, next year, and the year after.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: That makes sense. As I thought about this, I said to myself, is the next evolution that I go to
your website for whatever mall I'm shopping at and I can do a search for white shirt and then instantly your website
brings up every white shirt that's being sold in the mall. I can click on which one I want and buy it. Is that the next
evolution that you have to get to is the integration of inventory of all your retailers onto your website so that that will
be the interface?
<A - David E. Simon>: I would say that would be terrific if we could ultimately get to their store level inventory and
be able to communicate that to the consumer much like the mall aggregates all the physical stores. If we could figure
out how to do that, that would be great. It's not that easy because you have to essentially get into the customer – the
retailers' inventory.
But the one thing I want you to do, when you do go to the mall, I want to be able to tell you when you go to the mall,
here is what's new in retailer XYZ, here is what promotion XYZ retailer has, here is who does have a white shirt, to go
to what retailer. So, you have a – your first stop at the mall is going to be able to communicate to you what's new and
what's exciting. So, that makes your visit that much more pleasant, if in fact we can do that, and more profitable for
you. So, I think it's as interesting to do it while you're in the physical environment as it is whether you're at home or on
your mobile device.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Appreciate it. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thank you. It's actually Craig Schmidt. I'm noticing the new development, blended
stabilized rate of return is 9%. Is that more due to higher costs or are the rents unable to be pushed as much as say
maybe a year ago?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Hey, Craig, it's Steve. It's really neither. It's – that number, the mix changes from time to
time. We opened some projects. As David mentioned, the first year return on the stuff that is opened, which is no
longer on the list, was 10.5%. So, it's simply a mix change. But there has been no real fundamental change in our
ability to get rents or cost control or our expectations for our development pipeline.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. And I just – I noticed the re-leasing spreads have been up four quarters in a row
and on a dollar basis, have gone from $4.86 to $8.05. I am wondering where can they can go from here and is that from
limited supply of quality space or just a growing demand from retailers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's a function of – demand is solid and you've got to look at what's expiring. So, as I
said, we – there is this huge focus on our retailer sales. We've tried to explain the correlation is slight, if at all, and it's
in lag. Fact is as you know, retail sales have gone up dramatically since the great recession. And you look at what's
expiring and you look at the supply and demand characteristics. You put it all together, it's more of an art than a
science, and that's why we're able to have pretty good re-leasing spreads.

Now, the fact of the matter is $8 is pretty damn good. We're finishing our budget for next year; we're going to see good
comp NOI growth just like we have the last two or three years, and that ultimately does not take into account when we
look at what the Houston Gallerias and the Fields and the Del Amos are going to do after those developments are done.
And those malls have been transformed to take their rightful position in the 21st century of great real estate that can't be
duplicated. So, I can't – we're not going to give you a number, but things are okay, and we'll continue to pound away.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah, hi. I was wondering, did you see anything change in terms of traffic during the
third quarter?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, generally, September was a pretty bad month in terms of traffic and sales for all retailers.
And we're starting to hear and feel that traffic is bouncing back in October, but clearly, clearly, the general economy
has slowed. And we're no – the fact is we get impacted by that less than most others because of where our properties
are positioned and the depth and breadth and the diversity of our properties. But the fact is, we're not denying that the
U.S. has actually slowed. We could talk philosophically about why, but it's nothing with what we're doing. But we
certainly have seen that from our retailers generally across the board at both high-end, middle and at the more moderate
customer base.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Got it. And then I guess going back to one of your answers before where you mentioned,
if I mentioned the stock, it would go up, you'd upgrade it, blah, blah, blah. Off-the-cuff comment there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, and probably a stupid one. Yeah, off-the-cuff and stupid. It's a little early, we're usually
at 11 o'clock, 9 o'clock, we're trying to get our groove on. So, the fact is, probably off-the-cuff.

Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. I just want to think about outlets for a second and when we look at some of the
recent projects, some of them have been, just in the industry in general, some of them have been more urban, far more
correlated with population centers rather than being further outside. What do you think it means for the projects you
must develop over the next 10 years and what does it mean for the existing real estate in the outlet business that tends
to be at the outskirts of town?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, Cedrik, I believe there has been one that's been built that's more infilled. So, we
do not hear – I will just tell you this. Our outlet business is great. We're building terrific products. We will not make
pronouncements about what the future of the world is going to be. We're not that good or arrogant. We're going to
continue to do what we do. We've always picked over the last several years, major important metro markets, usually
suburban locations, Toronto, St. Louis, New Hampshire, go down the list, all of which have been very successful.
We're continuing to do that.
There may be one or two built that's more urban, but one does not make a trend. We will not make pronouncements
here. We're not in that business. We're in running our business day-in and day-out to increase our cash flow, make

smart investments, smart developments. And our track record indicates, so far, knock on wood, we're pretty good at
that. But I will not make pronouncements that that's the new trend. One does not make a trend.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. What do retailers say about their preferred locations in terms of outlets and whether or
not they do have an interest in trying to move more infill?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the fact that we're 100% leased on every outlet that we open gives you an indication
what they're telling us.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think, Cedrik, the retailers want to be where they can be as productive as possible. And

Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yeah, hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Thinking about dispositions for a second, I don't think you addressed those, Dave. You sold
off two this quarter. And I'm curious, have you given more thought to maybe selling off a bigger chunk or spinning out
a group of your lower tier regional mall assets in the U.S.?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Rich, the fact is, we're always looking to do as much portfolio management as we can.
And as I mentioned to you earlier, I mean, since 2010, basically $12.8 billion of acquisitions, $2.7 billion of
dispositions, $1 billion of new development, not including the redevelopment. So that's part of our focus day-in and
day-out and that will always be an important thing in terms of what we do. And the form of which that takes will
depend on market conditions, but we'll continue to do portfolio management. It's very important, very vital. It's been
something that we've been pretty good at over 20-year history of a public company. So, we'll continue to do that, Rich.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: But no real thought, Dave, to a big chunk, I guess, of assets, as opposed to one or two at a
time, as opportunities arise?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, I'm not going to share exactly the internal work-ins that we do day-in and day-out
in terms of how do you do the best portfolio management possible. But needless to say, if you look at our history, it's
an important thing that the senior management team needs to do and we'll continue to do it to the best of our ability. So,
I'm not saying one way or another exactly how that will be done. It is just we will portfolio manage to the best of our
abilities.

<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to go back to, along the line of Craig's
questioning, and again re-leasing spreads, ability to keep raising rents going forward. Steve, could you give us a sense
of where occupancy costs are right now, relative to historical levels and how much that gives you confidence about

pushing rents going forward?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Tayo, the occupancy costs are 11.4%. I think we gave you about five quarters of trailing in
the supplemental on page 23. And that's down 100 to 150 basis points from where it would have been going back to
2010. But I think, the other point I would add is that it's been very stable over those five quarters. So, we are – we've
been at that 11.3% to 11.4% range and we still have momentum in our business, and that bodes, I believe, very well for
our ability to hopefully continue our performance going forward.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Okay. That's helpful. But with your – with the tenants at this point when you're going
through lease negotiations, how much are they really kind of bringing up this issue of slowing tenant sales in general
and a tough retail outlook when they're negotiating with you? Or do they just want the space so badly, it doesn't really
come up?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me answer that. I mean, the perception that the retailers negotiate -- let's take an
example. Let's say their comp NOI is up 4%, and they are willing to pay $11, and the comp sales are flat, they go to
$10, is not reality, okay. They look at it over a longer period of time, what they're going to do, what the return on equity
and profitability in that store is.
So, again, we try to give you a sense of these numbers generally, what's happening in the – from our retailers, but the
fact is comps, the immediate ups and downs of comps have no bearing on what rent we can charge overall. And so over
a long period of time, potentially, but the one thing you have to remember is our comp sales also include retailers that
are going out of favor. And if they were in favor five or seven years ago, sometimes they're able to negotiate whatever
rents because we think they're a new and exciting retailer. If that wanes or waxes, the fact is we're able to replace that
retailer with someone else that's there. So, there is no boy-I-had-a-bad-quarter-sales, therefore I'm going to – I want to
pay you less rent. It doesn't work that way.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: That's definitely helpful color. I think -- I was just, along the lines of if you have three
quarters of bad sales, that's kind of what I was kind of thinking, what happens at that point. But I think the explanation
has been very helpful. So, thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. No worries.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah. Don't lose sight of the fact that between 2010 and 2012, over that three-year period,
sales were up 25% in our portfolio.

<Q - Vincent Chao>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Since no one else has asked this here, I'll just throw it out there. I
was just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts here on what you're seeing from JCPenney. And given that
they are discounting pretty heavily to try to claw back some share in sales, just wondering if you're seeing or noticing
any impact on other parts of the mall as a result of those efforts?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. I would say generally it's not – there is not a real impact on the mall environment, both
with the old Penney, the potential new transformed Penney and now the recovering to back to basics Penney. I mean, if
you go through kind of the three cycles, the way they were doing it, the radical change, now back to basics Penney, the
fact of the matter is, it really hasn't impacted kind of the entire mall environment that what we have.
If they get back to the basic Penney, having them – they do broaden the mix generally in the environment and they
appeal to a more moderate consumer, which we'd love to have in a number of cases in a number of malls, as well as the

higher income consumer. And that market is there for them to appeal to that consumer in the mall environment, which
they've done historically for 100-plus years. So -- and even the before the mall environment. So, we'll wait to see how
they do that, but it's really had no impact on the, what I'll call the mall environment.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. So I mean they are making some progress on the sales decline, so I was just curious if
that's hurting anybody else, but it sounds like not.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well look, we're glad that they are, but again it's not a huge impact on what's going on in the
mall.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Yang with Evercore. Please proceed.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yeah, Hi, thanks. Maybe for David, I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on the B mall or
even the C mall sales market, which has been surprisingly active this year, maybe in terms of the prices being paid for
these type of assets, what that might mean for the value of your stock, if anything. And then also, maybe building off of
Rich's question, do you think spinning off a B mall portfolio would unlock some value for you guys?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, there is a lot there, so – and you broke up at the end. Did you hear the end part?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Potential of --
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: I guess maybe just starting, just what your thoughts are in terms of the prices being paid for B
and C malls and what that might mean for the value of your stock, if anything at all?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I'm not going to comment on the value of our stock other than you need to look at us as a
company that can increase its cash flow and its dividend and it has a lot of future, very high returns on equity
investments, under-levered, ability to execute its game plan. We get caught up too much on A malls, B malls, tenant
sales, all of that stuff. Put it all in a blender, you allocate it, you figure out what's most important to you. What's most
important to me is cash flow growth and return on investment and equity. And that's what we strive to execute, and the
ability to finance our business appropriately, making smart investment decisions, which all kind of factors in, and then
the market decides what the value of the stock should be.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Got it.
<A - David E. Simon>: I don't get carried away, one way or another. And the fact is we look at every asset as it's very
important to our business. We look at the future growth prospects. If we might dispose of it, we look at what the price
we might get, we factor in the taxable income, what we might have to do in terms of dividend if we sold it, because as
you know we're at our taxable income number, it's growing rapidly. Our dividend is going to grow. We put all those
things in and we try to do the best we can and we see where it takes us.
So it's good that -- the big picture, I'm not going to comment on price other than it's – I think it's very positive,
generally speaking, that there's a lot of activity in, if you want to call it B or C malls, call it B or C malls. I think that
never hurts us as an owner of – if you want to say we're an owner of B and C, that's fine. It never hurts us that there is a
lot of capital activity in that business.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe for a follow-up instead, can you maybe talk about your
expectations for cash flow growth in your A mall versus the B mall and whether you think that's going to compress in
the coming few quarters or even years?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think, historically, the better the center or the more – let me say it differently, the more
market share any piece of real estate has the better its cash flow growth characteristics they have. So, whether it's A or
B, it's irrelevant. It's really a question of does it have market share, what's the competitive outlook, and those that have
that position have better growth characteristics, generally speaking.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Good morning.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Thinking about McArthurGlen, in the European outlet business, specifically the leasing
side. We have upside exposure in the U.S. with overage rents. Is it similarly structured there or any other nuances we
should be thinking about?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's very much structured towards sales. But it's even more clever in the sense that they have, in
their leases, they get a percent of sales, but the high water mark is then fixed at kind of their base rent. So you get the
best of both worlds in a sense. And these centers on average do, just to, if you convert, you all can convert, but we'll do
it. These things average about $900 a foot. So it is a, the ones that we've invested in, and as -- we think over time we'll
be able to invest in other outlets in Europe through McArthurGlen, we think it's a very productive portfolio and
extension opportunities and the like.
So we think it's a, we think -- we like it and we expect it to be a very good investment for us over time. And I think
we're coming in at a decent valuation. So again, that's our ability to assess real estate, handle the complexity of a
partnership like this, different countries, different personalities, and we're one of the few companies that are able to do
a deal like this. And that is a, respectfully I say, a competitive advantage for the company.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: In terms of growth there, how penetrated do you think Europe is with outlets relative to
the U.S.? I mean what's the opportunity set, in your view?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's good, because the right to build in Europe continues, whether it's an outlet or even a full
price, continues to be very high – very hard, I should say.

Your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Thanks very much. Was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the comments in terms
of upgrading the assets, and you've done a great job over time, and very strong redevelopment pipeline now. And when
you go through the mall portfolio, mall by mall in the next couple of weeks. How much do you have in terms of a
shadow redevelopment pipeline where you look at it and say, we'd love to do this redevelopment, but don't want to do
so until as we look at these struggling anchors here, if this were to happen, we'd do it? Just trying to think about sort of
that, the opportunity in terms of the shadow pipeline there?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, let me just, if I could just comment generally on it, we are in the midst, again, of
doing the biggest extensions and the biggest redevelopments that we have. So as an example, I'm not going to do the
list, we are under construction in the Field, Roosevelt Field, we are under construction in Stanford, we're under
construction shortly in Houston Galleria. And we're getting the approvals in, at King of Prussia to create the extension
between the two big assets.
We just got approval from the BRA at Copley. We still need another hurdle. So, we are literally – we just finished
Nanuet, Shops at Nanuet, which if anybody that has seen the mall prior to what we've done before, you would be
pleasantly surprised, not only just with the transformation, but with the lease-up. So, we are – for Del Amo, to name
another one, we're in the midst of huge construction there, bringing Nordstrom in and all the rest.
So, right now, the biggest focus is executing these huge big redevelopments that are going to be really exciting. And
there is a lot of opportunities beyond that. And our pipeline in terms of redevelopment is in the $4 billion to $5 billion
range. But beyond discussing it, because everybody can have the shadow, the fact of the matter is, it's happening right
now. Right now, it's happening. So, this is no longer we're going to do this; it's actually happening and I've got the
pictures to prove it, if you're interested.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing I would add is, David touched on the major redevelopment projects.
We're also adding 39 new anchors across the platforms this year and we've been adding that every year and each of
those additions just make our properties stronger. We also have an ongoing renovation program, where we're
renovating a number of projects every year, and all that is just part of what we're doing to keep our products relevant
and enhance their market share.

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Jeremy, it's Steve Sterrett. It's a couple of things. One is, as David mentioned earlier, we
have sold some assets, we also had a wholly-owned asset that converted to a joint venture in 2013. So there are fewer
properties, which is causing part of the decline that you're seeing. The rest of the decline is caused by the fact that
insurance costs are a little lower. It's really those two items that are driving it.

Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Yeah, Rick, I got just a question on sort of occupancy. 95.5%, I recognize that
includes the outlets, but I think that's a peak overall, certainly ahead of where you were even in the fourth quarter of
last year. And so, I'm just curious as you head into the holiday season, when you start including some of the temp
spaces, how should we think about occupancy and how full the portfolio is, how you're balancing that with rent, which
continues to move up in terms of the spreads?
And then as you think about 2014, given the fact that you've already leased a lot of that space and done your renewals
and – what's that visibility that you have into 2014 in terms of occupancy? It seems like a great place to start from, at
95.5% today.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, first, we don't include temp space in the occupancy. Secondly, what we're doing is
making our space more efficient and we are going to be able to continue to generate increases in NOI, because we're
constantly looking to see how we can make our space more effective by bringing in more productive tenants, David
made the point earlier, by decreasing the amount of space allocated to given tenants.
And frankly, we still have leasing going on in the pipeline. So, we're never going to be satisfied and never get to the
point where we say to you, well, we're fully occupied. The bottom line is, look in the Premium Outlets that are 100%,
for all intents and purposes, and we're still driving our NOI and driving spreads, because we're doing more effective
leasing, more effective space allocation to more productive tenants.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: So, where does occupancy go then? I'm just – I know you don't include temp, so what
does that mean for the fourth quarter in terms of...
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I would certainly hope that we continue to show advances over where we are.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: And your 2014 outlook in terms of how much you've already done relative to that
roll?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're certainly going to anticipate that we're going to be able to increase it in 2014.

<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Hey, I know you talked a little about sales on this call, but if I look at your percentage
rent growth line, in the first half of the year it was growing about 30% or more, and we're down to 10% year-over-year
growth in the third quarter. That seems consistent with the slowdown that we're hearing from a lot of the mall retailers.
Is that, I mean, can we assume that you are thinking that's a temporary slowdown, and that we'll pick up even in this
quarter?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the fact is that some of our percentage rents, we've had certain tenants that have run into
harder sales, and then some of that have picked the balance up. So it's all over the lot. But we'll see how the next couple
of months pan out, David. It's very hard for us to give you a really specific answer to that question. We do have certain
earnings risk tied to percentage rent. We gave – we took that into account in raising our guidance. And, but it's clear,
and we're not denying this, it is clear that, and it's not Simon Property Group, it is clear that the economy has slowed.
You've seen it with wages, you've seen it with employment. Needless to say we don't have to get into what's going on
in terms of leadership in our country, none of which we use as an excuse, because we put blinders on to the best of our
abilities when it comes to that kind of stuff. But we're operating at a high level in a very slow growth economy, and
we're outpacing the growth in the economy and that's all that we can do, but we are affected by the economy. I mean, I
wish I wasn't, but we are and...
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: What period did this most remind you of in say the last 10 or 15 years, David?
<A - David E. Simon>: Good question, good question. The fact is, let me – I don't have an immediate -- usually I
would just make something up, but I can't even come up with that at this point. But I would say a little bit like coming
out of, my initial reaction would be coming out of the – when we were public, coming out of kind of the 1997, that era,
where it was just kind of, we weren't – we hadn't ended, we'd survived and it was just kind of grinding, we were
grinding about. Now, by the way, when we're grinding, I got double digit FFO increase, okay. So just keep that in
perspective. But kind of like that, David, would be the initial off-the-cuff reaction.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Okay, can I sneak in with a quick one for Steve?
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Steve, with the issuance of the euro bond, it reminded me, are you embracing or have you
used any of these tax structures that are sort of coming under greater scrutiny like double Irish or using the Netherlands,
Luxemburg, to structure your offshore interests?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Not really, David. It's pretty plain vanilla. We record, as an example, we record a tax
expense as it relates to the Klépierre earnings that we pick up our share of every quarter. So, relatively plain vanilla
structure.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, in fact, just to reinforce what Steve said, if you look at our – we did, as we've made
more international investments, we're having to pay taxes in those jurisdictions. And if you see our P&L, we actually
separated that out so that you can see that impact, because it's becoming less than trivial.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Right. Simon is not Apple.
<A - David E. Simon>: No, no. I wish I were, like in cash flow. But no, I don't want Carl Icahn on me, but I do wish I
were Apple.

Our last question comes from the line of John Kim with CLSA. Please proceed.
<Q - John Kim>: Good morning and thank you. I just wanted to follow up on your comments on international
opportunities. Right now, international is about 8% of your NOI. At what level do you feel comfortable of this going to
in the next few years? And then also, geographically, where do you see the most compelling opportunities between
Europe, Asia, and South America?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we don't – our only goal is to make smart investments and investments that we can add
value to. So, the fact of the matter is if our international business stays the same or goes up slightly, it doesn't – that's
not how we think. We're only looking to make smart investments where we can add value. And we have a higher
threshold in international investments because it's a lot of work and it's got to be – there is no desire here just to do
international for the sake of international. The desire here is to make international investments because one, we can
--think we can add value, and two is because we think at the end of the day we're going to make money, and Klépierre
is a perfect example of that.
So, I don't have in my mind it ought to go from X to Y, and each jurisdiction that we're in is different. But we are doing
new development in Asia. We're not an acquirer of assets in Asia just because it's a tougher market. And we're sticking
to the outlet business and in markets that we're in, where we can develop and we – and it meets our threshold return

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, China I gave to you. Brazil, we continue to look at opportunities there in the outlet

<Q - John Kim>: All right. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.
