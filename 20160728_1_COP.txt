MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Christine and I will be
your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, VP Investor Relations and Communications, ConocoPhillips. You may
begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Christine, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to the second quarter earnings call. With me today are
Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Don Wallette, our EVP of Finance, Commercial and our Chief Financial Officer;
and Al Hirshberg, our EVP of Production, Drilling and Projects.
Our cautionary statement is shown on page two of our presentation. We'll make some forward-looking statements on
today's call that refer to estimates and plans. Actual results could differ due to the factors noted on this slide and in our
SEC filings. We may also refer to some non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparisons across
periods and with peers. For any non-GAAP measures we use, a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP
measure can be found on our website.

So with those administrative details out of the way, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan.
Ryan M. Lance
Thanks, Ellen, and good morning. I'll begin on slide four. This is a recap of our 2Q results, and Don and Al will
provide more detail in a moment. But the key messages are, we delivered strong operational performance, our financial
performance is improving and we're making progress strategically to position ourselves for a world of lower and more
volatile prices.
Let me quickly go through this slide. Production grew year-over-year by 3%. Our second quarter performance
exceeded guidance, despite a busy season of turnarounds and over a month of downtime at Surmont due to the
wildfires. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we're raising the mid-point of our 2016 production guidance
by 2%. We're also lowering our 2016 CapEx from $5.7 billion to $5.5 billion, based on efficiency improvements really
across all business lines. Our major projects across our portfolio are on track for startup as planned, and Al will talk
about these projects in more detail.
Our financial performance was challenged, like the rest of industry, but did improve sequentially in line with prices.
Three of five of our producing segments were profitable this quarter, and I think this highlights the benefit of having
high-quality legacy assets in our portfolio. Cash flows were in line with expectations and we ended the quarter with
over $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. We're continuing to make progress on our asset sale
program and expect to achieve our goal of about $1 billion of proceeds this year.
We reduced debt by $800 million in the second quarter, so we're making progress on improving our balance sheet. On
the strategic front, we continued our phased exit of deep water exploration. We signed an agreement to sell our position
in Senegal in July and expensed our remaining deep water position in the Gibson and Tiber wells in the Gulf of Mexico
and we drilled a successful appraisal well at Shenandoah. Our adjusted operating costs continue to improve across the
business and we're lowering our full-year guidance there as well. This will create additional cash flow momentum as
prices improve.
And finally, we continue to spend a lot of time analyzing the macro outlook and the choices we have for allocating cash
flows through the business cycles. This is an important aspect of our value proposition and very much on the minds of
investors. We've set priorities and targets that will guide our allocation decisions. By following these priorities, we can
create value as prices recover and through future price cycles.
So before I turn it over to Don and Al, I want to step through our allocation priorities and targets on the next slide. The
way to create value in this business is through disciplined capital allocation. On last quarter's call, I outlined the
principles of our capital allocation approach, which is shown on the left side of the slide. And as a reminder, they were
that the dividend will remain a core part of our offering and we're targeting real annual growth in that dividend.
Another principle is to maintain a strong balance sheet. The recent downtown has emphasized the importance of this
principle. For us, that means having debt of less than $25 billion.
And finally, we'll focus on disciplined growth, where our per share growth will complete with absolute growth. We
have positioned the company to compete on returns. So while we have a large low cost of supply portfolio, we'll be
disciplined about allocating cash to volume growth. Now establishing these principles was an important first step in
articulating our value proposition, especially coming out of the downturn. But we also want to set priorities and targets
that will guide our incremental allocation decisions, and these are shown on the right-hand side of this slide. Let me
step through them.
The first use of cash is to pay our existing dividend and invest capital to maintain our production base. Now, let me be
clear that flat production is not our goal. But at a minimum, we want to sustain our existing production. Because of our
low decline base production, we can keep production flat for over a decade with CapEx of $5 billion to $6 billion, and
we believe our capital intensity is now one of the lowest among our competitors, and that's a real advantage.

After our cash from operations exceeds the level required to cover our dividend and CapEx for flat volumes, the next
use of cash will be to grow our quarterly dividend – our dividend annually at a real rate. We think this is a prudent and
sustainable target. Our next priority is to reduce our debt to below $25 billion. Our target is to reduce debt as it matures,
but we might accelerate some of that reduction with asset sales. Our target is to have an A rated balance sheet, which
we think is a competitive advantage.
Next we have a target to achieve 20% to 30% total shareholder payout of cash flow from operations through a
combination of our ordinary dividend and flexible share repurchases. We don't believe our ordinary dividend represents
enough return of capital to shareholders through the cycles for a company our size and maturity. So when we have
available cash flows, we expect to return additional capital through share buybacks. We believe this will be a
differential aspect of our offering. It will also force discipline on the system while giving us a more flexible means of
returning capital to our owners.
And our final priority of cash flows will be to invest in our large, low cost of supply captured resource base. We'll
allocate capital to the lowest cost of supply opportunities, while maintaining an appropriate balance between short and
medium-cycle programs. And we have that inventory to grow.
So what I've laid out should give you a clear sense of how we plan to create value through disciplined capital
allocation. You should not think of our priorities and targets as a precise formula, but rather as a relative ranking of the
choices we can exercise through the cycles. In some parts of the cycles, we can envision pulling out all these levers.
And other times, we may be hunkered down. But in all parts of the cycle, we'll be disciplined.
So let me stop here. We'll have some more time for your questions in this call. We'll also provide a lot more detail on
our strategy at our Analyst and Investor Meeting in November. But what you should take away for my comments is
that we know where we're headed and we have a strategy that is distinctive and will differentiate ConocoPhillips from
our competitors.
So let me turn it over to Don for a few comments on our financial results.
Donald Evert Wallette
Thanks, Ryan. I'll provide a quick overview of the second quarter financials, starting with adjusted earnings on slide
seven. The business is performing well operationally and we grew production 3%, but the low commodity price
environment continues to impact financial results. For the second quarter, with an average realized price of around $28
per BOE, we reported an adjusted net loss of roughly $1 billion or $0.79 per share.
A couple of items to note that negatively impacted earnings in the quarter. We expensed our remaining position in the
Keathley Canyon area of the deep water Gulf of Mexico and, with respect to adjusted earnings, recognized the Gibson
and Tiber wells as dry holes. We also saw higher DD&A in the quarter and we're increasing our guidance for the year
from $8.5 billion to $9.2 billion. This increase is due in part to stronger production performance, but it's also related to
an increase in the DD&A rate, primarily a result of price-related reserve revisions.
We continued to reduce costs across the business and achieved an 18% reduction in adjusted operating costs compared
to the year-ago quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings by segment are shown in the lower-right side of the slide.
While Lower 48 was impacted sequentially by higher DD&A and dry hole expenses, the remaining segments are
roughly in line with expectations. As a reminder, the supplemental data on our website provides additional financial
detail.
Turning to slide eight, I'll cover production. Our second quarter production averaged 1.546 million BOE per day, which
exceeded our guidance, despite the wildfires in Canada. Last year, second quarter volumes were 1.595 million BOE per
day, or 1.523 million BOE per day when adjusted for dispositions.
Adjusting for the impact of incremental downtime, production increased by 46,000 BOE a day, representing 3% growth
year-over-year. Increases in LNG and liquids volumes were partially offset by lower natural gas volumes, mostly in

North America. This gets you to our 1.546 million BOE per day production for the quarter.
If you turn now to slide nine, I'll cover the cash flow waterfall for the first half of the year. We started the year with
$2.4 billion in cash and have generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, excluding operating working capital
changes. Total working capital was a use of cash of $600 million in the first half of the year. This was largely driven by
reduced capital spending and lower decommissioning activity in Europe. Since we don't expect a significant reversal of
our spending trends for the remainder of 2016, we believe working capital will be a use of cash for the full year.
Proceeds from asset sales, mostly North America gas properties, were $400 million in the first half. Through the first
six months, debt increased by $3.8 billion. This reflects the $4.6 billion debt raised in the first quarter, offset by $800
million of commercial paper retired in the second quarter. Capital spending for the first half of the year was $3 billion.
And after dividend payments of $600 million and some other small items, we ended June with $4.2 billion in cash and
short-term investments.
Now I'll turn it over to Al to run through our operational performance.
Alan J. Hirshberg
Thanks, Don. I'll go through our operations by segment and then provide a brief overview of what's left to watch for in
the second half of the year, and then we can take your questions. If you turn to slide 11, I'll start with the Lower 48 and
Canada segments.
In the Lower 48, our production in the second quarter was 503,000 barrels per day. Once you adjust for asset sales,
that's an underlying decrease of 17,000 barrels a day compared to this time last year. The unconventionals produced
262,000 barrels per day, or down 4% from second quarter of 2015. That's better performance than we had expected,
driven primarily by better well performance in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, but also by the lag effects from our
ramp-down in rig activity. Now that we're running with three rigs, we expect decline in the unconventionals to steepen
somewhat in the second half of the year. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw successful results at the latest Shenandoah 5
appraisal well, which encountered over 1,000 feet of net pay.
Moving to Canada, our production was 279,000 barrels per day. Adjusted for dispositions, we saw growth compared to
the second quarter of last year, even including the wildfire impacts at Surmont. That's the result of ongoing ramp up of
our oil sands projects, which provided a 16% increase in bitumen production compared to this time last year. We
expect growth to continue as Surmont 2 ramps up to full capacity through 2017 and we bring additional phases online
at FCCL. We also achieved first production with the commissioning of the Foster Creek Phase G during the second
quarter and we're progressing toward first production at Christina Lake Phase F.
Moving to slide 12, I'll cover the Alaska and Europe and North Africa segments. In Alaska, we saw growth compared
to the same time last year, with second quarter production of 179,000 barrels per day. This came from ongoing strong
production at CD5 and drill site 2S. In the quarter, we also approved an expansion phase of CD5, which will add an
additional 16 wells and bring CD5 to its full design capacity. We have significant turnaround activity planned in Alaska
for the third quarter at both Kuparuk and Alpine. And finally, we completed the sale of our Beluga River asset in the
Cook Inlet during the quarter.
In Europe and North Africa, production of 187,000 barrels per day was down 20,000 barrels per day compared to the
same period last year. That decrease is primarily the result of increased turnaround activity in this year's second quarter.
In the U.K., at Clair Ridge, the drilling and production modules were successfully installed and progress is also
continuing at Alder, where we expect to achieve first production in the fourth quarter.
Moving to slide 13, I'll cover the Asia-Pacific and Middle East and other international segments. In APME, production
was 398,000 barrels per day, up 14% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the ongoing ramp up at
APLNG. Train 1 is continuing to run ahead of expectations, with 27 cargos loaded in the first half of the year, including
our first cargo to Kansai Electric in Japan. We're on track to deliver the first cargo from Train 2 in the fourth quarter of
2016.

In Malaysia, Gumusut is continuing to produce at high level and third-party pipeline commissioning is underway at
KBB, so we're beginning to see increased production volumes there as well. And the sailaway of the Malikai TLP was
completed this month, with startup expected next year. In the other international segment, the key milestone was
signing the SPA for the sale of our exploration blocks in Senegal in July. The sale is expected to generate proceeds of
$400 million to $450 million.
If you turn to slide 14, I'll provide a few comments about our outlook for the rest of the year. As Ryan and Don
mentioned, the business has performed well through the first half of the year. We're updating our full-year production
guidance to 1.54 million barrels per day to 1.57 million barrels per day. That's an increase of 35,000 barrels per day, or
about 2% over prior guidance. While at the same time, we're lowering both our capital and our operating cost guidance.
For the third quarter, we expect production to be between 1.51 million barrels per day and 1.55 million barrels per day,
which reflects ongoing turnaround activity in Europe and Alaska.
Our project activity is on track. We're continuing to ramp up at our Surmont and FCCL projects and are progressing
several other projects in Alaska, Europe, and Asia Pacific. We expect to complete our Senegal sale before the end of
the year and we're continuing to market our remaining deep water exploration positions in Eastern Canada and the Gulf
of Mexico.
And then finally, just a reminder that we will host our 2016 Analyst and Investor Meeting in New York on November
10. At that meeting, we'll provide more details on our cash flow priorities, our low cost of supply portfolio and our
future investment plans. So we look toward to seeing all of you at that update.
And now I'll turn it over for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. [Operator
Instructions] And our first question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Paul.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Actually, good afternoon. Well, anyway, Ryan, just curious, your partner in Canada was saying
that they are ready to restart Christina Lake. Given that your portfolio is different than theirs, is there any maybe
scheduling differences in [indiscernible] (18:48) between you and your partner?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Scheduling what – scheduling differences, Paul?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Yeah, in terms of the expectation, given that I think the first set of assets that you're going to go
back and reinvest, I don't believe it's going to be in [ph] north end (19:05) I presume that it's going to be in Eagle Ford
and Bakken and Permian. So how is that we reconcile that?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, no. Well, we spend quite a bit of time with our partner up in Canada talking about our
plans. We've been fairly well aligned in terms of what the performance and the opportunity set looks like. I'm aware
some of their comments are wanting to ramp up some of their spending, get back to work on some the project with
increased oil prices. But we've got that accommodated in our plans as well. And we work really close with them to
make sure that we're doing the right things and if the projects make sense economically and have a competitive cost of
supply.

<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Just a real quick one from me. Maybe do you have a production number for Eagle Ford,
Bakken and Permian in the second quarter?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, I can quote you those numbers. It's actually, production is actually up in the Eagle
Ford versus the fourth quarter to the second quarter.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: I've got them here. I've got them here, if you want.
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: You asked us the same question the first quarter about Eagle Ford, and we are at 168,000.
We're up to 171,000 in the second quarter. Bakken was 65,000 the first quarter. It's 64,000 the second quarter. So
actually if you add Eagle Ford in Bakken together, we're up a few thousand barrels a day in the second quarter versus
the first quarter.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I think it's still morning in Houston. So, Ryan, I think is it
slide number five, the 20% to 30% cash flow shareholder payout, I think that's a new number on the slide deck this
quarter. I just wanted to get a clarification to make sure we're interpreting this properly. That includes the dividend, I
assume?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. It does, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: On that basis then, can you just give us some idea as to what kind of thresholds you're thinking
about? Because I imagine at $70 oil that would imply a much bigger number than obviously $50 oil. So can you give us
some idea, is there a limit to the level that you would put on that? Or should we just take that as a kind of blanket
guidance going forward?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, Doug, I think the way to think about that is we recognize that as prices recover that the
dividend payout that we have today doesn't represent probably enough return to shareholders in a recovered price
scenario where we're starting to free cash flow above our requirements of the current dividend and to keep our
production flat at a minimum.
So we recognize that, as prices recover, that's not enough payout to shareholders. Even when we spun the company, we
were talking about these kinds of payout levels. We were doing that with just the ordinary dividend at the time. So we
set a pretty broad range, 20% to 30%, and clearly, we'll take a look at that as the circumstances warrant. And then
compare, really, as you get down to those fourth and fifth priorities, it's about what kind of investments do we have that
the shareholders would want us to be making in the portfolio? What kind of returns do they have? What kind of costs of
supply do they have and how does that compare to where our stock is trading at the time and the value that we see in
the shares and compare those two and make those decisions as we go down the road.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Thanks for that. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess, and it's a clarification on your
debt targets. Because, again, number three on that list is pay down debt. You're already at a net debt number below $25
billion, and you're talking about paying debt as it matures. So are you now at the debt level you're comfortable with? Or
do you still want the absolute debt to be below $25 billion? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Donald Evert Wallette>: Yeah, Doug. No. This is Don. We wanted to be real clear. When we talk about balance
sheet debt, we could be talking about net debt, too, but we didn't want there to be any ambiguity. What we're looking at
is balance sheet debt that at the end of the first quarter was approaching $30 billion or so. And that's when we set our
target and said we want to bring that down to a number less than $25 billion.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. But, Don, to be clear, if you're paying maturities as they come due, I assume that's from
cash from the balance sheet. So isn't that essentially a net debt number?
<A - Donald Evert Wallette>: Well, we'll see how the macro environment turns out. But we would hope that that
would come not just from cash on the balance sheet, but also from organic cash flow.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question, guys. You've clearly had a lot of success ramping at
APLNG. Is there a point with Train 1 or getting into Train 2, where the project in aggregate begins to be a net cash
generator?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, this is Al. I'll take that one. As we're still spending a lot of capital in on construction
on Train 2, of course. But once both trains have ramped up, the project, if you include even the financing, the cost of
that, throws off cash when you get to around around a $45 a barrel kind of number.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: $45 barrel, is that is that at GCC?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Pricing? Okay. And just second quick one on the Senegal sale. Woodside threw out some
numbers on the underlying resource. Were any of those included in your proved reserves at last year end?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: No. That's a recent discovery that's a long ways from any kind of proved reserves. So our
proved reserves for Senegal on our books would be zero.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. Appreciate it, guys.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks. Good result, gentleman. Maybe if I could talk about your free cash flow generation
a little bit. We see you guys – you were near free cash flow breakeven even at $45 a barrel in the quarter here in 2016,
which is probably a little ahead of what our anticipated pace was in terms of you guys getting there in the medium
term.
Are you ahead of pace on cost reduction and cost structure optimization? And could you talk about maybe continuing
momentum that you have in that regard going forward and the potential to dip below your potential $45 a barrel target
in terms of covering CapEx and dividend?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, Ryan, I think we really got – in terms of the progress there, we've got three things all
working in our favor. We're higher on volumes, we're lower on CapEx and we're lower on OpEx. And so all those
things are moving in the right direction to help drive down our breakeven cost of capital.
We've trimmed back our guidance on CapEx and OpEx to reflect that. But we continue to make a lot of progress there.
I can go into the details more, if you want, but really that's the big picture answer, that all three of those things are
driving us in the right direction.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: And, Ryan, we're not satisfied with where the numbers are at today. And we've got a lot of
effort to continue to drive them down to get the same scope done for less capital and less cost as well. Because we've
got to continue to attack that breakeven and make sure we get the breakeven for the company down as low as we

evolved over the years and how its positioned to sustain that free cash flow generation? And is there maybe some
additional granularity on the portfolio that you might be able provide going forward that could help increase investor
confidence in this?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, so, you've heard a lot from us over the last few years about the shift that we've had
from mega projects, longer cycle, to shorter-cycle, more flexible investment that's really standing us in good stead now.
But if you just look at our near-term performance on volumes, start out with second quarter volumes. We beat the
midpoint of our guidance by 26,000 barrels a day and we're even above the high end of our range, and that was despite
having about a negative [ph] 15 (29:00) in Surmont due to the wildfires.
So you can see there that there are a lot of parts of our business that are really performing well. And the single biggest
area that drove that outperformance on volumes was the Lower 48 unconventionals, as you could kind of see from
some of the numbers we were quoting to Paul's question earlier. The decline, even running just three rigs in the Lower
48, we're seeing better performance on the volume side and on the cost side in our Lower 48 unconventional. So that's a
key driver.
And then as you look toward the end of the year at the strong momentum that we're going to have on volumes, we'll
have Alder starting up, APLNG Train 2, Surmont 2 will be continuing to ramp, KBB volumes are moving up, FCCL.
So we have a lot of different projects that'll be adding volumes that give us a lot of confidence that we can continue to
drive that volume performance of at least flat or even growth if we want to at these lower kind of capital levels that
we've been talking about. And, of course, we're going to show you a lot more detail on that in November at our Analyst
Day.

Thank you. Our next question is from Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Hi there. Good afternoon. The first question is just a follow-up to Doug's question on the
leverage level, the $25 billion target. So you have $1.250 billion coming due in the third quarter, $1 billion in 2017.
You talked about maybe accelerating some paydowns if you have asset sales. But I guess it would seem to imply that
the $25 billion target on a gross basis wouldn't be reached until maybe late 2017 perhaps. But I'm guessing you're
probably thinking faster than that based on the cash you might have coming in and the cash on the balance sheet. So,
maybe you could just clarify that for us in terms of when you think you can reach that target.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, Phil. We thought it was important to throw out an absolute gross target of debt. So, as
Don talked about, below $25 billion. And then I think some of the questions we've had since that time is saying, well,
you're not going to be doing anything else until you get to that point, so you're going to spend all – those $4 billion
required to get from $29 billion down to $25 billion will be at the expense of everything else.
And what we wanted to try to tell folks is we feel comfortable with paying off the debt as it matures with the cash flow.
So as we get some recovery in price and we're generating cash flow above what it takes to hold production flat and pay
the dividend, we'll go ahead and put that to the balance sheet. But we're not going to spend $4 billion before we do
anything else, because we think we can get there over time over the next couple of years, as you say, with the natural

maturities that we have on the balance sheet.
And we know that we want to get back into the market with some asset sales when the market starts recovering. So we
know that we'll be selling some more of our non-core assets and we'll always have that to help us accelerate that debt
repayment. But the main message, it's manageable. We think, we have a plan. We can get there just through the natural
maturities and we can get to a point that we think is solidly investment grade, in the A credit-rated band.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Got it. Okay. So you're comfortable with the next couple years. Okay. So the second question
was just on the production beat. I believe maybe it was earlier this year you gave outlooks for each region from a
production standpoint. And I think Lower 48 at the time was down 3% or so, if I have my numbers right. Maybe you
could just give us your revised thoughts on the production outlook for different regions. It sounds like Lower 48 is the
key driver of the beat and the raise.
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, I think the biggest change in our production outlook – when I was asked on the first
quarter call, with coming down to three rigs and holding that three-rig level for the rest of the year, how much did we
think our Lower 48 unconventional would decline on the year. And my answer was 10%. At that time, our projection
was we would drop about 10% in our Lower 48 unconventionals.
With this update and with the performance we've had in the second quarter, that number has been cut roughly in half.
About 6% now is what we think we'll be down in Lower 48 unconventional. So, that's a big change, holding that same
flat three-rig rate.
We've also got some improved production in Europe and in Malaysia. And so really if you think about it, those are all
above-average margin barrels for us. So that's part of the other good news in our production beat is that it's coming
from places where we have higher margin barrels.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Phil.

Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy A. Baber IV>: Thanks, everybody, for taking my question. Ryan, you mentioned you have one of the lowest
capital intensity portfolios. And I wanted to just explore that a little bit more and follow up on the earlier question. But
at $5 billion to $6 billion, you've noted you could keep your production profile flat. I believe that translates to CapEx
on a per barrel basis in the low teens. Is that the type of F&D you believe you can achieve with your current portfolio?
And can you talk about what gives you that confidence?
And I'm really trying to understand if the $5 billion to $6 billion of spend can not only hold production flat, but also
replace reserves. Or if you're comfortable drawing down your proved reserve life to a certain extent, given the strength
of your resource base.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, there's quite a lot in that, Guy. Let me just start with your first question. Yeah, we have a
lot of confidence. As I said in my remarks, $5 billion to $6 billion of capital at today's inflationary rates and what's
going on in the market today, we can see with our portfolio a decade of flat production at that kind of level.
So with the opportunities that we have to invest in the portfolio, even at the lower capital level, yeah, we're pretty clear
about what we can do over a long period of time at that kind of a level. And a lot of that's driven by the fact that after
we get APLNG up and running second train and we get Surmont 2 ramped up, we've got 500,000 – we got a third of
our production base that's virtually no decline for the next 20 years. And I think that's what's unique about our company
and that's what helps us drive down this maintenance capital level or this capital to hold our production flat to the kind
of level that we're seeing.

Now as that translates F&D, it's a little bit tougher question because now you bring in the vagaries of reserves and
bookings all that kind of stuff. And that gets to be a little bit more tougher question. But generally, you're right. It has to
drive F&D down from where we've been at over the last few years. But in our portfolio, we do have a pretty high R/P.
So we are willing to let that moderate some because the bookings will not necessarily exactly follow the capital as we
go forward. So reserve bookings end up being lumpy. But over time, over three-year and five year periods, the F&D
should follow.
And as you're starting to book all the resources that you're developing, typically in the unconventionals, even in the
Eagle Ford, we're booked to a small percentage of what we think the total resource potential will ultimately be out of
Eagle Ford. So the F&D is lumpy, but generally over time, it should happen. But there is probably some drift in R/P.
<Q - Guy A. Baber IV>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up is, as CapEx continues to be revised
lower here, I just want to make sure that we stay on top of the latest view in terms of the level and the amount of
longer-cycle committed CapEx that rolls off the books from 2016 to 2017. I think you've previously talked about $1.5
billion or so. Is that still the case?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, that story hasn't changed much from last quarter where, you're right, we were talking
about $1.5 billion. Remember that about $1 billion of that was from APLNG and FCCL joint ventures and about $0.5
billion from deep water roll-off.
The APLNG, both because of a bit lower spending and a bit higher revenues because the Train 1 is running above
expectations is using a little less so that the $1.5 billion may be down a tenth of so. But it's still in that same kind of
range. And that roll-off does provide room for us should we choose to increase rigs in the Lower 48 next year. That roll
off money is where some of that can come from and still keep us down at these same capital levels next year. Some of
that money will also be used with some of our medium-cycle size projects that are in a phase of execution where some
of their CapEx is going up from 2016 to 2017.

Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess two questions I have. One, as you described the decline in the OpEx, can you give us an
idea what you see as sustainable there? Or are there further goals to reduce it? Just trying to get an idea how much of
that is internal and how much of that might be external as activity recovers, prices goes up and some of those costs
have to go up.
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, good question, Roger. I think you've seen us continue to drive our OpEx down. I
think our organization has really continued to outperform versus the targets that we've set. We just remind ourselves we
were down $1.2 billion of OpEx with this new $6.8 billion target versus where we were last year. That's 15% from last
year. And we're down $2.9 billion from 2014, 30%. So we've driven our operating costs down about 30% from this
year versus 2014.
But we're not done. We've got a lot of very firm plans and work that's been underway this year to continue driving
those costs down next year substantially. And so we'll do the reveal on that at the November Analyst Day, but there's
more to come on our operating costs.
And, of course, the second part of your question, we are very focused on trying to do this in a sustainable way with
structural cost reductions and not just the cyclical deflation. Of course, the deflation is a piece of this, and we're trying
to hang onto that, get as much of that as we can along the way and hang onto it for as long as we can. But we recognize

that there will be reflation if prices ever come back one day and we'll give some of that back. But we're dominated here
by the structural side and real significant changes we've made in the way we're running our business.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then a cash flow question here. As we looked at the data that
came through on the spreadsheet, saw a big hit on the deferred taxes side. And I just was hoping to get maybe a little bit
of a feel for what that is. And then maybe an idea of how to think about cash taxes when prices do recover and the
company is generating profitability again.
<A - Donald Evert Wallette>: Yeah, Roger. This is Don. Yeah, we continue to see deferred tax as a use of cash, being
in a non-tax paying position in several of the key jurisdictions that we're in. I think that probably the way to think about
it going forward is that we can – we take a look at the price decks that the analyst community is using. And I think that
on the basis of those, it's really unlikely that we're going to be in a tax paying position in North America and in the U.S.
and Canada for probably the next two or three years at least under those types of price environments. So it's going to be
a while before that deferred tax flips from a use to a source.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alastair Syme of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Really have a question back on Senegal. When you look
at the equity performance of some of the partners in the asset and it did suggest the market sales price is fairly low. Can
you maybe comment on that and why you think the deal was done?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: We think we got fair value for the asset based on our assessment of the resource and the cost to
develop it.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: As a follow-up, can you maybe talk about where you're at regarding the rest of the asset sales
and, again, what the environment is like for those sort of transactions, specifically for the deep water?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. No, so we've been told – telegraphing that we think we're on track for $1 billion of
assets sales this year. And we're on track do that, so we'll deliver that. We've said we've taken a number of producing
oily assets off the market because we just don't think the market is there for a fair value with respect to that. So we're
not going to sell assets into that kind of a headwind.
We have done some North American dry gas assets and we continue to look at those in the portfolio and see if we can
get what we believe is a fair value relative to how we view the assets. That's certainly what we felt like with the
Senegal transaction. And specifically on the deep water, we've signaled to you what we think about Keathley Canyon is
there's something there, but the development probably is smaller and doesn't compete for capital in our portfolio. So
we'll be looking at what we can do about that particular area going forward as well.
Senegal, we'll look at it – I mean Shenandoah. We've had a successful appraisal well there. So we're really encouraged
about what that looks like. We'll think about putting that back on the market as well. But, again, if the market's not
there for what we think is full value, we'll continue to be a part of that development.

investors is that Conoco is kind of stuck in the middle. For some who look at you as a major, they'll say you have a low
yield. And for some that are looking you as an E&P, they'll be more focused on growth.
Is the message on that slide and going into the Analyst Day that the most powerful differentiating factor is the free cash
flow? Is that what you see as that most powerful, unique value proposition point?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, I think that the leverage to the price has a point there where we can start to generate free
cash flow with sort of modest increases in the prices. And we have tried to tell you what we're going to do with that
free cash flow. And a prevalent piece of that is a recognition that we need to return more to the shareholders as prices
start to recover relative to where the ordinary dividend is.
But I'd tell you, Neil, I think there's a lot of differentiating factors in the portfolio. The maintenance capital, keep flat
production, the quality of the investment cases that we have, the low cost of supply we have the portfolio. We will
show you that in quite a lot of detail in November. But I think there's space in the E&P world for a company like ours
that is focused on returns.
We know given our size that we can't compete against the growth, the pure-play smaller growth companies. But we're
going into a world of lower and high-volatile prices. And having some predictability, which I think we've shown
through the execution since we spun the company, we've delivered on everything we said. We know how to run the
company, we now to run this business, we know what we're doing. And as we think about that, there's space in the E&P
space for a company that does differential on returns and that can be more predictable through the cycles and do that
both on the low and the upper end.
And finally, ever since we spun the company, we've been saying that we'll give returns back to our shareholders right
off the top. And that's what we're trying to tell you here, is an important part of our offering, the 20%, 30% we
recognize needs to go to the shareholder to create discipline within the company. And that, combined with our flexible
investments and what the portfolio looks like, we think we'll differentiate ourselves.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: I appreciate that, Ryan. And just as a follow up. I always appreciate your perspective on the oil
macros. You operate in a lot of countries that we have less visibility on. And you took I think a little bit more cautious
view earlier this year, partly driving the dividend reduction. Where you see we are in the rebalancing process? And
what you think is the biggest upside and downside risk to the base case?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, I think we're concerned about it, Neil. I think the guys we've been talking and preaching
for quite a long time, we need to prepared for lower prices and volatility. And I think we're in that and we're seeing that
in spades right now. So in our outlook, our guys did predict that, yeah, we would see refineries start to cut run rates and
we'd see gasoline inventory start to build. Because we were a little bit surprised even to see the crude oil inventory
build in the last week like it did.
So we think we're in – while the supply and demand are closely balanced, it doesn't take a lot of movement on either
end to create the kind of volatility that we're seeing. So as we think about it going forward, it's kind of being really,
really cautious as we go through 2016. And it's going to take well into 2017 before we see any real increases in the
price.
So we continue, as Al said, we're batting down the hatches. We're focused on lowering the capital required to deliver
the scope and we're focused on reducing the costs and trying to get our breakeven down as low as it can possibly get
because we're going to be in this world for periods of time over the next year, year and a half.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: Appreciate it, Ryan.

<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Folks, good morning. Both of my questions are on slide five so maybe I could just ask them
both. I'm really just trying to get a point of clarity here on number two, the annual dividend growth being a real
dividend target. With inflation trending around, say, 1% or so, is that to say that that's literally what you're trying to
achieve is just maintaining pace with inflation? I don't mean to be pedantic with it, but I just wanted to clarify that.
And then the second piece is the 20% to 30% target on cash flow being paid out to shareholders. That's being put above
growth capital. So is it fair to think that the buybacks are going to take priority over reinvesting? In other words, CapEx
will remain at the $5 billion to $6 billion level until you've begun doing some buybacks? Thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, Blake. I guess a couple of things on the dividend. We say targeting real annual returns.
I'm not trying to put a percentage to it – I realize the inflation rate is quite low today. But what we're trying to say is
we're not going to be trying to increase the dividend annually to get back to somewhere like we were before we cut the
dividend.
So we're recognizing we went through the pain and the agony of the dividend decision to reset the fixed cost of the
company at the lower end of the cycle. And we recognize as we go through the middle part of the trough into the upper
end of the cycle, that's not enough return to the shareholders. So we're going to augment that with a variable
distribution plan around share buyback. And while we say, can you be counter-cyclic in that kind of world, we're going
to look at that pretty judiciously. We'll have a view of commodity prices today and where we think they're going over
the next few years. We'll look at how our shares are trading in the marketplace and we'll make a decision on what the
level of share buyback is. Certainly at a minimum, we'd like to offset the dilution that our stock programs to our
employees provide. So that would sort of set a floor on the share buyback.
But, again, I don't think there's bright lines between all of these. And as I tried to say in my comments, as the prices
start to recover, we can envision doing a little bit of everything. We're going to be doing some share buyback, but we're
also going to be investing in the portfolio as well. But certainly we view making sure that we hit the 20% to 30% return
to our shareholders is an important hurdle for us to make before we start investing in the portfolio.
<Q - Blake Fernandez>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Blake.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yeah, my first question is, obviously congrats on the well recoveries driving the
surprise in Lower 48 volumes. Obviously that's probably lowered the breakevens as well. At the same time, you've got
global inventory positions still high. Maybe talk a bit about where the breakevens are now in the core shale assets in
North America. And then what you'd need to see, maybe on the macro side or maybe just in terms of the well
performance, to start to increase activity levels. Because it does feel as if you've got this following wind from your
projects so you don't necessarily have to rush.
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Yeah, I think that's right. Our answer to that same question really hasn't changed from what
we said in the first quarter, that we don't have some set price that's going to drive us out to add rigs in Lower 48. We do
have the volume momentum that I was talking about earlier and the better volume performance we're getting from just
the rigs we're running. But we're not going to get excited and rush out there and add rigs every time the price bumps up.
The price, since the last call, the last quarter, has been up, it's been down. Did the same thing this time last year. And so
we're not on a hair trigger to go out and add rigs in that kind of situation, even though we do have a very high quality
opportunity set to invest in.
So I would say we're ready, but we're patient. And when we do add rigs, we're going to be very mindful about it. The
macro situation will have to be solid and we're going to have to have the right costs, that we'll have to be able to make
sure we can get the right contracting to be able to go back at the kind of cost level that we need to to maintain that low

cost of supply that we have from those assets.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And some idea of where that breakeven has fallen given the well performance
improvements? Say, Bakken and Eagle Ford?
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: I mean, those numbers are very low. That's really not what's driving us. We could drill like
crazy right now in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford and make a lot of money at today's prices. Those have got cost
of supplies down in the 30%s. But that's not really what's driving us. We don't want to go run out and add rigs too
quickly before we get to a clear macro environment that's going to be supportive of that.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I would add, Ed, we all can show 40%, 50%, 70% internal rates of return on an incremental
well. And we've all got that. Anybody that's got a large North American position has got that in their portfolio today.
We've got [ph] it at go-go (54:41). But as Al said, we're not going to drill in the face of $40 headwind. It's not going
anywhere. It just doesn't make any sense.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: My second question is maybe esoteric and maybe we'll have to just leave it to the
Analyst Day. But I don't know if you've done any work on just how large a non-core asset disposal program could be if
investors were still unhappy even with the $25 billion debt target that you've laid out, if they felt that really the right
gearing for sort of a volatile oil market is actually lower than the gearing targets that you have laid out. I presume
there's lots of tax impacts on old assets and a whole load of things that you'd have to think about. But I'm just trying to
get a sense of the size of the hopper that's available for disposals if you did want to reduce debt through that volatile
period.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, we'll probably speak to that more a little bit in November, Ed. We continue to watch the
macro and continue to look at what competes for investment in the portfolio. And then, as you say, there's other
considerations. Can we get the value we think we have with holding? we know our assets really well and we have a
view on the macro and we have a view what's full value being paid for the assets. So we have demonstrated that we'll
sell things that don't compete in the portfolio. We're going to continue to do that. And we'll provide you more in
November.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi, everyone. You've got us in a little bit of a spin as to whether it's morning or afternoon here.
Hello. Thinking of the November Analyst Meeting, it seems fairly clear to us that shareholders really want you to do
what you're doing in terms of lowering costs and breakevens, but really commit to no growth and all buyback as an
overriding strategy, you're kind of referencing it, but you're keeping the growth option open.
Can you just talk a little bit about why you don't just go down the route that I believe, and maybe I'm wrong, most
shareholders would prefer you to? Thank you.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah. Thanks, Paul. We do get that question from you and maybe two others. That's a good
way – when we look at it again, we recognize that through an upcycle or through the – as this commodity price
recovers a little bit, we'll start generating a fair amount of free cash flow. So what do we do with it? And how much of
that should go to the shareholder and how much go to the portfolio?
I'd say shareholders in the company, and you know what our portfolio looks like, we'll show you more of that in
November. And not only have we reduced the breakeven cost within the company, we've made some fairly substantial
progress reducing the cost of supply in the portfolio within the company as well.
So when you look at those opportunities to invest in the portfolio that are going to move our returns, they're going to
add margin and create more cash flow growth for the company, even at a flat fairly low price deck, we think those are
things that we ought to be investing at in the company. And we've got to demonstrate that to you. We've got to show
you. And that's our plan to go do that.

But I will say we're not trying to compete on growth. Investors have better – they may have different places to go with
their investment if that's what they want. We're going to show you why we can compete on returns, why that makes
sense, yet we're not going to forget about the shareholder and make sure an appropriate amount is going to them off the
top.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thank you, Ryan. That's reasonable. You guys are really helpful on the macro. Can you observe
globally why decline rates haven't been as high given your global portfolio? It would be just interesting to hear given
your own portfolio hasn't been declining as fast as we thought, what's your perspective on what's going on, why we
aren't seeing more declines than we anticipated? And I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - Alan J. Hirshberg>: Well, I think that certainly if you look at U.S. production, we have seen a big decline. The
U.S. is off over a million barrels a day from the peak last year. But I think that, particularly in the unconventional, the
surprise factor is that some people kind of pronounced about a year ago that there was an asymptote coming and that
technology had kind of reached its end in the unconventional. And I think we're proving once again that that's not the
case, that there's still more cost be driven out and there's still more increased recoveries to be found through new ideas
from new technologies. And so I think we're still a long ways to go there and so you will continue to see that.
In terms of the rest of the world, I think in our case, there are some better reservoir performance that we've experienced
in various places. We've had better facility performance in places like APLNG. We've had timing of a pipeline
commission in KBB. So it's been a variety of different things that have been – driven the timing for us. But the main
real performance surprise, the biggest single item for of us is in the Lower 48 unconventional.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I would add, Paul, to that that internationally there's just a number projects that continue to
come online that were funded in the last three to four years. And our experience is they're not lagging on schedule
anymore, they're coming on and they are coming on usually at better performance than what we were predicting. We're
seeing that in our portfolio, weather it's drilling in the UK, or Norway, or projects in Malaysia, or as Al said, Alaska,
we're seeing better performance there.
And then APLNG, our train at APLNG and the rest of the trains, frankly, that are using our technology on Curtis Island
are well outperforming their nameplate capacity and they're running really well. So we're seeing those pockets that are
happening. And it's a bit more of a lag in the international space. But the capital investment I think will catch up
internationally. We're just seeing some of those projects come online.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thanks.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul. Folks, we're at the top of the hour. We'll take one more question. And then,
by all means, feel free to follow up with IR after the fact. Christine, one more.

Our last question is from James Sullivan with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Sullivan>: Hey Good afternoon now decisively, guys. Just wanted to ask the question melding your view
on the macro, and it's not another cut at kind of the same question about growth and share buybacks. But do you guys
have a threshold of materiality given that we're not necessarily going to be looking at oodles of free cash flow
necessarily, but maybe smaller tranches of free cash flow if we're at $50 or $55 in a year or two? Do you guys have a
threshold of materiality for a shareholder buyback or how do you think about that?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Well, yeah, as I tried say, I think as we generate free cash flow, we'd like at least at a minimum
do some anti-dilutionary share buybacks to offset the cost of our employee-based stock ownership plans. So that kind
of sets a bit of a floor. And then depending on what level of free cash flow we have available, we'll start delivering that
to the shareholder. And then we'd like to be in that range of 20% to 30% of our cash flow going to the shareholders. So
we we'll target that range and look at where we're trading in the marketplace to make sure it makes sense relative to the
other options we have.

<Q - James Sullivan>: Okay. Great. So first that anti-dilution, but really you don't necessarily have it's got $0.25
billion or anything like that in terms of...
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, we're at the 20% to 30%. So that's what we've tried to tell everybody and signal that that's
the range we'd like to be in in terms of total returns to shareholder, including our ordinary dividend.
<Q - James Sullivan>: All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks. Christine?
