The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be
providing for the fourth quarter. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our
documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important
risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. As a
reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it's done through an explicit
public disclosure.
As a reminder, in Q2, on November 20, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our SP
Video Connected Devices business and accordingly had no revenue or expense from that business in Q3 fiscal 2016.
As such, all of the revenue, non-GAAP and product orders information we will be discussing is normalized to exclude
the SP Video CPE business from our historical results.
We have provided historical financial information for the SP Video CPE business in the slides that accompany this call
and on our website to help to understand these impacts. As a reminder, the guidance we provided during our Q2
earnings call and today's call has been normalized in the same way.
So with that, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Chuck.
Charles H. Robbins
Thank you, Marilyn. We delivered strong Q3 results against a backdrop of a macro environment that continues to be
uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, we executed very well, with revenue growth of 3% and non-GAAP EPS growth of
6%. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow of over $3 billion in the quarter, returning nearly $2 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our commitment to operating discipline continues to yield solid
results in spite of the challenging environment.
The operational changes we continue to make will further enable our customers to leverage the strategic role of the
network as they transform their businesses to become digital. As I did last quarter, I'd like to highlight our momentum
in four key areas.
First, in Security. We saw continued acceleration in the third quarter, with revenue growth of 17%, while deferred
revenue grew 31%, driven by our ongoing shift from hardware to more software and subscription services. Our
Security business is tracking as we indicated it would earlier in the year. As one of the largest IT security vendors, we
believe our portfolio is the most comprehensive and effective in enabling our customers to protect their businesses.
Security is and will remain one of our absolute highest priorities.
Second, Collaboration. Revenue accelerated by 10% and deferred revenue here grew 16%. This is yet another example
of a successful transition to a cloud-based platform, increasing our market leadership, which we expect will give us
sustainable long-term differentiation.
Third, our Next Generation Data Center portfolio is extremely well-positioned to meet our customers' needs regardless
of where they place their workloads, enabling public, private or hybrid cloud deployments. At our Partner Summit we
received a very strong response to our innovations as customers adopt our Next Generation Data Center solutions. Our
strong position is evident in our installed base of 52,000 UCS customers and the continued success of our ACI
portfolio.
In March we announced a dramatic improvement in price performance, and by this I mean 100-gig performance for
40-gig pricing, driven by new ASICs which provide us a time-to-market advantage of 18 months to 24 months while
maintaining the same margin profile.
In Q3 our ACI platform grew revenue approximately 100% while it exceeded a $2 billion annualized run rate, far
outpacing our next closest competitor in both size of business and growth rate.

Our entry into the hyperconverged market with HyperFlex, as well as our acquisition of CliQr, an innovator in
multi-cloud orchestration, extend our leadership position in the Data Center.
Finally, we continue to make great progress in transitioning more of our revenue to recurring, with increased emphasis
on software and subscription offers. Our software subscription deferred revenue balance continues to exhibit
accelerated growth, this quarter up 36%. We have a number of strong proof points for how we've executed successfully
against our objective and the potential to apply the same model to the rest of our portfolio. In addition to the success
I've highlighted in our Security and Collaboration businesses, we had double-digit revenue growth again this quarter in
Meraki, which stands out as an excellent example of how we've begun to scale our enterprise networking into a
subscription model.
As I look to the future, you will see us expand the approach we've take with the success of Meraki, Collaboration and
Security, and apply it to our Data Center and core networking for both Enterprise and Service Providers.
Our $180 billion of install base, with by far the most widely adopted systems for networking, makes us uniquely
positioned to lead this migration. While the overall macro-environment remains uncertain, we are nicely positioned to
benefit from any rebound in the global economy. At the same time, we will continue to manage our business to
capitalize on the key growth areas in front of us. I'm very pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute
operationally and strategically in virtually any environment.
Now, I'll turn it over to Kelly to walk through more details on our financials.
Kelly A. Kramer
Thanks, Chuck. I am pleased with our continued execution on our financial strategy of delivering profitable growth,
managing our portfolio and strategic investments and delivering shareholder value.
Starting with delivering profitable growth. Total revenue was $12 billion, up 3% with growth in product revenue of 1%
and services of 11%. We did have an extra week in Q3. Consistent with our guidance for the quarter, the benefit to
revenue was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services, subscription businesses and
$65 million from our SaaS businesses like WebEx as well as some from our product distribution.
In Switching, as Chuck mentioned, we continue to see good momentum with ACIs and the Next Generation Data
Center. The 3% decline in Switching was mostly driven by macro-related weakness in our Campus business, offset by
positive growth in Data Center Switching. Routing experienced 5% decline mostly driven by the high end. We are
seeing continued strength with our web-scale customers where our co-development continues and our sales to the top
10 web-scale customers was up 31%.
Collaboration grew 10% by strength across the entire portfolio and deferred revenue grew by 16%. WebEx continued
its double digit growth with solid performance in TelePresence and Unified Communications, driven by our new
offerings in those areas.
Data Center grew 1% with the slower growth largely driven by continued macro challenges impacting customer spend.
We expect that our HyperFlex offering will further expand our growth opportunities in the Data Center. Wireless grew
1%, led by strong double-digit growth in our cloud-based Meraki platform, partially offset by declines in our controller
and access point businesses.
Security grew 17%, along with continued strong deferred revenue growth of 31%. We had great performance in our
advanced threat security and web security solutions, which grew over 100% and 50% respectively.
SP Video grew 18% with ongoing strength in China. Services revenue grew a very solid 11%, which includes the $200
million for the extra week I mentioned. Normalized for the extra week, the growth was 4%. We again saw very good
progress against our goal of driving more recurring revenue. Deferred revenue had solid growth of 8%, with product
deferred revenue up 9% and service up%. The portion of product deferred revenue relating to our recurring software
and subscription business grew 36%.

From an orders perspective, product orders grew 3% with a book-to-bill comfortably above 1. Looking at our
geographies, which is the primary way we run our business, Americas grew 4%; EMEA was up 2%; and APJC grew
1%. Total emerging markets grew 4%, with the BRICS plus Mexico showing strength, up 4%, and China up 22% and
India up 18%. Brazil and Russia continue to be challenged and is now combined representing less than 2% of our total
product bookings.
In terms of customer segments, Enterprise declined 2% and Commercial grew 8%. Public Sector grew 6% and Service
Provider was flat. Similar to Q2, we are seeing pressure in the Enterprise segment driven by the macro uncertainty.
We drove strong profitability this quarter, especially with gross margins. From a non-GAAP perspective, gross margin
was 65.2% with product gross margin of 64.5% and service gross margin of 67.1%. Operating expenses were 35.2% of
revenue and operating margin was 30%. The total impact of the extra week on our non-GAAP cost of sales and
operating expenses was $150 million. We are being very disciplined in this tough macro and pricing environment,
focused on making the right investments while driving operational efficiencies and productivity.
From a bottom-line perspective, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, up 6%, while GAAP EPS was $0.46. Q3
non-GAAP net income was $2.9 million, up 4%, while GAAP net income was $2.3 billion.
We've been very active from an M&A perspective, closing five acquisitions in Q3 – Jasper Technologies, making
Cisco the largest cloud-based IoT service platform, helping enterprises and service providers launch, manage and
monetize IoT services on a global scale; Acano, which provides on-premise and cloud-based video infrastructure and
collaboration software; Synata, which enables us to deliver search capabilities for collaboration cloud applications;
Leaba, a fabless semiconductor company; and CliQr, which provides an application-defined cloud orchestration
platform, which is expected Cisco customers simplify and accelerate their private, public and hybrid cloud deployment.
These acquisitions are clearly focused on our key growth areas, including IoT, software, cloud and collaborations as
well as continuing to strengthen our core. We've also seen solid momentum with our Ericsson partnership, closing 17
deals this quarter.
Moving on to shareholder value. In Q3, we delivered operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. Total cash, cash equivalents
and investments at the end of Q3 were $63.5 billion, with $6.3 billion available in the U.S. We returned $2 billion to
shareholders during the quarter, that included $649 million of share repurchases and $1.3 billion for our quarterly
dividend, which we increased by 24% in Q3.
Overall, Q3 was a very solid quarter in a difficult macro environment. We focused on strong operational executions,
resulting in top-line growth, strong gross margins and continued operating leverage, consistent with our expectation.
We're making the right investments in the growth areas of the business, balancing our decisions with sound portfolio
management.
Let me now reiterate the guidance we provided in the press release for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. This
guidance includes the type of forward-looking information that Marilyn referred to earlier.
The guidance for Q2 is as follows – we expect revenue growth to be in the range of zero to 3% year-over-year,
normalized to exclude the SP Video CPE business from Q4 2015. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin rate to be
in the range of 63% to 64%. The non-GAAP operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 29% to 30%, and
the non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be 22%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.61. We anticipate our GAAP EPS to be lower
than the non-GAAP EPS by $0.08 to $0.11. Further details to this range are included in the slides and press release that
accompany this call.
I'll now turn it back over to Chuck.

Thanks, Kelly. So let me summarize before we move to questions. First, I think the number one key takeaway is that
we continue to execute well even in an obviously very tough environment. Secondly, we've proven our ability to
transition certain elements of our portfolio like we've done with Meraki, Security and Collaboration and we believe we
can accelerate long-term growth by bringing this same approach to our core and this process has begun. And finally,
everything we do will be done through a lens of enabling our customers' success while driving value for our
shareholders.
Marilyn, I'll turn it over to you for questions.
Marilyn Mora
Thanks, Chuck. Kim, let's go ahead and open the line for questions. While Kim is doing that, I'd like to remind the
audience that we ask you to please ask one question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to clarify your guidance for the July quarter.
How much of the revenues embedded in that guidance comes from acquisitions that closed in the last year, just so we
can get a sense for the organic trends in the business? And then when we think about the 3% growth in bookings in the
quarter, how much of that was benefited by the extra week in the quarter?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, so I'll answer the second part first, Simona. So in terms of how much benefit we got
from the extra week, we don't think there is much. What we saw this quarter was, the forecast was pretty
straightforward. The team saw deal closure and conversion rates drag on because of the – especially in the Enterprise
segment. And quite frankly, the deals that we closed were more in line. So we don't think we had any upside from the
extra week in bookings sitting there. In terms of your first question on the acquisitions, we'll start to see in the current
run rate, you have the bulk of, like, open DNS and everything else. For the new acquisitions that you don't have a full
quarter in the run rate, we'll get a bit of a benefit from Jasper and Acano, but it's not terribly material in the overall
growth rate.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Simona. Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer & Company.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks, and congrats on great execution. I guess first question is with regards to the Data Center. I
hear your comments with regards to the macro impact on it, but it's five quarters in a row now where that business is
stuck in between the $800 million to $850 million in revenue. And this business has accounted for about a third of your
growth in the past few years. So if you could give us a little bit more color as to why isn't this moving, that would be
great.
And the second question, with regards to the gross margins, I had to go back all the way to 2010 to find product gross
margins that are equal to those that you just reported. Can you just give us a little bit more maybe of a framework to
think about what is really changing in the portfolio, whether it be through mix or change in the competitive
environment? Anything that can justify the increase in gross margins, and how sustainable you think that is.

<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Hey, Ittai, this is Chuck. Thanks for the questions, and I'll answer the first one and I'll give
Kelly the gross margin question.
So as we look at the Data Center business we see a few things going on. First of all, we think that there is an impact
coming from the overall macro environment that is relatively undeniable. We also saw – as our peers have, we saw
some caution in I would say the CapEx spend in the SP space, and that was one of the segments that we saw weakness
this quarter, even with our Data Center portfolio. When we say Data Center in this context, we're talking about UCS in
particular.
The other thing that's going on is there is a transition going on in the Data Center relative to workloads. I talked a little
bit about it on the last call. We see workload-specific use cases being deployed on high performance blade systems like
our classic UCS. Then we see also this move to hyperconverged systems, which led us to the launch of our HyperFlex
platform last quarter. We also see a transition to rack-based systems which also results in stacks that are driven by
container-based architectures. And so, in the past quarter 30% of our UCS business was actually from our rack
portfolio, which we do have for the appropriate use cases. And you'll see us continue to expand our offering.
So we have UCS as a blade system. We have a rack version of UCS. We have HyperFlex in the market and you'll see
us continue to expand our portfolio to meet the evolving use cases in the Data Center. I think that's what's going on
right now. Kelly, on the gross margin question?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, on the gross margins, I'd say, Ittai, it's a couple things. You're absolutely right when
you go back and look historically, if you go back and normalize, the biggest thing that we did was obviously when we
got out of the set-top box business, that helped us quite a bit. And normalized, if you go back to just Q1 of this year, we
were at a 64.9% and even last year we had a 65.1%. So I'd say it's kind of the new normal, in that 63%, 64% range. I
would say the only other thing, when you go back and you update your models for the extra week, because a lot of the
top-line that I talked about comes off the balance sheet and there is not incremental cost, I did get a 0.5-point benefit
just from the extra week in my gross margin. So I'd say a normalized view on the gross margin would have been closer
to 64.5%.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Kelly. Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question.
Operator
Thanks. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Yeah, hi, Chuck. Hi, Kelly.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Hi, Vijay.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Hey, Vijay.
<Q - Vijay Bhagavath>: These are clearly better-than-feared results. Congratulations to you and your team. My
question is as follows, which is, Chuck, heading into the back half, what gets you most excited in terms of new product
refresh opportunities? And then now that your Security business honestly is starting to turn the corner, especially versus
the pure plays, would you double down on Security investments, both organically and M&A? Thanks.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, Vijay, so I think the number one thing that I'm feeling very positive about right now
is that again we have shown that we can drive the transition in our Collaboration portfolio, which when you see that
business over the last two years, the team's done a great job of transitioning it to a portfolio that is available to our
customers as cloud-based services, and seeing it growing double digits and also growing our deferred revenue balance
up 16%, I think that's one example. In Security 46% of our business now comes from software and subscription
services, which is clearly the direction that we had indicated we were going take it; at the same time growing 17%.
Our Meraki business, which really shows the evolution of networking to cloud-based management and policy, is over
$1 billion now and growing double digits. And I think that we – the thing I'm most excited about longer term is that we

see a path to deploying that model across the rest of our portfolio. And again, that work has begun.
I think in the near term we see obviously a mix of a pretty cautious environment still because we do see customers
spending where they need to spend, but don't misunderstand, there is still a fair amount of caution in the market. But I
think that we've executed well. This quarter we had five of our seven product categories that were in positive growth,
with three of those in double digits. We had all the geos in positive growth from an order perspective. And we saw
pretty good strength across our segments. So that's the first question.
The second one, relative to Security, the answer is yes, yes and yes. We will continue investing both organically and
any other way that we see appropriate to drive that architecture. The team's done a phenomenal job.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Your Switching and Routing businesses were both down. I guess how
concerned are you about that? Do you think your new product portfolio is yet to impact that? Do you believe you'll lose
share or it's the markets? And then finally, what's the impact on your services business? In other words, how much of
that is maintenance that could be impacted by declining hardware?
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Well, let me take the first one, and then Kelly, you can maybe make a connection from the
services to the hardware.
So on the Switching business, I'll point out a couple things. Last quarter we indicated that our Campus Switching
business, the growth there is largely driven by Refresh, which in an uncertain time, enterprises that have infrastructure
that's functioning for them, they're not going to make the move to upgrade. So we see a pause in that Refresh cycle
which we talked about last quarter, and nothing really changed there.
What we did see is we saw our Data Center Switching revenue growth increase. And the other thing that I'll point out is
that we had indicated that we believe that our Data Center Switching growth would – the new product portfolio would
surpass the declines of the traditional products that we've had. And our order growth rate, which we haven't put in any
of the documentation, but our order growth rate this past quarter, on that $4 billion portfolio, was double digits. So
we're pleased with the progress that we've made in the Data Center Switching space. And again, that's $4 billion and it
grew double digits in orders. So we feel okay about that.
On the Routing front, I think it's a combination of things. I think that there is certainly...
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: [indiscernible] (24:00).
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: $1 billion in the quarter...
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, quarter.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: $1 billion in the quarter, $4 billion annualized run rate on the Data Center Switching.
Kelly's making sure we're clear.
On the Routing business we've seen a few things. Clearly there is a macro issue that we're dealing with. We also saw,
again, as you've heard from some of our peers, we saw some increased caution in the service provider space. We saw
slow movement in the core of those networks, kind of flattish activity at the edge. And we do have a number of new
platforms that are in certification with several of the key players that we – at some point in the coming quarters we
would expect those to begin to show up favorably. But that's what we see right now.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: And in terms of, Steve, your question on impact on the services business. Typically for new
sockets there would be a little lag for that, but I'll say that our service business has been laser-focused on driving

renewals. So even if enterprises are holding on to their switches and routers longer, our services team and sales team
has been very focused on getting the contracts renewed, and we're seeing that pay dividends with the acceleration of
growth. Again, if you normalize our service revenue growth this quarter for the extra week, they still grew 4%, which is
up from 3% year-over-year growth in Q2, and it was 1% in Q1. So we're really starting to get traction there.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, and, Steve, if I could just pile onto what Kelly just said. The team has been building
out, trying to strengthen our capability around the entire software and subscription business model which requires a lot
of focus on adoption and renewals and we've also taken the same approach to just sharpen our focus on our services
renewal business. And we did see improvement in that in the last quarter. So I'm happy with the progress the team's
making there as well.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Steve. Kim, let's go ahead and take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
<Q - James Dickey Suva>: Thank you, and congratulations, Chuck and Kelly, to your team there at Cisco. One thing
that stood out was the very impressive gross margins this quarter. If I calculated it correctly, it looks like it was around
65.2%, and that was meaningfully above – I think, your guidance was 62.5% to 63.5%. Can you help us understand
what were the factors to drive it higher because I know the guidance all included an extra week? And then for the
outlook, are there any type of swing factors we should be aware of, and the causes of why it will be lower than the
reported gross margins just from this quarter? And again, congratulations to you and your team.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Jim. So again the thing to keep in mind, true, we did
guide with the extra week, which came in in line. But just, again, a couple things. When we guide we tend to have a
little conservatism in the gross margin rate. But take off that 0.5 point, we're still parked at the 64.5% range. We do
have normal seasonality quarter in and quarter out, so always Q1 and Q3 are our strongest gross margin quarters, and
Q2 and Q4 are weaker; and it's typically driven by our mix, especially mix of servers in those two quarters. So that's
also a driver.
And I think just operationally speaking, again, the teams are doing a very good job from a productivity perspective in
terms of driving costs out of the product. We had a lot of efficiencies out of the supply chain in terms of managing our
freight and our inventory management. So I'd say there's just been real – we had a very strong quarter from a
operational excellence – if I look at pricing this quarter, we are being very disciplined on pricing. We're starting to see a
tiny bit of a tick-up and you'll see that in our 10-Q where the impact to our gross margin rate year-to-date is about 2.2
points, and Q3 was 2.4 points. So still strong, but we are still seeing price erosion. But again, the strength we are seeing
this quarter mostly came from just improvements in productivity.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Great. Thanks, Kelly. Next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Pierre C. Ferragu>: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to come back on what
you said about your top 10 hyperscale, web-scale clients. If I get that correctly, you had revenues up 31% there. Could
you give us a sense of what made most of these revenues and most of this growth? Was that mostly Switching,
Routing, anything else?
And then if we exclude that very strong performance on that segment, what did the rest of Enterprise look like in terms
of growth? So you were down 2%, overall; I assume that if web-scale were up 31%, probably the rest of Enterprise was
down quite significantly.

And lastly, could you help us quantify any kind of the macro impact you mentioned about Enterprise in this quarter and
in your guide for next quarter? So I don't know, maybe in points of revenues or whatever, do you have a sense of how
much you've lost because of the uncertain macro environment? Thanks a lot.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Okay. So I'll start – and make sure I don't forget the rest of the pieces here, Chuck. You got
me covered there. Okay.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: So of our massively scalable data center customers, of that amount, more than half of it is
certainly Switching. And then the next biggest follower is Routing. So it's more than 50% – significantly more than
50% is our Switching products. To your point on then, like you inferred, what does that mean, if Switching overall was
down 3%, I just want to reiterate what's known to...
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Let me just clarify the question. He believes that we're – we roll the web-scale into our
Enterprise business. So he was saying we were negative 2% on Enterprise.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Oh, sorry.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: So...
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Definitely in our Service Provider segment.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, it's in our Service Provider segment, Pierre. So now you can answer that question.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, so, yeah, sorry about that, Pierre. So these web-scale customers are definitely in our
Service Provider segment, which was flat overall for the quarter from a bookings perspective. On the rest of the
portfolio, to your question, in Service Provider, we're seeing again the slowdown from just the overall Service Provider
CapEx spend and you're seeing that reflected, certainly, on our Routing portfolio.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, just a couple comments. I don't think we've ever exposed that over half of that
business is coming from Switching. So clearly, there is value in our Switching portfolios that the web-scale players are
seeing. I also think that there's still a small percentage of overall SP business as it relates, which is why you'll see flat
when this segment was up 31%, given the size of that business. But obviously, you could have done that math. But I do
think that our teams have done a really god job here.
Kelly, the other question, the third portion of the question was that relative to any revenue impact in Q4 that we've built
into the guidance relative to the macro environment, I'll make – I mean just generically, we're not modeling any
improvement, I think, is the safest way to say it. We do see a continued amount of uncertainty out there, and we're not
modeling any improvement into Q4.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Exactly.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Next question please, Kim?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities.
<Q - Brent Bracelin>: Thank you for taking the question. Chuck, I wanted to follow up on services revenue. I get
there was a clear benefit of an extra week, but this now marks I think the second quarter in a row of upside coming
from the services segment. I imagine most of the return to double-digit growth was the extra week. I guess my question
is, are you seeing a broader increase in services driven by digitization or solution selling trends? And if so, do you
expect the services kind of recovery to potentially be a leading indicator for a future product recovery?
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Thanks for the question, Brent. Let me first of all say that I think over the last few
quarters, Joe Cozzolino and his team have been incredibly focused on driving the operational excellence around the

P&L element of that, which is what you're seeing with the gross margins, and I think some of the discussion I had
earlier around the focus on the renewal capability. I think we're seeing general improvement in the execution there. We
see Advanced Services obviously doing reasonably well, Security services doing reasonably well; and then as I
mentioned earlier, the renewal activity, our teams did a better job this past quarter. So I think a lot of what you've seen
is operational discipline and execution, to be honest.
However, I think that there is an opportunity, and more of our customers are asking us to help them as they look at their
strategies to take advantage of this digital transition that's occurring. I'm not sure that I'm in a position where I would
give you any sort of tangible connection between it and future product growth. But we definitely see that as a required
service that we're going to need to provide to our customers because they're looking to us as one of the few large,
capable, financially viable partners that really understand this transition.
<Q - Marilyn Mora>: Great. Thanks, Chuck. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to see if we can talk a little more about the cloud and
talk about the ACI momentum. How should we think about the mix of just cloud revenue for Cisco in terms of how
much is going into public cloud versus private cloud as the run rate improves? And then, is there any change in terms
of public cloud versus private cloud related to margin, either from a gross margin perspective or a operating margin
perspective that we should be aware of? Thank you.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Thanks, Mark. So I'll let Kelly tackle the second question. If you look at what we declared
– we've stated our strategy is around cloud, it really is focused on enabling what we believe is going to be the long-term
desire of our customers, which is to operate on a hybrid cloud model. And we said that we're going to do three primary
things. We're going to make sure that we provide the infrastructure to the cloud providers, and we've done that with
SPs, and we've done that obviously with the top 10 web-scale providers, given the business was up 31%.
We also said that we were going to transition our portfolio to be cloud-delivered and as-a-service-delivered where it
makes sense, and over time across the entire portfolio. And you've seen us do that with our continued growth in
Meraki, in Collaboration and Security. And now the plans – we're actually underway on a project to deploy that across
the rest of our portfolio, although it's early days.
But I think when you look at that deferred revenue of 36% on the balance sheet, that says that we're being successful in
that second pillar. And then the third pillar was to help our customers with the infrastructure needed to actually take
advantage of both private and public clouds, or enabling hybrid. And when you look at the Data Center Switching
portfolio, on an annualized $4 billion business with new orders growing in double digits, I think that customers are
driving both, and I think that the three pillars of that strategy are working.
As far as gross margins, when we sell to private cloud versus public cloud providers, Kelly, any comment there?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, I'd say – we obviously have different margin profiles within both, but I'll say both,
whether it's Campus versus Data Center or whether it's to the Service Providers versus Enterprises, both margin profiles
are above, well above the Cisco average gross margin rates. And between Campus and the Data Center side we're
within 5 points to 6 points of gross margin. So the differentiation's not much there.
We can have variations within that. We have some public cloud customers on some deals that might have better or
worse margins, but overall the portfolio is within those ranges. And again, way accretive to the overall Cisco margin.

Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Great. Thank you very much. I just had a clarification. You talked about ACI hitting about
$2 billion annualized run rate. And I think our notes have suggested that it was at a similar level the last couple of
quarters, or at least you gave a similar level. I just want to make sure our notes are right there.
And then really my question is around acquisitions. You guys clearly have been quite active doing acquisitions and
doing a lot of what look to be pretty promising technology-related acquisitions. Should we expect the current pace to
persist or are we going through an accelerated period that you think we're pretty close to slowing down from? Thanks.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: I'll take the first one?
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Sure.
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: So on the first one, yeah, we were being – rounding. I mean, it's actually closer to a $2.2
billion run rate and so sequentially – I'm certainly up sequentially than what I was last quarter.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, I think when we hit it last quarter it was probably roughly $2 billion, and this time
it's -
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: More like...
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: ...closer to $2.2 billion, $2.25 billion on the ACI portfolio.
And then on the acquisition front, what I would say is that, given the valuations and given the movement in the tech
industry, that we'll continue to be opportunistic. We're in a good position as a strategic buyer with some of the
challenges in the public market, and public market and some of the valuations becoming a little more realistic. Would I
suggest to you that over the next 12 months we'll be quite as active as we have been in the last 12 months? I probably
wouldn't expect it to be quite as fast-paced as it has been, but we will continue to be opportunistic around the areas of
growth that are important to our future.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Next question, please.
Operator
And your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Paul Silverstein>: Thanks very much. Chuck, going back to the question about the top 10 Web 2.0, I don't think
you've ever broken it out, at least in my memory. But if Routing is 15% of your total revenue and Service Provider
typically, if I remember the numbers correctly, were 80% of Routing, that would suggest that the Web 2.0 guys are
somewhere in the range of 15% of total revenue, if I'm looking at the current numbers correctly. Is that in the ballpark?
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: 15% of our overall total revenue or 15% of our Service Provider revenue?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Or Routing...
<Q - Paul Silverstein>: Well, I'm basing it off, if Routing's 15% of total and Service Provider's 80% of Routing, again,
that would suggest that, traditional service providers being the bulk of your Routing revenue, are somewhere in the
order of 12% in total revenue. I recognize it by more than just Routing. And if I saw this Service Provider category
correctly in terms of 30% of total bookings, maybe I misread the number, that would suggest the Web 2.0 guys are – let
me just ask the question directly. Can you give us any sense for how large the Web 2.0 category is?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, Paul, we haven't been disclosing that. So we just don't disclose that.
<Q - Paul Silverstein>: It's in that 15% range?

<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Again, Paul, it's not something we give out. I apologize, but it's not...
<Q - Paul Silverstein>: No worries. All right, let me ask you a simple question. And I think you mentioned it before,
but can you give us any insight on the linearity of the quarter?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: Yeah, I'd say it wasn't that crazy. I mean, obviously our extra week when it actually fell in
from a calendar perspective was in February. But again, because the way the teams were forecasting, I'd say the
linearity in terms of what we see usually coming through month three was in the normal ranges.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Paul.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Thanks, Paul.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Okay. Kim, we'll go ahead and take the next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hi. Hopefully you can hear me.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: We got you, Tal.
<Q - Tal Liani>: Hello. I have just one clarification. It's the tone of the previous conference call was very different. It
was about the very weak environment and we didn't speak about the growth trends. The tone of this conference call is
so much more positive in a very similar business environment. So what happened in the last three months that makes
you so much more positive about everything you have done basically also before; very little is new now. What makes
you so much more positive now versus three months ago in a similar environment? Or unless maybe the environment's
gotten better?
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, it's a good question, Tal. I'm just having a better week this week. No, I'm kidding. I
think the difference is if you go back to when we ended our last quarter it was towards the end of January. And if you
recall the last few weeks of that quarter were the weeks when the stock markets were having those incredibly wild
swings and our customers actually put the brakes on pretty significantly. And so coming into that earnings call we had
seen a very tough close to the quarter from an orders perspective. We saw our Enterprise customers in particular really
put the brakes on because they were just completely unsure of what was going to transpire and I think that led us to a
very cautious tone.
And so that would be the number one reason why we were more cautious then. I just want to make sure that we are
balanced here that while we're optimistic and we're pleased with our execution, we still are operating in a relatively
uncertain environment. We got the Brexit coming up, the vote coming up in June. We've got the news out of the Fed
today. We've got all the election dynamics. We got issues in Brazil. We've got geopolitical dynamics. So there is still a
relatively broad set of unknown issues out there. So we're still operating in an uncertain environment, but I think the
stock market issue and the timing of the end of our last quarter would probably be the biggest difference.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Thanks, Tal. I think that was really helpful. Operator, we'll take another question, please.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.
<Q - Simon M. Leopold>: Great. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the web-scale vertical a bit. I know that's beating
the dead horse a little on this call. But I wanted to see if you could talk about the bigger trend around the white box
competitive threat because it seems apparent that there is not the dramatic shift to white box that many had feared. But

maybe it's just yet to happen. So if you could talk how you are countering the threat or the substitution effect of those
web scale customers building or buying unbranded switches rather than your products? Thank you.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, Simon, it's a good question, and I think that there is a misconception about what's
driving this belief that all the customers want to buy white-box switching. And I think this is sort of in the same vein of
it's all about cloud, or all about SDN or all about white box. None of these customers are fundamentally chasing a
technology trend. There are underlying business drivers that are leading them to these solutions. And so what we've
been doing is focusing on attacking the business driver and not so much the technology trend that everybody writes
about.
So in the case of the web-scale players, what they're looking at is they're looking for significant automation, they're
look for the ability to run massive data centers at huge scale, very low cost, with a ton of automation, which over time
will become the norm, I think, for all customers. There is this massive focus on operational expense reduction, which is
all around automation programmability which is where we're headed with our core platforms in the Enterprise as well.
So what we did is we built some really aggressive products. Our teams – again, the ASICs improvements that have
been built that give us the advantage on the price performance and then enabling our portfolio to fit within the
operational environments of these customers, I think, has been the key. And that's what they're looking for. They're not
singularly focused on white box. They're looking at how do they solve that problem. And we're just spending more time
with them to really understand what they need and how we can fit their requirements. And you're going to see us
continue to evolve our portfolio in whatever way we need to, to make sure that we remain relevant there.
<A - Marilyn Mora>: Kim, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. It comes from Brian White with Drexel Hamilton.
<Q - Brian J. White>: Chuck, I'm wondering if you could walk us through what you've seen so far with the Inspur
relationship in China? I see China revenue decelerated but it still grew very strongly at 22%. And also the Ericsson
relationship. It sounds like you've got some big deals in the quarter, or a few deals in the quarter. Maybe just highlight
if you feel like that relationship is still on track for this $1 billion by 2018? The reason I ask, obviously, Ericsson had a
very soft March quarter. Thank you.
<A - Charles H. Robbins>: Yeah, Brian, it's a great question. I actually didn't expect anyone to highlight the fact that
our China revenue was decelerating. It is our third quarter of really solid growth in China, and I will point out that that
is across the board. It's across the portfolio. The team has done an amazing job there. And I've spent a fair amount of
time over there and I think that we're really pleased with where we are in China right now in the midst of the
uncertainty that's been discussed in the marketplace.
On the Inspur partnership, in September we signed the MOU, which was basically a letter of intent to formulate the
venture. And I was over three weeks ago where we formalized the term sheet basically, and we're in the final stages of
getting that one put together. I would expect it will be in market sometime in the fall with some of the early products
and solutions with them. We're spending a lot of time with them right now. So I think sort of late this year is when we'll
begin to see some early results from that.
I think on the Ericsson front, any time you do these really large partnerships, they always take a little longer probably
than we would all hope, but we're very optimistic. We have spent a ton of time together. I think that on the last call we
talked about the number of joint solutions within the first 100 days that we actually had on display together at Mobile
World Congress, which was pretty amazing. And then this past quarter, we saw 17 transactions close between our
teams, in the midst of a time where Hans was doing a pretty significant organizational restructuring and our teams were
getting to know each other. So we think we'd all want it to go faster, but we're pretty pleased with where that
partnership is right now.

<A - Marilyn Mora>: All right, Chuck. I think that was our last question. Why don't I go ahead and turn it over to you
to close it up?
Charles H. Robbins
All right, thanks, Marilyn.
First of all, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today and I want to thanks for your questions. I would
just go back to the three things that I stated earlier. I'm really proud of what we've done. I'm proud of the way the teams
have executed. It is a challenging environment out there and I think that our teams have proven that we continue to
execute regardless of the environment we face.
As I said last call, we're running the company on two fronts. We're focused on the execution and the operational
excellence and at the same time we're focused on transitioning our business and investing in the future, which I think
was displayed by our progress in the different areas that I highlighted during the call today.
I think that, again, if you look at our success in Security and Collaboration, Next Gen Data Center, the Meraki cloud
networking platform and overall in our transition to software and subscription, I think we're on that journey. We've
proven that we can transition elements of our portfolio and we're going to apply that same approach again to the rest of
our business. We're in the early days in the front end of a long journey, but I'm pleased with where we are. So I want to
thank all of you for spending time with us today. And we'll forward to talking to you soon.
