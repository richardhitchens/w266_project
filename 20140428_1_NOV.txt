Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Loren, and good morning, everyone.
Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced that it earned $1.37 per fully diluted share and excluding transaction
related charges $1.40 per fully diluted share for its first quarter of 2014. Earnings improved 9% from the first quarter of
2013 but declined 10% sequentially from our strong fourth quarter results in 2013, excluding charges from all quarters.
Revenues were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9% from the prior year and down 6% sequentially. Generally, our largest
two segments saw a surge in product shipments late last year which did not repeat in the first quarter, leading to slightly
lower sequential results as we expected. Overall, the company made steady progress on several fronts through the first
quarter, including moving closer to the spinout of our Distribution Services group, which we will speak to more in a
moment.
We were very pleased with another strong quarter for orders for drilling capital equipment. Rig Technology posted over
$2.3 billion in orders, which exceeded our revenue out of backlog by about 5%. This led to a record $16.3 billion
backlog for Rig Technology. Offshore demand remained very strong. We won drilling equipment packages for three
floaters and 17 jackup new builds during the first quarter. Land demand also increased materially, mostly
internationally, and we are encouraged by rising demand for drilling workover and well stimulation equipment for the
resurgent U.S. land market.
Our $2.3 billion of first quarter orders for Rig Technology were comprised of $1.2 billion or 52% for packages for new
build offshore rigs. We expect the second quarter to continue to be strong for offshore new build demand as well, but
we expect demand from new offshore rigs to slow during the second half of the year as offshore day rates have come
under pressure. We do expect to win some offshore new build orders in the second half, as our shipyard partners are
continuing to quote to entrepreneurs targeting specific markets in Latin America and the North Sea, along with a few
established drillers considering rigs for specific purposes like 20K.
The 48% balance of first quarter orders included land rigs, workover rigs, pressure pumping equipment, FPSO
equipment, and assorted individual components for various rigs and vessels. This other half of our order stream is
carrying good momentum into 2014, and we expect it to partly offset offshore new build declines later in the year.
Specifically, we are now seeing North American drillers resume buying equipment. But we continue to sell land rigs
into the Middle East, Russia, and Latin America.
Drillers the world over continue to retool the land rig fleet to newer, more modern levels of capability. While orders for
AC power quick-move electronic control land rigs ebb and flow a bit, the direction is clear. These are the workhorses
that make our industry steadily safer and more efficient and enable profitable unconventional resource production. And
land drilling contractors appear to be increasingly convinced of their superior economic returns.
We are also encouraged by recent orders for stimulation and pressure pumping equipment in North America. Frac
spreads continue to be pushed harder, pumping larger fracs into more stages at higher pressures. And many are now
being run 24 hours a day, consuming these fleets at a faster pace. Our book-to-bill for pressure pumping, coiled tubing,
and wireline products all handily exceeded one in the first quarter.
Demand for floating production products , kits for FPSOs and flexible pipe mainly, dipped this quarter. but we believe
this is simply a function of timing and that FPSO demand will increase as we move through the year given our strong
bidding activity.
So to summarize our order outlook for the remainder of 2014, we believe the second quarter will be in the range of
one-to-one book-to-bill. And at the third and fourth quarters, we'll gradually drift down, leading us with an ending
backlog probably in the low teens but probably our second highest year-ending backlog ever. Backlogs at or near
record levels throughout most of the year should continue to drive strong financial performance for the next several
quarters.

Our long-term outlook continues to be very robust. We have previously cited four major trends driving our prospects:
one, the build-out of a fleet of deepwater rigs; two, the build-out of floating production systems to produce deepwater
discoveries; three, the retooling of a replacement of the jackup fleet; and four, the continued proliferation of
unconventional shale technologies, driving demand for a wide variety of NOV equipment, products, and services.
In our view, the energy needs of the 21st century will be satisfied by a combination of growing production from: one,
deepwater frontiers which have gone from effectively zero to about 9% of worldwide oil production in 20 years; and
two, unconventional shale technologies, which have gone from effectively zero to about 3% of worldwide liquids
production in six years.
Although these two incremental sources of oil today comprise only one in eight barrels of supply, most of the other
seven barrels are from conventional fields found in prior eras, which with decline. And with most of the easy oil
already discovered, future conventional sources will continue to become increasingly challenging to find.
As economic growth steadily drives oil demand, we believe that growing production from: one, deepwater technology,
which opened up vast horizontal expanses of the planet to production; and two, shale technology, which opened up vast
vertical sections of the stratigraphic column to production, will supply this demand, both oil and NGLs, in greater and
greater proportion through the 21st century.
Since the earliest days of the oil industry, companies have battled ferociously to emerge as the lowest marginal cost
source or at least not be the highest marginal cost source of the last incremental barrel. A high-cost barrel is the most
disadvantaged position on this battlefield. When economic cycles diminish demand, as they do from time to time, oil
prices drop and the highest marginal cost position suffers the most. [indiscernible] (8:10) market forces continually test
to resolve with high marginal cost producers. The battle lines constantly ebb and flow as various combinations of
innovation and geology lead winners to relative advantage and sometimes brief periods of respite from harsh market
forces at least until their fields decline or some other competitor finds better rocks and technology.
NOV is a unique supplier of critical components to the combatants on this battlefield. We understand that our success
rests on the success of our customers, meaning lowering our marginal cost per barrel, either capital or lifting cost or
both. Both major new sources of incremental oil supply, deepwater and unconventionals, require new toolkits,
specialized deepwater rigs, floating production systems, subsea production systems, Tier 1 AC land rigs, drilling
motors, premium drill pipe bits, and hydraulic stimulation tools. Our products win demand in the marketplace by
conferring lower costs and higher value to their users. That's why we must continue to invest in promising technologies
and ideas.
Unconventionals in particular are unique in the rate in which they consume iron. Long horizontal laterals wear out
fixed cutter bits, downhole motors, and premium drill pipe far faster than vertical drilling. And they require specialty
tools NOV provides, such as fluid hammers and agitators. Similarly, high pressure massive 24-hour frac jobs wear out
frac fleets and associated consumables like fluid ends, liners, and pistons far faster than stimulation jobs of yesterday.
NOV is unique in our leading supply position into both of these major trends. And the trends themselves are unique in
that they are more consumptive of specialized equipment as compared to sources of supply of yesterday. And we saw
good evidence in the first quarter that the industry has largely burned through its excess inventory of pressure pumping
consumables, and we believe new capital orders are not far behind.
History teaches us that new innovations constantly change this battlefield, sometimes in surprising ways. Who among
us would have predicted that the U.S. would enjoy such a revival, becoming once again the fastest growing producer of
oil, from marginally productive shales no less? Pad drilling, downspacing, new rig technologies, and bigger frac jobs
have enabled shale producers to steadily improve their marginal cost positions, and further improvements are to be
expected.
Likewise, while deepwater producers have struggled lately with project execution challenges and rising costs, these are
certain to be remedied by time and innovation. The deepwater drilling space faces startup challenges which we believe
are transient. A lot of new deepwater rigs have been launched recently with new crews, and these are operating under
tighter operational requirements post-Macondo. Crews will certainly get more experienced and more efficient over

time.
At NOV, we are helping by opening new technical training colleges to train both our own as well as our customers'
personnel. We supply simulators to let drillers practice safe, efficient operations offline. We are investing heavily to
ramp aftermarket spares and service capacity in proportion to our growing installed base to improve uptime. And we
are preparing for further challenges the industry will face as the new rig fleet undergoes five-year SPS surveys.
A couple of years ago, NOV deployed capital into floating production technologies used to produce deepwater fields,
recognizing that FPSO construction projects are notoriously problematic to deliver on time on budget. A recent
industry study cited a sampling of nine FPSOs which cost on average 38% more than budget, and were delivered an
average of 14 months late. We believe our success in transforming the deepwater rig fabrication supply chain and our
experience working with shipyards uniquely positions NOV to undertake the challenge of driving costs and risk down
for these complex projects. We further believe the recent introspection of deepwater producers signals their explicit
recognition of the structural shortcomings of the status quo. NOV aspires to be an advocate of change because we think
we can pioneer a better way.
Participants in both camps, shales and deepwater, are smart and adaptive, and the world needs oil supply from both
camps to offset the relentless drumbeat of production declines. Within this battle, NOV's mission is to offer new and
better ways of doing things to lower the marginal cost of barrels, to improve economic returns of our customers'
projects, to reduce environmental impact, and to improve the safety and efficiency of operations.
To this end, we announced our plans to reorganize our business along more customer-centric axes concurrent with the
spinout of our new DistributionNow company. Our new organization will enable us to focus more tightly on specific
customer initiatives.
Beginning in the second quarter, we will begin reporting our results in four new segments: first, our new Rig System
segment, which will primarily support offshore and land drillers, will consist of land and offshore rig equipment,
offshore packages, complete land rigs, replacement and upgrade rig capital components. We believe that the industry's
need to build out a new deepwater infrastructure, replace an aging jackup fleet, and upgrade a global land rig fleet will
create tremendous growth opportunities for this segment.
Second, our new Rig Aftermarket segment, which will be closely tied to our Rig System segment, will separately report
sales of spare parts, repair services, training, and other sales opportunities focused on the maintenance of our
substantial installed base of drilling rigs worldwide. These two segments will jointly supply and maintain sophisticated
modern drilling tools.
Third, our new Wellbore Technology segment will report products and services NOV provides which enhance drilling
performance and reduce the environmental impact of drilling operations. This group will include bits, reamers,
downhole drilling motors, premium drill pipe, solids control and waste management technologies, drilling fluids,
tubular inspection and tubular coating services, drilling instrumentation, and dynamic drilling systems.
Fourth and finally, our new Completions & Production Solutions segment will report sales of well stimulation
equipment and consumables as well as composite full-line products, flexible subsea pipe, conductor pipe, pumps and
artificial lift products, and floating production solutions. We will also include certain non-oilfield industrial products
within this segment.
Within the next few weeks, we plan to publicly announce our historical financial results for the preceding five years
within this new segment framework on a pro forma basis. This is designed to lend our investors long-term perspectives
into NOV post the spinout of our Distribution Services group. We will also change how we report backlog, including
recasting our historical backlog through this historical period to conform to our new segments.
I believe the new segment structure will lend greater transparency to the trends affecting our business and enable the
investing public to better see our execution of our strategic plans. We also believe this new structure will highlight the
diverse portfolio of products, equipment, and services NOV delivers.

Finally, with regards to spinout of DistributionNow or Now Inc., we refiled our Form 10 last week and believe we are
nearing the completion of the spinout, which we hope to effect in late May. The new company, which will initially be
debt-free, has a security commitment for a $750 million revolving line of credit. We would encourage our investors to
review our filings for this exciting new company, including its risk factors, which are available on our website at
www.NOV.com.
As a standalone company, DistributionNow will be uniquely positioned to prosecute supply chain services initiatives
and selective acquisitions from a focused public company platform to better serve its global upstream and midstream
customer base. I'm excited about the opportunities for this organization under the able leadership of CEO Robert
Workman, CFO Dan Molinaro; Chief Accounting Officer Dave Cherechinsky; and General Counsel Raymond Chang.
It will also have an outstanding Executive Chairman, a guy named Pete Miller, who has a pretty good track record of
building successful companies. Pete will step down as Executive Chairman of NOV at the time of the spin. So I want to
take this opportunity to say thank you to an extraordinary business leader, mentor, and friend. Very, very few CEOs
have achieved Pete's remarkable track record of success. And, Pete, we are grateful to you for your vision for this
organization and for the industry we serve. So on behalf of our 65,000 employees, congratulations and thank you and
very best wishes to you and all of our friends within DistributionNow.
At this point, let me turn it to Jeremy to provide more color on our first quarter results.
Jeremy D. Thigpen
Thanks, Clay.
As Clay already mentioned, National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $1.37 per fully diluted share in its first
quarter 2014 on $5.8 billion in revenues. Excluding $19 million in pre-tax transaction charges, first quarter 2014
earnings were $1.40 per fully diluted share, down $0.16 per share or 10% from the fourth quarter 2013 but up $0.11 per
share or 9% from the first quarter of 2013.
Sales of $5.8 billion declined 6% sequentially. But on a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 9% despite the fact that
the worldwide rig count only increased 2% over the same time period.
Excluding transaction charges from all periods, operating profit for the quarter was $880 million, down 10%
sequentially but up 8% from the first quarter of last year. Operating margins on this basis were 15.2% for the first
quarter of 2014 compared to 15.8% for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 15.4% for the first quarter of last year.
Sequentially, decremental leverage on the 6% decline in revenues was 24%. On a year-over-year basis, operating profit
flow-through leverage was 14% on a 9% increase in revenue.
Now let's turn to our segment operating results. The Rig Technology segment generated revenues of $3 billion in the
first quarter, down 9% sequentially, with as expected almost the entire shortfall being driven by reductions in revenues
from our land rig and well stimulation equipment businesses, which both benefited from large project shipments in the
fourth quarter that did not recur in the first quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, Rig Tech revenues were up
almost 15%, as capacity additions enabled us to convert 12% more revenue out of backlog as our ever and growing
installed base coupled with our recent investments in our aftermarket infrastructure enabled us to generate 25% more in
aftermarket sales, and as our floating production and subsea flexible strategies have produced strong year-over-year
gains.
Operating profit for the segment was $635 million and operating margins were 21.1%, which were flat with the prior
quarter despite the 9% decline in revenue.
While pleased with this result, we continue to face the same market challenges that we've discussed in the past, which
include working through lower priced backlog, more aggressive delivery schedules from our shipyard customers, new
drill floor layouts coupled with new installation and commissioning personnel, unfavorable product mix, and continued
investments in long-term strategic growth initiatives, and capacity expansions that are not yet fully operational, such as

the Flexibles plant in Brazil. Still, we are confident that we're moving in the right direction on all fronts. And I'd just
like to take a moment to address each.
Regarding lower priced backlog, beginning in the second quarter of last year, we assumed a more assertive position on
orders for offshore equipment components and complete packages. And while I would describe the improvement as
modest, we are already seeing the impact of this change manifest itself in higher margin backlog and a more favorable
shift in customer financing.
On the aggressive delivery schedules, over the past couple of years we've added manufacturing capacity to relieve
some of the stress on our supply chain. And over that same timeframe, we've significantly increased our installation
and commissioning workforce. As we become more comfortable and efficient with this new capacity and as our new
I&C teams come up the learning curve on these new [indiscernible] (19:42) floor layouts, we will realize efficiency
gains.
With respect to product mix, as we move through 2014 and into 2015, we should begin to see a more favorable product
mix as demand returns for pressure pumping equipment and coiled tubing units and, even more importantly, we
continue to see mid-teens percentage growth in our aftermarket revenues. While these gains will partially be offset by
continued growth in our floating production business as well as the conversion of Brazilian backlog, we're still
confident that the net result will be positive.
And finally, when talking about long-term strategic growth initiatives, the Flexibles plant in Brazil, which is the single
largest CapEx project in the history of NOV, has finally started commercial production and will begin generating
revenue sometime in the second quarter. So as stated on the fourth quarter conference call, we believe that we are
taking the actions required to expand margins in the old Rig Tech segment as we move through 2014 and 2015. But
again, it will be a slow process.
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for the first quarter of 2014 and our resulting backlog. As Clay
already stated, for the quarter we booked two semis and one drillship as well as 17 jackup packages, and we were
pleased to once again win a majority of BOP work within these packages. In addition to the strong orders offshore, we
were especially pleased and encouraged to see continuing demand for new land rigs in the Latin America and Middle
East markets and particularly pleased to see strengthening demand for new land rigs in the U.S. In the quarter we
booked several complete land rigs for each of those three markets as well as multiple equipment packages for other
new builds. We also secured orders for new coiled tubing units destined for international markets. And we're starting to
see some demand for new pressure pumping equipment in the U.S. and Canada, which is obviously very welcomed.
All of these new orders, which totaled $2.3 billion in the quarter, were mostly offset by revenues out of backlog of $2.2
billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of just over one times and another record quarter ending backlog of $16.3 billion. Of
the total backlog, approximately 92% is offshore and 94% is destined for international markets. So overall, the quarter
for Rig Technology turned out almost exactly as expected, with revenue declining in the high single-digit percentage
range, margins flat, and a book-to-bill slightly above one times.
Looking into the second quarter of 2014, we expect orders for new offshore drilling equipment packages and land rig
equipment packages to remain fairly steady. And while it might not happen in the second quarter, we believe that we
could soon benefit from a resurgence in orders for well stimulation equipment in the U.S. We also believe that we
could see a higher volume of orders for our floating and subsea-related production equipment. Overall, we think that
the total order intake in the second quarter could once again approach one-to-one book-to-bill.
And while this will certainly be an odd quarter as we transition to our new organizational structure and reporting
segments, I can tell you that I think that the revenues for the old Rig Tech segment on an apples-to-apples basis could
improve in the mid-single-digit percentage range sequentially and that margins would likely continue to be challenged
to expand but might see a slight uptick on the incremental revenue.
The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment posted revenue of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially but up 5% from the
previous year. Sequentially, the decline in segment revenues was driven exclusively by the non-recurrence of some
large year-end projects that were shipped in the fourth quarter of 2013. On a year-over-year basis, we've benefited from

both a full quarter of Robbins & Myers and the fact that our customers have finally worked through the excess
inventory that they carried into 2013.
Operating profit for the quarter was $326 million or 18.2% of sales, down 80 basis points sequentially and essentially
flat, down 10 basis points year over year. On a sequential basis, the decremental flow-through was just under 30%,
which is fairly consistent with the historical performance of this segment. As with Rig Technology, the quarter for the
PS&S segment turned out almost exactly as expected, with revenue declining in the mid-single-digit percentage range
and margins contracting on the volume.
As we enter the second quarter of 2014, we believe that revenues for most of the products and services in our old
Petroleum Services & Supplies segment could improve in the mid-single-digit percentage range, as seasonal declines in
Canadian drilling activity should be more than offset by strengthening U.S. market and continued growth in our
international businesses. In the U.S., demand for our downhole technologies, including bits, downhole motors, and
agitators, is clearly on the rise as is demand for fluid and expendables for both drilling and well service applications.
We're also starting to see incremental demand for coil tubing, composite pipe, and even four-inch drill pipe and
five-inch drill pipe into the U.S. land market, which is very encouraging.
And while we expect margins to expand with the incremental volume, we believe that our flow-through on the
incremental revenue could be somewhat challenged as we battle a few different issues, including ERP implementations
in multiple businesses, under-absorbed facilities and underutilized assets in Canada due to breakup, slightly
unfavorable product mix, and some continued pricing pressures on certain products.
The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.3 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 4% compared to
the first quarter of 2013. The majority of the sequential growth for this segment was driven by a strengthening U.S.
market, but the segment also enjoyed strong project sales in the Middle East. On the $1.3 billion in revenue, D&T
generated $68 million in operating profit for a 5.3% operating margin, which represented a 50 basis point improvement
from the fourth quarter of 2013 or 29% flow-through or leverage on a 2% increase in revenue. On a year-over-year
basis, operating margins were flat.
For Distribution & Transmission, the quarter actually turned out a little better than expected. While we expected the
low single-digit percentage growth, we were pleasantly surprised by the expansion of margin. With the implementation
of SAP across the enterprise and the work associated with the spin, we thought that margins would be challenged. But
as a direct result of the focus, hard work, and dedication of the entire D&T team, they have once again managed to
overcome distractions and challenges to produce a solid result.
Looking into the second quarter of 2014, under our old segment reporting, we would expect Distribution &
Transmission group revenues to remain relatively flat, as the seasonal reduction in Canadian drilling activity as well as
absence of the large Middle East projects should be offset by a strengthening U.S. market. And we think that margins
could contract slightly sequentially, as we fully expect to both complete the rollout of SAP and finalize the spin, both of
which have the potential to be somewhat distracting and disruptive.
While on the topic of the spin, I'd like to provide a brief update on some of the organizational changes that are currently
underway within National Oilwell Varco before moving on to discuss some of the remaining income statement and
balance sheet items. As previously mentioned, we hope to consummate the spinoff of our Distribution business in late
May. Shortly following the spin, we will be filing two separate 8-Ks. The first 8-K will be related to the discontinued
operations of the Distribution business. The second will include five years of historical financial statements for the new
reporting segments, and will include the first quarter 2014 financial statements. A few weeks following the second 8-K,
we will plan to file a revised 10-K for NOV RemainCo's 2013 and revised 10-Q for NOV's RemainCo for the first
quarter of 2014.
While the spinoff of our Distribution business and the subsequent restructuring have required a great deal of work, the
entire organization is excited about the realignment of our businesses into Rig Systems, Rig Aftermarket, Wellbore
Technologies, and Completion & Production Solutions. With these new segments, we believe that we will be much
easier to understand and access, which should benefit all of National Oilwell Varco's stakeholders. For suppliers and

customers, the new segments will make it easier to navigate our organization to find the people, products, services, and
support that they require. For employees, the new segments should help each employee to more easily and obviously
connect his or her specific job to the overriding objectives of NOV, which we expect to lead to improved awareness
and engagement. For investors, the new segments should provide more visibility to more of the market-leading
products and services that we provide while also giving more clarity to the way in which we participate in each of the
markets that we support. It should also help investors to better understand the interrelatedness of our various businesses
and the value that this brings to our customers and to National Oilwell Varco.
In addition to being much easier to understand and access, we also believe that the reorganization will ultimately help
drive improved operational and financial performance. While we've always done a good job of working across
businesses and segments to both recognize efficiencies where possible and to offer complete and integrated solutions to
our customers, we believe that the realignment of our businesses will in time better enable us to drive incremental
improvements in both areas.
Now let's turn to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated first quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margins only
declined 10 basis points sequentially to 24.2% despite a 6% reduction in revenues. SG&A declined $7 million
sequentially and represented 9% of Q1 revenues. Transaction costs, primarily related to the Robbins & Myers
acquisition and the Distribution spinoff, totaled $19 million in the quarter. Interest expense declined $1 million
sequentially to $26 million, and interest income was flat at $4 million.
Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was $14.5 million, which was consistent with the previous quarter. However, in
the quarter we booked a $4 million loss attributable to a pair of joint ventures that we acquired with the Ameron
transaction. For the second quarter, we do not expect to incur such losses from the Ameron JVs, but we do expect for
equity income from the Voest-Alpine JV to decline slightly.
Other expense for the quarter was zero, which represented a $17 million delta sequentially, as we benefited from
favorable movements in currencies and we also recognized a gain on the sale of assets.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6%, which was higher than the 29.2% rate that we posted in the
fourth quarter of 2013, but it is more consistent with historical trends.
Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $149 million in the first quarter,
down $1 million sequentially. Depreciation and amortization was $195 million, down $5 million from the fourth
quarter. And EBITDA, excluding transaction charges was $1.1 billion, or 18.9% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, National Oilwell Varco's March 31, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital
excluding cash and debt of $6.4 billion, up $115 million from the previous quarter but down $582 million from the
previous year. In the quarter, inventory increased $56 million or 1%, as all of our PS&S businesses modestly added to
their inventories to support heightening demand in the U.S. market.
Accounts receivable increased $414 million or 8% sequentially, despite the sequential decline in revenue. This build
can be directly tied to our Distribution business where the implementation of SAP has led to some slight delays in our
collection process, and our Rig Technology segment where we have some payment delays from some of our larger
most established customers. In short, the growth is simply an issue of timing. Fortunately, a large portion of this growth
was offset by continued improvements in customer financing, where prepayments and milestone invoicing on major
projects outpaced costs incurred by $379 million.
In addition to the increase in working capital, we spent $132 million on capital expenditures, made cash tax payments
of $301 million, paid dividends totaling $111 million, and cut bonus checks based on 2013 performance. As a result,
the company generated free cash flow of $252 million in the first quarter, resulting in a quarter-ending cash balance of
$3.7 billion and a net cash position of $539 million. Of the $3.7 billion in cash, 12% of the balance was in the U.S. at
March 31.

Clay C. Williams
Thank, you, Jeremy.
Before we open it up for questions, I want to say thank you to all of our employees out there. We have a lot of terrific
employees around the globe who have been working very, very hard to effect the spin of our Distribution Services
business, which we're very excited about, as well as take care of all of our good customers around the globe. I just want
to say once again how grateful Jeremy, Loren, and I are for the hard work that you do.
That completes the prepared remarks this morning. So at this point, we're prepared to open up for questions. Adrianna?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Go
right ahead, sir.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Thank you. Hey, good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So thanks for all that color and detail, much appreciated. One follow-up I would have or point of
clarity I would ask for would be your views on backlog ending the year, your comment I think was in the low teens.
And once again, I just wanted to understand the semantics or definition of low teens. The way I would think about low
teens would be $12 billion or $13 billion. That would appear to me to be way too low predicated on the other
commentary about slightly declining order book as the year goes on. So if you can provide a little more clarity on that,
that would be very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Kurt, first as you well know, our visibility into precision around orders is always limited,
Kurt. But looking out into the second half of the year, we're coming off a March 31 balance of $16.3 billion. If we fall
short of a one-to-one book-to-bill for Q3 and Q4, that could drift down a little bit and certainly would be expected to
drift down a little bit. We would define low teens as anything south of $15 billion, and right now that's our outlook. I
will stress though that we're very encouraged to see land orders picking up, stimulation equipment picking up. We're
encouraged for improvement in our FPSO orders later in the year. And so there are a lot of moving pieces here, but
we're just trying to provide a little more color. I think $12 billion or $13 billion would be lower than we would expect
at this point. I think you're probably looking at something in the $14 billion – $15 billion range.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. Thanks, I appreciate that. The follow-up I would have would be – what's your take
on the situation in Russia? There were sanctions obviously announced this morning. It might be a little bit too early for
you to make that assessment, but it looks like Rosneft was one of the companies that sanctions were put on. I know you
have a facility that's being manufactured in Russia. So just I'm trying to get a handle on how to risk-assess that from
that standpoint.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: I think we do. We've been investing in Russia and are building a facility to actually rig up
plant rigs in that country, and that's obviously a quickly evolving situation. So we've been watching it very, very
closely. We have lots of customers in Russia, including Western companies that operate there, and so we'll have to see
what the specifics around the sanctions in terms of the impact on our business. But we've been a supplier of equipment
into the Russian market for many, many years and have a pretty diverse customer base there.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, thanks. I appreciate that.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet. Thanks, Kurt.

And our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen. Go right ahead, sir.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Jim.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Good morning.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: First, I'd just like to second your comments, Clay, that you made about Pete and the
outstanding job he's done over the past dozen or so years as CEO. I have questions about the order outlook for three
distinct areas, Clay, and I'll just lay them out here and let you answer. One is FPSOs and if you expect a better order
picture there and how quickly you see that segment improving. Secondly is Russia, particularly in light of you building
this new plant, what we might see in terms of an improvement in land rig orders there. And then thirdly well
stimulation, if you could answer well stimulation in the context of how big was that last time and how meaningful
could that be to National in the next cycle.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet, Jim. Last year, with regards to FPSOs, we had over $1 billion in FPSO-related
orders, primarily turret warning systems for vessels along with flexible pipe that plugs into those turret warning
systems. And in addition to those two major products, we also sell a lot of composite piping systems into FPSO vessels.
A very strong year for orders and improving P&L results coming out of those orders, so we are very encouraged. As I
mentioned in our prepared comments, Q1 orders for FPSOs dipped down a little bit, but we do think that's just a
function of timing. We think both for flexible pipe as well as for vessels, Q2 and Q3 are looking much better, and so
we're encouraged by that.
With regards to Russia, as I just mentioned, we're investing in another facility there. We've had manufacturing
operations for many years in Belarus, which primarily supplies for Russian market. A couple of years ago we opened
another facility in Nizhnevartovsk. And so it's a market that has a lot of potential. There are something on the order of
800 rigs operating in Russia, and most of those are older technology. And there's a growing recognition I think amongst
Russian oil companies for the need for new technology much like their counterparts in North America and elsewhere
around the globe. And so our idea is to expand our footprint in Russia and in particular our aftermarket support of that
fleet. Under our current plans, that particular facility is slated to open up and start producing revenue probably the
second quarter of 2015, and very encouraged about the progress on the plant, sanctions notwithstanding. Obviously,
we're keeping a close eye on that, as I just mentioned.
Finally, the well intervention stimulation business, as we mentioned, we're very encouraged there. We saw orders slow
way down through 2013. We continued to deliver our backlog, and so the P&L for that business has been coming
down. But last quarter, or Q4 2013 and then Q1, the quarter we just finished, we saw orders begin to pick up and are
really encouraged for new capital equipment and also a lot of consumables that we see in that business. And so that's
what we're seeing across those landscapes, Jim.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay, and if I could, just a brief follow-up on your FPSO answer. Are you seeing any
progress with the customers in order of willingness to try to order a standardized package?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: I would prefer to use the term configurable package, Jim. What we're trying to do are
standardize interfaces between modules and make the vessels overall more configurable. And yes, what we're running
into at the senior level amongst many of our customers is this recognition that their prior projects haven't gone
[indiscernible] (39:25) amounts plus the late first oil because of late delivery of those projects, and arguably, I think the
project has been challenged. And so we're gaining an audience at the highest levels of a couple of the oil companies
and are encouraged with a couple of specific – two in particular specific projects that we're bidding this concept into
and we think there will be more to come.
So it's very early days and we know from our drilling rig transformation experience, changing the status quo in this
industry is a long-term effort to generate success. But we do think we have a better way and we actually think the

recent concern that oil companies are expressing publicly about their economic returns on these projects provides a
good backdrop to go in and have those kind of conversations.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay, great. Thank you, Clay.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Jim.

And our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Go ahead sir.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Marshall.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Good morning.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Clay, you guys have more than a pristine balance sheet and you got pretty substantial free
cash flow. So I will go ahead and ask the question I've been getting a lot. What's your latest in terms of thoughts of
what we do with that cash here in the next year or two?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Marshall, historically we paid a dividend. We began paying a dividend in 2009 versus special
on a regular. We doubled that dividend last year. So I would tell you in the past, our preferred method of returning cash
to shareholders, and I think that's what you're talking to, has been around the dividend. We agree. We have a very
strong level of cash flow. In our meetings with our board upcoming in May, we plan on discussing the level of dividend
with them as well as other alternatives, including share buybacks or some other use of cash, and so we'll see how that
turns out. But I would say we're looking hard at a meaningful increase in the dividend again in May.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: The other thing that I'd add to that, Marshall, we intentionally took a pause from
acquisitions following the Robbins & Myers acquisition in February last year. We calculated about 20 deals in about a
16 – 17-month span, and waited some time to digest what we had acquired. I'd say we've done that now. We've gotten
through the integration work. We're just about done with this span which is consuming a lot of resources, but I think
you'll see us get a little more active in that market again, and deals are looking pretty good right now. I'd say we've got
a pretty full pipeline. Most of them are smaller in nature. Most of them are internationally based, which is good since
88% of our cash at the end of the quarter is overseas. So we'll continue to look there as well. And we still have a couple
of fairly significant CapEx projects, including the Russia facility. We're doing some work in Saudi, certainly some
more work in Latin America, primarily Brazil, that will consume some cash.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Right. The follow-up there, Jeremy, you mentioned that you're putting in an ERP system
and SAP. A lot of times that creates some short-term disruption as it's going in. Tell me how that's progressing and
where you stand on all that.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: We don't have a common ERP platform across all of NOV. The distribution and
transmission segment functioned on SAP prior to the acquisitions of Wilson and C.E. Franklin. So, they're just going
through the conversion process now to upgrade their SAP platform and then bring over the Wilson and C.E. Franklin
businesses. That's going extremely well. Obviously, these are always somewhat disruptive, but we've had SAP in our
business since 2000. I believe maybe it was 1999. So we've got some strong subject matter experts around the world in
that area. In some of our PS&S segments – current PS&S segments, it's not as if we're implementing a common ERP
across that old segment if each individual business within that segment too are converting over to something a little
more robust now that we're far more global and much larger and more complex. So I don't expect any major
disruptions, Marshall. Certainly, there are going to be some little hiccups in there, but I don't think it's going to be
anything material.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Sounds good, guys, thank you.

And our next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Go right ahead.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Hi, Brad.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Hi, Brad.
<Q - Brad Handler>: So I think you've outlined in some previous calls that your pace of delivery of offshore rigs is
running right around the 50-plus mark. I guess it did last year. It did this year and is into 2015, if I recall correctly?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: That is correct.
<Q - Brad Handler>: That's correct, okay. What you have done so far, what you're in the process of tying together in
terms of workforce addition, capacity addition from a plant standpoint, is that enough or should we expect continued
initiatives along that vein as you live with what choices you've made?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: I think we're building up to a level of capacity that fits that level. If you look back, Brad, over
the last couple of years, orders began flowing in in earnest late in 2011 and 2012. We've rebuilt our backlog up to new
record levels here more recently. We began to experience supply chain challenges in the first components that to go
into rigs, which are typically mud ponds. And then as we work through those and get better at that, the next wave that
we saw was rig floor equipment, derricks. Finally, BOPs last year was the source of some challenges and then more
lately it's been I&C.
And so what you've seen is that as the pigs move through the snake, it's tracked, the equipment that has had to be
delivered into this extraordinarily high level of rigs that we're delivering. And why we're so confident, we know we're
just going to get a lot better is that piece by piece we've successfully challenged our supply chain issues and worked
through those short-term challenges as we ramped up our capacity. So we're addressing that and we feel like we're in
the last phases of it, a record level of installation and commissioning work going on in shipyards right now to
accommodate a level of rig deliveries which is effectively double our prior peak back in 2008 and 2009 and dealing
with shorter delivery times and the like, and we're making a little progress on it quarter by quarter. So that's the
progression of things.
With regards to that last piece of the fabrication puzzle, the installation and commissioning, we now have six technical
colleges around the globe and we're going to eight shortly to train our service technicians who both perform installation
and commissioning work on new build rigs as well as repair older rigs, and so it's a versatile skill set. When we look
out over the next four or five years, we see a tremendous number of offshore rigs having to come back in for their
five-year surveys. And so this is a workforce that we're training to handle the I&C work on new orders. And we foresee
a few years out then a portion of those will be redeployed into our next pressing challenge, which is to handle a flood of
rigs coming back into shipyards to see overhauls and upgrades of the equipment that's on those rigs. So this is a
workforce that we see a lot. We're going to keep them pretty busy for the next several years.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Makes sense.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Brad, one thing to add to that, which would be as you look at capacity additions on a
go-forward, what I think you might see is more regionally-specific capacity additions, where you see places really
strong in growing markets, say in Saudi Arabia where they are pushing for more and more local content requirements.
This has also obviously happened in Brazil. It's happening in Russia. You're seeing it in Argentina; it will be in Mexico.
So I think if you see capacity additions on a go-forward, they will be smaller in scale, not nearly requiring the same
level of CapEx and far less disruptive, but it will be to capture new and growing markets.

<A - Clay C. Williams>: Primarily, we're looking to develop market support.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Makes sense, okay. As a related follow-up, maybe it's going to be certainly broader than just
that part of Rig Tech or the legacy Rig Tech. But in general, what you've just described is leveraging what you have put
into place, appreciating that there are some smaller additions, obviously a lot of optimism around some improving mix
over the course of time as some of the well stimulation equipment comes back. You get a little bit better pricing and
backlog, as you described. And all things are pointing to what you had described for us in the past as an improving
trend. But I guess is there any change to that thought if we start to think about margins in Rig Tech over the course of
the next couple of years? Is there any acceleration to getting back to that mid 20s% level, for example? Do you see any
signs that that might because of the U.S. land market, that that might happen a little bit more quickly than you have
suggested to us in the past?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: That's certainly encouraging as we see other parts of the Rig Tech business pickup, and that
will help us on that front. The main driver here though is just continuing to gain experience on these new rig floor
layouts. We talked in previous calls about new class specifications for the crop of deepwater rigs that have been
ordered recently, new rig floor layouts. And so we've negated some of the learning curve effects from the 2008 cycle.
And we know from history across all of our businesses, once we're making the second copy and the fifth copy and the
tenth copy of something, we always get better at it. Costs always come down, and we're moving into that phase for this
new crop of rigs. So I would say that's the main engine, and then the other improvements in other parts of our business
are additive to that.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Right. Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the color.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Brad.

This will be our last question in our Q&A session. Our last question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Hey, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Clay, did I hear the words share repurchases come from you – come forth from those lips?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Michael, to be fair, we've always considered share repurchases along with dividends, and
we'll continue to look at that, and so yes. And also, too, as a reminder, at Varco prior to the merger, we had a share
purchase program. So we're very familiar with the math and the concept.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Yes.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: But to be fair, we have a track record now of paying a dividend. I think our recent thinking
around the subject with our board's counsel has been more along the lines of dividends.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Got it. Understood. I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a change there. I'm struck by
looking at the Rig Tech business and thinking about how in an up cycle you're focused on making sure that your
pricing is running ahead of your inflationary pressure so that you can grow margin. And when you're on the downside
of working the rat through the snake, you're really focused on efficiency and delivery as the emphasis on margin. I'm
wondering. As the volume scales back from 50 floaters a year delivery to something less than that, how do you manage
the absorption issue in terms of potential margin pressure?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, that's a great question. First point of clarification, when I say 50 rigs a year, that's
jackups plus floaters; that's not floaters.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Right.

<A - Clay C. Williams>: But certainly, cyclicality in our business is not news to us, and historically this business has
been up and down. And so we I think are very, very good at managing both the ups and downs. But the good news for
us again is the fact that the five-year SPS cycle for these rigs kicks in, in earnest, and in fact in the year 2016 – 2017 it
really ramps hard. And so even if new build infrastructure slows down, we're going to be very busy in the shipyards
with rigs coming in a lot.
And by the way, to provide further clarification around this, the vessels have to come in for hull inspections for
insurance, for Coast Guard certificate purposes, and the like every five years. And as part of that downtime in the
shipyard, they will do a lot of work on the drilling equipment packages at the same time because the opportunity cost of
being out of service for a month or two is so high, so that drives a lot of work for us in serving those rigs and repairing
that equipment and replacing and frequently upgrading equipment as part of those rigs. And so we see our installed
base driving very bright prospects over the next few years. And so that will do a lot to help keep our folks very busy.
So I think the aftermarket portion of our business does a lot to bring stability to an otherwise more cyclical business.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Another thought on that, Michael, is, when we made the decision to add capacity in our
Rig Tech segment, we were operating at three shifts, outsourcing way too much expediting freight. We added the
capacity with the hope that we could bring that down to a more balanced level of capacity in our plant, maybe two
shifts, not outsourcing as much, not expediting. And then we had a record level of orders last year, so we're still
operating at three shifts. We've reduced our outsourcing certainly and certainly reduced the expediting in freight, but
we're not at optimal levels at this point in time. So a slight slowdown wouldn't be the worst thing in the world from a
margin standpoint and efficiency standpoint.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay, great. So really two – if I could summarize, just two real sources of leverage: one, the
efficiency, Jeremy; and two, utilization doesn't fall off necessarily with the volume because of the aftermarket coming
back.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Correct, that's right.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Michael, just subject to – let me throw in we're very optimistic about the land rig opportunity
before us both in North America and elsewhere. And this business shares a lot of resources between land and offshore
as well. So this is particularly a strategic focus going forward. We need to continue to upgrade the land rig fleet, and so
I think that will help provide additional sources of work going forward.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay great. Thanks, Clay.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Michael.
Clay C. Williams
I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking to you about our second quarter
