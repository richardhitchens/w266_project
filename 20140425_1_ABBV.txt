Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings conference
call. Today, we're pleased to report strong results, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 exceeding our guidance
range for the quarter. This included strong operational sales growth, also ahead of our outlook for the quarter.
We delivered this performance with strong growth across a number of products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA,
Synagis, Synthroid, and Creon. Our performance this quarter illustrates our ability to grow our business despite the
impact of generic competition. It also provides confidence in our ability to deliver meaningful sales and EPS growth
starting next year as we launch our HCV therapy.
In 2014, our focus remains on continued strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement.
Today, I'll briefly discuss our first quarter performance and provide an update on our pipeline and some of the key
milestones we expect to occur throughout the year. Then I'll turn the call over to Bill, who will provide you additional
detail on our performance and our second quarter outlook.
Our first quarter performance was led by HUMIRA, which delivered more than 18% global operational growth. We
continue to see increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies, which is driving strong market
growth. Additionally, HUMIRA continues to gain market share across segments. HUMIRA is off to a strong start, and
we're well on our way to achieving our sales growth outlook.
Beyond HUMIRA, we also saw strong performance from other products in our portfolio, including Creon, Synthroid,
Synagis, and Sevoflurane. We continue to be pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands.
In addition to our strong commercial performance in the quarter, we also made significant progress advancing our
pipeline. So far in 2014, we have achieved a number of key regulatory and clinical objectives. This includes an
important milestone for our interferon-free HCV combination. As you may have seen earlier this week, we announced
the submission of our U.S. regulatory application for HCV therapy for genotype 1 patients.
Our European regulatory application will occur in early May based on specific dates allowed for submitting
applications to the CHMP. In anticipation of U.S. commercialization in late 2014 and European approval into early
2015, we've continued to make good progress in building the appropriate infrastructure.
Detailed results from several of our Phase III registrational studies were recently presented at EASL and published in
the New England Journal of Medicine. The comprehensive body of data demonstrates that our combination provides
high rates of cure across genotype 1 populations, including difficult-to-treat patients.
As we evaluate the HCV market and consider which patients will likely be treated in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we
believe the most advanced patients, those with cirrhosis, fibrosis, and patients who have previously failed treatment,
will be treated sooner.
This view is consistent with feedback we've received from payer organizations and physicians around the world, and
based on the high level of efficacy demonstrated by our therapy in these difficult-to-treat patients, we believe we're

well positioned for success in this market.
Further, because we've conducted independent studies across specific genotype 1 patient populations, we're able to
characterize the performance in each patient type with a very high degree of confidence, and we believe this will be an
important point of differentiation.
During the quarter, we also presented results from our mid-stage HCV trials in Japan as well as initial data on our
next-generation HCV assets. Given patient characteristics and the prevalence of genotype 1b in Japan, we are
evaluating a 12-week 2DAA once-daily ribavirin-free treatment for these patients.
Data from our Phase II study with this combination in Japan demonstrated SVR12 rates in the mid-90% range. Our
Phase III program is ongoing and enrolling rapidly, and we expect to submit our regulatory application in the first half
of 2015.
Japan represents the second largest HCV market globally, and given our commercial presence and the potential product
profile, we believe we're well positioned relative to the competitive offerings.
At the recent CROI meeting, we presented initial data from our next-generation HCV assets, including ABT-493, a
potent protease inhibitor, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT-530.
As we've said before, it is our goal with our next-generation program to bring to market a ribavirin-free once-daily
pan-genotypic combination. As I mentioned last quarter, we have ongoing efforts to further simplify our initial offering
with a once-daily formulation, and we've continued to make progress in this regard.
Certainly, there has been significant attention regarding the competitive landscape for this market. While we can't make
direct comparisons between studies, we do believe there are important differences between the clinical trial designs
across various programs. This includes significant differences in cohort size for specific sub-groups and patient
populations, and the confidence intervals around trial results. We believe these factors will be important considerations
for physicians, payers and patients.
Based on the large body of data supporting our therapeutic profile across genotype 1 patients, our global footprint and
our ability to execute commercially, we continue to believe we're in a strong position. AbbVie will be an early entrant
into this market where there is clearly a strong desire from both physicians and payers for multiple therapeutic options.
Well-tolerated treatments like ours that demonstrate high levels of efficacy, particularly in difficult-to-treat patients,
will fare well, and considering the number of patients afflicted and both the physician and payer capacity, we believe
there will be a steady cadence of patients treated annually, making this a very attractive market for many years to come.
While HCV certainly garners significant attention, today I'd also like to highlight some of the other important pipeline
programs and milestones that we expect throughout the remainder of 2014.
We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm on our late-stage oncology assets, including our Bcl-2 inhibitor,
ABT-199, in development for a number of hematological malignancies, including our late-stage trials for our vanguard
indication, CLL; our PARP inhibitor, ABT-888 in development for more than a dozen different cancer types; and
elotuzumab in Phase III development for multiple myeloma.
The ABT-199 clinical program, which is partnered with Roche/Genentech, continues to progress very well. As a
reminder, last spring we refined the dosing and monitoring approach with ABT-199 in CLL to minimize the risk for
tumor lysis syndrome. Since initiating the new protocol, we've collected and analyzed data on a significant number of
patients. There have been no clinically significant events of TLS reported.
We recently shared these findings with U.S. regulatory authorities and reached agreement to remove the hospitalization
requirement for a significant portion of patients going forward. We plan to present the safety data in an upcoming
European Hematology Association meeting.
As you know, last year, we initiated a large Phase II single-agent study in relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p
deletion. The initial data readout from this trial is expected in the first part of 2015. If the data warrants and regulatory

agencies agree that ABT-199 addresses an unmet medical need, these data have the potential to serve as a path to early
registration.
We have a number of ABT-199 data presentations in other activities that are also expected this year. We plan to present
initial Phase I combination data with Rituxan in relapsed/refractory CLL patients at the upcoming ASCO and EHA
meetings.
Later this year, we expect to present initial single-agent AML data and multiple myeloma data. And also later this year,
in collaboration with our partner, we plan to start a Phase III combination study of ABT-199 plus GA101 in first- line
CLL patients.
We've also seen good progress with ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor. We recently announced the initiation of a global
Phase III trial evaluating ABT-888 in patients with previously untreated squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The data
supporting the decision to advance to Phase III development will be presented at a medical meeting in the second half
of this year.
Earlier this year, we started a Phase III study of ABT-888 for neoadjuvant treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.
Several other mid-stage trials will complete in 2014 with the potential for additional Phase III transitions yet this year.
Also in late stage development in our oncology pipeline is elotuzumab for multiple myeloma, the second most common
blood cancer, in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Two Phase III studies are ongoing in relapsed/refractory and
first-line patients. Results from the event-driven trial are expected in early 2015.
Now, turning to our other late-stage pipeline assets, this summer, we'll see data from the second of two registrational
studies on daclizumab. As a reminder, the DECIDE trial is designed to show reduction in annualized relapse rates and
disability progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis versus an active comparator.
Despite advances in this category, there continues to be a significant need for high efficacy agents, and we believe
daclizumab has the potential to deliver the right balance of clinical activity in an acceptable safety profile.
In our neuroscience pipeline is Duopa. Regarding our U.S. regulatory application, we recently received questions on
the submission. FDA did not identify safety issues of the clinical data and no new clinical trials were requested. The
questions were primarily related to the use of the delivery system. We're in the process of addressing the questions and
plan to submit a response when that process is complete.
Moving on to elagolix, our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and Phase IIb for uterine fibroids.
We'll see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis in the second half of 2014.
And finally, we look forward to seeing Phase IIb data in RA in our partnered selected JAK1 inhibitor. Beyond our
partnership with Galapagos, we have a robust pipeline in mid-stage immunology assets including an internal selective
JAK1 inhibitor, an IL-6 antibody and DVD bispecific biologics, among others.
In closing, we're off to a strong start in 2014. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and we continue to make
good progress executing on our key strategic priorities including pipeline advancement. As we evaluate our pipeline
prospects including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is as strong as it has ever
been.
We're on the cusp of a number of important data milestones, phase transitions, and product launches. Given the
progress we've made, we continue to expect strong sales and earnings growth beginning in 2015.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results.
William J. Chase
Thank you, Rick. This morning, I'll review our first quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the
remainder of 2014. As Rick said, we're very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Total sales increased 6.7%

on an operational basis excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid
franchise due to loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 13.5% on an operational basis.
HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $2.6 billion, up 18.4% on an operational basis. In the U.S., HUMIRA
sales increased 24.7%, driven by continued market expansion, share gains, and particularly strong growth in the gastro
segment. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew nearly 14% on an operational basis and more than 12% on a reported
basis. International growth is being driven by continued uptake of new indications, share gains and double-digit market
growth in most key countries. On a global basis, we continue to expect double-digit sales growth for HUMIRA in 2014.
International sales of Synagis were strong in the first quarter at $354 million, up 9.3% on an operational basis. Synagis,
which protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease, is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first
and fourth quarters.
AndroGel sales were up 6% benefiting from a favorable comparison versus the market dynamics of the prior year
quarter. While AndroGel continues to gain shares, we have seen a notable slowdown in the market this year with
overall prescriptions down roughly 10%. We expect AndroGel performance for the year to be in line with these market
trends.
Global Lupron sales were $189 million in the quarter, up 5.6% on an operational basis. For the full year 2014, we
expect sales to be down modestly from 2013.
U.S. sales of Synthroid were at $157 million with the year-over-year growth rate aided by a favorable comparison to
the first quarter of 2013 which was unfavorably impacted by customer ordering patterns. Synthroid maintains strong
brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year
2014, we expect low double-digit sales growth for the brand.
U.S. Creon sales were $107 million in the quarter, up 18.4%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic
enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. We expect low double-digit
sales growth for Creon in 2014.
Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew nearly 30% on an operational basis this quarter.
For the remainder of 2014, we expect continued double-digit growth in Europe and other international markets where
Duodopa is currently approved.
All of the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. Sales of Niaspan were $47 million
and TriCor/Trilipix sales were $23 million, both down significantly versus the first quarter of 2013. We expect these
trends to continue for the remainder of 2014.
I'll now turn to the P&L profile for the first quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 78.4%, in line with our
expectations and up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. This reflects loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise
offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio and margin-enhancing initiatives we've implemented.
Adjusted R&D was 16.9% of sales, up 22% from the prior year driven by increased funding of our mid- and late-stage
pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. The level of R&D investment in the
quarter was above our guidance.
Adjusted SG&A was 27.6% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting continued investment in our growth brands and
preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Adjusted SG&A investment increased 4.6% from the prior quarter. We
remain on track for a full-year adjusted SG&A profile approaching 28%.
Net interest expense was $65 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items were $0.71, up
4.4% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.61.
Moving on to our full year 2014 outlook, we are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.00 to $3.10.
This guidance range excludes $0.37 per share related to amortization expense and ongoing separation and restructuring

costs.
We continue to expect sales of approximately $19 billion this year, with growth from our key marketed products
offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact
from exchange of roughly 1% for the year.
We're committed to improving our gross margin ratio in 2014, despite the loss of high-margin lipid sales. As a result,
we continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 79% for the year, reflecting actions we've taken to
further improve our margin profile.
As you know, we have a record number of Phase III programs in development, including a number of exciting
opportunities in oncology, HCV, immunology and other areas that warrant investment. We now expect R&D expense
to be somewhat above 16% of sales as we continue to advance our late-stage pipeline.
As I noted during our call in January, we expect to see an increase in SG&A this year as we invest in our key brands
and our upcoming HCV launch. And as a result, we continue to expect SG&A expense to approach 28% of sales in
2014.
We are forecasting net interest expense of about $270 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted
tax rate of approximately 22%.
Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.77. This excludes roughly
$0.10 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a second quarter EPS in a range of $0.65 to $0.67 on a
GAAP basis. Our second quarter outlook reflects a flat to slightly increasing top line including a modest negative
impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full year
guidance.
The amount of investment in R&D and SG&A in the second quarter is expected to increase sequentially from the first
quarter as we accelerate spending particularly for our upcoming HCV launch. This has been captured in our EPS
guidance range for the second quarter.
So, in conclusion, we're pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo
Thanks, Bill. And we'll now open the call for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you so much. I have three questions. First, regarding the hep-C opportunity, has your
strategy on how to approach the market changed at all in the past six months, and if so, in what ways?
Secondly, on Duopa, I assume the PDUFA date will be pushed out from the early May timeframe. Do you have
visibility on for how long? And then, thirdly, maybe a bit of a bigger picture question. Some companies are
philosophically opposed to changing full year EPS guidance at the end of Q1 because it's simply too early in the year to
do so. Does AbbVie share this view, or would the company have increased its full year EPS guidance already if thought
that was prudent? Thank you.

Page 7 of 15
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Steve, this is Rick Gonzalez. I'll take the first one and the last one. Let me start
with the last one. Yeah, I think we are in a position where it just doesn't make sense based on first quarter to change
guidance. I wouldn't say we have a philosophy where we won't change it if ultimately we believe it should be changed
going forward, but it's just too early in the year to ultimately make that decision today.
As far as hep C is concerned, I think it is a very interesting market as it's evolved over time. But the one thing I'd rule
out is we said early on in the process that we thought we had a very competitive profile on our product and we thought
we could position this product well in the marketplace. And if you recall, one of the things that we talked about is that
we had done a significant amount of market research in this area and that there were really three key drivers of success.
One was clearly cure rates, SVR12 rates, in both naïve patients, but more importantly in difficult-to-treat patients. And
second was therapies that were highly tolerable. Those two factors alone drove the vast majority of physician
prescribing patterns. Convenience was a distant third, a very, very distant third is what we said.
At the same time, we also said that this was a large market and would stay a large market for a long period of time
because of the clinical capacity and the triaging of patients over time, and that physicians and payers would want
multiple options in the marketplace. And we also said that we believed that the patients that would get treated first were
cirrhotics, fibrotic patients, and experienced patients, that they'd be a significant amount of the treatment in the first
several years.
When you look at the way the market's playing out today, it's playing out pretty close to what I just described here, and
that's what we articulated more than a year ago. If you look at our product profile against that, we have very strong
SVR12 rates in cirrhotic patients and experienced patients. We have strong individual patient data around
sub-populations with very tight confidence intervals. We have extremely high tolerability with or without ribavirin. We
have very low relapse rates in these patients, and we're going to be an early entry into the marketplace and provide an
alternative to the other competitive offerings.
And so when I look at it, it's playing out very similar to what we expected. And I think we'll be in a very good position
to compete very effectively in this market.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Great.
<A - Scott Brun>: This is Scott Brun. I'll take the second question on Duopa regarding the PDUFA date. So, certainly
through our interactions with FDA, they acknowledge the importance of Duopa in providing an option for patients with
severe Parkinson's disease who other than deep brain stimulation really have no other options. And so we've been
working very closely with them to address some questions predominantly related to the use of the delivery system.
Really, we've gotten no concerns with regard to the safety, efficacy profile of the product. I think this is more a factor
that this is a very unique drug device combination, and we're working with multiple constituent parts of the FDA
beyond just the drug review division. And so certainly, there are some additional questions related to patient use,
instructions for use, and we're working through those with the various FDA divisions, our partner who manufactures
the pump, and our own internal AbbVie experts.
I don't want to give you guidance on the PDUFA date right now. Certainly, it will extend beyond May, but we're
working very expeditiously and in good partnership with the FDA to address those questions.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Rick, I'm not even really sure where the question is here,
but maybe you can comment on this. As you know, Sovaldi sales this quarter were $2.2 billion. J&J's Olysio sales this
quarter, one single-agent protease inhibitor, generated $350 million in sales annualizing at $1.4 billion. And I look at
consensus numbers for AbbVie's hep-C regimen next year, and they're under $800 million. What do you think the

world is missing here? Because we've seen really good data, et cetera, et cetera, but I don't know, maybe you can just
comment on what you think the gaps in misunderstanding are?
And then secondly, Scott, to you on your second-generation hep-C regimen, clearly, I think one of the key messages at
EASL is just how aggressively your competitors are moving in this space, and I'm wondering if you can give us an
update on your development timelines for your second-generation hep-C regimen, and if we will see data at AASLD?
And then just lastly on the news, Rick, on ABT-199, so are you saying that we are now out of the woods on TLS with
respect to ABT-199? Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jami.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Jami, so I'll cover the question on hep-C. You know, I'm not sure what the gaps
are. I mean, I just went through how I think our product fits against the market criteria, and I think that's consistent with
our view of how we'll compete in the marketplace. I will say, look, the data is evolving here very rapidly. We just saw a
lot of the competitive subset data at EASL and the market probably needs a little time to digest that over a period of
time and make some determinations as to how they want to – how they want to value each of the competitive
alternatives in the marketplace. But I can tell you from our perspective, we feel pretty good about our position and we
feel it's playing out very consistently with what we thought would play out in the marketplace.
Having said all that, it's certainly better to delight than disappoint. And so, the number that's out there I think is a
number that certainly is one that we have confidence we can beat.
<A - Scott Brun>: Jami, it's Scott. Maybe I'll go on with the HCV second-generation. So, as Rick said, we presented
data at CROI showing the characteristics of our new protease inhibitor, ABT-493 and our new NS5A, ABT-530. Both
are pan-genotypic with very balanced activity against genotypes 1 through 6, activity against the first-generation
compound typical mutations that we see arise, and frankly, very interesting characteristics with regard to their barriers
to resistance. So, certainly, if you compare these against other next-generation compounds, these compounds are
ranking near the top extremely favorably.
We're in Phase II right now. We have established our confidence that these are indeed once-daily compounds without
the need of Ritonavir. We are very pleased with regard to what we're seeing in patients. And we are moving forward
with our Phase II program that's going to incorporate elements of, let me say, much of what we've been learning about
where the competition is moving with the next wave of therapy. And we certainly feel we are on track for these
therapies to be available in the 2017 timeframe.
Certainly, moving on to ABT-199, as Rick said, after we changed our dosing protocol to start at a somewhat lower dose
and ramp up more slowly, we had been hospitalizing all of our CLL patients with the initiation of 199. We have
monitored them very carefully, collected a very significant body of data, and certainly have seen no TLS, clinically
significant TLS, with that approach.
As a consequence of our analyses of these data, moving forward with the FDA, we've been able to remove the
hospitalization requirement for, I will say, the majority of patients. We're continuing hospitalization for those patients
at highest risk with the most bulky disease who, frankly, are also the ones who have the fewest options and the greatest
ability to benefit from ABT-199 therapy.
So, the program is expanding rapidly with Phase III studies having initiated. So, we're going to be getting a lot more
patient experience. You're going to see what we've seen at the upcoming ASCO meeting. I always want to be careful
about saying "out of the woods", but I will say strongly off to the races based on what we've been seeing.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just on the once-daily formulation of the
current offering, I wonder if you can just give us a bit more color around timing of that? And what you're required to do
for that in terms of any clinical studies or work with the FDA?
Secondly, can you just let us know if you've had any indication around guidelines in advantage potentially in patient
groups like cirrhotics or any other hep-C population where you think you have a higher level of evidence than the
competitors so far in terms of specific trials?
And then just a last question, what do you guys think the percentage of the global hep-C opportunity that's driven by
tender or preferential access based pricing, just to give us a sense of how important pricing might be in this market?
Thank you.
<A - Scott Brun>: It's Scott Brun again. So with regard to our once-daily formulation of our first-generation regimen
that will take our twice-daily non-nuc polymerase ABT-333 and co-formulate with the once-daily 450/267, we are
finishing up some of our pharmacokinetic work to make sure that we're selecting the optimal candidate formulation.
Certainly, based on what those data look like and how similar the PK profiles are to the regimen with separates will
drive exactly what our next steps are going to be.
Certainly, if there's additional clinical work required, we fully anticipate that we're going to be beginning that work
before the end of the year and this regimen will slot in between the entry of the first-generation regimen and as I
referred to, the second-generation.
You know, with regard to guidelines, certainly, we work very closely with the various groups that drive the prevailing
global guidelines, certainly to make sure that they understand the breadth and depth of our program. I think typically,
guidelines are driven by weight of evidence. Certainly, you can see ABC gradings with regard to how strong evidence
is, and having dedicated data in some of the most important patient groups who are hardest to treat in very significant
numbers that shrink your confidence intervals and provide you greater certainty, I think it's going to resonate with these
guideline groups.
Again, those guidelines haven't been written yet. But if you look at how these are conventionally put together, it's a
weight of evidence approach. And I think we feel very, very confident in our body of data, particularly in the groups
that you referenced such as the cirrhotics.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay, Jeff, this is Rick, on the tender question. Well, as you know, the U.S. is a big part
of this market which is in a tender-driven kind of market. And then obviously, a lot of the major European countries
would be the other significant part in Japan. And so if you look at pure tenders across the G7, it will be a relatively
small percentage of the overall revenue in this market as it exists today.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: The first is just – great. The first is relatively straightforward, just a simple numbers
question. IMS has been reporting mid- to high-single digit TRx growth for HUMIRA in the U.S. in the first quarter.
Could you just break down the reported 25% U.S. HUMIRA sales growth to give us some better perspective on
underlying demand as you see it, in case the IMS TRx growth is misleading, and then also on price and any inventory
stocking?
Second, with respect to HCV on pricing, maybe Rick, you could just give us your thoughts at a high level about how
competitive one needs to be on price in a duopoly. I would think that in the initial duopoly, it would make little sense to
price aggressively when you have just one competitor, but just wanted to get your perspective on that.
And then third, with respect to HCV diagnosis, I think the HCV bulls are talking about significant diagnosis increases
in the U.S., but I don't have a good perspective on what the real numbers are. So maybe you could talk about the
number diagnosed in terms of whatever number you have recently, [indiscernible] (38:37) that number is really going
to grow annually in the next three years. We think about the number of diagnosed in the United States growing in the
low single-digits percentage annually or mid-single-digits percentage, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, David.
<A - William J. Chase>: So David, it's Bill Chase. I'll start with your HUMIRA question. You know, as you pointed
out, the IMS scripts on HUMIRA are high-single digit. The numbers we see are actually a little higher than that
typically on an annual basis. This thing is doing high-single to low-double digit. And then obviously, you've seen it
when we've taken price increases. So, price does remain a component of the U.S. growth.
Inventories, we try to minimize fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter on inventories as much as we possibly can. In both
the fourth quarter and the first quarter, HUMIRA inventories were about half a year. There were some impacts – half a
month, rather, I'm sorry – there were some impacts in the first quarter of 2013, but that was maybe four to five points
on the growth all together.
This is a brand that continues to perform very, very strongly in the U.S. You saw the numbers last year, and certainly
we expect continued performance this year.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: And I'm sorry, I don't know if you can hear me, sorry to interrupt, but with respect to four to
five points in the first quarter of 2013, are you saying that there was a negative impact resulting in a somewhat easy
comp for the first quarter of 2014 given what happened in the first quarter of 2013?
<A - William J. Chase>: There was a favorable comp versus the first quarter of 2013 related to ordering patterns.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question...
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay, David, this is Rick. I'll cover the HCV one. You know, as it relates to pricing, as
we've said before, if I look at the product profile that we have and I look at the mix of patients that are going to be
treated first, we have a product profile that stands up quite nicely in the marketplace, and so that's not our strategy
going forward. And so we're not going to talk specifically about how we're going to deal with pricing, as I mentioned in
the last call as well. But I'll just tell you, the product attributes of the AbbVie therapy I think stand up quite nicely to
what the market wants, and certainly that will be the driver of how we try to educate the market and market the product.
As far as diagnosis rates are concerned, I don't have the numbers directly in front of me, but last time I recall we
thought there were about 3.5 million patients in total in the United States, about half of those were currently diagnosed.
And I'd say in our LRP modeling, we're not modeling out dramatic increases in diagnosed – in newly diagnosed
patients. I mean, there are obviously patients that are being diagnosed and coming into the system, but it's probably in
that high-single or low-double digit kind of rate.

Because you have to remember, there's a certain level of clinical capacity here to begin with just to get through the
people that are already diagnosed that need treatment. And so, I think everybody will have campaigns to go forward
and try to diagnose more patients, but the governing factor may be the level of clinical capacity that exists in the
marketplace anyway.
<A - Scott Brun>: Yeah, no, David, hey, it's Scott. I completely agree with Rick. You know, you see some varying
numbers with regard to say the U.S. how many patients are actively in care with HCV. I've seen numbers on the order
of 400,000, and to Rick's point, maybe 1.5 million to 1.7 million diagnosed on a total of 3 million.
But I think the more relevant question is, as Rick laid out, if you're trying to see the how this market is going to evolve,
there's all the various factors in the patient – their journey, not only diagnosis, clinical capacity, but then some of the
things certainly both in the U.S. and globally with regard to how payers are going to be looking at the cadence of
treatment with certainly all the signaling that we've been seeing, those are the most advanced fibrosis and/or prior
treatment experience coming in first.
So, I agree with Rick. Probably – we have not modeled, and don't need to model very aggressive diagnostic uptake in
our forecast.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much. Just following up on the pricing topic here on the HCV side,
I guess your competitor's price and launch have obviously attracted a lot of attention from payers and some politicians.
I guess, do you have a little bit more on your view on how this all plays out? I guess, if price doesn't come down in this
market, do you think we're going to see more efforts to restrict usage of these products that I guess medically make
sense at all to do? And I guess, finally, does that attention at some point give AbbVie better negotiating position with
payers? I just – a couple of questions there, but just any thoughts would be appreciated.
My second question was on ABT-199. I guess just two clarifying questions there. First, how many patients have been
dosed on the new regimen at this point? And the second question is, it looks like you could have a best-in-class product
here, but one that's going to be coming to market a few years later than some other highly effective novel agents. I
guess, how do you just see that playing out commercially, the time to market issue here? Thanks very much.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Chris.
<A - Scott Brun>: Chris, hey, it's Scott Brun. So maybe I can talk about it. Obviously, I don't want to be giving away
exact numbers with regard to where we're at on our Phase II program, again, just because of the competitive fervency
here. But to your point, I mean, when I look at the characteristics of these drugs, and again, we're comparing in your
minds the pre-clinical information that's out there and then certainly what I know about from what we've seen in
patients so far. I absolutely think that this particular regimen has the potential for best-in-class. We will know more
over the ensuing year as we continue our Phase II program.
But when I say for a regimen that's going to be out in 2017, referring back to the prior question, this epidemic is going
to be far from over, okay? And I'm talking in the developed markets. You just look at our throughput even if you
assume in the G7, say, on the order of 250,000 patients coming through. There are going to be a number of patients still
in need, and certainly, this number, as you made the point, is going to be affected by healthcare system decisions on
how our patients going to be prioritized.
Certainly, this is a disease where the consequences occur decades after initial infection, so you do have some time
before you have to act. You don't have to treat everybody with no or little evidence of liver scarring right off the bat.
Certainly, I think those patients who have more advanced fibrosis or scarring or other factors that are medical

indications for treatment, I cannot imagine any healthcare system that's going to be making the decisions to deny that
care.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And Chris, I mean, the only thing – this is Rick – the only thing I would add to that is
what will really drive access and who is treated is capacity guidelines and then ultimately whatever criteria the
governments or managed care organizations put in place. And I think those will be responsible and appropriate clinical
guidelines that are put in place because they tend to come together. And the governing factor may be more of one of
capacity than it is other kinds of things.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. So just following up a little bit on pricing question there
with hep-C. I'd just like to – I wanted to ask you a question as it relates to HUMIRA, and just obviously, hep-C, there's
some unique components here. But are you seeing or do you expect to see any greater pressure across other specialty
care markets like specifically with HUMIRA, you're in a class with a TNF where you do have a number of different
competitors. I think we're starting to see some of these concerns maybe extend to areas that have been immune to this
issue before, so just curious to hear your thoughts.
And then separate unrelated question, just on AndroGel. Appreciate what you said about 2014. Just what do you think
about the longer-term potential for this class and your drug, specifically, just given some of the safety concerns that
have been raised? Do you see any potential to reestablish growth for this category, or not? Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: This is Rick. So if you look at HUMIRA and the class of anti-TNFs, I think you have to
reflect back on there have been many, many competitors in this market for a long period of time, and you still see
HUMIRA have a leadership position in this category. Obviously, a component of that is working with governments and
working with managed care organizations to ensure that you're demonstrating the right value proposition for the
product, and it is priced appropriately against that value proposition. And that's something we deal with every single
day, every single year. I wouldn't say that we've seen dramatic changes in the approach that we've had to take with
those organizations. Even recently, I wouldn't say we've seen dramatic changes.
As it relates to AndroGel, certainly, we're not projecting going forward that the market will accelerate dramatically.
And so I think we're assuming in our modeling for our long range plan, that ultimately, the market will be relatively
slow-growing to flat going forward.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Vamil.

<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Three questions, if I may. Regarding your hep-C regimen, are you having discussions with payers

influence of this group?

Second, could you comment on the growth – enhanced gross margin enhancement margin initiatives that you were
talking about earlier? What are those initiatives, and what's your longer term outlook in gross margin given your plans
to establish manufacturing in Singapore?
And then third, when can we expect data from your own JAK1 inhibitor? Thank you.
<A - Scott Brun>: So maybe what's going on with regard to our data particularly in cirrhotics in the payer community.
So, look, we've been sharing the specifics on these data with a variety of different stakeholders that are involved in the
care of these patients ranging from, again, clinicians to various payer groups around the world.
And as I've said before, yeah, when you are – have been the only company that has done a dedicated study in a
population that traditionally has had lower rates of response with any other HCV therapy that's been seen, there's great
interest in how therapies are going to perform in this population. And I will say a great appreciation to the fact that we
did a very comprehensive 400-patient study in these patients to be able to provide them some granularity in terms of
how sub-populations of cirrhotics will perform.
Their view is we're not – we understand there's a population, but the individual clinician is going to be treating the 1a
cirrhotic relapsed patient. They're not going to be looking at a blended population when they make the choice, and
that's exactly what payers want to be seeing. So, I'd say there's been a very – a very robust interest in those data.
Maybe I can go ahead with regard to the JAK question. Certainly, we have two selective JAK1 programs ongoing; our
partnered program with Galapagos and then our own internal ABT-494 selective JAK inhibitor. Certainly, we're
looking at both of these in rheumatoid arthritis. We've also been studying Galapagos in Crohn's disease. We will be
seeing data on our JAK inhibitor on the first part of 2015.
<A - William J. Chase>: On gross margin, yeah, I would say that our gross margin profile has been a focus of
emphasis on this business going back actually many, many years, even pre-spin. The way we drive those savings is a
combination of everything from manufacturing efficiencies to purchasing efficiencies to even Lean manufacturing
techniques, that sort of thing. And certainly, we're keeping our eye on all of those balls as we move forward through the
LRP.
We expect over the next few years that you'll see some gross margin profile expansion. A lot of that's going to be
driven by the launch of HCV, which, as you can imagine, will be a higher margin product relative to our base. And so, I
think you'll be very happy watching that line develop over the next couple years.

<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Sure.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Another one on hep-C, just with regards to what you're seeing in terms of the Sovaldi and
Olysio numbers, how has this changed your internal expectations regarding the number of patients treated and launch
ramp? And you talked a little bit about capacity and where do you think we are now with regards to the sort of
percentage of capacity, and what do you assume this – what do you assume this is – the limit is here?
On HUMIRA, you – previously you've given some good color on the share and trends in each of the indications. If you
could give us an update on this, that would be great.

And just one on ABT-199, what are your expectations now for potential post-approval monitoring requirements, and do
you envisage a scenario where patients are stratified based on tumor bulk regarding whether they need monitoring?
Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks. Colin. This is Larry. I'll start with some HUMIRA overview, as you mentioned.
Certainly, we're seeing very good growth by indication. In general, I would say, we're seeing the rheum growth in kind
of the mid- to high-single digit range. The derm area is growing probably close to mid-single digits. And in gastro,
we're seeing more strong double-digit growth there. Ex-U.S., it's a little bit harder to cut it by indication, but as we
mentioned in the prepared remarks, we continue to see nice double-digit growth across the major markets ex-U.S.
In terms of share at this point in time, we would say that we're seeing gains in rheum. We've got about a 25% share
there. We see steady derm share at about a 40% share. And gastro, we're seeing share gains there and we're probably
about a 45% share holder there, toggle between number one and number two there, number one in derm.
So, very pleased with the progress that we're seeing. Strong commercial execution across the board. The mix of sales
right now, we see RA in the U.S. is actually just a little bit below 40% of our overall sales. Ex-U.S. is probably around
35%. The gastro space is probably around 25% or so of the overall sales mix both here in the U.S. and ex-U.S. The
derm space is probably in the range of 15% or so of sales in both geographies. And then the remainder is a little
heavier; ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis component actually let's call it 25% or so, and in the U.S., that
component's around 20% of our sales mix.
So, it's becoming a nicely diversified book of business for us overall in both geographies.
<A - Scott Brun>: Colin, hey, it's Scott. I'll go ahead and take the 199 question. So, with regard to speculating on
post-approval monitoring, obviously a little bit early, but as we've said today, we've been able to successfully remove
the requirement for hospitalization for both the low- and medium-risk patients which accounts for the majority of the
patients be it either first line or later line.
We're going continue with hospitalization for the time being on the high-risk patients which as you said are those with
the bulkier tumors. But as we include more data on those patients, we're going to continue to see how we can refine any
requirements for that type of monitoring. So, I just think we need some more patients under our belts for us to be able
to really say what it's going to look like at the time of launch.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Yeah. And Colin, this is Rick. I'll cover the hep-C one. We're obviously pretty early into
this launch. So, it's a little difficult I think to project off of one quarter. I'd say it is relatively consistent with how we
modeled it. If you go back to the initial PI launches, what you saw was some de-warehousing occurring, and then in the
first quarter or two it was high and then it started to flatten out a bit and come down a little bit.
And so if you think through that and you say that was a model that you wanted to follow that ultimately you might see
it peak, come down, flatten out a bit, and then reap – you see another peak occur with the launch of all orals where you
see more de-warehousing occur. So – but at this point, you're looking at one quarter. You're looking at one data point.
So it's a little hard to model against that. But I wouldn't say it was out of the realm of what we anticipated.
As far as capacity is concerned, I think we've talked before about the capacity. We do anticipate that there will be some
expansion in capacity with all oral coming into the marketplace. So I think we will see particularly in the United States
some expansion in capacity going forward. And so we will see more patients being able to be treated by the time those
products get to the marketplace. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Colin.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: And Elan, we have time for one final question.

Our final question today is from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. Can you talk about the PARP and the market and how you view your product and
compares to the other products?
<A - Scott Brun>: Sure. Yeah. Definitely. Marc, Scott Brun. So, Veliparib, our PARP. One of the things we tried to do
differently from the competition is to not just limit the use of the PARP mechanism as monotherapy in genetically
deficient tumors such as breast cancer with the BRCA mutation.
And so, I think you can see from the Phase III trials that we've started so far as a neoadjuvant therapy in triple-negative
breast cancer, these are for women who have been initially diagnosed with breast cancer where we treat with a
Veliparib-based regimen prior to therapy to de-bulk the tumor.
And then certainly, in non-small cell lung cancer, which is an area that no other PARP inhibitor has explored, we're
able to go there because we found a way to successfully combine with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. So we're really
looking to more broadly leverage the potential of PARP by using it in combinations with chemotherapy as reflected in
our initial Phase III trials.
We have an ongoing Phase II trial where we're using it in combination with whole brain radiation in patients who have
brain metastasis from lung cancer. That study is going to be reading later this year, looking at a variety of other solid
tumors in combination with other chemotherapies as well.

Veliparib as a consequence.
