Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group,
Stephen Hemsley.
Stephen J. Hemsley
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we will review our strong start to 2013 and update you in broad
terms on the environment we expect for the balance of this year and into 2014.
As you could see from our release this morning, first quarter revenues grew more than 11% to reach $30.3 billion. We
continue to grow market share and increase the number of customers and consumers we serve across every one of our
businesses that make up the two core platforms of UnitedHealthcare and Optum.
Our results reflect a consistent combination of fair and steady pricing discipline, fresh innovation in our products and
approaches, the capacity to address the changing needs of many of the key healthcare markets with comprehensive and
integrated solutions, and the fundamental values of consistent, responsive and compassionate service in everything we
do.
These elements all played to the steady top-line growth we have been fortunate to realize this year and over the past
three-plus years as UnitedHealthcare has added a net 5 million U.S. consumers, virtually all organically, over that
challenging economic period, and Optum has emerged as the distinctive enabling platform for advancing change across
the healthcare system.
First-quarter net earnings were $1.16 per share and were driven in particular by stronger earnings from Optum. Cash
flows from operations for the quarter of $1.1 billion represented 85% of net income, a 9 percentage point improvement
from the first quarter last year. Our balance sheet remains strong with $3 billion free cash and quarter-ending
debt-to-capital ratio of 36%.
We repurchased more than $0.5 billion in shares for the quarter, consistent with our annual plan; paid $216 million in
dividend, a 29% increase year-over-year; and our return on equity for the quarter was above 15%.
Turning to UnitedHealthcare, in the commercial markets, we work closely with one of the largest, fully insured
customers in the nation to convert its coverage arrangements from risk to fee status. While the bottom-line impact of
this conversion is negligible, revenues are impacted significantly in this business by $2.5 billion annually.
Looking through this jumbo, 1.1-million-member conversion, our organic consumer growth is pacing ahead of our plan
for the year, with first-quarter commercial membership growing 375,000 overall, self-funded benefits up 480,000
people, and risk-based benefits down a better-than-expected 105,000.
Commercial pricing yields are tracking well with our expectations, and the commercial care ratio for UnitedHealthcare
came in at a solid 78.3% for the quarter. We are lowering our full-year commercial-medical-care ratio target by 80
basis points from 82% to 81.2% plus or minus 50 basis points, in large part to reflect the large case funding conversion.
Growth across our Medicare offerings was even stronger. We added a net 300,000 seniors to Medicare Advantage,
145,000 to Medicare supplemental benefits, and 485,000 to standalone Part D drug benefits.

As expected, Medicare and retirement margins were down in the first quarter, given the Medicare ACA rate reductions,
the shift of our traditional level of first-quarter Part D profits to later in the year with the introduction of our enhanced
plan design, the strong level of new growth in Medicare Advantage, and significantly from unusually high levels of
reserve development in the first quarter of 2012, which we were never expected to repeat in 2013. And sequestration
will now add further margin pressure over the balance of the year.
In Medicaid, we grew a net 65,000 people representing organic growth of 125,000, offset by a divestiture impacting
60,000 beneficiaries, and we see no end to the growth opportunities. We've been privileged to expand services in
Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Florida.
We look forward to the significant opportunities to grow and serve additional states and to seek further in-state
expansion as the Medicaid proposal pipeline remains robust. And lastly, we are pleased with the very strong growth of
more than 200,000 commercial lives at Amil in the first quarter. In all of these broad categories – Commercial,
Medicare, Part D, Medicaid, and International – we are trending to the high end or above our growth outlook for 2013.
Looking at UnitedHealthcare on an all-in basis, the first-quarter operating margin of 5.8% was well within the range of
our expectations. As we also expected, reserve development levels of $280 million for the quarter was sharply less than
the unusually high $530 million in development in the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2012 also benefited
from a care ratio rebate true-up of $130 million.
First-quarter 2013 saw a greater positive development in the commercial business than in the government-sponsored
program, but overall, our cost estimates are proving to be quite accurate. Operating cost management across
UnitedHealthcare continues to be a strength, even as we continue to spend to meet the extensive requirements of the
new healthcare regulations.
Turning to Optum, the growth pace accelerates further. First quarter earnings from operations nearly doubled.
Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, a nearly 15% year-over-year top-line growth performance. Every Optum
segment grew organically and benefited from the continuing efforts to integrate and simplify the organization, focus on
the customer, and pivot to growth.
Revenue growth was exceptional, with OptumHealth growing revenues 26% to $2.4 billion, OptumInsight growing
15% to revenues of $773 million, and OptumRx growing 10% to revenues of $5.2 billion. For Optum, margin
restoration and expansion was an area of intense focus in 2012 and it remains so. The progress has been impressive,
with Optum's operating margin at 5.9% for the quarter compared to 3.4% for the prior-year quarter and with each of
Optum's businesses meaningfully strengthening its margins.
OptumHealth doubled its margins from 4.7% to 9.3% for the quarter, OptumInsight advanced from 13.3% to 19.3%
first quarter margin, and OptumRx expanded from 1.5% to a 2.3% margin, even with continuing costs associated with
the significant current-year insourcing effort. The market needs and is looking for the enabling capabilities Optum
offers. We anticipate further client developments in coming quarters which will illustrate just how strongly Optum is
maturing, holding its focus on execution and customer service, and pivoting the growth.
As we assess our position and our outlook, now informed by the events and perspectives of the first quarter, we remain
in a strong overall position with our unique diversified businesses growing and performing well. That is in large part
because we are serving customers well, we're steadily advancing our agenda of value and innovation, and strengthening
and readying our businesses to both navigate the coming market changes and then maximize the market opportunities
with the right timing.
As we move beyond the successful TRICARE implementations and migrations of more than 12 million consumers to
the OptumRx platform, we will redeploy energies and resources to advance new areas. The early themes of these new
areas have been discussed with you before. They include the comprehensive new basics services model, a deep and
substantive commitment to the rising importance of the consumer and healthcare, repeatable innovation disciplines and
capability, deeper service and experience integration using simpler enabling technologies, and the acceleration of
one-offs.

The businesses themselves are positioned to grow and perform well and service to their markets. UnitedHealthcare
businesses are growing well across the board. Customer retention remains strong, and the new military and veterans
platform is in place and operational. 2.9 million people from military families joined us on April 1.
In relation to the exchange markets that will begin in 2014, our views from last quarter remain unchanged. We will be
very selective in where we participate and do not believe the exchanges will be a significant factor for us, either plus or
minus in our 2014 commercial markets outlook.
Amil is off to a strong beginning, with its seasonally strong first quarter, and has the potential to exceed its earnings
plan for the year. We see this market and Amil's market leading offerings well-positioned to grow and diversify in the
traditions of both Amil and UnitedHealth Group.
Optum's momentum in growth and margin expansion should accelerate, as it becomes increasingly capable and mature.
Optum is now tracking to reach or exceed the upper end of its earnings outlook for 2013 and is establishing its own
reputation for fundamental execution, service, and innovation.
While we are performing well, we are doing so in a challenging economic, regulatory, and healthcare climate. The
headwinds we have discussed in our past sessions with you remain very real. By far the most impactful headwind is the
Medicare Advantage rate picture for 2014. While the final guidance was improved from the negative 8% all-in starting
point, it is still a significant challenge. The cumulative net effect of the SGR resolution, the mandated ACA rate
reductions, the strong negative impact of the risk recalibrations, and the insurance stacks still leaves the Medicare
Advantage program significantly underfunded; a more than 4% net reduction against the typical industry forward
medical cost trend outlook of 3% or more for 2014.
These rates will undoubtedly impact more than 14 million Medicare Advantage beneficiaries across the nation, and will
cause UnitedHealthcare to reduce benefits and pull back access in certain markets, and will affect the growth prospects
and earnings potential for our overall Medicare Advantage offerings across all our markets for 2014.
We did not expect the fastest-growing, most popular and most effective of the Medicare benefit options serving
America's seniors would be underfunded to this extent in 2014, particularly with the backdrop of the already existing
ACA mandates and sequestration. We will take the time to fairly assess the implications to our 2014 UnitedHealth
Group growth outlook and whether our growth expectations for 2014 can be sustained in light of the continuation of
both sequestration and a significantly greater rate setback than anyone could have expected.
Coming back to 2013, our original outlook did not factor in sequestration, which began on April 1st. It has the potential
to burden us in the range of $250 million to $300 million over the balance of 2013. We plan to absorb that within our
$5.25 to $5.50 per share earnings outlook range for this year, which keeps us oriented to the midpoint of that range for
now. And as always, we are committed to delivering to the absolute best of our abilities for you.
Our balance sheet is strong; our cash flows from operations are expected in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion this
year. We have already targeted returning up to $4 billion of that to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchase.
We expect the general narrative of UnitedHealth Group's story for 2014 to be largely the same as 2013. Our
commercial benefit businesses, international business, Medicaid and military businesses should all continue to perform
well. Medicare will likely experience market exits as well as in-market membership contraction as we reshape
Medicare networks and benefits to respond to the continuing underfunding of this program. We will continue to
manage operating costs and improve both service and productivity for this program.
Optum will continue to grow and contribute more to our overall performance, as virtually every Optum business and
product line is growing and performing well and is expected to continue in that path. We remain optimistic about the
capacity and capability of our enterprise to serve society and to create the value for the people and customers we serve
as well as for the health system at large.
Despite the great attention paid to rules, regulations and political maneuvering in healthcare, we keep sight of the fact
that health care is about people, patients, individual consumers, physicians and other care professionals. If people are

served well with appropriate quality care provided in a respectful and compassionate manner at a cost that's reasonable,
and if the professionals who provide that healthcare are treated respectfully, then our healthcare system and our
enterprise will move forward.
UnitedHealth Group has been built as a living, evolving set of businesses focused on working, serving and innovating
on behalf of the people we serve in the communities where they live, putting capital to work to create a distinctive
return to investors while simultaneously advancing the healthcare system for a distinctive and constructive return to
society. Our strategy, market positions and consistent execution for customers differentiate us, and we are committed to
responding creatively and aggressively to these more intense headwinds.
Now we'll be happy to take your questions this morning. As always, please limit your questions to one per person.
Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ralph Giacobbe with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the conversion, maybe you can help us size
the headwind from an earnings standpoint? And then are there many more accounts this large that are still risk-based,
and any comment on sort of incremental appetite to shift ahead of 2014? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yeah, I think Jeff Alter will – the impact as we said was really negligible, but Jeff Alter
can really take you through this.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Yeah, I think it's important to keep in mind that this was a very unique case, a $1.1 million
fully-insured case is – I think it's probably the largest fully-insured case in the industry. It was fully insured for
decades, we've been partners with this municipality for a very long time, really because of regulatory constraints. And
the conversion shouldn't be seen as anything just playing out a decade-long process of putting this case into a
self-funded condition where most cases these sizes have always been. There aren't any – as you can imagine, a case this
size there really isn't any earnings headwind. It was a long three – almost 40-year relationship with this client. So, the
earnings are stable – is really just a plain funding conversion.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: And then what about on the smaller side?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Hi. This is Gail Boudreaux. Just to follow Jeff Alter's comments to the second part of
your question. Overall, actually our conversions to self-funded have been relatively consistent. There's been a
longstanding movement from fully insured to self-funded, but we did not – we have not seen any acceleration in that; to
your earlier question, it's been pretty stable.
<Q - Ralph Giacobbe>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Sarah James with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sarah James>: Thank you. Can you speak broadly about 2014 headwinds and tailwinds? I'm interested hearing
the growth in some of the unique businesses that United has, such as Optum and Amil, but also in the core U.S. risk
businesses, particularly given the incremental information that you've received since the last time we spoke on changes
to the risk coding calibration and counting rebasing for Medicare and provider contracting for exchanges with better
clarity now on the unit cost basis you'll be using?

<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. So, I think we'll parse between – a little bit between Optum and UnitedHealthcare;
I'll start out with Optum. And I think our focus in UnitedHealthcare really will be around – we will be restating
comments we made from our formal commentary about exchanges in Medicare. I think really Medicare is the principal
headwind on 2014. The rest of it I think we were trying to make it clear that our businesses are very strong, and our
growth is very strong, including Medicare. But Larry, do you want to start with Optum?
<A - Larry C. Renfro>: Sure. It's Larry Renfro. I think you're probably aware of the three-year business plan that we
put together last year. We call it One Optum. And we are – as we finished 2012, we were in a situation of pretty good
momentum that has carried forward in the first quarter. I think also what we're experiencing with what's going on with
rate cuts, there's obviously increased pressure in the market, and as a result, Optum is actually having a lot of
opportunities that's presenting itself to us. So, what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask three people. I'm going to start
with Bill Miller and go to Stan Dennis and then to Kathy Hopkins to talk about their individual businesses within
Optum, so you'll get a better flavor for everything.
<A - Bill Miller>: Thanks, Larry, and thanks, Sarah. This is Bill Miller. I would say on the behalf of OptumInsight,
Larry is right that a lot of the growth certainly is expected based on all the work that we did in 2012 establishing some
sustainable new levels of performance. But alongside of that, and particularly in Q1, these pressures that Larry spoke
about have showed up in Insight in two pretty simple ways: one in our payer market and provider market is anything
that our businesses do around operational performance quality and efficiency, anything where our clients are feeling
those pressures, those are opportunities that often flow to Optum. That's true in our payer market around things like
payment integrity, and in our provider market it often shows up in some of our efficiency businesses and revenue cycle
businesses.
The other thing I would stress that have been key areas of the growth as this environment with higher compliance
requirements, particularly in our payer business – our provider business, we're seeing the uptake of all of our
compliance businesses pretty dramatically over 2012, but also going into 2013 and we expect that trend to continue as
the heightened awareness about compliance is here to stay. So, that's where I would categorize our big growth areas.
There are others, but those are two critical ones, and I think they're brought on by some of the environment that both
Steve and Larry have discussed. Stan?
<A - Stan Dennis>: Thanks, Bill. Sarah, this is Stan Dennis, and I'm going to comment on the physician businesses
that are principally organized within collaborative care and specialty networks, and I'm going to then hand it out to
Kathy Hopkins and she's going to talk about our consumer-facing businesses.
So, we had a strong start to the year for this group. The Q1 performance is grounded in a solid plan that Larry referred
to. We created momentum coming into the quarter across all of our business units and we remain committed to its
execution. The results are driven principally by a healthy balance between growth and cost management discipline.
I can't point to one business that drove the results for the group, as all the business units across the group are
performing at the upper end of their range. Collaborative Care assets has a broad and growing footprint with solid
performance. In a measured way, we are integrating these practices, which is part of our simplification plan, in doing so
in a way that it adds value to improving care and affordability in the communities that we serve.
We have several lines of business in our specialty networks division, all with strong performance, and the performance
of our military reserve readiness business is solid as well. So, we had a strong start to the quarter. We have our head
down. We're going to continue to focus on executing on this plan, pivoting the growth, and as we do so, we believe
these businesses will continue to scale nicely and perform well. Kathy?
<A - Kathryn Hopkins>: Thank you, Stan. Good morning, this is Kathy Hopkins, and as Stan mentioned, I will speak
to Optum's consumer-facing businesses.
We're seeing strong demand for our care management financial and distribution services, and as Larry mentioned, we're
performing solidly against our three-year plan. We're enjoying the benefits of our cost management programs that we
put in place in the last year and expect these benefits to carry forward. We're also enjoying the benefits of scale and
simplification of many of our business lines. We remain focused on execution and continuing to further develop our

products and services that help consumers as they choose their benefits, navigate the healthcare system, and make good
decisions about their health.
These programs are being well received in the marketplace, and as Stan said, I don't think I can point any one aspect of
our business that contributes to be the driver, but we are really performing well across all aspects of our business.
<A>: Comment on Amil?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: [indiscernible] (25:45)
<A>: As from a [ph] PVN (25:50) perspective, we had a nice growth year in – over the last 12 months. We've grown a
little over a million members.
What I would say our value proposition remains strong; we've talked about it before in New York. Really it's all about
optimizing health outcomes and minimizing costs, and we do that by using our clinical engines and string together all
the pharmacies, the labs, and medical data, the behavioral data. Have appropriate interventions, again, to minimize
costs and optimize health outcomes. And that value proposition continues to resonate within the marketplace.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, pretty positive across the board, and then maybe, Gail, do you want to talk about
UnitedHealthcare, and maybe Dave at the end a comment on Amil?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Sure. Good morning, Sarah. Two questions I think you had embedded there; I'll
focus on exchanges and Medicare. First on the exchanges side, I think as Steve said in his opening comments, we don't
see the exchanges on the commercial side having a significant positive or negative impact in 2014. We do think that
there's still long-term growth opportunities in the exchanges, so we're still positive over the long-term. Overall, our
position on exchanges hasn't changed as we gave you a broad range at the last call.
As we think about the contracting side, again, I think I shared this last time – that we see the contracting based on a
market-by-market assessment, and the economics needed to participate effectively in that market in an exchange. So
those rates are going to vary from commercial to something less.
We've had a pretty long history of having value-based networks, and have been successful at that. And I would tell you
at this stage, our contracting for the exchange markets is going very well, so we feel positive about that.
Turning to Medicare, that is the most impactful headwind that we face heading into 2014. Again, I think in Steve's
opening comments, we think about a 4%-plus rate impact, plus the impact of sequestration, against the backdrop of a
3% trend in Medicare – that's an accumulated impact that is more significant than we would've expected.
So that is – we are in the process right now of doing right now of doing our bids. We're doing a market-by-market
assessment of what those imply by each of our markets. Again, it's part of the accumulated underfunding, but we do
feel we have a very strong Medicare business. And as part of that assessment, we will be using our clinical assets and
looking at optimizing our network to provide the broadest base support and consistent benefits for seniors, because
that's been part of what we've been looking to do.
So that would, I think, define the headwind in terms of Medicare for 2014.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So the rest of business lines all strong?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Yeah, and the other good point on that – the other businesses – I think as you saw in
our growth this year – really positive about how our products and services are tracking. We're really pleased to have
brought TRICARE on this year, and feel very positively about the growth trajectory that we see, not only this year, but
over the last several years.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And Amil?
<A - David S. Wichmann>: And, Sarah, it's Dave Wichmann on Amil. Thank you for your recognition of it. It's a very
strongly positioned enterprise in Brazil. The brand. The value proposition. From its own delivery components, its
strong service reputation, and the value that they provide to the various communities inside Brazil is, I believe,

unmatched.
Coupled with that are the market dynamics, which are such that they support meaningful growth in that market, similar
to what we're starting to see shape up here in 2013. So a combination of those two things should provide a good avenue
for both revenue and earnings growth in 2014 and beyond.
As we step into 2014 and into the future, we also see the potential to access meaningful new markets in Brazil that are
not – or are underserved by Amil today. In addition, we see a great opportunity to address services offerings. As you
might expect, there are very little capabilities to the extent that we see with Optum, and we see great opportunity for
that enterprise in the future.

<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Good morning. Thank you. Could you elaborate on two issues related to your
commentary on 2014. The collectability of the Medicaid premium tax. And when you're saying you don't expect
exchanges to impact your commercial business, are you including the potential impact of any margin compression in
small group, and can you address that potential issue, as well? Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure. So, Gail, do you want to discuss that, and then maybe Steve Nelson can talk about
Medicaid?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Sure. Let me start with the first question, which was around the tax on – insurance
tax on Medicaid.
So we've been in a constant dialogue with our state Medicaid directors around the impact of the tax, and we are
including that in our rate exhibits, as we talk to them. It's recognized as a cost to the program.
I think what's important there is Medicaid is a little bit different than commercial in that our rate negotiations occur not
just at a single point in time, but they're ongoing. So they occur at the beginning of the cycle, throughout the cycle. And
that's a pretty common occurrence.
It's early in the process with them. We are including them again in the rate exhibits, and we think that there's been a
positive dialogue about that.
In terms of the impact on exchanges, our assessment is that at this stage, just given the overall impact – not necessarily
commenting on margins and small group, but our overall participation in the exchanges – we have a very robust
product offering outside of the exchanges.
As I mentioned, one of the tools that we're using are to build value-based products. We've seen most of our small-group
growth in those products already, so we think we're very well positioned to also have a robust offering outside of the
exchange.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Steve, you want to add anything further?
<A - Steve Nelson>: Sure. Just one point. Hi. It's Steve Nelson. I wanted to just add to Gail's comments.
We have a very active and robust rate-advocacy process and are engaged continuously with the states. And as you
know, it's a challenging rate environment. But so far, as Gail mentioned, early – it's early in the year. But those
conversations seem to be effective and very productive.

<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: So my hearing that you don't expect an impact on small-group margins, because you've
got these value-based products and you think that you can convert people to them?
<A - Steve Nelson>: Yes. Yeah, I think that's right. Gail, do you want to...
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Sure. No, I think we have a whole portfolio of products, Christine. And I think we've
always had a strategy of offering employers a multitude of options. That's been pretty consistent at least over the last
four or five years.
And while there are different pressures, clearly it's a very competitive market in small group. We work really hard to
make sure that we put our clinical and network assets to work, to offer employers a broad range. But at this stage, we're
not commenting on margin specifically there.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And if you take a look at the growth that UnitedHealthcare has been able to achieve in the
commercial markets, it has been in the newer products. It has been in the wide variety of products. So I think that we've
been deployed in this posture for a few years now.
<Q - Christine M. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Matt Borsch with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Yes, I apologize if you mentioned this earlier, but can you – are you prepared to reiterate
your view of overall earnings growth for 2014?
And if you could – maybe a dovetail into that – what about Medicare advantage enrollment? Do you – directionally,
can you say if you think that's going to be up or down, based on everything that's changing?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I thought that in our prepared comments that we had addressed that. So maybe I
could restate a little bit for you, Matt.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Well, yeah. I'm sorry. I probably – I just missed it then. You did. Okay.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'll be happy to touch on it.
But we were comfortable last quarter with the overall 2014 earnings growth outlook, before the 2014 Medicare
Advantage rate actions were taken. So I think then, as you stand back and look at the basic overall funding in terms of
MA, it has been pressured the last couple of years, and is already absorbing ACA mandates in terms of rate reduction.
And then if you believe that sequestration would come on top of that, you would never have expected a beginning point
of an 8% net reduction in 2014 rates to occur.
And then when they – basically, as that process cleared and some relief was provided, you still stand back and look at a
net reduction of 4% or more, against an overall 3% cost trend in the program.
So taken together with the other pressures, that's really not sustainable funding in our view, and it will cause us to
reconsider our overall 2014 growth rate in this program. To evaluate market exits. To address benefits. To reshape our
networks in those markets. And that was not really the premise, as we basically lead into 2014 from a growth outlook
point of view.
So we are evaluating that, at this point, in time given the finalization of those programs.
Really on a market-by-market basis, to the extent there are actions that we can take to mitigate this continued program
and the underfunding, and assess whether 2014 can absorb that change and still grow earnings.

So our long-term view on Medicare is unchanged. We're very strong in terms of the advocacy of the program. The
underfunding has been a challenge. And we are reassessing [ph] net 2014 (36:22) based upon the rate actions that we're
taking. And that's why, as we discussed in the previous question, that really our focus, when you look at headwinds for
2014, is around Medicare.
<Q - Matthew R. Borsch>: Okay. I got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Yup.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Justin Lake with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the government side. Can you – two things. One, can
you tell us how much the Part D seasonality impacted the quarter versus the typical that you've previously seen because
of that shift in the enhanced plan?
And then you mentioned the pressure on Medicare margins due to rates. It's clear Medicare margins [ph] while (37:05)
they came down. MLR up this year. Going to do somewhat similar – you've got pressures in 2014.
You talked about a 3% to 5% margin. Can you tell us how – are you there yet? Are you close to it? Do you expect to be
there next year? Just to give us some idea on how to size that headwind going forward from Medicare.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Good morning, Justin. Dan Schumacher. So your first question with respect to the Part D
timing and the implications of that on the quarter.
As you look at it in the context of our overall UnitedHealth Group loss ratio, you can think of that in terms of about 50
to 100 basis-point impact to our overall group loss ratio in the quarter. Basically, our revenue recognition is being
shifted out later in the year, so it's a big impact in the first quarter, moderates in the second, and then it recovers in the
third and the fourth quarter.
With respect to the margin performance in our government programs, our target margin is in the 3% to 5% range. And
some years we perform in excess of that, and we are near that range now in our performance.
<Q - Justin Lake>: So overall, you feel like you're nearer that range now?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Yes.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Okay. And if I could just slip one other in on the recalibration. Can you give us an idea of what
you think that is?
I mean if I did the math right from what you said, you thought it was 8 before. Now it's 4. You got 5% back from the
SGR fix. Are you saying you think that's about a 100-basis-point headwind from the risk or recalibration to new model
there? Or do you think it's more or less than that?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No, I think it's more than that, Justin. Substantially more, which is why we're commenting
on it.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Yes.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Yes, I think, Justin, as we look at the impact of that across the industry, we would size the
recalibration more on the order of magnitude of around a 2.5% impact.

<Q - Justin Lake>: And I would assume it's higher on maybe HMO plans that code better, have higher acuity. Could it
– I've heard industry experts say it could be as much as 500 basis points for a real good, IPA-based HMO, versus
maybe even less than 250 for a PPO that's maybe less well-coded? I mean is that about right?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I'm not going to comment on specific product offerings. But I will tell you, you're
right. There is certainly variation as you look across products and geographies in terms of the impact of recalibration.
But not likely the order of magnitude you're talking about.
<Q - Justin Lake>: Okay. So not as wide a spread. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Good question. Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from A.J. Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - A. J. Rice>: Hi. Thanks, everyone. Maybe just to take a minute to talk about the OptumRx situation. Have you
sized the cost that you're incurring this year to transition that in-house? And does that spread evenly over the course of
the year? And is there any early commentary on the selling season for them, and what that looks like?
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Well, I would say a couple of things.
So first of all, how's the transition going? We migrated 400,000 – on the first of the year, 400,000 members converted.
We actually also added 500,000 new members to the platform at the beginning of the year.
On 4/1, we just added 2 million members. So we've migrated three million members so far.
From a run-rate standpoint, it will be $200 million in operating profit at a run-rate basis. We still have some ramp-up
costs and development costs in 2013. We haven't specifically sized those externally yet, but we'll – that's really where
we sit.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think you'll likely – that was Dirk McMahon, by the way. And you'll likely carry those
into the third quarter, as you go through that. And then they'll start to peel down in the fourth quarter and into 2014.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: Yeah, that's the important point. We have development and ramp-up of personnel costs
throughout the first half of the year. And as Steve said, they'll peel down. And we'll hit our full run-rate in 2014.
<Q - A. J. Rice>: Okay. Thanks. Any comment about the selling season so far. I know we are still a little early.
<A - Dirk McMahon>: We've had some – we've sold some cases already, of course. What I would say is our proposal
volume is up. It is a little bit early. We've seen an increase in proposals over last year. I guess that's all I'll comment at
this point.
<Q - A. J. Rice>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Chris Rigg with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Rigg>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the revised
commercial MLR guidance. I want to make sure – is the 80-basis-point decline entirely due to the risk-to-ASO
conversion?

Page 12 of 20
And then with regards to the quarter specifically, year-to-year, the MLR was down 40 bips. We don't have the
prior-year development by segment. I'm just trying to get a sense for – one, in the change of guidance, is that all related
to conversion? And two, what would the MLR have been without the conversion in the quarter? Thanks.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Chris, good morning. It's Dan Schumacher.
So with respect to the commercial loss ratio and the impact of the funding conversion, it was around 80 basis points in
the quarter and on the full year. So that's why we've revised our full-year medical-care ratio guidance to 81.2% plus or
minus 50 basis points. So down 80 basis points from our Investor Day guidance.
As you look at the influencing factors year-over-year and the commercial loss ratio, certainly that played a meaningful
role in it. We also had the absence of leap year, which is more pronounced in the commercial business. And then
pushing the other way would be the change in development as well as the large rebate true-up that we recognized in the
first quarter of 2012.
So those are the major impacts in the commercial loss ratio in the quarter.
<Q - Chris Rigg>: Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Thank you. Next question?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - David H. Windley>: Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to stick with commercial loss ratio. A couple of
hospitals have come out and talked about low volumes in the first quarter – lower than they expected, anyway. Would
you say that they were more in line with what you expected? Or is it too early to see enough development in the claims
to reflect those low volumes in the first quarter?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Good morning, Dave. Dan Schumacher again. As we look at our medical-cost performance
in the quarter, we were very pleased with it, and it paced out as we expected.
So as you look at both the composition of it from the unit cost and utilization perspective, as well as the elements by
cost category, we're not seeing any meaningful change in that from what we pointed out in Investor Day.
<Q - David H. Windley>: So your cost-trend guidance and the buckets within that guidance are essentially
unchanged? Do I understand that correctly?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Correct.
<Q - David H. Windley>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Dan Schumacher>: And we really aren't necessarily standing on claims. We have good visibility with respect to
– particularly inpatient settings and so forth.
So again, unchanged, but we are not sitting and waiting for claims data. That's the only thing I'd like to correct to that.
<Q - David H. Windley>: Okay. Got it.

Page 13 of 20
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So coming to the quarter, you've talked a lot about the headwinds
for the next year. I'm trying to get an understanding of what is your strategy for 2013 and 2014 on the share versus
margin trade-off in 2013? And how that might play out in 2014 -
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I didn't hear this clearly. Could you just restate it again?
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Yes. So the notion of the share versus margin trade-off between commercial versus the
government businesses. You've expanded margins in commercial. I understand it's largely leap year and MLR true-up
and all that. But the surveys are showing that you and other companies are pricing up in commercial. So you're
certainly moving toward margin over share.
If you look at Medicare on the other hand, Part D, you came out with a $15 product on Part D. You've had outsized
share gains in Part D. Outsized share gains in MA.
And what is your target margin? And why should it be 3% to 5% in Medicare when, with an 85% MLR and the MLR
floor reg, you can do better than that at a 10% SG&A?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, that's a very good question, but I also would maybe level-set this a little bit.
We try to keep our pricing and our approaches to the marketplace in a consistent, stable approach year to year. So
pricing essentially to our costs. Trying to innovate and advance a variety of products to meet the different needs of the
marketplace.
So it is maybe more broad and more balanced than your question suggests. And we are out to optimize the performance
of our business and the performance of our margins no matter what the circumstances are in the context of maintaining
sustainable products and sustainable offerings in the marketplace.
And I agree with your point that we should be able to get above target margins at full-scale and at full operating
performance in mature markets, and I think in many respects, we do that both in the commercial and Medicare sectors.
And now after that kind of commercial announcement, I'll hand this over to Gail and Jeff and so forth to respond to the
pricing. Jeff?
<A - Jeff Alter>: Ana, good morning; it's Jeff Alter. I think Steve said it well. We have a very long philosophy around
commercial pricing which is we price to our forward cost trend and really don't play too many games around that. And
that has served us well over the years, and we believe it will continue to serve as well and maybe even serve us in a
much better way as we get into the 2014 and 2015 timeframe. So, I don't think we really are discussing a trade-off. We
just – we have a disciplined pricing methodology that has served us well and we continue to employ that as we go
forward.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And while we always have to pay attention to it, the fact is we've had very steady
consistent growth in both self-funded and actually on a relatively basis, market share gains in the risk-based because
there's a level of contraction in that marketplace and maintaining margin. And then on the Medicare side?
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Well, I think we shared – I mean, the issue on Medicare as we've shared on this call
is really the underfunding of the program. And we work very hard on both the clinical side as well as the network
optimization, and then finally our cost structure, that's been an area of focus. So, as I think about all of our government
programs and our target margins there, we work to be extremely efficient while improving service of the operating
costs as a lever, and then our clinical programs are important, too, to delivering value to the beneficiaries.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And I'd just throw in that basically these are very well established, well penetrated
programs in the marketplace, almost 30% market share in Medicare Advantage. And the underfunding pressure is
really more intense in the Medicare Advantage product line. So, it's not like Medicare across the board, supplemental
offerings, Part D offerings are really different. It's the funding, the overall funding philosophies of the Medicare
Advantage platforms that are – that need to be strengthened.

<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: So, just one quick follow-up on that. On MA, as you're doing your product bids, which need to
be submitted in June, and all this underfunding you're alluding to in 2014, should we expect that you will be – as we're
modeling out 2014 that your margins will get better because you bid more conservatively at the expense of enrollment
growth, or will it go the other way in that you're willing to – in your optimization, you're willing to gain share and keep
losing margin?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Maybe I'll start out by saying first of all, it's like anything in healthcare, it's a
market-by-market proposition, which is why we need to be very thoughtful about how we go forward in this. In some
markets, we'll take actions that will be more conservative and more pulling back; in other markets, we may not feel
necessary to do that. It also brings in dynamics of network positioning and so forth. So, it is a much more multifaceted
than simply what our benefit will be in a particular market. And I think that's why it takes time and there isn't kind of a
single-gear response to your question that will price like X and calculate market share. Although I would say that based
on the funding level, you'd have to – we've been clear, we will be pulling back from markets. And so we don't expect
the growth in the MA product line in 2014 to be as robust, because of the actions we're going to have to take to, as your
point, preserve margin.
<Q - Ana A. Gupte>: Thanks. That's helpful.

And we'll go next to Scott Fidel with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thanks. I just wanted to stick on MA, and just interested if you can talk a little bit about
utilization trends observed so far in the new membership that you've added so far this year relative to the more mature
MA membership that you already have? And then maybe just touch on the lives that you've added in California,
particularly relative to some the PPO products that members were previously enrolled with competitors, and how you're
seeing the utilization trends in those members?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Dan or Jack?
<A - Dan Schumacher>: Sure. Good morning, Scott. Dan Schumacher. With respect to our utilization in MA, I will
tell you that it's pacing about as we expected. Certainly, our new growth tends to have a higher first-year loss ratio, and
that improves in the second year. And that improvement comes on the maturation of the revenue as we get more
complete diagnoses as well as our clinical programs begin to take hold and those results begin to emerge. So, from a
utilization perspective, it's pacing as we expected, but obviously our new growth comes with a higher loss ratio.
<A - Jack Larsen>: And I would say, Scott – Jack Larsen; good morning. The overall portfolio or profile, I guess, of
new membership we got was very much in keeping with our expectations. As you pointed out in your question, it's only
been two months, really, of development with these new members, and so far I don't think we're seeing anything
unanticipated.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, just interested if you could maybe give us some initial
comments just on the CalPERS contract that were announced? And then maybe just talk about some of the changes that
CalPERS might have made with the new structures that make you more comfortable about participating in CalPERS
risk business, given that historically when the public planned to participate it used to be a pretty volatile book of
business? Thanks.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Good morning. It's Jeff Alter. It's really hard for us to comment on CalPERS right now. We're
pleased. We thought we had a very strong offering for that RFP. We're pleased that we were selected as one of the four,
and we're actually in the second phase right now of negotiations. So, very hard for us to comment on that.
<Q - Scott J. Fidel>: Thank you.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: John Penshorn here. If we could please sustain to one question. I don't think we're going to
be able to get everybody in, and I really would like to get as many people able to address questions as possible.

And we'll take our next question from Carl McDonald with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carl R. McDonald>: Great. Thank you. I was hoping you could walk through the mechanics of sequestration
touching specifically on how much you're assuming you're going to be able to pass through providers and the hit you're
talking about? And how long you think it will take to fully offset the impacts? Or in other words on that last piece, just
getting to is it going to be as big of an impact in 2014 as you think it's going to be in 2013?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Sure.
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: Sure. Hi, Carl. It's Gail Boudreaux. So, as you know, sequestration results in a lower
reimbursement of 2% to our Medicare Advantage and Part D program. We've shared this before. We have some natural
hedges to that; in Steve's opening comments, he talked about the impact. Our goal, what we're going to be doing is we'll
be offsetting our reimbursement where our payments are tied, an index fee-for-service Medicare that will be offset, and
then our lower payments to capitated providers. Those that are not as tied to that we'll be working obviously to manage
through that as part of the overall program. But obviously, given the time to implement, that's why we've identified the
$250 million to $300 million impact in 2013.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And some programs don't have any Part D and...
<A - Gail Koziara Boudreaux>: And Part D doesn't have any in there. So, that's part of the issue.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: And we'll get more absorption as this goes on, we'll get this more absorbed into the
marketplace. So, the impact going forward should dissipate. Next question, please?

And we'll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. I don't want to belabor all the other points. I guess just a question on the
repurchases; I know we'll see it in the queue. But could you give us an update on maybe the monthly repurchase
numbers, and maybe more specifically how much was done after February 15th?
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Hi, Josh. It's Dave.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: This may be the first question we've ever been asked on monthly repurchase activity.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: It was an important quarter, I think.
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Well, as you – we repurchased about 9.9 million shares in the quarter. And as you would
expect, we try to repurchase – or our mechanisms are such that we repurchase more when the stock price is down. And
so, as it tailed off, our repurchase activity accelerated. I won't get into the specifics about what we purchased in the last
half of February or through March, but...
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But we're methodical.
<A - David S. Wichmann>: We're very methodical about what we do. And certainly as our stock price goes down,
we're more heavily into market.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Got it. But you guys have discretion on that, right? Based on your corporate outlook and things
like that. That's just not a mechanical calculation based on the stock prices?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's right. We do have discretion with respect to that.

As you recall, Josh, given the Amil transaction, we were trying to meet or to bring in a debt-over- debt-plus-equity at
35% by the end of the second quarter of the year. Overall, we said we do $2.5 billion to $3 billion of share repurchases.
So, we're edging up towards the upper end of that range for this year. And so, that obviously mathematically would
increase our repurchase activity for the balance of the year. So, we're on plan, and we are at the levels that we would
have anticipated for the quarter. We are regular and methodical in the marketplace. And I would say when we – what
changes is the pace of it. So, we pace it in terms of that, but we are basically at this on a regular basis. This is a
methodical program. The pacing of it changes. And that's all.
<Q - Joshua Raskin>: Okay. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Baker>: Yeah, I know you commented on the exchanges. I was just wondering in terms of that as you
continue to evaluate them, how much of a factor is it as it relates to some states now considering taking the Medicaid
expansion and running through the exchange? Is that a factor for you guys, or really not meaningful in light of the
broader picture?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I'll – maybe I'll have Steve Nelson comment on this, but the beauty of our diversified
model is that we basically cover all the markets. And we've said actually probably as much as two years ago when it
became clear that this kind of a marketplace channel would become established, that we really are covered on both
sides, from the Medicaid side and the commercial side. So...
<A - Steve Nelson>: Sure. Michael, it's Steve Nelson. States are evaluating a lot of different alternatives to the
struggling with how to cover their uninsured, bring down the cost of Medicaid program, so exchange is one alternative
that they're considering alongside a variety of things, and we're very engaged in those conversations with the states and
bring a lot of capabilities in there. The advantage is, as Steve mentioned, we have broad capabilities not just in the
Medicaid program but across all of our products and so, the exchange decision and conversation is one that is outside
of just Medicaid or commercial. So, let me just ask Jeff to comment on the exchange strategy. And with respect to
Nevada, I think it is one in particular that has required us to participate in the exchange as part of our Medicaid
contract.
<A - Jeff Alter>: Sure. Good morning. It's Jeff Alter. As we've said in the past, we're going to gauge our participation
based upon how we assess each one of those local markets, and I would say that part of that assessment is our
commercial teams working very closely with the Medicaid teams coming up with the value proposition for not just one
or the other but for both. And that is part of our decision-making process as we pace through market-by-market
decisions. I will reiterate though that as we said in the past, we believe that there's going to be some pacing with
exchanges, and it's not just a 2014 event. It is a market that will develop and mature and be part of the distribution of
small business as well as covering individuals and perhaps in some states in some markets, Medicaid population. And
as that market develops, we'll make those decisions together.

One of the things that I think the market is focused on – and appropriately as you have – is the issues around MA. But
some of the commentary and I think some the concern we're seeing is a perception that MA is the single either largest
or only growth driver in the business. Perhaps you could help us to put this in the appropriate perspective and deal with
the appropriate level of concern, which is, is it one component of growth, is it the only component of growth? Can you
parse out the growth for us that you're seeing; if not in 2014, then the year like 2012 or 2013 to help guide us in our
thinking about the potential impact of changes in MA versus the performance of the rest of the business?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think we tried to suggest that the performance of the rest of the businesses is really quite
strong; that the Optum businesses not only exceeded expectations for the quarter, the momentum is growing there, and
it wasn't in isolated Optum businesses. It was across the entire expanse of that portfolio of businesses and offering. And
we see them as a meaningful growth element and an increasingly growth element for us in 2014 and beyond, and that is
really unchanged. I think what we have been pleased with is how rapidly this has gotten traction and the substance of it,
how solid the business is maturing.
The Amil businesses is another platform that we think has significant potential and where we would be looking to
continue to align our combined capabilities and potentially continue to invest to build that to be an even more
meaningful platform going forward, 2014 and the years to come. And in the UnitedHealthcare businesses, just take a
look at the growth, which is why we came back to the 5 million over the last three years, and the broad base of it;
growth in every single offering, meaningful growth. We think market share gains across each of them, and it's not just a
current-year phenomenon; this is three years or more. And that doesn't even include the 3 million that we'll be reporting
next quarter on the TRICARE business.
So, the focus is to optimize those businesses across their expanse, and that was the whole purpose of the diversified
business model in the first place. And Medicare is one that is getting more than its share of attention because of the
funding posture that it's experiencing, and that one is really pretty much focused to Medicare Advantage. We will work
through that as well. It is just a more severe funding posture than we would have anticipated given all the elements that
have hit the Medicare Advantage program over the last year or so. So, does that put it into perspective?
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: It does. I guess what I was kind of hoping for was something more quantitative than that,
which might help us think through how much might be at risk. But I don't suppose I'm going to get that, am I?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Well, I think if you were going to get it, I would put it in – carefully put in the prepared
comments. So, what I did carefully put in there is that we are assessing this very seriously in terms of evaluating to
what extent we can overcome the headwinds of Medicare Advantage with all the other elements of our business and
produce growth in 2014, and that's our goal.
<Q - Sheryl R. Skolnick>: Excellent. Thanks very much.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: Next question, please.

Next we have Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: Great. Thanks. I want to stay on this MA side of things, because I'm still a bit confused
on a couple of points here. I think it really comes down maybe to expectations. It sounds like versus what we were
expecting anyway, the MA MLR was disappointing.
But when you talk about it, and the things that you highlight – as far as lack of development, as far as Part D
seasonality, as far as PPACA cuts – it sounds like all those things you actually highlighted last quarter, and so they
were all known things. Did you think that Q1 was in line as far as you feel on the MA side of things, and maybe this is
just a perception sight from our side of it? Or was Q1 a little bit weaker than you thought on MA particularly?
And then two, the comments about 2014, although I understand the rate for 2014 is not a good rate, it is more or less
what I think everyone thought it would be back in January. Obviously, we got hit with a worse proposal, and then it got

fixed back I think to where we all thought it was going to be.
So I'm really trying to understand why the tone has changed so much from the view about 2014 growing when to me
really the only thing that's changed in the MA reg is really the coding adjustment. Is the coding adjustment really that
big of an issue – as far as being the unexpected part of the final rule versus where we were before – to cause you to say,
yeah, MA, we're not going to be able to grow it? And maybe our whole earnings number is at risk for 2014?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: So, that's quite an involved question, but so let me see if I can provide a simpler response
and answer. We're very happy with our MA business; we have very good growth, we have very good products, we have
great positioning in the marketplace. It is perhaps affected by contrast to the prior-year quarter where we had
meaningful reserve development and never anticipated we were ever – we didn't anticipate it in the first quarter of 2012
to have that level of reserve development, we certainly didn't expect it to repeat in the first quarter here. So, I think the
health of our MA business is quite robust.
Our concerned is the forward-looking. That may be an expectation issue because when you take a look at all the
elements of – that have hit the funding experience of the MA program, I think the very significant factor was – in lieu
of that background starting out with a negative 8%, and then basically coming out with a final, which is in essence a
relatively negative 4%, maybe even a touch higher against the 3% overall trend, strikingly higher than – so, the year
before was 1.5% in that zone. That would have been more manageable.
So, it is really overcoming that funding posture going forward that then begins to cascade through a variety of things.
To respond to that, you need to think about benefit adjustments that are more dramatic than what we have typically
liked to manage in the marketplace, network adjustments that are more dramatic. And so, I think the difference is – I
know that some people were relieved that the SGR came through and that focus on that element, but when you stand
back and look at the total funding status of that program, it's a down 4%, and that is significant.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: And so that's not what you were – down 4% is what we were kind of assuming the
number would be if you throw in every – all in, but you're saying that your – when you made that comment before, you
were thinking maybe somewhere to where it's been the last couple of years, which is maybe down 1.5%?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: If you are thinking of supporting the program, if you think about that as perhaps the best
offering of Medicare in the marketplace, one that seniors have high satisfaction with and strong growth and strong
response and one that manages costs, the posturing of funding that is what we're taking – is what we're discussing.
<Q - Kevin Mark Fischbeck>: All right. Great. Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: I think it is an expectation gap.

And we'll take our next question from Steven Halper with Lazard Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve P. Halper>: As you look at the development of the state exchanges, understanding that you're being very
deliberate in pursuing those opportunities, can you update us on where you think the whole program stands? I know it's
a general question, but more specifically, the federal government looks like they're under increasing pressure to get this
thing done. And do you foresee any scenarios where the administration has to back off and say, we need another six
months or a year to get this done, and just your views on that.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: We really don't have any insight on that. We are presuming that these programs and these
capabilities will go into market as scheduled; that has been the posture throughout. And we are acting to be ready to
respond to those. So, we are not seeing or believing or suggesting anything to the contrary.
<Q - Steve P. Halper>: Thanks.
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: But we're presuming that it is going forward as planned and as scheduled.

We'll take our last question from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But can you just go over the
operating cash flow? It was fairly weak in the quarter, whether you expect that to reverse itself in the second quarter,
and what exactly caused the weaknesses this quarter?
<A - David S. Wichmann>: Hi, Peter. It's Dave Wichmann. Thanks for your question. The operating cash flows were
actually stronger this quarter than they were in the comparative quarter last year, and they came in line exactly as we
expected. The cash flows at UnitedHealth Group at least are seasonally down in the first and second quarters, and they
are stronger in the third and the fourth. The things that really affect that are the timing of our risk-adjustment payments,
which generally come in the third, and then also the Part D timing as an example. So, that's – we expect to follow pretty
much a pattern similar to last year. Operating cash flows for the year should be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6
billion, which is 1.3 times or more times net income.
<A - John S. Penshorn>: This is John Penshorn. Dave, I think last year we also had some timing differences around
some of those government receivables in the second quarter and they came in early. So, it may even be a little more
second-half biased. Is that fair?
<A - David S. Wichmann>: That's right.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Okay. And then you didn't change the guidance on your consolidated medical loss ratio. I
assume that's really just the offset of the sequestration versus the commercial account conversion? Is that correct?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: That's right, Peter.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Okay. And then you talked about recalibration being 250 basis points. Was that over two years,
or was that over one year?
<A - Stephen J. Hemsley>: No, that's one year. So, that's your three-part one-question limit, Peter. So, thank you very
much.
<Q - Peter H. Costa>: Thank you.
Stephen J. Hemsley
So, wrapping up our call today, I'd like to recap just a couple of points. Our enterprise is performing well. In the first
quarter, we delivered significant growth in people served, in market share, in revenue across all of our businesses and
internationally. UnitedHealthcare's commercial benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, military businesses, as well Amil all
continue to diversify and steadily grow. Optum's momentum is accelerating. As the market for health services expands,
and it's expanding we think at kind of exponential levels, we believe no other company has the positioning, the
resources, the people to take on the challenges of healthcare and succeed in this marketplace and in our mission.
So, thank you very much for joining us today. We'll see you next quarter.
