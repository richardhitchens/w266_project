I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who'll be reviewing our
recent performance and outlook and covering the information in our slide materials. As usual, after our prepared
remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported first quarter 2013 net income attributable to common stock of $648 million or $0.68 per share,
which compared with $764 million or $0.80 per share for first quarter of 2012. Our first quarter 2013 net income
attributable to common stock included charges totaling $50 million or $0.05 a share associated with debt
extinguishment costs for the termination of the acquisition bridge loan facilities following our successful permanent
financings and for costs associated with the pending transactions, the oil and gas transactions and the recently
completed transaction of the acquisition of a cobalt chemical refinery. Our first quarter 2013 interest expense also
included $17 million of additional interest related to the new debt that we issued in March, which we'll discuss in more
detail.
First quarter 2013 consolidated copper sales of 954 million pounds were higher than our previous estimate of 940
million pounds, primarily reflecting higher production and sales from Africa where we've just completed a second
phase expansion. Sales were also higher than first quarter sales of 827 million pounds because of higher production
from Indonesia and also the higher production from Africa.
Our first quarter 2013 gold sales of 214,000 ounces were slightly lower than the January 2013 estimate of 230,000
ounces. That primarily reflected the timing of shipments at quarter end. As expected, the gold sales were lower than
first quarter 2012 of 288,000 ounces, primarily because of anticipated lower grades in Indonesia.
Our first quarter 2013 consolidated molybdenum sales of 25 million pounds were higher than our January 2013
estimate of 23 million pounds and the year-ago quarter of 21 million pounds, primarily reflecting some stronger sales
volumes in the metallurgical and chemical sectors.
Our realized copper price during the quarter averaged $3.51 per pound compared with a realized price in the year-ago
quarter of $3.82 per pound. Our gold realizations in the first quarter of 2013 were $1,606 per ounce compared to $1,694
per ounce in last year's first quarter.
And molybdenum realized prices averaged $12.75 per pound in first quarter 2013 compared to $15.34 in the year-ago
period. As anticipated, our consolidated average unit net cash costs net of by-product credits averaged $1.57 per pound
were higher than unit net cash costs of $1.26 per pound in first quarter 2012, primarily reflecting lower by-product
credits. We generated operating cash flows during the first quarter of $831 million; that was net of $430 million in
working capital uses and capital expenditures during the first quarter totaled $805 million. We ended the quarter with
$10.1 billion in debt, total debt; that included $6.5 billion of notes that we issued in March 2013 in connection with the
pending acquisitions, and we ended the quarter with $9.6 billion in consolidated cash.
As previously reported, in December of last year, we announced definitive agreements to acquire Plains Exploration
and McMoRan Exploration in separate transactions. The completion of each transaction is subject to receipt of MMR
and PXP stockholder approval of their respective transaction. We were advised this morning that the SEC declared the
PXP filings to be effective which will enable the immediate filing and mailing of the proxies to Plains' stockholders.
We are completing the process of responding to comments from the SEC staff on the MMR filings and expect the
McMoRan filings to be declared effective shortly. We expect both transactions to close in the second quarter.
In connection with these transactions, we completed $10.5 billion in financings during the first quarter. We sold $6.5
billion of senior notes in four tranches in March and also entered into an agreement for a $4 billion bank term loan,
which will be funded at closing of the transactions. The weighted average interest rate of these financings approximates
3.1%, and we'll use the proceeds from the financings to fund the cash portion of the acquisitions and also for the
repayment of certain indebtedness of Plains and McMoRan. We ended the quarter we had no borrowings under our
$1.5 billion revolving credit facility. We also entered into an agreement with our banks to increase our credit facility to
$3 billion upon the completion of the pending acquisition of Plains. FCX currently has 950 million common shares
outstanding.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who'll be discussing our outlook and referring to the slide material.

Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning. Like all of you, we've been focused on the market, so over the past two weeks, last week, Red,
Kathleen and I met our team down in South America, Santiago at the annual CESCO meeting. Like LME in the fall,
this is a good opportunity to get together with industry, companies, traders, investors, financial people, and take a read
on the industry. We have been sensitive to and watching the build-up in inventories. The move down in CESCO was
concerns about global growth and increasing supply, and we've seen a significant drop in copper prices, $0.20 over the
past ten days or so. I think it's important to look back at history and remember that these short-term movements can get
accelerated by things like consumer buying patterns, material moving into and out of warehouses for inventories and
flows of investor funds. When times are good they accelerate things on the upside and they can accelerate things on the
downside.
As we look at the environment today, we walked away from the meetings in Chile with a lot of confidence in the long
term copper markets based on the fundamentals of the world's requirements for copper longer term and continuing
challenges of maintaining supplies from existing mines, and also of developing new sources of supply. So we continue
to run our business with a lot of confidence about a positive, longer-term copper markets, but it's in times like these
when we may be facing weak markets that the real strength of our company I think comes to the forefront. With our
long life reserves, our geographical diversity, our ability to produce large volumes profitably at low cost and generate
cash flows, we're financially strong and we'll talk more about this. Just the way we run our business from everything
from environmental responsibility to safety issues. We've got a great team and a great set of assets that allow us to
operate profitably during weak market conditions and then be there with those assets to make a lot of money as markets
improve, and we have confidence that they will.
The first quarter is again a reflection of just our team running the business in the way that we planned it. We had strong
operating performance. We saw productivity improvements at Grasberg over last year's first quarter and throughout
2012. By the end of this year, we'll be entering into higher grades as we – our mining to the lower ranges of the
Grasberg open pit, and that'll give us a run through 2016, that'll be very positive with continual limited waste
movement and access to higher grades.
We made good progress with our development projects. We really completed the project at Tenke now. We are
advancing the Morenci Mill expansion and we commenced construction at Cerro Verde. And during the quarter, we've
advanced our move towards our oil and gas acquisitions that Kathleen mentioned. We completed debt financing in very
favorable terms for the acquisition in a structure that allows us to delever and it gives us a broader access to growth
opportunities by investing here in the U.S. and adding assets to our portfolio that have complementary growth profiles
as well as cash flow generating characteristics.
On slide six, the details of what Kathleen reviewed to you and the only comment I'll make is, at the margins we were
affected by some shipping issues in the first quarter. You've read about the port issues in South America which delayed
certain shipments there, and of course, we recognize revenues and profits when shipments are made. We also had some
equipment issues at Grasberg, which reduced our copper and gold sales out of Grasberg. Our production at Grasberg
for gold was actually 235,000 ounces versus sales of 214,000 ounces. Of course that product is going to get shipped as
we go forward.
Page seven shows our operating cost structure and this is very consistent with what our guidance was going into it.
We'll be affected as we go into the rest of the year by the gold credit at Grasberg and the increase of guidance there
from $1.35 to $1.45 is strictly that impact, $0.10 a share by reducing the gold price assumption, and that'll – the gold
price will be whatever the gold price will be. Our cost structure is there. Now of course, if we go into some
environment of where global growth gets constrained as we've seen in the past, a lot of our costs are correlated to
copper prices and if copper prices go lower, we can expect cost to go lower as well.
When we look at the market, China of course remains the important demand driver and that was brought home last
week when we saw the market react to the Chinese GNP number coming in slightly below expectations. The

government of China continues to express confidence in meeting their targeted GNP growth for the year and as we're
doing business there we're certainly not seeing any diminishment in the demand for our copper concentrates that we
ship there and our other products. Chinese growth is likely to drop over time because the growth levels in the past were
extraordinarily high and unsustainable. But the economy has grown so much that when you look at the demand for
physical copper based on a larger economy even with slower growth rates in relation to what the industry can produce
longer term, it still indicates a very positive outlook for copper longer term.
In the U.S., growth is slow, of course, but we are seeing the copper industry benefit by a healthy automobile sector and
improvement in construction and wire demand for there, and our customers are relatively positive about their outlook.
Europe remains weak and as I said, we've been watching these global inventories; the exchange stocks as well as the
bonded warehouses in China and so forth grow. The market will work. Over time, the lower price will encourage
consumption, the inventories will work off, and so we look at the underlying economic numbers in China and the
world, think about the industry's challenges in producing supplies and feel confident about our long-term strategy.
We do have a business of where if we need to as we executed in 2008, 2009, and we're nowhere near that kind of
challenges right now, but we do have the ability of managing our capital expenditures, of lowering our production of
high-cost copper elements and being responsive to market conditions. Our copper development projects are very
attractive at even lower copper prices than we have now. The Morenci expansion is proceeding well and we have very
significant sulfide resource beyond this current expansion that we're learning more about and it gives us optimism
about future growth not only at Morenci but other mines in the U.S.
Cerro Verde, we've been successful in working with the local community and the government in a cooperative way of
proceeding with our expansion opportunities there. We've gotten our major permits. We began groundwork there and it
is underway. We have a very significant potential expansion at El Abra that will require some work because of the
challenges that all operators in Chile are facing from water and power issues. But it's a great resource. The world's
going to need to that resource I believe at some point, and we are progressing from the pre-feasibility stage to the
feasibility stage there.
We're operating effectively in the Congo and have not had disruptions from any of the issues you read about in the
paper recently. In some respects the government seems to be making progress in the Eastern provinces with its issues
there. We've basically completed our expansion and are going forward and we're proceeding effectively with our
underground development at Grasberg, prepare ourselves for the post-open pit era. These expansions give us highly
profitable economic growth prospects that we have clear line of sight visibility to achieving over the next three years,
growing our production by 1 billion pounds a year, and adding to our capacity in ways that are economic.
I mentioned the Morenci Mill expansion; I'm on page 11 now. To date, we have spent roughly a third of the capital
required there. We've increased our mining rate. We're expanding our mill, adding incremental production on a high
rate of return basis, and as I said, setting ourselves up for the opportunities for future growth there at that great mine.
At Cerro Verde, we're expanding the mill from 120,000 tons a day to 360,000 tons a day, and that would be the largest
concentrating mill operation in the world. Increasing the mining rate, doing this on a footprint that's established in an
area where we're established and operating and we worked well with the government of achieving a mutually
supportive way of having water for this because of the investments we're making in Arequipa wastewater system,
which gives us water for our project. So, so far we're making great strides with that and look forward to proceeding
with it.
And I mentioned, Tenke where we're adding tank house capacity and increasing production, those of you who've
followed us know the challenges we faced with our initial development project there that started in the spring of 2008.
Well this one is going on-time and on-budget.
In the first quarter, we set operating records for mining and milling rates and copper volumes. Our team there is
working very effectively and as I've said, we've had peaceful operations. In the last couple of days, there has been some
pronouncements out of the government about restricting exports of ores. We produce a finished product of copper. We
produce a product for cobalt there that involves in-country processing, so these restrictions do not apply to us if they

are implemented. Because of the level of cobalt production that we're achieving at Tenke and the prospects for future
growth, we kind of follow the model that our Climax molybdenum team has established in the past and executes now
under Dave's leadership of moving to give us downstream presence, and we completed this acquisition of this
processing facility in Finland. Our partners at Tenke, Lundin and Gecamines, the state-owned company of the DRC are
partners in this operation and we believe that this provides us the ability to maximize the value of our cobalt resource
over time by being involved in the market in a more dynamic and substantive way.
The Grasberg underground development has gone very well, even during the productivity issues we faced for mining
and milling operations resulting from the strike. Our team was able to stay on schedule for the development of the
Grasberg Block Cave and the nearby DMLZ mine, which is underneath and adjacent to the DOZ mine. Development
capital is being spent, progress is being made. The DMLZ mine is scheduled to start up in 2015 with full production of
80,000 tons a day in 2021, the Grasberg Block Cave startup in 2017 with 160,000 tons a day; that's 240,000 tons a day
of production from the underground using block cave mining, which we have been experienced with since early 1980s.
It's not new for us, it's not something that we have technology advances to make; we know what we're doing and feel
confident that we'll do it. It would be a very large, underground operation, high volumes, low cost and would allow us
to continue having Grasberg as a cornerstone asset of our company for years to come.
Our 2013 outlook remains as we have previously reported. I mentioned that this unit net cash cost that we're showing is
– really only reflects the fact that we're now using the lower gold price as our estimate for the rest of the year. That'll
vary and the effects will be that our team constantly reviews ways of reducing cost. In this business, there's always
inherent cost increases that you have to deal with, and so when you see us be able to maintain these cost levels, you're
showing the effects of a lot of work of our team in finding ways to offset the increasing cost for managing businesses
like ours and I'm really proud of Red and his team and Mark and our whole organization and what they're doing with
that.
At the end of the year, we showed $7 billion of operating cash flows at $3.65 copper – at $3.25 copper that is $5.5
billion, no real changes in the underlying numbers there, just the commodity prices and we continue to be highly
leveraged to copper prices. Each $0.10 change is $270 million.
Capital expenditures are essentially the same. We've reduced it, our outlook by $200 million for next year and moved
that out two years. As we reported at our last call, we are looking to have growing production profile over the next year
as these development projects come on stream. You can see that with the increase from 2012, 2013, 2014, and into
2015 and 2016, and that would generate substantial cash flows for us. Grasberg, you can see the effect that I mentioned
earlier, as we get into higher grades towards the latter part of 2013 and then we would be at higher gold production, 1.8
million ounces for 2014 and 2015, and on a very profitable basis.
The molybdenum sales reflect our expanded capacity at Climax. We're the market leader in this industry with great
resources, great cost structure, great downstream presence and the ability to manage our operations to be responsive to
the market requirements for molybdenum.
The year 2013 is a year in which we will be having increasing production as we go through the year. As I mentioned,
driven by the increased production at Tenke, but also the access to higher grades and higher volumes at Grasberg, and
that really kicks in at the fourth quarter, as you can see, where we would be going from 950 million pounds of copper
to basically 1.25 billion pounds of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold.
Our annual cash costs, which I've already referenced, are consistent with our earlier guidance, and the change reflects
the lower gold price. You can see at the bottom of the page the sales by region. Page 20 shows the impact over time of
our growth opportunities. You can see that we have strong cash flows at $3 copper; our operating cash flows are
roughly $5 billion. When we get our additional volumes in 2015, 2016 that would increase by 50%, and if copper were
to go back to $4 a pound, that would go from $8 billion to $17 billion, so you can see the really significant effects of
our growth projects coming into play.
The sensitivities, so that you can take your own view with respect to these commodity prices and input levels, are
presented for your use on Page 21. Exploration continues to be a hallmark of our company. You can see our exploration

is globally oriented; roughly 50% in the Americas, 25% in Africa and 20% in Indonesia. We do have a global
greenfield project, but most of our exploration spending is understanding the resources associated with our existing ore
bodies, the ability to expand on a brownfield basis with the significant opportunities we have. These aren't just add-ons
of small size, but to do significant expansion projects in areas of where we are already operating really makes it much
more efficient and much easier to execute in terms of permitting issues and community accepting issues, and that's
again the real strength of our company.
Capital expenditures, now we're looking at $4.4 billion in 2013 and 2014, and then as we complete our projects going
into 2015, we're showing a drop to $3.2 billion. We're continuing to study the next round of expansion opportunities.
That takes time and a lot of work, and we'll be reporting the progress on those as we go forward.
Now with our oil and gas transactions, very positive that we were able to get access to roughly $10 billion of financing
at average cost of 3%. I mean that just shows the markets that we're in. We elected to go ahead and put that in place
during the first quarter because markets were good, and it gets that issue settled. As Kathleen said, expect to close these
transactions in the second quarter and this gives us, in addition to all the great opportunities that we have in our mining
business and our exposure to copper in China through that mining business, an incremental opportunity for investment
and growth opportunities in the U.S. The assets that would be acquired through the Plains and McMoRan transaction
have strong, current cash flows with strong margins. Initially the cash flows will be driven by the oil production from
the Plains properties and for the next three years much of that production is protected from a price standpoint by a
hedge program.
Attractive volume growth profile that is almost remarkable how it fits in with our mining growth profile with very
significant exploration potential coming both through McMoRan all through the exploration program in the shallow
waters and onshore Gulf Coast region, and in its pioneering effort to drill to very large, attractive structures that have
not been drilled before but have the potential of achieving the kind of production that the industry is achieving in the
deep water, but doing it in a shallow water, onshore environment. Gives great exposure long term to the U.S. natural
gas business and then from Plains exploration, focused in large part in the deep water Gulf of Mexico where they
recently acquired some strategic and very attractive assets from BP during 2012. So what this will do is add assets that
are generating cash which will allow the oil and gas business to fund its capital expenditure and give our company an
expanded growth profile with the benefits of having our geographical profile enhanced by more business in the United
States and in a business that we understand at Freeport. Our management team, our Board's had long experience in the
oil and gas business and in a business where economics are complementary to those in the copper business.
Page 25 shows where the producing assets currently are. I mentioned the Gulf of Mexico deep water, Plains has very
attractive oil production in California that has an established production profile and good margins at today's oil prices
and a very long productive life. They have a very attractive position in the oil shale play in South Texas called Eagle
Ford. And then long range, along with the potential from McMoRan's exploration program, which at those depths, it is
drilling – it's targeting natural gas formations. Plains has a very attractive position in the Haynesville Shale gas play in
North Louisiana. So we've got near-term exposure to oil growth and oil revenues, longer-term exposure to exploration
and potential for the U.S. natural gas business and that adds an exciting and attractive asset mix to our company.
We factor in the oil business to our growth profile on Page 26, and you can see that this opportunity to increase our
cash flows and cash earnings by 50% continues to be reflected with the addition of these oil and gas assets, and the
opportunities to grow beyond that are really significant. If you look at the center column, the operating cash flow
number, which is net of cash taxes and cash interest, you see it ranging from $3 to $4 of copper prices, operating cash
flows based on today's level of operations from $8 billion to $11 billion growing to $12 billion to $16 billion, roughly a
50% increase based on our current outlook for growth. And beyond 2016, there is very exciting longer-term growth
profiles in the oil and gas assets as well as through our very large reserves and resources that are undeveloped in our
copper business. So, very complementary combination of assets and company with experienced management team and
exciting future.
Now, we are taking on significant debt. As a result of this, at closing we'll have roughly $20 billion of debt and we'll
have $4 billion of cash, and most of that cash is located at FCX offshore and will be spent to fund capital projects

during that period of time. Even though we're adding to our debt, we maintained our investment grade credit rating
from all three agencies and we were effectively able to finance this transaction as an investment grade issuer.
Now looking forward, if we look in the periods of 2013 to 2016, recognizing that because of our growth profile, a lot of
these excess cash flows are going to be generated in the 2015 and 2016 periods, if copper prices remain at $3 and we
use all of our excess cash flows funding today's capital expenditures, today's dividend levels, minority distribution
levels, we could reduce the $20 billion of debt down to $7.7 billion. And if copper is above $3.50, basically pay it all
off and that's what we used our funds for. We would plan to not pay off all of our debt because we believe an
appropriate amount of long term debt on our balance sheet is a good way to lever returns on equity, and so our current
thinking is to reduce debt to roughly one times EBITDA, or around the $12 billion level.
But, I think it's important as we think about issues relating to near term weak commodity price levels, to look at this
slide and think about just what kind of strength we have to deal with that. And that's not taking into account our
opportunities to manage our business through deferring capital, reducing cost and so forth. So we're very confident
about our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, to reduce debt, to invest in projects, to
continue our dividend and in the long run, to grow our business in ways that we can increase returns to shareholders
through higher dividends, perhaps stock buybacks.
On Page 29, we kind of take a look back over our shoulder and say, what has FCX done over the years? Through our
exploration we found the Grasberg. We developed the Tenke Fungurume project in DRC, when many were very
skeptical about our taking on those risks. We resourced the – we added resources through our exploration program that
Jim Bob and Rich Leveille and our exploration team focused on. We've had a real long history of being disciplined in a
way that we manage our finances. We successfully integrated the Phelps Dodge transaction where Freeport acquired a
company two and a half times its size, with a different culture, but we've all come together with a great team. Over time
we've had solid financial performance. You can see from our record of the way we run our business that we do things
in the right way. So, we are very positive about our ability to build shareholder values. Those of you who follow us
know that our officers and directors are investors in this company and we run this company with a view towards
building shareholder values.
So, we are very excited about where we are, where we're headed and our ability to manage through the time of
commodity price volatility and underlying all that is a long-term confidence in our future.
So with that, Jim Bob is here on the line, and he and I and Kathleen and Red, Dave are here to answer your questions.

coming up for renewal in September. I was wondering if, on the government side, if it's worth negotiating or coming
off a conclusion before the election next year, you think it's better to wait for the new government, just in case there is a
big change over there?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Sal, we've been working hard to advance our discussions with the government to
deal with its review of our contract of work and to get the process of the extension of our contract formally approved by
the government. As you know, our contract provides us rights to extend the contract on its existing terms beyond its
original term ending in 2021 to 2041. We believe it would be best for all of us, the government of Indonesia, the
province, the workforce and everyone to get these issues resolved as quickly as possible. And we have been working
towards that end with that goal.
The government officials have expressed a similar goal, and we've had productive discussions, but the process has not
been organized in a way that has led to a conclusion yet. We're continuing the discussions. I will tell you, we've made
progress in finding some mutual acceptable ground on a number of the issues. You are right, the election is – for the
President, is scheduled for next year. At this point, Indonesia is an established country with a democratically elected
government and so there is expected to be a continuity in the way the company operates and deals with investors like
ourselves. So we're going to continue to work to get this done as quickly as possible and recognizing the challenges of
getting decisions made as we get closer to the election.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: And how about on the labor side? Have you started working.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The labor side, okay. Excuse me, Sal. The labor side is – the union is now getting
organized. Under Indonesian law there has to be new CLA agreements, labor agreements, every two years and our
current contract expires this fall. The formal process of discussions begins May 1 and the initial process is one of
exchanging information and having interaction with the union leadership. And so the union and ourselves are getting
prepared for that. Union leaders, community leaders and others are all mentioning a goal of avoiding a strike this year
and that's certainly our objective, and we will begin that process formally on May 1.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Hi, guys. Two questions. One, as you look ahead beyond the pending merger, do you think –
are there any non-core assets in your current portfolio that you perhaps would be open to divest?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we over time always review assets, see what makes sense and what doesn't make
sense. At this point, we have not made any decisions to sell the assets. We like the mix that's there and so there is
nothing that's been decided yet to target any particular sales, but we will be working with our management team and
our board to assess what would make the best structure going forward.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. And then second and last, on Cerro Verde, could you talk a bit more about your capital
spending plans? In other words, so what are the major spending years, 2014 or 2015?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Well, Paretosh, this is Kathleen. The CapEx will be spent – now that we're in construction,
it'll be spent over the next 2013, 2014, 2015 kind of evenly, and we'll complete the project towards the end of 2015 or
early 2016 to get to the rates. But in terms of what's left to spend, I think you can assume it is split over those years
equally.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Hi. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Good morning, Oscar.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Richard, just wanted to first verify the number that you provided for the throughput in
Grasberg. You said 2015 for the DMLZ zone and then Grasberg. What were those numbers again, please?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, in rough terms, it would be a ramp-up of DOZ extension and the deep MLZ that
would end up achieving 80,000 tons per day. Now that's really the current capacity of the DOZ mine, but we are
moving to a resource that's deeper and adjacent to the DOZ mine, and fortunately the initial production from there
comes from a section that has very good grades, and so that will help us during the period that we're transitioning from
the open pit to the Grasberg Block Cave, which lies underneath the open pit. We currently expect to complete mining in
the open pit at the end of 2016 approximately and then over the next four years or so we would ramp that up to 160,000
tons per day. And that actually comes from two headings in the Block Cave and in some ways it will be like having
three mines that are currently comparable to what we're doing in the DOZ.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: And so basically the plan hasn't changed. Thank you for that. And then getting back to the
issues that the government and DRC put forward, or the comments that they had, could you just walk us through what
they're asking? My understanding is that they want higher value-added in the products leaving the country. You guys
are producing copper cathode, but you don't think that the hydroxide that you're producing in cobalt that presumably is
going to be exported to your new operations, will be affected by these changes. Can you just walk us through...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, Oscar. You know, one issue that the DRC looks at, and this was also an issue in
Indonesia which led to the 2009 mining law, is that for certain types of minerals, and in the DRC it applies to some
copper, people are exporting ores. They're just mining the ores and sending it to other countries for smelters and
sometimes it is small smelters in the DRC. A lot of ores were going to Zambia, and in Indonesia you saw nickel, tin,
ores going to Japan, and the countries say we want to see processing facilities in our country.
Now in the DRC, we produce copper cathodes through our SX/EW process, and that's a finished product. We produce
this intermediate product, which is a processed product, cobalt hydroxide, and with our move into the processing
facilities in Finland, we now have as a partner in that the Gécamines Mining Company, and so we are very comfortable
that we're not the target of these types of restrictions because of what we're doing there.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay, understood. Thanks a lot for the clarification.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, Oscar.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citigroup.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Great. Thanks and good morning. Rich, I think last quarter you guys had mentioned that in
Indonesia you were still finding some issues with the panels. And I'm wondering, it looks like from your guidance that
it's unfolding as planned. I just want to confirm that as you guys get kind of deeper in these panels that there isn't
anything particularly surprising coming out?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. If you look across all of our metrics, when we talk about productivity increase,
you can see a higher mine rate in the open pit. You see a higher mine rate in the DOZ underground mine, higher mill
rates, higher concentrate production. All those things are heading in the right direction. In the DOZ mine we are getting
to 60,000 tons to 70,000 tons a day. Our capacity is roughly 80,000 tons, so there's – every day there's issues that our
guys are dealing with, but there's nothing that's changing our outlook for continued progress. And that's what you're

seeing in our numbers.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay, great. And my second question is on the site production and delivery costs. The
guidance is still the same at $1.89, but there is some material movements across the region. So for example, in South
America your site production delivery costs are coming down quite a bit, while Africa is moving up. I was wondering if
you can comment on either what's happening maybe in those two that seem to have more material changes in the cost
outlook.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Brian, this is Kathleen. You're right. On a consolidated basis the $1.89 is similar to what we
had previously on a consolidated basis but there were some movements between the various regions in Africa. Our unit
costs are – we're estimating to be higher for the year and that's primarily a function of sulphuric acid costs. Purchased
sulphuric acid costs are higher than what we had previously modeled. As you are aware we're putting in a sulphuric
acid plant in 2015 that will enable us to reduce our acid cost but we are modeling higher purchased acid cost than what
we had previously.
In South America the decrease is related to some energy contracts, principally where we've had modeled some higher
energy costs in our plan and have achieved some better results so that's a factor in South America. We had some slight
increases in North America and Indonesia that offset, but net of all those things the consolidated number is $1.89 are
the same. And then really when you cut through it the big change was the gold by-product credit at Grasberg where we
were previously expecting something close to $1.95 of by-product credits and now we're down to $1.66, which works
out to $0.10 on a consolidated basis.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I just want to say, two weeks ago, as we do at the end of every quarter, Red had all of his
senior operating guys here for a meeting in the Americas, and I really want to compliment Red and his team for this
focus they have on really looking at cost. I mean it's one which is – it's a real challenge and you can see that throughout
the industry particularly as mines age and our mines in the America for the large part are older mines and so that means
issues keep coming up and this mining business is a tough, tough business as we can see by the problems that Bingham
Canyon is facing right now. But we've got a culture here of markets are markets and that's what at the end of the day
drives a lot of our profitability, but we're a commodities company and so the culture that we have of really looking for
cost in these older mines where it's not like a Grasberg and you can just breakthrough with these high grades is really
something that's built into everything we do, and Red and his guys do just a great job with it.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Maybe, Richard, a quick follow-up on that, on the cost side, it seems like we are finding that
on the mining, maybe less CapEx does seem to decline. At the same time, you've just got secular increases in the
industry because of grades and depleting mines, but more on and maybe the EPCM equipment, are you seeing any kind
of cost relief coming through as more and more of mining companies start to maybe rationalize some of the projects?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: You're seeing availability improve from contractors, from suppliers, from personnel in
the industry, and that's going to be a continuing factor as we see all these cutbacks that companies are making in their
capital spending and their operations. So the answer is yes. One of the really serious talks we had with our team is to
make sure we take advantage of it, and to look for opportunities to pick up people in areas that we're short in, to use
contractors more efficiently and take advantage of supplier costs whenever we can. We have great relationships in the
industry and so we'll be able to achieve those things. Those are all things at the margin, but things at the margin are
what ends up making a difference.
Heard a lot of talk in Chile, I mean, I'm sure you read the things about the competitiveness of mining in Chile right
now. Peru is in a similar situation in many respects versus mining in the U.S. and so these assets that came to us
through the Phelps Dodge transaction, increasingly look attractive.

Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
Company Name: Freeport-McMoran
Company Ticker: FCX US

<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Congratulations on the rise in the natural gas price. With the rise in the gas price, do you
think more U.S. energy acquisitions are still possible? I read that energy stocks fell with other commodity stocks even
though gas is higher, first question. Second question, would you hedge copper prices? Third question, how far out in
the CapEx planning horizon do have flexibility to reduce CapEx if copper prices were to keep falling? Would you look
at 2016, 2017 projects as opposed to 2014 spending?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Well, John.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Forgive me for being interested.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I don't even know how to respond to that. You ask good questions we're all interested.
John, we like the position that we have in the natural gas industry that'll come to us with the Plains and McMoRan
acquisition. Plains had a position, a significant position in the Haynesville Shale play, which because of its cost
structure is a play that's uneconomic at lower prices but becomes very attractive as prices rise. And so that is a good
position to have, and then with McMoRan, it has a very positive attributes in terms of its access to very large potential
production reservoirs that will unfold over time. And we think the timing of the way that the McMoRan story will
come into play, plus having the position in the Haynesville gives us a very attractive position in the natural gas business
and the oil business.
So, initially we're going to be focused on executing our financial plan, integrating the companies, of managing our debt
level to get it down. As we go forward, our management team and our board will have the opportunity to look for
investments over a broader set of assets, and look to where we can get the best returns. So, we're certainly, as we do in
the mining business, we'll be alert to all potential opportunities.
With respect to hedging copper, we fundamentally believe that we can manage price risk through the way we manage
our portfolio of assets, the way we've structured it, the way that we have the ability to deal with capital expenditures
like you talked about. We showed the ability to defer capital; if we had to we could do that again. We also have the
ability to manage our margins and our costs by the way we run certain of our operations. You may recall that at
Morenci in third quarter of 2008 we had unit operating costs that were nearly $2. Within four or five months we had
reduced it to $1.20. Now that reflected lower input costs, which if the copper price does ramp down, input costs are
going to be ramping down because of the way that the correlation between the economics between copper prices and
input costs, but we basically have a philosophy of managing price risk in the mining business through operating hedges
as opposed to financial hedges.
And with CapEx, you're right, if we have to we have the ability to defer CapEx going forward. The good thing about
our opportunities is that we really have the rights to do that. We're not compelled by contracts with the government and
so forth or other outside parties that force us to spend money at particular points in time, so that gives us flexibility on
how to manage costs.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen Securities.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Hi, everyone. Got a couple of questions here. The first one is how should we think about the
Cerro Verde output before the mill expansion comes online in 2016? I know the grades were lower in 2012 and output
was down year-on-year, but should we be building in further grade declines as we model the next couple of years?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Kathleen is taking a look through her book here to answer your question
specifically. I will say that that's all built into our numbers that we give you. I mean that as we give you volumes going
out for the next three years that factors in what we expect to produce at Cerro Verde.

<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah, Tony, it's Kathleen. We're showing slightly lower production in 2014 compared with
2013 at Cerro Verde. And then it starts to increase in late 2015 when we get the concentrator in place. So, we would
have had, and I think we have a slide that shows that, we would've had declines at Cerro Verde if we weren't doing this
expansion. We're still bringing on incremental volumes, but we were facing declines in grades if we didn't – and loss of
the oxide deposit as we go forward. So that's all reflected in our numbers that we've given you the outlook on.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Thanks, Kathleen. Is that decline, will it be of a similar magnitude to the decline we saw in
2012 or less than that as you're modeling right now?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: We're modeling about 10% lower in 2014.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: Okay. Okay. And then just a follow-up on DRC and appreciate all the commentary there, and
I was wondering, I know you've also got a labor expiry there as well, is there any potential here that the government
may look to try to tie in something along these lines with the cobalt hydroxide along with labor negotiations there? Is
that a risk do you think?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No. I don't see that as a risk at all. We have
great relationships with the workforce. We haven't had any sort of really significant issues. When they have issues that
are important to us we respond to them and the government has been very supportive. That's a country where people
really appreciate jobs and the government appreciates employment, so we haven't seen any attempts to try to tie in
labor relations with government policy issues, and in fact, Tony, I'm just real pleased with the way we've conducted
business there. The provincial government, the central government are all very supportive. Now having said that, the
government is constantly trying to extract money from us in terms of the way they interpret our contract and
regulations and that's an ongoing issue. But that's just a function of the status of the government. But our relationships
with leadership, its province and the central government have really improved dramatically over the past couple of
years.
<Q - Tony B. Rizzuto>: That's great insight, Richard. I appreciate that. And thanks, Kathleen, too.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Good morning. Just following a little but up on what Tony was talking about. Can I ask
the same question on El Abra because first quarter it looked really good, you did 90 million pounds, but my
understanding was as we transferred over, it was going down to a run rate of 300 million pounds over the next few
years. So, is it possible just to get the sort of profile on that, too?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. El Abra we are expecting in the 350 million pound range for this year and it is
similar next year. 2012 we had sales of 340 million pounds, so we're kind of in that range over the next few years.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: And will that be like sustainable long term, i.e., higher than original? I think originally
when we converted all over it was sort of more replacing at 300 million pounds you used to talk, but will it be higher
than that on a sustainable basis going forward now do you think?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We're going to try to get as much as we can. I mean that's just the way we are and I think
that's what we're reflecting in achieving these higher rates going forward. I think looking beyond that we ought to just
think about it in terms of replacing that 300 million pound level and we'll give you the outlook. Red, do you have any
comment on that?
<A - Harry M. Conger>: No. That's the level that we're at those. Those grades are consistent pretty much for the
Sulfolix project.

Your final question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered but I did want to ask about the dividend
policy. Can you definitively say that under no circumstance would you cut the $1.25 dividend? And that even if copper
and other commodity prices were to decline materially, you'll extend your debt pay down timeline and/or defer CapEx
before you'll trim the dividend? I'm noticing that the stock is yielding about 4.5% right now, which is its highest yield
in some time, which I think is compelling to a lot of current and prospective investors.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Garrett, we've been working around these commodity business for a very long time and
so to say, never, is not something that I will think about; never is just too strong a word. Now having said that, we have
confidence about our ability to maintain that dividend, we recognize that it is attractive to investors. When our board
made the decision to set it at that level, it was set at a level that was looked at in contemplation of lower commodity
prices than the $4 where it was when we set it and lower prices than where we are today. So we have a commitment to
it. I don't think any natural resource company can say definitively that you never do it because we can all look back in
history and see where companies have all had to make adjustments for difficult scenarios, but we do have a confidence
and a commitment to it.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Sure. I mean it seems like the dividend is well covered even at much lower commodity
prices so.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It is that and that's the way we looked at it when we set it at that level.
<Q - Garrett S. Nelson>: Okay. Thanks, very much.
