I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Patty. And good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.
I am pleased to report that we are off to a solid start in 2011 with strong growth in the first quarter. Net revenue for the
first quarter reached $877 million. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased 12% to $112 million, or $0.89
per share. And adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased 9% to $216 million. These results reflect net revenue
growth of 10% in our Global Generics division and 6% in our Global Brands division; and strong profitability with
adjusted Generic and Brand gross margins of 51.8% and 81.6% respectively. R&D investment grew over 25%; and we
generated strong cash from operations of $232 million in the quarter.
I would now like to highlight some of our achievements thus far in 2011. In our Global Generics business we received
FDA approval for two new products and now have more than 130 ANDAs filed at the FDA and a significant number of
applications globally. We disclosed four new patent challenges, including OxyContin, where we believe we were first
to file on several strengths. We also made preparations to launch generic version of Concerta and we will launch that
product on Monday.
In our Global Brands business in April, we saw the publication of the positive PROCHIEVE Phase III Pregnant study
results in the White Journal. As was published, PROCHIEVE lowered the rate of pre-term birth in women with a short
cervix by 45% before 33 weeks of gestation, which was the primary end point of the study. The results also showed a
significant reduction in the rate of pre-term births at two other important end points: before 28 and 35 weeks of
gestation. The published data also showed strong trends favoring PROCHIEVE in terms of neonatal safety outcomes.
As announced last night, Columbia, working with us, filed the NDA for PROCHIEVE. And should the filing be
accepted under expedited FDA review, we could receive FDA action before the end of 2011.
We also prepared for the launch of our new oral contraceptive, which will occur in just a few days at the ACOG
meeting. The product offers the popular 24/4 dosing regimen, and we have a unique marketing program, which will
benefit a number of women's charities.

Received FDA approval during the first quarter for our value brand product Nulecit, the generic version of Ferrlecit.
We have begun marketing the product in our Global Brands division. Unfortunately, the market for this product has
seen unusual competitive behavior and intense price erosion, so the revenue opportunity is not what it was a year ago.
As a reminder, Nulecit was never expected to be a significant contributor to Brand profitability this year.
We saw lower year-over-year and sequential revenue for our ANDA Distribution business due to a lower number of
third party generic launches. That said we saw expanded gross margins in our ANDA Distribution business by over 4
percentage points year-over-year. ANDA continues to be an important contributor for Watson and will play an
important part in the launches of our generic versions of Concerta and Lipitor in 2011.
Finally, we ended the quarter in excellent financial condition with $515 million in cash and marketable securities and a
debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of below 1.2 times.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd and he can take us through some more financial results. Todd?
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone.
We're very pleased with our first quarter financial performance. We saw strong year-over-year earnings growth and
operating cash flow. All in all, it was a great start to the year.
I will now review our first quarter results on a consolidated and divisional basis.
Net revenues were $877 million, an increase of 2% over the prior year period, reflecting strong revenue growth in our
Global Generics and Global Brands divisions, offset by lower revenue at our ANDA Distribution business. Net
revenues for our Global Generics division were $600 million, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Our U.S. business
results were strong as a result of stable pricing, higher sales of our extended release products, and the launch of new
products including Zarah, our generic version of Yasmin.
Sales of extended release products were $183.6 million, up 33%. Oral contraceptive sales were up 5% to $93.8 million
due to the launch of Zarah, offset by some erosion in our base OC franchise.
First quarter international net revenue was $108.7 million, down 2% from the prior year as lower pricing in key
markets offset the impact of higher unit sales. Global Generics' other revenue was $15.1 million, up $5.4 million
year-over-year due to a settlement of a long-standing commercial dispute. The settlement of $7.4 million has been
excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Adjusted gross margin for the Global Generics division was 51.8%, 1.6 percentage points higher than last year as a
result of increased sales of higher margin, extended release products.
Moving to the Global Brands division, net revenue was $96.9 million, up 6% from the prior year period. The increase
reflects higher sales of RAPAFLO, Androderm, GELNIQUE and the addition of CRINONE.
Global Brands adjusted gross margin was 81.6% percent, up 8.7 percentage points from 72.9% in the first quarter of
last year as a result of favorable product mix. For the full year, we now expect our Global Brands adjusted gross margin
to be at the high end of our previous forecast range as a result of lower anticipated sales of Nulecit.
Finally, net revenue from our Distribution segment was $179.5 million down 19% from the prior year period as a result
of fewer third party product launches in the quarter. Distribution segment adjusted gross margin was 17.2% up 4.1%
from last year as a result of lower chain sales in the current year quarter.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses, consolidated R&D for the first quarter was $74.3 million up 25% over the
prior year period as a result of increases in both our Generic and Brand businesses. Global Generics' R&D increased
$4.5 million, includes $4.5 million of costs related to the closure of our California and Australia R&D facilities. Our
Global Brands R&D includes $4.4 million in costs related to the revaluation of a contingent liability related to the

progesterone business acquired from Columbia Labs.
SG&A for the first quarter was $164.8 million, an increase of $12.8 million over the prior-year period. The increase
reflects higher international SG&A expenses and an increase in our Brand selling and marketing expenses due to
increased prelaunch activities in support of our upcoming launch of our new branded oral contraceptive. Amortization
for the first quarter was $56.6 million, up from $39 million last year, reflecting higher amortization of intangible assets
in our international business as a result of product launches and higher amortization rates.
Our international tax rate, or excuse me, our income tax rate on a GAAP basis was 48% in the first quarter, reflecting
certain international losses and impairment charges for which no tax benefit was recognized. On a non-GAAP basis,
our income tax rate was 36% in the first quarter, consistent with prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes
amortization impairment charges and other charges as detailed in Table 4 of our earnings press release, earnings for the
first quarter were $0.89 per share, up 10% from $0.81 per share in the prior-year quarter. GAAP fully diluted EPS for
the quarter was $0.36.
Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $215.9 million, up 9% compared with the prior-year period. Cash flow
from operations for the first quarter was very strong at $232 million. We ended the quarter with $515 million in cash
and marketable securities. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was just below 1.2 times and our adjusted capital ratio
improved to 23%.
I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. Watson's beginning 2011 with strong financial
results and the ability to continue to make investments in growth during the year.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2011 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd.
Now, I'd like to provide you with an update on the 2011 forecast. Our estimate for full-year net revenue remains at
approximately $4.2 billion. We now expect our Global Generics segment revenue to be up slightly to between $2.9
billion and $3.1 billion.
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business, we continue to assume we will see some additional
competition on our generic Toprol and our generic oral contraceptive franchise in 2011. The impact of this competition
was modeled in throughout the remainder of the year. Our U.S. Generics forecast includes contributions from new
launches of generic Concerta, generic Lipitor and a small contribution from Paragraph IV patent challenges.
On the Brand side of the business, we now expect net revenue to be between $445 million and $465 million for the
year, reflecting on the positive side continued growth of RAPAFLO, GELNIQUE, CRINONE, Androderm and ella, the
launch of our new OC and some amount of PROCHIEVE sales late in the year. The reduction in the forecast simply
reflects much lower than anticipated revenue from Nulecit due to the market conditions previously described.
With the ANDA Distribution business we now anticipate revenue to be down from the original forecast and be between
$770 and $800 million. This reduction is the result of fewer than expected third-party product launches. As a reminder,
sales from two of the largest generic product launches in 2011, Concerta and Lipitor, will not be included because they
will be launched by Watson. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $950 million to $1 billion and non-GAAP EPS in the
range of $3.95 and $4.20.
In summary, we had a very solid beginning to 2011 with strong results in the first quarter. We continue to be focused
on driving shareholder value by executing on the opportunities that we have for 2011, and over the longer term by
utilizing our strong balance sheet to fund investments for additional growth and expansion in all of our integrated
businesses.

Lastly, our positive results would not be possible without the efforts of our employees, so I'd like to thank all of our
Watson employees around the globe for their continued support. With that, I'll turn the call back to Patty for questions
and answers.
Patricia Eisenhaur
Thank you, Paul. And Darla, we can open up the call now for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Amsellem from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Hey, thanks. Just a couple. Quick question on the debt; what is your goal on where you
would want the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to get to in the next 12 months or so? And what's your appetite for a nearer-term
bump in the ratio if you saw an attractive acquisition opportunity? And where could you see taking the ratio to in that
context?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, David, we've been – debt is just a factor of paying down various obligations as they come
due, of course. Our current long-term debt of about $850 million we'll probably keep on the books for some time. We
don't have any sort of plans to pay that off, but we have some shorter-term debt that we expect to pay off in due course.
As to longer-term appetite for debt, we've talked about, and talked with rating agencies about, 3.5 times
debt-to-EBITDA ratio as something that we'd like to stay at or below. We've talked about getting over that if the right
opportunity presented itself and then we'd try to de-lever as quickly as possible. Of course, that will all depend on
having the right opportunities present themselves.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. And then a quick question on Nulecit. I know that your expectations are muted. But
there was a recent suspension of manufacturing and distribution from the competitor product, Venofer. Any thoughts
on how you believe that could impact Nulecit? Do you expect a temporary bump in demand, and does that change your
view at least in the near term and what that product can do?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think we're all sort of waiting to see what will happen with the Venofer product. There's
been sort of conflicting reports about the availability of product and how many manufacturing sites there might be for
the product. But as of now, we stand ready to fill whatever need is presented in the marketplace, and we'll continue to
work with customers to try to get Nulecit into as many customers as possible. But I think it's just a little too early to tell
what Nulecit might do over the year and how long Venofer may have its issues.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. And then one last quick one, if I may, on Lidoderm. I know it's in your 2013 growth
targets. I guess a broader question is do you think we'll see other filers beyond Myelin and how would you think about
that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'm sure other people have looked at the product. It's certainly a significant product, and
there are other people who have the ability to develop patches. So I would anticipate that we could see additional
competition or additional filers on Lidoderm. But as we're about a year or so ahead of Myelin in the process, so I like
our position right now where we sit.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay, great, thanks.

<Q - Marc Goodman MBA>: Yes. First question is on the gross margin in the Generics line. Todd, can you help us
understand what's going on behind the scenes? Obviously got a product mix shift. You've got a lot of work you're doing
with your supply initiative. Can you help us maybe carve out the difference, how much is really going on behind the
scenes on the global supply initiative, how much you're improving margins there, you know, if product mix was not
shifting? And then second question was on PROCHIEVE. What are your expectations for how ACOG is going to treat
recommending this new product and how this all plays out? Thanks.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Well, on your question on margins, the main driver for the quarter really was the higher
extended release sales, and those are at much higher – much higher than our average margin. As we've said in the past,
the supply chain initiative has contributed and continues to contribute to the gross margin, although we're not seeing as
significant benefit year-over-year in 2011 as we've seen in the past. So it's still contributing, but it's less than 1
percentage point of the year-over-year variance.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Fred, you want to take the PROCHIEVE question?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Marc, this is Fred Wilkinson. Obviously ACOG, the MSN Society and some of
the other groups around there will be critical factors on determining practice standards for utilizing TVUs, which is the
key entry to this product and then the general practice for how the product will be used. ACOG meeting is a national
meeting is next week. We have many meetings scheduled with both the national committees and the district
committees. There'll be at least three presentations at that meeting on the results of the study as well as some new
insight as to the value of conducting TVUs on all women that are pregnant. So this is going to be a critical issue for us,
and we've been working on it for about six months now and will continue to work on it until the time the product is
approved and then launched.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks, Marc.
<A - Patricia Eisenhaur>: Darla, next question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions; first on the international pricing. At the
analyst meeting earlier this year you had talked about the expectation that you see stabilization. Can you just give an
update on the trend there? For Lipitor, can you talk about what your assumptions are currently, and do you expect to
have any update on the potential for early entry in Lipitor? And then on PROCHIEVE, can you talk a little bit about the
reimbursement landscape as you see it and the first couple of months of launch with Medicaid reimbursement and
commercial? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Well, Siggi, why don't you handle this, the international piece?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: On the international front, let's just remind everybody that our international businesses
are about 20% of our overall business and half of that is Canada. Clearly in first quarter in Canada, the prices have
stabilized. We see much less price erosion in Canada than we have seen previously in first quarter.
On the three European markets, Germany, France and U.K., there is still a price erosion in those markets, especially in
France where we saw that earlier in the year. We are relatively small in these markets. We are number five and number
six in France and U.K. So it doesn't affect our overall result. I think what we have done, obviously, to adjust to that is
we have, as Todd explained in his talk, we are a little bit down on the international business. The reason is the price
erosion, but also we have done some pruning to focus on our bottom line, but there's a significant volume increase in
the products that we have kept on the market. But clearly, in France and Germany, there has been a price erosion in the
market. In the Nordics, as I mentioned at the Analyst Day, the prices have been much, much more stable.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Thanks, Siggi. And then I think on the Lipitor question, David, we have secured launch
quantity so we're ready to go at the earliest possible time and will be ready to go at the earliest possible time. We are
obviously watching closely Myelin's lawsuit against the FDA. I think there's a hearing tomorrow. We'll be watching, as
I said, watching closely and be ready to react to whatever happens.
For purposes of guidance and forecast, what we've done is we've left the Lipitor in the model and in our models for a
November, late November launch, with one competitor, and we assume that competitor will be Ranbaxy. Until there's a
change, we're not going to do anything on changing the model.
And then I guess Fred on PROCHIEVE?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yes. So on the PROCHIEVE reimbursement front, obviously there's two places.
We're working very aggressively with the insurance groups and the third-party reimbursers [ph] versus (23:42) the
drug. It does feel to us that the insurers are pretty well set up to reimburse for an important therapy like this as far as
both in the government sector and the third-party sector. The most important factor we're working on is making sure
the physicians get reimbursed for the use of TVUs.
So we're active on both fronts. We're having positive discussions with most of the insurers and have a clear plan to
have their selves all set up by the time we launch the product.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Just to follow up with that, Fred. What's the process just to get that, in terms of timing, to get
that physician reimbursement, say in the Medicaid channel?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Actually, for Medicaid, it could happen very rapidly. It could happen at launch
primarily because of the patient population where the drug is being used.
<Q - David G. Buck>: And do you expect the controversy with the competitive product? Actually, a different
indication but do you expect that to limit your ability to price in the market?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: I think it will make people pay a lot of attention to how we price, so there's
clearly a heightened awareness to some of the pricing practices of our competitors so, but I don't think it changes our
view on how we will go out. Obviously, we have a pricing study that's still fielded. It needed to be pulled back and put
back out again because of the unique pricing in the environment that came from [ph] McKenna (25:03). But we're
actively working on that and doing the analysis as we speak.
<Q - David G. Buck>: Right. Thank you.
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Your next question comes
from the line of Rich Silver for Barclay's Capital.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Richard B. Silver>: Good morning. First, on the financial side. How should we think about SG&A and R&D
spend for the remainder of the year in terms of sort of quarters? Or at least kind of a – just trending? And then second is
on Concerta pricing given that you're launching on Monday, can you give us any sense of what level of discounting
relative to brand?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'll start with the Concerta question and then we'll turn it back to Todd for SG&A. But on
the Concerta piece, we are – we don't normally disclose pricing, and we won't start that process now. But I think I've
said in the past, in the situation that's presented here where you're the single generic, you would assume that we would
price the product to – at the point where it would maximize utilization and profitability. So that number is probably in
the range of 40% off of the brand price. Somewhere in that range would be appropriate to use.

<A - R. Todd Joyce>: And then if you look at the rest of 2011 compared to the last three quarters of 2010, I think you
should expect roughly, on an adjusted basis, a roughly 10% to 12% increase year-over-year.
<Q - Richard B. Silver>: And that's, sorry, for what line?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: For both R&D and SG&A.
<Q - Richard B. Silver>: Okay. And then just on a sequential basis, the Brand sales decline, can you give us any sense
of what was behind that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, most of that was related to actually some of the smaller products, the more legacy
products, that have just kind of been on a slow, steady decline in units, although kind of offset a little bit by price.
Some of the other issues that were out there was Trelstar, because Trelstar's still being impacted by the negative pricing
that's going on by the LCA reimbursement process being revoked.

business, just following up on an earlier question. If we exclude Concerta and Lipitor, is this kind of 51% range we saw
in the quarter sustainable as we move through the rest of this year?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: I would say yes, but it's going to depend upon the level of competition we get on both
POTASSIUM and – POTASSIUM XR and Toprol. So we factored some competition in. We've also been a beneficiary
of some other companies' issues, manufacturing issues. And so we have taken some pricing here and there. And that
provided a benefit in the first quarter. And so it will depend upon how our competitors come back to market on some of
these products. So – but yeah, somewhere in that 50% range. If you exclude Lipitor and Concerta, I think we'd be very
close to that level of profitability.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Okay, great. And then just my follow-up question, can you just also talk about your
latest kind of U.S.-based business pricing assumption on the Generics side for this year? I think you mentioned some
competitor supply interruptions, but how has your view changed in terms of the relative health of the base business as
we go through this year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think we've been looking at, been saying that the base business has been at the high
single digits. I think now we're moving things more to the mid-single-digit range as price declines. We've seen a lot
more stability in pricing over the last few quarters and we continue to see that. As Todd mentioned, it will really sort of
depend on when competitors start coming back on some products and how they come back into those markets and what
their process is, and that will affect pricing probably most significantly.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Collins Stewart.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: Hi. First question I had was on CRINONE and PROCHIEVE. If you do get PROCHIEVE
approved and you want to increase your pricing there, would you keep CRINONE on the market, or would you take it
off? How should we think through that?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: I think it's a little early to describe what the strategies would be on the approval
of the product. Obviously we value the infertility business very highly; we're growing it nicely. We now own the

and we're going to stay at that business. We have a pricing study that's fielded; it's looking at a lot of different
alternatives and just really too early to comment on that.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: And then second question I had was just what are your thoughts on M&A and business
development for Watson going forward, and that do you assume anything in your long-term guidance for these
potential endeavors?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, the last question is the easiest one, the answer is, and that's no. We have not included any
income from any possible acquisitions for 2011, but we are actively looking at opportunities in our Brand, Biologic,
and Generics businesses and I would expect that you'll see us intensify our activity throughout the rest of the year. You
know, these deals take time and we hope to get some things done before the end of the year to improve our overall
Generics business, Brand business, and as I mentioned, Biologics business as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Thanks, good morning. With respect to Distribution segment performance in the quarter, and
understand it's not the sexiest part of the story, no offense to Al, but the underperformance is pretty substantial relative
to expectations, and I guess, you know, sort of the reduction in full-year guidance is pretty significant, particularly
considering when we last heard from you guys in terms of what your expectations were. So I'm wondering has there
been some sort of fundamental change in that business? Or it just seems unusual that there's such a large deviation.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, let me try to, I'll start and then Al, notwithstanding, you're our good-looking man, so
we'll – on the Distribution side of the business, I think there's two things that have affected the forecast. One is FDA
had slowed down approvals and sort of the lack of, we've been talking about the lack of new product launches. A lot of
that is the things that our competitors have faced. You know, as more and more competitors are facing issues, not
getting approvals, being on OAI status and the like, that directly affects the Distribution business.
I would anticipate that that's something that everyone in the Distribution segment is facing, just this lack of new
products, and that's what feeds the business. Al has the additional problem of, we mentioned before, of two of the
biggest launches, Lipitor and Concerta, will not be included in his numbers for the year, and so that's going to affect the
perceived performance, but of course he's a major part of our distribution strategy for those products. So he's sort of
swimming upstream a little bit with those two issues. Al, did you want to add anything to that?
<A - Albert Paonessa>: Yeah, I mean basically the biggest issue is the lack in new launches. We are kind of surprised
that there hasn't been a few unexpected launches that have come out. Usually it happens in the first quarter, maybe a
little bit in the second quarter, but it hasn't happened at all. First quarter was the worst quarter we've ever had for new
product launches going back to 2005 since I've kept track. So that's the big missing picture. When I look at my normal
retail independent business that's out there, my units are up, my customer base is up, and it's pretty consistent. So I'm
good there. It's just the chains are down and it's basically driven by the launches.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Okay. Thanks, Al. Maybe to just follow up on that real quickly. It definitely is a soft quarter in
terms of top line, but it's also a very strong quarter in terms of the margin performance, and I know that there's some
mention in the press release of sort of a light contribution from chain drug store sales in the quarter. Is that just an
anomaly?
<A - Albert Paonessa>: No. I mean, the margins are going to be up when it's your normal base business. You know,
the large launches that we do and that, it's to the warehousing chains, and the margins are lower on those types of
products. So the first quarter the margins were good; they were stable. We're seeing a little bit of competition right now

which normally will happen after you have a long drought without launches. You'll see more competition to the big
three and everybody else. So we're starting to see some stress in the top line number, but the manufacturers have been
working with us and basically our margins have remained steady. So, we're comfortable there. I'm really happy that I
have my independent base, and it's been consistent for quarter after quarter for about I'd say six quarters. So we're
comfortable where we are. I think it would be a totally different conversation right now had I just got two launches that
were significant. We wouldn't be even having this conversation.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: And one final question for Fred as well. With respect to PROCHIEVE, I know when you did the
original call announcing the positive results of the Phase III study, you talked about an addressable market at roughly
5% of singleton births. But then in sort of looking for the more detailed Phase III results that were published, seems
like there's a fairly large screening sample around 35,000 women. And I know that the estimated – or the eligible
women were about 2.3% of that population, so I'm wondering if you're still sort of thinking maybe that's just a sample
size effect or maybe the market is closer to what we saw in terms of the Phase III study.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: To me I think what you've got is the bookends. What occurred in the study, I
remember is in a study, so there were a whole lot of other factors that were involved in the inclusion-exclusion criteria
of those women before they even went to be screened. So I think you've got an abnormally low number in the 2.3%.
There have been two other published articles that are out there looking at short cervix, the size of cervixes, and I think
the range is somewhere in that 4% to 6% range of the marketplace that's below two centimeters. So that's a reasonable
position to be looking at. Now the burning issue that everybody's still trying to address is what kind of utilization may
happen above two centimeters. And I think that's part of the market research that's going on right now.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Pinkerton with SunTrust.
<Q - Frank H. Pinkerton MBA>: Hey. Great. First question. Can you speak broadly to once the Arrow acquisition
was completed there was a thesis that there was an over-filing of products we rolled onto other European countries?
Where does Watson stand with rolling that out and what countries can we expect next and is that still a significant
theme to expanding the international presence?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, Frank, it is. We've been working very hard at filing products that we've developed here
in the U.S., basically leveraging our U.S. portfolio across the globe. In Canada, we just launched our nicotine gum
product and we're doing quite nicely with it up there and we expect to be launching that throughout Europe. Australia is
also going to see some benefit and South Africa will see some benefit of our products. Also, Brazil will start seeing
launches of Watson products over the next few months. So we are rolling those out and that's a top priority and
continues to be a top priority for us this year and as well as next year. Siggi?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. I think also part of your question was, in the Arrow acquisition, was that Arrow
had marketing authorizations in countries where we are not commercially selling them today. That is still true and we
are still filing in these markets. We have significant numbers of marketing authorizations approved in countries like
Switzerland, Italy and Belgium, where we have no commercial operation. We are looking at our strategic options in
these markets. The experience in these markets is unique to have a significant portfolio before you kick off the cost of a
commercial operation. But this could be a benefit also going forward and we look at these markets when we file our
Watson portfolio today in Europe. So every time we file a product in Europe, we file in markets usually between 8 and
15 different markets even though our core markets in Europe is maybe 5 or 6.
<Q - Frank H. Pinkerton MBA>: Great. And then, thanks, as a follow-up, the oral contraceptive business. I know that
on the Investor Day you gave guidance for that to be down first half of the year, gross profit, and then second half of
the year, gross profit down even further. Has there been any change in your view on the competitive landscape there
with launches or competitors coming to market where that guidance in January may have been conservative? Thank

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi Greg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Hey. Good morning. Recognizing that Lipitor timing is what it is in your guidance, Paul, I have
to ask you, as a lawyer, what your personal legal view is on the chances of an accelerated launch. I know there's
precedent for AIP products getting approval but I'm not sure a judge has been asked to weigh in in this specific way
before. So I realize what your guidance is; let's put that aside. What's your personal view?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well...
<A - David A. Buchen>: I'm not sure I can let you answer that.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Really, the lawyer's diving across the phone. You know, Greg, it's always an uphill battle to
argue that the FDA has somehow misused its authority, and so I think it's going to be a tough, it'll be a tough fight from
Myelin to get this one done. Tomorrow, we'll see. We'll see how the hearing goes, but I think it's going to be a tough
battle.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: All right. Thanks for opining. And then my follow-up is on Venofer. Have you submitted an
ANDA on Venofer? Do you have a development program there? And lastly can you comment on how user fee
discussions are going or not going for the industry? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: On the Venofer question, the answer is no. Venofer and Nulecit I think are reasonably
interchangeable in the marketplace, so we don't see any real value in having a version of Venofer if we already have a
version of Ferrlecit.
On the user fee front, user fee discussions are going well. We continue to meet. The GPhA continues to meet with the
FDA task force that's working on user fees. We meet about every two weeks, and I think we've had three or four
meetings. I think there's another meeting coming up this week. You know, I think these things, they do take time. I
think we're pleased that the agency has listened to our concerns as an industry and is trying to address them, and we're
trying to help them find a way to fund the resources they need to deal with the backlog, deal with the ANDAs that are
out there, as well as dealing with the compliance issues and inspection processes and the challenges that they face,
trying to inspect thousands of manufacturing sites around the world. So I think – I'm optimistic that we'll get something
done this year.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.

week, and is there any sort of ballpark figure that you guys have targeted for a share in this market this year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Tim, to answer the first part of the question, Johnson & Johnson's been great, supplying
us product. We have no issues with that at all. We're ready to go on Monday. As far as market share, I'd say, as I
mentioned earlier, the pricing will be around 40% to 45% off the brand price I think is kind of the range I gave, and
that's sort of a traditional single player market. It could be a little bit bigger than that. But there is a link between the
price that we have and the total market penetration we're going to have, so we're trying to maximize both. So, you
know, I think you just need to factor that thought into your model when you think about doing Concerta.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay. And just one follow-up. You know, I remember when you guys talked about your deal with
J&J, that the margins would be tiered. And I guess now that we're to the launch, is there a potential that you could get a
higher margin this year or is it really, how does the tiering really work on the gross margins?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I think, Tim, what we said was that margins would increase over time, and then – they would
begin below our current Generic margins. And then they would sort of plateau at about our Generic margin.
And that's kind of the guidance we've given. And it would – it will occur over several quarters. So obviously, the first
quarters will be lower and then the later quarters will be higher.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Paul.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Thanks. Paul, just to clarify, when you talk about the price decrease on Concerta, are you
talking about an un-rebated product or off of the rebated, as we try to size the market?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: You mean, are you talking about the brand rebates or are you talking about...
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Yeah. So, when we're trying to – you're saying 40% to 45% off. Should we be looking at...?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Brand [ph] WAC (44:34) is what I'm talking about.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Fred, if you could help us understand – we don't, clearly don't
hear from the company that's introducing the product too often, but can you give us a sense of how [ph] KP (44:49) has
been on the second price cut in securing reimbursement? And should we think of that as some level of framework for
what you could be using as maybe a price top on PROCHIEVE? Or are these totally disparate?
I understand that they are different indications, but can you help us at least understand how they've been doing in
securing reimbursement, now that they've cut price this second time?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: I mean my understanding is that they are doing reasonably well with the
reimbursement issue. I think where they are struggling is the acceptance of the product now, because almost every
association and everybody involved in this has kind of come out with a negative position on it. And I think they've
positioned it so they could go back to the compounding product.
I don't know that I would use the [ph] McKenna (45:38) experience as an example in any way as to how Columbia will
be and Watson will be launching this product.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Now Fred, I know that it's again a different indication, but doesn't that concern you a bit – that
the standard of care is essentially going to still be secured to a certain extent from compounders? Doesn't that
potentially have some impact on your introduction?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: No, because you've got to remember 17P has been used for four or five years
now as a compounded product.

So – and we don't have that experience right now with Crinone. We've got a very unique delivery system that allows
you to use a bio-adhesive vaginal gel so that you get good, long extended release of the product vaginally, so you get
good local coverage. Very different than what they're doing with the compounded product and then what ended up
resulting as an improved product from the FDA. I don't think those experiences even mimic each other.
The other side is that we're in very different indications. I mean it is pre-term labor but ours is in short cervix, which is
a very measurable issue. Theirs is in a previous pre-term, which is really a patient history issue.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Okay. And then one last follow-up on Nulecit. Paul, I understand the conservatism of Watson,
and I know there's a lot of unknowns about the manufacturing and the supply, but our understanding is it's a couple
hundred million dollar plus product, Venofer. Maybe even more.
Any reason to believe – and understanding your pricing on Nulecit is fairly low, so that would limit that opportunity, if
you could go approach some of what Venofer has now – but is there any reason to believe that this couldn't be
substantial? I understand that you're trying to keep our expectations low.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'm going to let Fred handle this one.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yes. So actually I mean there were three things that really have affected this
market.
So the first is the fact that you've got a significant shift of the market share from Ferrlecit to other products. I mean it's
been cut almost into thirds since the time we turned it back over to Sanofi at the end of 2009. So the natural shift of
Ferrlecit to a generic Ferrlecit is a much smaller position.
The price is almost equally cut because we have everyone in the market is chasing price. And that actually was
occurring before we even brought the generic to the marketplace.
And the third is that we had an advantage at launch, which was we had a vial, and since then, Sanofi has launched a
vial of Ferrlecit, so it's – one of the advantages of the product we had has also gone away.
We're seeing actually everyone chase price. So the price on this from almost all the manufacturers in this category has
dramatically declined.
I think the glimmer of hope here is that there's a supply issue of Venofer, but we're watching that closely, and today, as
we talk to customers, everybody feels comfortable that the supply will stay intact.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Great. Thanks guys.

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Hi. Thanks very much. So my first question is on France. I was hoping that you could
maybe explain in some detail what's happening with respect to price erosion? I'm assuming that it's basically
competitors becoming more aggressive, launching new products into the market, taking price down, et cetera – that
that's the main driver, rather than the government. But if you could frame that and explain it, that would be helpful.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, it's Siggi here, David.
The situation in France was that there was a budget cut by the government, but that mainly had the effect on the
branded business in France. But you're absolutely right; the main price erosion in the generic market has been due to
competition by the companies there.

Obviously Teva and Ratiopharm have now merged, and they're a bigger competitor on Myelin, on [indiscernible]
(49:37) those are the three big companies and they're fighting extremely hard for top line in that market. And that leads
to discounts that are happening, which takes down the generic price.
So overall, there is a part of it which is the governmental budget issue, where they have introduced that they needed to
cut the overall healthcare budget in the pharmaceutical. But more for the generic industry, it has been the top-line
competition that has happened in the market.
Our response to that has been that we have focused more on, as I mentioned before, pruning our portfolio. We have
also looked the opportunity of lowering our costs. Our global operation initiative has really helped us enormously for
the product that is manufactured in-house, and we're taking more and more of our third-party products in-house to
allow us to compete in this market.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Okay, that's very helpful. And with respect to volumes in France, broadly speaking,
obviously you're paring back. But maybe you could just characterize whether there's decent growth in volume in France
or not.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: There is a decent growth. Let's remind ourselves that the general penetration in France
is still very low, especially if you compare it to Germany or U.K. Germany and U.K., we are talking about 70% to 80%
penetration, where in France we are talking about around 20%, maybe 20% plus.
So this is growing very fast now, because in every country where they need to cut the healthcare costs, the best way to
do that is to use more generics. And France is finding that formula pretty well at the moment.
So there is an increase in volume, and we see that very significantly on our product, both in the retail pharmacy side but
also in our hospital portfolio, there's much more usage of generics in France.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: That's very helpful. And a quick follow-up tidbit. With respect to the gross margin, Todd, is
there any way that you can characterize for us how much the Fentora inventory write-off impacted your cost of goods
line?
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Well, we had a very small Fentora write-off so it had very little impact on the gross margin in
the first quarter.

Your next question comes from Shibani Malhotra from RBC Capital.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi, guys. I've got a quick question on PROCHIEVE. Paul, can you – and Fred actually. Can
you talk about your expectations in terms of whether you think you can get a first round approval from the FDA and
whether you're expecting a final?
And then can you also clarify the P-value requirements and that these are actually just under 0.05 rather than 0.01,
which I think has caused some confusion with investors? And then I have a quick follow-up on OxyContin.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Well, we're very hopeful on a first-round approval. Watson's very hopeful that
the product will be accepted as a fast track with [ph] Unicycle (52:47).
So that's what we've applied for. That's – the discussions that Columbia had had with the agency were pointing in that
direction so we're very hopeful that would happen. Obviously, the results were very positive.
As we put in the press release and as I think Columbia has mentioned before, really the submission is really based on
two clinical programs. There was a previous trial that was done on women with a history of preterm, of which a small –
a subset of that was looking at short cervix. And that's the foundation for the second part of the data that's submitted,

So we think the data's robust. We think that we've met the criteria. The meetings with the agency that Columbia has had
pointed all the right directions. So we think we're in a nice spot to be.
Delighted we submitted yesterday. Looking forward to the acceptance position within the next 45 to 60 days. And then,
obviously, to try to adjudicate the NDA before the end of the year.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Great. And then very quickly, Paul, on OxyContin. I know you've got first-to-file status on
the TR dose. Can you talk about your expectations for generics of the current – or rather the older version of
OxyContin? Do you expect generics or do you think this will be a TR market and the entire thing available to you as
first to file?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, just to clarify it, I think I said we believe we were first to file on some of the strengths,
not all of the strengths.
And I guess over time, we would anticipate that this would become a complete tamper-resistant market, and that's
basically what we're planning for. I think that's what everyone expects to have happen. It's probably the safest thing to
have happen. So I think we're all moving in that direction.
It'll be – we've seen a little bit of movement in some of the state governments to try to limit the ability of distribution of
non-tamper-resistant narcotics. We don't expect those to actually have much of an effect.
And we've been sort of defending against those because it's going to – of course, there are always, when these state
activities go on, they're always over-broad, and they try to prevent any substitution of tamper-resistant products. So that
means that it could impact the generic substitution of an equivalent product to tamper-resistant.
So we continue to follow those very closely, and we will continue to combat them at Watson as well as GPhA going
forward.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Just to clarify. You're not expecting generics for the old OxyContin?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: It's going to be interesting to see what the FDA does on that topic. I'd hesitate to sort of weigh
in on that. It's really the agency's call. I think they could take the position, the agency that is, that they're not going to
approve any. I mean they could take that position. That would not shock me.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: All right. Great. Thank you.

And your last question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. First a couple of particular products.
First on Mucinex, can you just give us a quick update? Is that in the guidance or do you expect that product to be
launched this year?
And second on Fentora, should we think about this product as essentially being gone for Watson? Is this essentially a
product where Sandoz will send you guys flowers, but they're likely to enter the market? Or is there still some things
out there other than the appeal that could allow you to monetize it?
And second, regarding your comment about getting some biologicals in, I know you guys have been thinking
significantly about what you're going to do with your biosimilar initiative. Can you give us kind of an idea about how
much money you think about spending in that area organically over the next couple of years? What does it really take
for you guys to bring a product to market there?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think, let's go backwards and start with the biologics first.

As you know, our first product, FSH, is in development now, and I think we've said that we expect to bring that product
to market will cost us somewhere in the $50 million to $60 million range.
We would anticipate that that would be the low end of a biologic development effort, and as we look at rolling out
additional projects and products, we're contemplating how much the balance sheet – well, the balance sheet can take it
– is how much the P&L can take on the – how many products we can do at any one time.
So we're looking for ways to be creative and find partners to help fund some of these opportunities. We just don't see
ourselves doing 20 different products, however. I would think that number is somewhere in the 5, 6, 7 range of
products.
And we wouldn't start them all at the same time. So I think we'd sort of layer them on over time. That's kind of the way
we've built our internal R&D models for '11, '12 and '13.
On Fentora and Mucinex, I think we don't really comment on what specific products are in the guidance, so I'm going
to refrain from doing that. I do think we will ultimately find a way to monetize the Fentora product. I think we have a
strong position on appeal, and I look forward to – we won on the first two cases as well.
And then on Mucinex, of course, we're working to get our product approved, so as soon as we get that approved, I think
you'll see us go quickly.
The real issue with us is getting these applications through the agency. That's not a problem that's unique to Watson. It's
a problem that everybody is struggling with.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Right. Question, just comment on biologicals for a second. Do you guys think it's important to be
there on day one with a biosimilar launch? Or is that something that if you come in a couple of years after the first one,
you'll be okay?
That is, are you layering the projects – basically we'll get a couple of them for the first wave, a couple the second
wave? Or is it possible for you to be come in on a later one?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I think we're looking to try to find those product opportunities where we're not going to
be coming in that late. I mean I think our preference would be to come at time of market formation and be one of the
first movers on those products. I don't – I wouldn't say we would never do that, but I think that we've said pretty clearly
that the first wave of biologics, the EPOs, the GCSFs and the like, you won't see us in unless we acquire a company
that has them. That's not something we're going to go out and develop and try to be the fifth and sixth player into those
markets.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Right. Thank you, guys.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure.
