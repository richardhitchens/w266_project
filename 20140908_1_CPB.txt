MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. At
this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and
instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.
I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President-Investor Relations for
Campbell. Please go ahead.
Jennifer K. Driscoll
Thanks, Kate. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 earnings call and webcast
for Campbell Soup Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Anthony
DiSilvestro, our Chief Financial Officer; and Anna Choi, Senior Manager of Investor Relations. I'm going to start
things off with a few reminders, including items impacting comparability, and our quarterly earnings dates for fiscal
2015. Denise will follow with her perspective on the quarter and the year and our plan for fiscal 2015. Anthony will
then discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year, finishing with our expectations for fiscal 2015. And after
that we'll take your questions.
As usual, we've created slides that accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website
this morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com and on our IR app, which is available through Google or Apple.
Please keep in mind that our call's open to members of the media who are participating in listen-only mode.

Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements, which reflect Campbell's current expectations about future
plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could
be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to slide three in the presentation or to Campbell's most
recent 10-K and SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those
anticipated in any forward-looking statements.
Now I'd like to remind you about items impacting comparability. As we said in this morning's news release, in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded $21 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs to
improve our supply chain efficiency in Australia, to reduce overhead across the organization, and for previously
announced initiatives. We also recorded an additional $4 million pre-tax settlement charge associated with the U.S.
pension plan.
Last year in the fourth quarter we recorded $30 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and restructuring-related costs
to improve our U.S. supply chain infrastructure, to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in
Mexico, to improve the Pepperidge Farm supply chain, and to reduce overhead in North America. Our comparisons in
fiscal 2014 with fiscal 2013 will exclude previously announced items as shown on slide four.
So now let me remind you that we will use non-GAAP measures to enhance our explanations. We've provided a
reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as an appendix to the slides
accompanying our presentation. Because the guidance for fiscal 2015 is on 52 weeks versus 52 weeks, we show the
estimated impact of the extra week in fiscal 2014 on sales and earnings as well. These slides, along with our earnings
release and selected quarterly and annual financials, also can be found on our website, which is available online or on
your mobile device with the Campbell IR app.
Last, please mark your calendars for our planned fiscal 2015 earnings dates shown on slide six. Like this quarter the
dates are a little later than usual due to the 53rd week, which you'll be hearing about a lot on this call. November 25 is
when we plan to report first quarter earnings. The next three earnings dates are February 25, 2015, May 22, 2015, and
September 4, 2015.
With that, let me turn the call over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.
At our Investor Day in July, I told you that I remained confident that our strategy to reshape Campbell by strengthening
our core business and expanding into faster growing spaces is the right course for our company. But I also know that it
will take more time than we originally anticipated to achieve our long-term growth targets.
Our industry is now in a period of profound change and challenge and there has been a meaningful decline in the
performance of the packaged foods sector. Forces like the economic environment, the transformation of consumer food
preferences with regard to health and wellness and their demand for greater transparency, the powerful social and
demographic changes, and the rise of e-commerce are all driving significant changes in consumer behavior with respect
to food. With this as background, today I will focus most of my remarks on our performance for full year 2014 and our
expectations for fiscal 2015. But first, I will briefly comment on our fourth quarter results.
Our fourth quarter results benefited from the extra week in the fiscal year, which was the significant driver in the
quarter as we delivered 7% sales growth and double-digit growth in adjusted EBIT and EPS. Organic sales in the
quarter decreased 2% as our core business continued to underperform in a challenging consumer environment.
Turning to our full-year results in 2014, including the 53rd week and the benefit of acquisitions, Campbell delivered
growth in both sales and adjusted earnings. We were encouraged by the performance of the businesses we acquired in
the last two fiscal years as part of our strategy to reshape Campbell's growth trajectory but we were not satisfied with
the performance of our core business and our organic sales results for the year reflected the extremely difficult market

conditions which are impacting the Food business.
Consistent with our most recent guidance, sales from continuing operations increased 3% to nearly $8.3 billion,
benefiting from acquisitions and an extra week in the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 1%. Adjusted earnings before
interest and taxes from continuing operations grew 4% to nearly $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share from
continuing operations increased 2% to $2.53.
In U.S. Simple Meals, we delivered growth in sauces with higher sales of Prego Pasta sauces and Campbell's Dinner
Sauces. But after growing 5% in fiscal 2013, sales declined in U.S. Soup as organic growth in Swanson Broth, which
increased 8%, was more than offset by declines in Ready-To-Serve and Condensed Soups, amid softer consumption.
In Global Baking and Snacking, the acquisition of Kelsen Group contributed $193 million in sales. We had modest
growth in Pepperidge Farm, including continued gains in our Goldfish franchise and fresh bakery. We had solid growth
in Indonesia. As we expected sales declined in our business in Australia. As we outlined at our Investor Day in July, we
have initiated turnaround plans to reinvigorate both our Australian business and our U.S. Beverages business, which
also declined for the year.
Overall, we are embracing change and continuing to diversify our portfolio. We are building our presence in packaged
fresh and other faster growing spaces in strategically important geographies outside of our developed markets and in
channels that will make our products available everywhere consumers shop.
In fiscal 2014, we achieved some key milestones in the execution of these strategies. We completed our acquisition of
Kelsen Group, which has given us a valuable growth platform with 40% of its sales of baked snacks in China and Hong
Kong. We invested in our first marketing programs to build the Bolthouse Farms brand and expanded the distribution
of Bolthouse products, driving solid sales growth and share gains of super-premium beverages in measured channels.
Internationally, we divested our slow-growing European simple meals business to focus on growth opportunities in
Asia and Latin America and expanded our sweet biscuit business in Indonesia, a key developing market.
In January we transitioned to a new U.S. network of distributors for our single-serve beverages. Over time we expect
this network to drive immediate consumption growth for both our V8 and Bolthouse Farms brands.
We increased our digital and e-commerce capabilities to enhance our connection with consumers who are engaging
with brands in new ways. We continue to drive consumer-focused innovation, with new products equaling 11% of list
sales on a rolling three-month basis. Across our portfolio, we reduced overhead costs, which is critical to funding our
growth.
Finally, we reflected on our company's purpose, which we've expressed in seven words – real food that matters for
life's moments. This will be the compass that guides our decisions as we aspire to become a $10 billion company within
the next five years. It affirms our connections to the core values that have inspired trusting Campbell in the past and it
[ph] brings (09:59) us to the priorities of new generations.
Now that 2014 is behind us, I want to give you a brief overview of our plans for fiscal 2015. We will take further action
to drive growth in our important U.S. Soup portfolio and improve category performance. To do this, we will continue
to elevate quality, increase our brand building, and drive more innovation, including our first Campbell's Organic
soups. We intend to expand in the Premium Soup segment, strengthen Ready-to-Serve Soups, and grow our number
one position in Condensed Soups and broth.
We will drive growth in Pepperidge Farm by executing against all the drivers of demand, including increased
innovation, particularly in the back half of the year. We will revitalize our shelf-stable U.S. Beverage business by
leveraging innovation and the powerful equities of the V8 brand in vegetable nutrition to capitalize on the juicing trend
with affordable juicing. We will continue to stabilize our Australian business and rejuvenate sales of Arnott's Biscuits
in that key market.
In faster growing spaces, our acquisitions of Bolthouse Farms, Plum, and Kelsen have diversified our nearly $8.3
billion portfolio, as we continue to shift our center of gravity. We expect all three of these businesses to grow the top
line as we expand distribution.

To continue to drive our expansion into faster growing spaces, we will focus on four key platforms under our long-term
strategy; number one, accelerating breakthrough innovation, including continued expansion in Campbell's Dinner
Sauces and plans this year to extend the V8 brand into adult on-the-go nutrition with protein bars and shakes. Across
our portfolio, we will launch more than 200 new products as we continue to respond to the evolving tastes and needs of
consumers. Number two, becoming a leader in packaged fresh foods, a growing $18.6 billion category in which
Bolthouse Farms has given us a solid foundation and is now expanding with the launch of Bolthouse Farms Kids, an
innovation portfolio of healthy snacks and beverages for children. Number three, expanding in developing markets in
Asia and Latin America, building on our footholds in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico; and finally, increasing
the availability of all of our products in all channels, including immediate consumption channels and e-commerce.
We will fund our growth by aggressively managing our costs and margin. Furthermore, we will become a
high-performance company as we continue to drive agile decision-making, own our results, and attract and retain
world-class talent to further diversify our team.
In fiscal 2015, we expect to deliver growth of 1% to 2% in sales and between 0% to 2% in adjusted EBIT and adjusted
EPS from continuing operations on a 52-week basis. This guidance reflects the impact of some significant headwinds
that will affect year-over-year comparisons. Importantly, while we will continue to invest in our platforms for
long-term growth, we are prepared to take additional actions if these headwinds accelerate.
It is important to note that our growth in fiscal 2015 won't be evenly distributed across quarters. Our first quarter
comparison will be favorable because in fiscal 2014 we experienced retailer inventory movements and later
Thanksgiving holiday timing that pushed sales into the second quarter. We expect a larger amount of holiday sales this
year to shift back to the first quarter. As a result, looking at our business performance on a first-half basis versus a
quarterly basis will be more meaningful.
We continue to believe that our long-term growth targets of 3% to 4% in organic sales, 4% to 6% in EBIT, and 5% to
7% in EPS are achievable. However, we recognize, as we said at our Investor Day, that further portfolio
reconfiguration, including smart external development, may be required to deliver and sustain growth at this level.
We have meaningfully changed the composition of our portfolio and are following through on our commitment to
diversify our business into faster growing spaces. But we know it will take some time to realize the full promise of our
new platforms, and we know that we stand at a critical juncture.
In closing, I believe it is essential to balance optimism with realism. Consumers are changing in profound ways. At
Campbell, we're putting the consumer first and adapting quickly to the new normal of our world. While remaining true
to our core beliefs, we have opened our minds to new ways of thinking about our business. To win in the long term,
food companies will have to embrace change and lead change, and we are doing this at Campbell.
I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes, and I'll now turn the call over to Anthony DiSilvestro.
Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Good morning and thanks, Denise. I'll walk through our fourth quarter results and segment highlights, followed by a
look at our fiscal year results.
As Jennifer indicated, both our fourth quarter and fiscal year results include an extra week compared to the prior year.
We'll wrap up with a look at our fiscal 2015 guidance, which will be presented on a 52-week to 52-week basis. As
usual, my discussion of results will exclude items impacting comparability, which are detailed in our non-GAAP
reconciliation.
For the fourth quarter, we reported net sales from continuing operations of $1.852 billion, an increase of 7% versus the
year-ago quarter. These sales results include a 7-point benefit from the 53rd week and a 3-point contribution from our
Kelsen and Plum acquisitions. Excluding the 53rd week, acquisitions, and the negative impact of currency, organic net
sales decreased by 2%, driven by declines in our U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking segment, partly

offset by gains in Bolthouse and Foodservice.
Adjusted EBIT increased 25% to $259 million. The increase was due to lower administrative expenses and the benefit
of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.49, a 14%
increase versus the prior year, reflecting EBIT growth partly offset by a higher effective tax rate.
The next slide shows the composition of our sales performance. As you can see, there was no impact from volume mix
and pricing. The organic sales decrease of two points reflects increased promotional spending, primarily related to
higher rates of spending to remain competitive in our Global Baking and Snacking segment. Unfavorable currency had
a 1-point impact to the Australian and Canadian dollars weakening against the U.S. dollar. The acquisition of Kelsen
and seven additional weeks of Plum added three points. The benefit of the 53rd week added 7 points to sales growth.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 240 basis points to 34.3%. Of the decline, 210 basis points came
from the base business and 30 basis points was the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the decline in gross
margin was primarily due to increased supply chain costs, cost inflation and higher promotional spending, partly offset
by productivity improvements.
To give this some context, the fourth quarter is a relatively small quarter for us and the increase in supply chain costs
negatively impacted gross margin by about two points. This included the impact of fixed cost absorption compared to
last year and mark-to-market losses on open commodity contracts. Importantly, going forward, we estimate that our
gross margin percentage for the full year of 2015 will be comparable to this year.
Marketing and selling expenses for the quarter decreased by $2 million to $189 million. The decrease was primarily
due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses, lower selling expenses, and the impact of currency, partly
offset by the impact of acquisitions. A&C for the quarter and the year fell 2% while total marketing support including
trade spending rose for both periods. Administrative expenses decreased $46 million to $149 million, primarily due to
lower incentive compensation cost and cost savings from recent restructuring initiatives.
Now let's look at below the line items. For the quarter, net interest expense of $30 million was comparable to the
prior-year quarter as a lower debt balance and lower interest rates were offset by the impact of the additional week. The
adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 33.2%, an increase of 8.5 points versus the prior year. The 2013 rate was
significantly lower benefiting from lower taxes on foreign earnings, reflecting the impact of the higher tax rate. Both
adjusted earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 14%.
Fourth quarter segment sales results and the organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. The Global Baking and
Snacking segment, our largest segment by sales in the quarter, delivered $628 million in sales, including a $32 million
contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales declined 2% versus the prior year with declines at Pepperidge Farm and
Arnott's. The sales decline at Pepperidge Farm was driven by increased promotional spending, partially offset by
volume gains.
Sales of cookies and crackers were comparable to prior year with gains in Goldfish snack crackers offset by declines in
Pepperidge Farm adult cracker varieties. Sales of frozen and other products declined, while sales of fresh bakery
products increased driven by volume gains in bread and rolls. The sales decrease at Arnott's was due to weakness in
Australia, primarily in savory and sweet varieties, partly offset by continued strong sales growth in Indonesia.
Our U.S. Simple Meals segment delivered $518 million in sales, including $32 million of sales from Plum. Organic
sales decreased 5% versus the prior year. Within this segment, U.S. Soup organic sales decreased 10%, including a
7-point decline due to movement in retailer inventories. As you may recall, we ended the third quarter with inventory
levels higher than the prior year due to the later timing of the Easter holiday.
As we ended fiscal 2014, retailer inventory levels were comparable to a year ago. Our consumer takeaway of soup in
measured channels was down 3% in the quarter. Organic sales of other Simple Meals increased by 2% driven by gains
in Campbell's Dinner Sauces and Prego Pasta Sauces.
Our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice segment posted $334 million in sales. It was our best-performing segment as
organic sales increased 4%. Double-digit growth in Bolthouse Farms premium refrigerated beverages and salad

dressings was partially offset by decreases in North America Foodservice.
International Simple Meals and Beverages delivered $188 million in sales. Organic sales were comparable to the prior
year as declines in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region were partly offset by gains in Canada. U.S. Beverages
delivered sales of $184 million. Organic sales decreased 1% due to declines in V8 V-Fusion, partly offset by gains in
V8 Splash beverages and V8 vegetable juice. Excluding the sales declines associated with the continuing transition to
our new immediate consumption route to market, organic sales would've been up modestly in the quarter.
Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 4% to $114 million. The improvement was primarily due to the
53rd week and lower administrative and marketing expenses, partly offset by the decline in U.S. Soup sales and a lower
gross margin percentage. Operating earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 17% to $98 million, primarily
driven by lower administrative expenses and the extra week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage. The
increase reflected earnings growth in Pepperidge Farms and the addition of Kelsen Group's operating results. Earnings
for Arnott's were comparable to the prior-year quarter.
Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages more than doubled to $43 million. The gain was primarily driven by lower
administrative, selling and marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week. Operating earnings within Bolthouse
and Foodservice gained 16% to $29 million. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses and the
benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher marketing expenses as we
continue to support the Bolthouse Farms brand.
In International Simple Meals and Beverages, operating earnings totaled $21 million, an increase of 15% primarily due
to a higher gross margin percentage driven by productivity improvement and the benefit of the 53rd week.
Our full-year results as shown on this chart were consistent with our most recent guidance for sales, EBIT and EPS. For
the year, net sales were up 3% while organic net sales decreased 1%. Declines in U.S. Beverage and International
Simple Meals and Beverages were partly offset by gains in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment. Adjusted EBIT
increased 4% on lower administrative expenses, a three point benefit from the 53rd week and lower marketing
expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the organic sales decline. Adjusted earnings per share
increased 2% to $2.53, including an $0.08 benefit from the 53rd week.
For the fiscal year, sales grew 3% driven by a three point contribution from acquisitions and a two point benefit from
the 53rd week minus one point each from lower organic sales and unfavorable currency translations. Organic sales
decreased 1% as the impact of higher promotional spending was partly offset by higher selling prices.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 190 basis points to 35.4%. The decline in gross margin was
primarily attributable to cost inflation, higher promotional spend, increased supply chain costs and the unfavorable
impact of acquisitions, partly offset by productivity improvement and higher selling prices. The rate increase in cost of
goods sold was approximately 4% for the year, in line with our estimate, partly offset by productivity savings of 3%.
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 1% or $12 million. The change was primarily due to lower advertising and
consumer promotion expenses, the impact of currency, lower marketing overhead expenses, and lower selling
expenses, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions. Administrative expenses decreased 15% or $104 million,
primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs, cost savings from restructuring initiatives and lower pension
costs, partly offset by the impact of acquisitions.
For the fiscal year, net interest expense decreased 5% or $6 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates on our
debt portfolio. The adjusted tax rate for the fiscal year was 31.7%, a 1.9-point increase versus the prior year, which
benefited from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of certain U.S. state tax matters. Adjusted
earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 2%.
I'll briefly comment on full year segment results. In the U.S. Simple Meals segment, organic sales were comparable to a
strong prior year, which saw sales grow 5%. Within this segment, U.S. Soup organic sales decreased 2% while sales of
other Simple Meals increased by 4%, primarily due to growth in Prego Pasta Sauces and Campbell's Dinner Sauces.
Our Global Baking and Snacking segment includes a $193 million contribution from Kelsen. Organic sales were

comparable to the prior year as sales growth in Indonesia and Pepperidge Farm driven by Goldfish were offset by
declines in Arnott's in Australia.
Our Bolthouse and Foodservice segment had organic sales growth of 2% with double-digit gains in Bolthouse Farms
premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, partly offset by declines in North America Foodservice. Organic
sales for International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased by 3% with declines in Latin America, Canada and the
Asia-Pacific region. U.S. Beverage organic sales decreased 4% due to sales declines in our V8 V-Fusion multi-serve
beverages as well as weakness in our single-serve products as we continue to transition to our new distribution network
for the immediate consumption channel.
Commenting on full year segment earnings, U.S. Simple Meals operating earnings decreased 2% to $714 million as a
lower gross margin percentage and expenses related to the November 2013 Plum recall were partly offset by lower
administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the extra week.
Global Baking and Snacking earnings gained 5% to $332 million. The increase was primarily driven by lower
administrative expenses, the acquisition of Kelsen, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly
offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the unfavorable impact of currency. The increase reflected growth in
Pepperidge Farm and Kelsen Group's operating results, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott's.
U.S. Beverages operating earnings increased 6% to $127 million, primarily driven by lower administrative and
marketing expenses, partly offset by lower gross margin percentage and lower volumes. Bolthouse and Foodservice
operating earnings increased 1% primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the increase in sales and the benefit of
the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the increased marketing for Bolthouse Farms.
International Simple Meals and Beverages operating earnings decreased 2% to $106 million in the fiscal year. The
decrease was primarily driven by volume decline and the unfavorable impact of currency, partly offset by lower
administrative expenses, a higher gross margin percentage, and lower selling expenses.
On the next slide, you can see the sales performance of U.S. Soups, excluding the estimated impact of the 53rd week.
Sales declined 2% compared to the prior year, in which soup sales rose 5%. Consumer takeaway measured channels
also declined by 2% as soup inventory levels at retailers at year-end were comparable with 2013. For the year, sales of
Condensed Soups decreased 3% driven primarily by declines in eating varieties. Ready-to-Serve Soup sales declined
6% with lower sales across the RTS portfolio. Broth had a very strong year with sales increasing by 8% driven by
stronger marketing programs, innovation and distribution gains.
Here's a look at U.S. wet soup category performance in the past year and our share performance as measured by IRI.
For the 52-week period ending August 3, 2014, the category as a whole declined 1.1%. Our sales in measured channels
declined 2% with the low single-digit declines in Condensed and Ready-to-Serve Soups, partly offset by high single
digit growth in broth. Campbell had a 59% market share, a decrease of 50 basis points in the period. All other branded
players collectively had a share of 28% with private label at 13%.
Cash flow from operations was $899 million compared with $1.019 billion in the prior year. The decline was primarily
due to lower cash earnings and taxes paid on the divestiture of the European simple meals business, partly offset by
lower working capital requirements. Capital expenditures of $347 million increased from $336 million a year ago. Net
debt decreased by $337 million to $3.783 billion.
Now I'll talk about our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we've stated, fiscal 2014 comprised 53 weeks, which includes one
additional week. As shown on the chart, we estimate that the extra week benefited sales by two points, EBIT by three3
points, and EPS by $0.08 per share.
On a 52-week adjusted basis in 2014, we delivered $8.139 billion in sales, $1.244 billion in EBIT, and EPS of $2.45.
These 52-week numbers are the base for our fiscal 2015 guidance. As we stated at our recent Investor Day, while we
expect to achieve growth in 2015, we do not expect to achieve our long-term target growth rates. For fiscal 2015, we
expect continuing operations to grow sales by 1% to 2%, adjusted EBIT to grow between 0% and 2% and EPS to grow
0% to 2% or $2.45 to $2.50 per share.

Turning to some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, we expect inflation in cost of products sold of
approximately 3% to 4% driven by double-digit increases in dairy, meat and tomatoes. Cost inflation will be mostly
offset by estimated productivity gains of 3% as a percentage of cost of products sold. We expect our gross margin
percentage to be comparable to last year, as we realize some gains in net pricing and wrap some one-time costs, most
notably the Plum recall. The anticipated return of incentive compensation to targeted levels represents a 4-point
headwind at EBIT or approximately $0.09 per share, the majority of which will flow through our administrative
expense line.
We expect that the benefits from our restructuring initiative, including the program initiated in the fourth quarter, will
partly offset the incentive compensation impact. The effective tax rate is projected to be in the 31% to 32% range
comparable to fiscal 2014. This guidance assumes a modest EPS contribution from share repurchases as we anticipate
resuming our strategic share repurchase program in 2015. We forecast capital expenditures to increase by $50 million
to approximately $400 million as we increase funding for capacity expansion projects for Goldfish, Bolthouse Farms,
aseptic broth and our business in Indonesia.
As Denise has already mentioned, given our performance in the first half last year, we expect stronger performance in
the first quarter and softer performance in the second quarter, which should add up to a first half that's more consistent
with our annual guidance.

<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Thanks for the question. Good morning.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Denise, just wondering if you could provide an update on the sauces strategy and maybe
the progress you're seeing in terms of retailers adopting these dedicated aisle merchandisers and the your expectations
for the contribution of sauces to growth in fiscal 2015?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Our sauces strategy is to continue to build the Pace brand. We have on the docket for F
2015 some innovation and brand-building programs, but most of the contribution from sauces will come from the
growth in Prego where we're continuing to expand our white sauces and also the innovation in our Campbell's Dinner
Sauces, where we've introduced Skillet and Slow Cooker Sauces, and this year we're introducing Oven Sauces, and that
platform continues to build. We now have the majority of retailers giving us an extra four-foot section in the store as
the destination for those particular sauces. So it's a very strong and profitable business for us.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Denise, in the prepared remarks, I think you made a comment about remaining committed to
investing in the platforms for the long term but also having the willingness to take additional actions if industry
headwinds accelerate. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what you meant by those additional actions. Is that the
potential for just to be more thoughtful around marketing in the year potentially or incremental restructuring or both, or
things beyond that that I didn't mention? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think it's really important that the company, given the fact that we are still having
challenges on our organic sales, to continue to invest in these brands and to make sure that we are innovating, and that
that is going to take the investment that we have in our plans. However, given the volatility in the marketplace, some of
the commodity issues that we're facing, et cetera, we are constantly looking for additional opportunities for cost
reduction and management of those margins. So that's what I was indicating there. We believe that we've got it
balanced. But quite frankly, if there are surprises, we will take extra action to make sure that we deliver what we said
we were going to do.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it, so a little less on the marketing side where I think you've mentioned even at your
Analyst Day that does need to continue to be bolstered behind some of the new innovation and maybe more on the cost
side potentially.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Correct, absolutely.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess maybe a little bit of a follow-up to Andrew's question for the long term, and then I
have a detailed numbers question. But on the long term, why wouldn't you – and maybe this is a little somewhat
semantic – but why wouldn't you change your long-term targets either a little lower given the environment and the
inability to change them over the last few years, or just say okay, our long-term targets now include the assumption of
M&A?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: The way we're looking at it, Eric, is we need about a point more of sales and two points of
EBIT growth to get to the bottom of the range. And when you think about the puts and takes that we're cycling in F
2014, that gave us about four points of EBIT pressure in F 2015 with a net impact of about $45 million from supply
chain costs and incentive compensation. Without this headwind, EBIT would have been consistent with our long-term
targets. So we have a line of sight of how to get there. However, we are saying that there may be a call for more M&A
to continue to diversify into faster growing spaces for sustainable achievement of those long-term targets.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then, Anthony, if I could just follow up, I don't understand one thing you said
about the fiscal 2015 assumptions. You've already started out by saying that your targets are going to be – that fiscal
2015 is likely to be less than plan. So is the incentive comp of $45 million, is that a portion of what you would have
assumed if you had achieved the targets? I'm just surprised that – wouldn't the incentive comp headwinds be lower
because you're already at the start of the year assuming a less than average year?

<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Let me clarify, Eric. What I said is that our fiscal 2015 growth rate will be lower than
our long-term target growth rates. Those growth rates in F 2015 are more consistent with our internal plans, and the 0%
to 2% EBIT and EPS growth include the negative headwind from returning incentive compensation to target levels,
part of which is offset by restructuring benefits from the programs that we recently initiated.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. I guess I don't understand. If you're starting out the year knowing that you're going to
be below your long-term plan, and I realize compensation is a function of several plans or several different time
periods, why would you restate or accrue the comp at what I guess is essentially a normal year's level? Do you
understand what I'm saying?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: You must be referring to the multiyear programs. And the annual plan resets every
year, so that certainly goes back to targeted levels. The way the accruals work on the longer-term ones is that you
basically adjust to your current expectations so that going forward the increment is more consistent or closer to target.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. Maybe I'll follow up offline. I'll pass it on. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just wonder if I can get a little more color on the increased supply chain costs. I
know that through the year you had those. I think weather in part was a factor, but it seems like those continued in the
fourth quarter as well. Could you give a little color on that and is that – perhaps in response to Andrew's question in
part which you would be targeting if there some more cost reduction activities?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Let me – on the fourth quarter, we had a couple situations in the supply chain that were
relatively unique and different than the full-year impacts that we saw around, for example, the Plum recall or the
impact of the extreme weather on warehousing and distribution costs.
What we saw in the fourth quarter is really two things, and they both add up to being about a two point impact on gross
margin quarter over quarter. The first is the timing of our fixed cost absorption. Last year we had some favorability.
This year we had some unfavorability. It's a relatively small quarter. We're truing up some of our fixed cost reserves,
and what we saw was year-on-year negative impact on gross margin.
And the second is on our open commodity hedges. So we take forward cover on the majority of our hedgeable items.
And what happened in the fourth quarter, the underlying prices of those commodities declined, and so we had to record
a loss on some of those open commodity hedges. So those two things happened in the fourth quarter. and again, they're
not really a recurring thing, which is why I added the comment that looking ahead, we do expect 2015's gross margin
percentage to be comparable to this year.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: And, Chris, just to build on that, in the fourth quarter last year we were gearing up and
launching Campbell's Homestyle Soups, so that is something that we're cycling this year.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: The absorption.

Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi. Just sticking with the soup category, you've launched a wide range of new soups over
the past few years, the Go Soups, Slow Kettle, Bisques, and so on, and yet the category continues to decline it seems.
What have you learned from those new product launches over the years and what makes the lineup for fiscal 2015 more
likely to succeed this time? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Alexia, what we're doing in the next year is two things. We're improving against our
drivers of demand, but we're also investing more in broader platforms to improve total category performance. So each
one of the things you listed in and of itself is a single initiative. But when you bundle that into a premium soup
platform, we then will be building the expansion of Slow Kettle and the introduction of Campbell Organic Soup. We're
putting Premium Soup sections in stores so that we know that the consumer for these particular products is younger and
more affluent. So that gives us the range in value all the way from Condensed Soup all the way up to a premium soup
in shelf stable and then also in chilled. And so focusing on the Premium Soup platform we believe is a faster-growing
space for us within the soup category.
The second thing we're doing is Swanson Broth is giving us an expansion to a Flavor-Infused platform, which is
offering consumers creative homemade soup and meal solutions based on the insight of Why I Cook. And then within
some of the brands, we have platforms like pub-inspired Chunky or building out our Campbell Homestyle and Healthy
Request soups. So what we've really learned is by bundling these into platforms, what we have to do is improve the
total category performance, which has been declining. And if we can do that by bringing new users into the category,
we believe that's the best opportunity for growth.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi, yes. Hey. Good morning. Just a follow-up on soup for this upcoming year. What sort of
year-to-year performance would you expect from Simple Meals and soups, specifically similar to your overall top line
guidance? And where I'm going with this is your innovation marketing and renovation plans for this year, how would
you characterize them versus 2014? And what do you think of weather comparisons? Are they neutral or perhaps
negative event for 2015 as you're thinking ahead? Thanks.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, I would say – I don't want to give a specific forecast for Simple Meals but, as
Denise said, we do expect soup to grow in 2014. We do expect growth from some of our other areas within Simple
Meals. The challenges that some of these core centered store categories have been sluggish of late and that's kind of
what's holding us back.
We will flex the marketing to focus against some of the innovation that's going on so the launch of Oven Sauces and
the launch of Organic Soups, so we'll flex the marketing within there to do that. We expect pretty significant
renovation. I mean Denise talked about 200 new SKUs. A lot of those sit inside the Simple Meals category. Regards
the weather, I would say kind of neutral year-on-year but I don't really focus too much on that.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: The only thing I would add is that we typically plan our innovation at the average in the
food business. And so if something performs better than average, we get a benefit from that but if something performs
below that, we believe that by planning to the average we can balance out.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just I guess maybe a broader question just trying to conceptualize a little bit where we stand
or where we'll go going forward in terms of the core business. I guess over the last few years, the challenging
environment or the challenges have been really North America and I guess Australia and it's been a combination of the
economy or a weak consumer wallet and all the things that would drive that. And then we've also got changing
consumer tastes. I guess from my perspective it seems like early on it was more a weak wallet and less sort of
consumer tastes and maybe that's changed now. So can you just give us a sense for kind of those items, which ones are
really causing the most pressure today? And as you're going forward, which of those two do you think are the most
important in addressing in terms of sort of getting the base to be where it needs in order to get ourselves back into the
algorithm?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: There are several factors but I'll talk about two that are on our watch. And the first one is
the impact of SNAP, particularly on the recipients. They're about 12% of our shopper base and that's correlated to about
a 1% decline in sales. There are about 90% of households in general based on government data. IRI captures about 12%
of them as they do their analysis and our analysis shows that about 30% of our retail customer base is experiencing
greater dollar declines among these households versus their total retail shoppers. So we're continuing to watch that.
The second is the shopping patterns of the next generation. We're watching the fact that 18 to 24-year-olds are not
necessarily frequenting stores like their parents. Now a lot of them live with their parents, so that might explain some of
it, but as we dig deeper in it, some of them haven't even made any trips to either a club store or mass merchandiser in
the last year. So making sure that we're engaging this next generation where they shop and how they are going to be
engaging with brands is going to be very, very important. So those are two things that we think are having a macro
impact. There are more.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: But it's fair to say in the near term, the longer-term thing is getting the millennials I guess or
the people in their 20s to engage in the category more, but the more specific thing to turn in the near term would just
simply be that financial pressure about the wallet?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I would say being the finance guy that that weak wallet has a very significant impact.
We're talking about our core category performance and probably something that we can affect the least and it's
certainly impacting some of our center store categories. And unlike the innovation thing, we're doing a lot about
innovation. Now those things are more in our control. We understand where the consumer's going. We can bring new
products. Denise talked about Dinner Sauces. We have a new line of V8 Juices that is more healthy. We have new
varieties of Swanson and Chunky and Homestyle and Prego, all those things addressing kind of where the consumer
taste is evolving. The hardest one for us to get at obviously is that weak wallet and the impact on our core category.

<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. So you've talked more recently about pulling back on some of the less productive
promotional spending that you've seen through the course of the year and shifting these dollars back to advertising. But
with promotion about a 2% headwind towards sales this quarter, I guess it wasn't really evident in Q4. Were you able to
make or have you been able to make these kinds of tactical adjustments you'd hoped to make two to three months ago?
Or is the competitive environment making it difficult to follow through on this?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Actually, for F 2015 we have made course corrections based on our F 2014 results, and
the work with both depth and frequency depending upon the category and the competition we're facing. And obviously,
for competitive reasons, we don't disclose the specifics of our promotions but we have, like I said, taken that learning
and applied it. In general, we aim to keep our total marketing spend, which is the combination of advertising consumer
and trade at about 25% of list sales. But the marketing mix is going to vary depending upon the brand and the category
and the competitive set in that category.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And just to clarify I guess with respect to the marketing and selling costs overall
for the full-year, my sense is that this should definitely be up year-on-year in absolute terms because of this course
correction, but can you just confirm that that's the right way to think about it on a full-year basis, not necessarily quarter
to quarter?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Denise was referring to our total marketing, so advertising, and consumer, and trade
spending, not the selling and marketing line on the P&L and trying to keep it around 24% to 25% of list sales. I
wouldn't expect any significant changes in those percentages year-on-year 2015 versus 2014, maybe some slight
changes within them but nothing significant.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, great. Thanks, folks.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on
gross margin. I think at least for me that was the biggest surprise in the quarter. Can you help us quantify the Plum
recall expenses as well as the other supply chain expenses? I guess the mark-to-market charges that hit you this year.
And then bigger question thinking forward into next year, you're guiding for inflation to modestly outstrip productivity.
As I think Matt was getting at, net pricing net of promotions has been eroding into the new fiscal year and you've had
this mix issue within your P&L presumably as soup sales lag and some of your lower margin with faster growth piece
of the portfolio become a bigger piece. So in context of all that, how do we get comfortable with gross margins being
flat in fiscal 2015?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Okay. I can address that because with any planning cycle there are certainly puts and
takes. So this year we had the Plum recall. That was worth $16 million, as we've discussed. In the fourth quarter, we
had this issue around losses on open commodity contracts. Both of those are going to turn and go the other way in 2015
but there's been some one-off or takes in 2015 as well.
Most of that Plum recall wrap is going to be offset by unfavorable currency movement at the transaction level, so
imports into both Canada and Australia are adversely impacted by the weakening of those currencies. So there's a
number of pluses and minuses that kind of net out with the exception of the incentive compensation headwind, and
we've talked about that. It's $45 million.

A good portion of that $45 million is going to be offset by the benefit of our restructuring programs. We had three
quarters this year we've announced restructuring initiatives. Combined when we're fully implement those, it's worth
$65 million. We won't get all of that in F 2015 but we'll get a good portion of that. So we're trying to mitigate that
impact. And again, we have a number of puts and takes and they kind of all balance out with the exception of that one
big one.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay, that's helpful. Switching gears, Denise, to you on M&A, you've kind of hinted that
maybe M&A is in the cards but you've put out this $10 billion sales bogey in five years and even given you credit for
pretty healthy acceleration in your ongoing portfolio. You're going to come easily $1 billion plus short of that without
M&A. So, A, is that the right way to think about it? And then, B, as we contemplate up to $1 billion or more of
acquired sales over the next five years, how do we think about your prioritization in terms of buying businesses that
accelerate the long-term growth of your portfolio versus buying businesses that can have a meaningful impact on both
the top and bottom line right out of the gate?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We continue to evaluate M&A targets that are a good strategic fit but we have a very
disciplined approach. So what I don't want the takeaway to be is that we're going to be reckless about this. We
definitely have been looking at specific targets but we've walked away from more than we made. So the prioritization
will be about the places that we've picked being the Global Baking and Snacking area, the packaged fresh area, health
and wellness in North America, those are three areas that we believe that they're our faster growing spaces for us based
on the strategy that we've laid out. And we do have the financial flexibility to make a meaningful acquisition. But like I
said, we're being very disciplined about it.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, if I could just add to that, I mean, certainly M&A can play a role as you've seen
us do with Bolthouse and Plum and Kelsen in terms of improving our growth profile and we'll continue to look for
opportunities to do that.
But we also recognize that in terms of value creation, the best that we can do is improve the performance of our base
business and Denise has talked about the dual mandate. We're focused on expanding into higher gross basis with
innovation and packaged fresh and availability and the international businesses that we do own. So it's that combination
of improving the base and expanding through M&A that'll get us to that $10 billion target.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Diane.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about Denise' comments about the
four pillars to accelerate growth, in particular the move into some nontraditional channels, and I'm particularly
interested in promo spending has been pretty inefficient. Most of your peers have said the same and you even
commented about the millennials not shopping the way their parents do. So I guess my question's really as promo hasn't
really produced the volume lift, can you, first of all, quantify what percentage of your sales is coming from these
alternative channels?
And then can you talk a little bit about how you will go about getting into say C-stores or club or maybe you could just
give us a few more details on what's behind that comment? And then obviously those channels are pretty competitive.
So just if you could frame that up a little bit, I'd be very interested in hearing that. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We have the majority of our business still concentrated largely in grocery and mass
merchandiser, which gives us lots of opportunity for expansion in other channels and we believe that we need to make

a concerted effort to do so. We've expanded our sales presence and our programming across multiple channels.
We're also paying attention to the e-commerce space with many of our large customers. And so we're doing a better job
in terms of tailoring programs in some of these new spaces so were not highly efficient right out of the gate, but we're
learning and getting better at it. I think most of the promotional situations that we had though this year were more in
our traditional channels, and we were working more with frequency and less depth. And in some categories like baked
snacks and soup, that didn't work as well as we expected it to so we are course-correcting.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: We have a very significant initiative again to the immediate consumption channels,
which we've talked about as we develop our own route-to-market network. At this point, we have over 100 new
distributors signed up. That transition is largely complete. We've got over 100,000 doors in terms of coverage, and we
expect to see some growth coming from this initiative probably by the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: And the original focus on that is beverage for both V8 and Bolthouse Farms.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Okay, thank you for the additional color.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think our estimate for alternate channels, Diane, is about 10%, somewhere in there.
<Q - Diane R. Geissler>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, David.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, David.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Thanks for taking the question. I see the hour so I'll be direct here. I want to just
talk a little bit about the gross margins. When I look really big picture at Campbell Soup, in more than ten years of data,
Denise, we haven't seen a gross margin like this. 35.4%, it's remarkable in respect to what Campbell's has produced for
so many years.
I also believe that at the beginning of the year, you guys thought that the gross margin would actually be flattish on the
year and it was down 190 basis points, so there are a lot of things that have really happened that I think were not easily
predictable by the team. The point and the question is, can you just discuss why gross margins wouldn't have
significant risk to the downside ongoing for the very same factors that drove the 2000 and the F 2014 numbers? And is
it simply all about this $65 million in savings? Is that the lifeline that we're hoping really stabilizes gross margins?
Thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I think the first is we certainly acknowledge what has happened to our gross margin
over the last couple years. And the principal driver of that has been an increasing trade rate, and it has to do with the
environment. It has to do with a couple of our businesses, namely U.S. Soup and Australia and more recently in
Pepperidge Farm. And I think the difference – and certainly it is a challenging goal. We acknowledge that. But we also
acknowledge in order for us to hit our financial targets, we need to do a better job of managing this trade rate closer to
flat. We have plans to do that in 2015 with a combination of changes to promoted price points. That's something we
didn't have coming into this year, so that obviously has a direct and immediate impact on the amount of trade.
We have adjustments to the frequency and around specific promotional events, continuing to learn in terms of what
programs are more productive versus less productive and let's reallocate within the portfolio. I think most of the
challenge in Australia is hopefully behind us. We have specific plans to address the issue of late within Pepperidge
Farm. So as we look across the portfolio, again, it's going to vary by category, but we're looking to hold the trade rate
relatively flat. And it is a challenge but that's our plan and what we're trying to do in 2015 because we know how

critical it is to the gross margin to get this trade rate back to flattish.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: To state the obvious, it's unsettling to see these gross margins do what they're doing
and then to have confidence in the model. Certainly, 2015 will be critical. Can you describe or quantify the size of the
commodity impact for the open hedge position that you took in the fourth quarter? If I'm correct, that's a reversible
item, so what will happen is as you actually recognize the actual transactions through F 2015, what was a headwind in
the fourth quarter will become a tailwind within the operating segments as the course of 2015 plays through and the
hedges are used up.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Somebody studied hedge accounting. It's about $10 million.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: It's $10 million. And then I would go back to Eric's question just to state it. I think I
want to state it simply. The $45 million of incentive comp that you've built back into the plan, I think what Eric was
getting at is why does all $45 million get back into the budget for the year when the expectation is that the company
will not achieve its long-term targets? So in simple form, and it doesn't mean to come across that harsh, Denise, maybe
the right answer is you just have to pay the team in order to keep the team. I think we all just want to understand the
philosophy on the $45 million and what it takes to maintain the excitement of the people running the business.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Let me jump in first here and then Denise can comment if she'd like, and thanks for the
second attempt here at an answer. Think about it as two parts. Again, there's an annual incentive plan, which resets
each year, and then there are long-term targets that will increase year on year but do not get back to 100% payout. So
the annual incentive goes back to target. The long-term ones will go up next year, but they don't go anywhere near
100% if they're set against our longer-term sales and EPS targets.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We definitely have a pay-for-performance compensation system with sales goals that are
higher than our guidance.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Okay, thank you so much.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Todd Duvick>: Thanks for the question. Very simply, on the balance sheet, you had $700 million of debt that
matured in August, and I think you had capacity to refinance that with commercial paper, and I guess my question is
really twofold. First of all, would you look to refinance a portion of that in the debt capital markets to term out a
portion of your floating-rate debt? And in terms of capital allocation priorities, do you continue to be focused
somewhat on debt reduction for FY 2015?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I can take that. In F 2014, we had $700 million of long-term debt maturing. We also
had cash flow that enabled us to reduce our total debt level by $300 million to $400 million. So one loan has just been
paid off with cash from operations; the other, as you point out, refinanced with commercial paper. As you know, we
have pretty good access to capital markets, so we're continuing to evaluate opportunities to come to market. We don't
have a specific plan this year with you today on that. But again, we're looking at that pretty closely.
In terms of capital allocation priorities, not much has changed there. Obviously, our first priority is to fund our ongoing
business. The second would be dividends; third, M&A; and the last would be share repurchases. What's changing in F
2015 is that we're going to resume in a modest fashion a return to share repurchases, get a little bit of EPS benefit in F
2015, but that would be the only change for us going forward.
<Q - Todd Duvick>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Sure.
