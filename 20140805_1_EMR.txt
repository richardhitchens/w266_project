will be available on our website after the call for the next three months.
I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales
decreased 1% to $6.3 billion, with underlying sales up 3%. Global economic conditions were mixed as areas of softness
continued. Mature markets improved, up 3% led by the U.S. and Europe. In contrast, emerging markets slowed to 2%
growth, reflecting political instability and economic uncertainty in certain regions. Backlog was at a record level, up
more than 20% year-to-date, driven by underlying orders growth of 5%.
Margin expansion was strong as portfolio changes and operational efficiencies more than offset growth investments.
Earnings per share of $1.03 increased 6%. Cash generation remained strong exceeding our expectations.
Moving to the next slide, P&L summary. As I mentioned, underlying sales grew 3%, with Artesyn divestiture
deducting 5% and acquisitions adding 1% for net sales down 1%. Gross profit increased 3% with 130 basis points of
margin improvement. EBIT, excluding charges in the prior year grew 5% helped by lower restructuring with margin
expansions of 90 basis points. Operationally, the tax rate was higher compared to the prior year impacting earnings per
share by $0.03. Repurchase of 2.8 million shares in the quarter contributed to EPS of $1.03, up 6%, excluding charges
in the prior year.
Next slide, sale by geography. Underlying sales grew in the U.S. by 5%, Europe by 4%, Asia by 3%, including China
up 8% and Latin America by 1%. Canada and Middle East and Africa declined by 3% and 9% respectively, such that
total underlying sales were up 3%. Strength continued in China and mature markets improved while emerging markets
were softer, especially in Brazil and the Middle East.
Next slide, segment earnings and cash flow, segment margin expanded 50 basis points with improvement in Industrial
Automation, Network Power and Commercial & Residential Solutions. Pre-tax earnings were substantially higher due
to lower corporate expense and charges in the Artesyn business last year.
Cash generation remained solid up 4% year-to-date, overcoming the Artesyn divestiture impact. Trade working capital
performance remained steady for the most part, better by 10 basis points.
Moving to slide six, Process Management; Process Management underlying sales increased 2%, with North America
up 7%, Asia down 2%, including China up 7%. Europe increased 5%. Latin America was up 5% and Middle East and
Africa down 11%. Acquisitions added 4% for net sales growth of 6%. Global energy and chemical industries continued
to drive growth, but project execution remained slow as customers continued to proceed cautiously.
North America was strong as U.S. unconventional oil and gas offset softness in Canada related to project timing. Asia
decreased reflecting market softness and difficult comparisons in Australia that offset continued strength in China.
Europe growth was led by emerging market and Mexico drove Latin American growth. Political instability remained
disruptive in the Middle East. Margins remained solid above 20%. Continued momentum in North America, anticipated
recovery in Asia and record backlog support the outlook for solid near-term growth.
Next slide, Industrial Automation; Industrial Automation underlying sales were flat with North America unchanged,
Asia up 3%, Europe down 5%, Latin America up 6% and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Demand for industrial goods
continued to recover slowly with mixed trends across markets and geographies. North America was stable in total and
varied by business, with growth in the U.S. offsetting weakness in Canada. Europe slowed, as economic momentum
stalled, while strength continued in China. Fluid automation, electrical distribution and materials joining led the growth
offset by declines in power-generating alternators and motors and drives. Market recovery is expected to continue, but
improvement will be slow due to uneven economic trends and demand, especially in Europe and the Middle East.
Next slide, Network Power; Network Power underlying sales increased 2%, with North America up 2%, Asia up 6%,
Europe up 10%, Latin America down 22%, and Middle East and Africa down 16%. The Artesyn divestiture deducted
20% for a net sales decrease of 18%. Growth was strong in the telecommunications infrastructure business, led by
double-digit gains in Asia and North America. Data center markets were stable globally, but mixed across geographies.
Robust growth in Europe benefited from a large project in Sweden and modest market improvement. Strength in Asia
was led by China and India. North America remained slow and Latin America was weak, impacted by the exit of

non-strategic businesses in that region.
The margin improvement reflected portfolio changes and continued strategic investments in Network Power. Backlog
strength and improving market conditions support the outlook for modest growth and improving profitability in the
next year.
Moving to slide nine, Climate Technologies, Climate Technologies' net and underlying sales grew 6% with North
America up 4%, Asia and Europe both up 9%, Latin America up 16% and Middle East and Africa up 2%. Growth was
led by a double-digit increase in the global refrigeration business, with China and Europe particularly robust. The U.S.
air conditioning business grew moderately, double-digit growth in service, mid single-digit growth in residential, and
single-digit growth in commercial. International air conditioning demand was mixed with strong growth in Europe and
flat market conditions in Asia. Favorable market conditions are expected to continue globally, led by improvement in
the U.S. air conditioning business.
Next slide, Commercial & Residential Solutions; Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales
increased 4%, with North America and international sales both increasing 4%. Market conditions improved
sequentially benefiting from a recovery from harsh winter weather in North America the previous quarter. There was
strong growth in the professional tools and residential storage businesses, with modest growth in wet/dry vacuums and
food waste disposers. Segment margin was strong, expanding 170 basis points. Recovery momentum is expected to
continue in the near term, benefiting from improvement in U.S. residential and commercial construction markets.
Moving to slide 11, 2014 outlook. Despite areas of ongoing uncertainty, global economic momentum continues to
improve gradually in an overall mixed environment. Mature market momentum is encouraging and should continue to
improve. Geopolitical tension and economic challenges in some markets continue to work against [audio gap] (9:15)
and is not expected to improve in the near term. Orders growth is expected to accelerate, increasing to between 5% and
7% in the fourth quarter. On a preliminary basis, July trailing three-month orders are approaching 7% growth, with a
standalone month of double-digit.
Due to slower-than-expected growth year-to-date, financial performance is trending to the low end of the
previously-communicated guidance ranges of underlying sales growth 3% to 5%, reported sales change of minus 1% to
1%, reflecting divestitures, completed acquisitions and currency translation, reported earnings per share of $3.68 to
$3.80, and operating cash flow of $3.5 billion, which is an increase from prior expectations.
With that overview of results, I'll turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Pat. I also want to welcome Frank Dellaquila today. He is joining us in the conference room.
First, I would like to thank all investors for joining us today on this call. We appreciate it. And next I would like to also
thank the global operating leaders for delivering a very strong profitable and cash flow quarter, despite an actual
weaker sales with underlying sales of only around 3%, even with a very unstable global geopolitical environment.
Operations, along the corporate organization continue to execute in a challenging environment to deliver top-line
growth, good earnings margins, very strong cash flow and very good return. As Pat mentioned, we had our first cut at
July, and good orders for the month of July. Now the three-month average looks like around that 5% to 7%. As I said,
in the press release, we think it's going be in the 5% to 7%. The key for us now is to execute and increase our sales
momentum, reduce our record levels of backlog and continue to convert the sales orders or the orders that come in
relative to delivering sales in the fourth quarter; key focus, conversion of backlog, conversion of current orders.
As we look at the world today, a lot of uncertainty. U.S. economy continues to improve slightly for us. Mexico
continues to be good for us; Western Europe, Southeast Asia, China running at very strong levels for us. Hopefully that
will continue in the next couple of years. India, Japan, all trending very nicely and with good solid orders and good
solid sales growth at the same time. Clearly the other markets around the world where the geopolitical environment are
very stressed and also are very concerning to me, given what we're seeing today and have been for the last several

months, and the uncertainty that will create in any business environment for our customer base, including myself.
Profitability remains at record levels for the company. Our cash flow is very strong. We are very much focused, as we
reviewed with our board today, on investing in innovation, investing in the programs, the solutions organization, the
service organization, that will drive longer-term premium growth and premium valuations and cash flow for this
company.
Clearly, the underlying growth rate is not what we expected in the first nine months of this year. Orders remain at very
good levels, but somewhat choppy relative to our customer base, but still at good level. The pace of growth is not above
what I would call the acceleration rate around 4%, but we are slightly better this quarter versus last quarter, but not as
strong as we thought when we entered the quarter. Growth is the challenge. Quality growth is very important. The pace
is improving, and we're clearly looking to try and accelerate this in the fourth quarter.
But from a standpoint of pure operations, and what I look at from the conversion of our cash flow, again, looking at
conversion of our cash flow at over 100% again this year, a 20%-plus return on total capital after-tax based on what we
see right now, our cash flow, giving back to our shareholders at over 60%-plus again this year, between share
repurchase and dividend. And a decent level of orders, but the key issue for us is converting, getting orders out and
converting those to sales and profit and cash.
So as I look at the quarter, from my perspective, the quarter clearly did not meet our expectation in sales growth.
Profitability and cash flow were actually better on a margin, return and cash conversion standpoint. Growth is the key
issue. However, there is slight improvement in momentum, and the key issue for us as we go into this fourth quarter
and finish this year, is to make that happen and convert.
So where we sit today, we've got to convert, we've got to get the orders, we've got to reduce the backlog, and then
deliver the profitability, which I believe we're set up to do for the remaining part of this year. But again, I'll remind
everybody around the world right now, the geopolitical situations are probably some of the worst I've ever seen. And
relative to what we face as a global company, for every good market out there, I have another market that concerns me.
And that's something we have to deal with as a company, and something I have to deal with as a CEO and the [ph] OC
have to deal – (15:07) and we're dealing with that. But it is a concern.
So I'll do that, I'll open the floor for people to ask questions. But again, I want to thank the corporate executives that did
a great job this year – this quarter as we brought the quarter in, and also thank all the operating executives out there
delivering a very strong profit and return quarter for our shareholders.
So with that, Pat, I'll open it up, Frank. Let's take some questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Gautam J. Khanna>: Yes. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're doing at
Network Power to kind of improve the margins now with the new portfolio. And is it realistic to assume kind of
double-digit margins in Q4 and throughout fiscal 2015 based on what you're doing? Then I have a follow up.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I think the key issue for us is, the order pace continues to be good for us. The key issue
for us at this point in time is the new proxy coming out. It's just a function of converting that and getting the costs in
line. I still believe that we'll see double-digit margins in the fourth quarter. And I – from my perspective, we're seeing
the growth pick up, we're starting to see a better mix of the business, we're starting to see, what I'd call, the more
transactional business start to improve.
We've had some very good large projects around the world, which are obviously a little bit lower margin for us. But the
growth rate is starting to build. So I feel from the standpoint of the product, our solutions organization and the

management focus on this, the underlying value of the business is continuing to improve and we'll continue to move
towards delivering higher margins and reaching that double-digit margin as we go into 2015.
<Q - Gautam J. Khanna>: Okay. Just a quick follow up. You upped the share buyback a bit this year. If you can just
talk generally about your cash deployments, kind of priorities as we look to the next fiscal, you were a little higher on
share buyback than you were M&A this year. Is that sort of what we should expect going forward? Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: First of all, I don't think there's going to be much change relative to the mix, relative to the
ratios, I've given out to you. Our actual acquisitions were actually higher than our share repurchase. We did about $1.4
billion of acquisitions, and we – we're going be doing about $1 billion of share repurchase. We paid back $1.2 billion to
our shareholders in dividends. We just announced our 48th year of increased dividends to our shareholders. 58, I'm
sorry, 58th, I can't even count anymore. And then I think internally, we've raised our capital. Our capital spending will
be over $800 million this year, up strongly from last year's around $700 million, as we continue to invest in innovation
and new products and our global footprint. As I look at next year, assuming the same type of improvement in cash flow
generation, you're going to see us probably buying back at a stock level around the same level, maybe a little higher if
we complete the divestiture of PTS as we committed.
If we do sell PTS, we'll take that cash proceeds and return that to the shareholder and share repurchase, which would
cause us to actually do a lot more in share repurchase. But right now, I'd say the acquisitions as we're planning them it's
going to be somewhere between $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The dividend will go – as I anticipate, I see no reason given
our earnings and cash flow capabilities we'll increase our dividend next year. We'll make that decision in November.
And our capital investment internally is going be somewhere in the $800 million to $850 million range. So that's where
we're looking at right now, not much – a big change from this year.
<Q - Gautam J. Khanna>: Thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question will come from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Or good afternoon I should say. Good morning someplace, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: A couple of things, can you maybe talk a little bit about that backlog conversion that you
referenced so many times? What are the hurdles to actually getting that done? Is it operational or is it customer release
of orders? How much of this is dependent on Emerson and how much is dependent upon your customers at this point?
<A - David N. Farr>: Steve, from our perspective right now, we have the capacity and ability to produce. It's not an
issue. There's no bottleneck. We've made the investments on a global basis to produce. It's very much industrial process
and Network Power focused. It's a function of to clear the customer, continue to want to spend the money and complete
the projects or the investments they're making.
So, right now we are not negating items relative to this. It's a function of our global customer base. And it's very broad;
it's not one or two customers. Our backlog, typically we would not have this big of a difference between our order pace,
which are running over 5% year-to-date and our sales, which is running less than 3% year-to-date. So this is a little bit
unusual, from my perspective, the order pace again this month was very strong. And is a function of, okay, now let's
get the orders converted and shipped to our customer base. And we're not negating item in that area.

<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: But, Dave, can you dive into that even a little bit? Is the customer – what's the general
sentiment? Is it just that they're moving slowly with projects and then putting the brakes on? Or because of a global
macro situation or what's your sense for why that conversion is slower than historically?
<A - David N. Farr>: The conversion is the uncertainty around the world, be it from a geopolitical situation and the
fact that the underlying growth of the world are substantially below what people thought they were going to be just six
months ago, Steve. I mean just look on what they're watching on CNBC right now. We have a map of Africa with
people sick.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Right, right.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. So the world's talking about negative things.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And in that light I guess as a follow-up, your spending path, not so much on the
CapEx side but on the expense side you've been investing for growth pretty aggressively and have been very vocal
about it coming into this year. Any early read on how that pace progresses as you transition to 2015?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think it's going be a function of what we see happening over the next two or three months on
order pattern. Do we see the underlying economic trends continue to improve, which they are improving, but very
gradually. And we'll look and see where we stand relative to what we got done this year and we'll go through that
internally. But a lot of these investment programs are not one-year type of programs. These are investments we're
making for the longer term. So we're going to continue to raise our profitability next year and we'll continue to invest
and continue to figure out how to position the company for faster growth and, what I would call, a more challenging
environment around the world for the next couple of years.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay, great. All right, thanks, Dave. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, Steve. Thanks.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks. Just on the...
<A - David N. Farr>: Hi.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Just on the margins, even with the sales falling short, it looks like the gross margin
you're kind of on track to hit that 100 bps improvement this year. So the culprit seems to be more around SG&A. Is
there anything unusual there in that number this year, that should reverse?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, as you well know, we've raised the levels; we talked about in February for our internal
investments relative to certain programs from the new products, the innovation, and our investment in the solutions and
service organizations. We have maintained that even though underlying sales are slightly below what we thought they
would be year-to-date because we fundamentally believe in what we're doing for the long-term. Therefore, we're
obviously converting GP and we're putting money back in the company and not quite giving as much back to the
shareholders at this point in time. Even though the GP is going up and EBIT margins are going up, they're not going up
as much as you would expect if we had higher sales growth.
So the key issue for me is as we get into the next year planning cycle is, okay, where do we modulate the continued
investments and do see we continued GP expansion, which I do believe we'll see. And the question is, do we see
continued improvement in the underlying business spending environment, which we've been seeing the last three or
four months. And now we've just got to make sure that it's converted as we go into 2015. That's what I look at right
now, Julian.

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then I guess if you look at Process Management, the last few years,
margins are pretty stable going back to 2011. Do you think when you look at the mix of backlog and the sort of
investment requirements from here, the margins are probably like to be flattish sort of for the medium term as well?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, I would expect us to build into a very flattish margin for 2015 for Process Management. I
would expect even though the growth rate will be a little bit better next year given the backlog and the pace of business
we see out there, I do expect us continue to make some significant investments. And some of the capacity that we're
putting in place right now for our international business relative to Process and also even in the U.S., will be coming
online, which will create obviously a somewhat negative margin pressure, but I think the growth will offset that. So at
this point in time, we continue to invest. We're trying to invest the technology and the capacity that's necessary to grow
the business nicely and also make sure we invest in the future and not just [ph] melt (25:01) the profitability of this
business, which as you well know, very strong.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care. Thank you.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I just wanted to turn your attention back to Network Power. And I'm just wondering, Dave, the
pressure you're seeing on margins there, is price a factor? Or is the sharp [indiscernible] (25:31) decline you've seen in
LatAm and the Middle East, is that a bigger factor for those margins?
<A - David N. Farr>: The lack of more margin improvement in the third quarter would be two reasons. One, the direct
drop-off in the Middle East and secondly would be the fact that there was more larger projects, big project wins in there
with the new business versus what I would call the day-to-day transactional, the core business, which had slowed down
in parts of North America. Those are the two things that caused that margin pressure in that third quarter not seeing as
much expansion. I don't see the Middle East turning around and the key thing right now would be as we go forward
here is the continued mix and seeing some of the core business. We're seeing a little bit of that already improvement in
North America, but that's clearly what's going to be key to us relative to making the improved margins as we go in the
fourth quarter and then we go into 2015.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's great. And I appreciate the color on July orders, Dave. The acceleration too, I think you
said, double-digits within the month of July, how broad-based was that acceleration? Was it primarily within Process
Management or was it a bit broader than that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Nope. It's pretty across the board. Everyone has at least a five in front of their name.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, great. And then on the backlog, finally, obviously a lot of it depends on when customers
actually want to have their orders shipped. But any visibility when you expect to see Process Management reaccelerate
in terms of sales?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would expect the Process to have a little bit better quarter this quarter in sales. A lot of – you
know there's a couple of things that go on in our business. We are a fiscal year ending September, obviously a lot of
things that happen relative to people driving to make their targets and bonuses. And they actually have the orders. So
I'd expect to see a little bit of improvement this year, the fourth quarter in Process. I expect the first half to be better
growth rate than we saw last year. So I think that's what we see at this point in time. It's really a function of what
happens in the North American and European business pace as we go forward here in the next couple of months in
orders. I think the next three quarters should be better growth for the Process business.

Next we'll hear from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hello. Could we come back to the investment? No, no, I am in the office, can you hear me
okay?
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: Yeah, we can hear you. Yeah, just barely. It's a bad line.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I just wanted to come back to the investment spending, Dave. Are you guys tracking to that
$110 million incremental you talked about at the February Analyst Day? And when you say we'll look at modulating as
we kind of plan in the year ahead, does that mean you're planning a lower rate of growth or an actual decline in that
number? How do we think about that going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think, we are tracking towards the $110 million. We've held very, very tight. We might have
moved pieces around, but we've held very tight to the incremental programs. As we've – what I'm looking at right now,
when I'm trying to – when I try to express that is, as I look at the underlying global industrial environment, that it
continues to improve, and we continue to see the underlying growth rates slowly continue to move back up, which then
we'll be able to convert into sales. And I see a [ph] momentum and I figure – did I get this – try (29:06) to get us above
that 4% underlying growth rate, and we may actually increase it slightly, but I'm trying to keep it in line to where we
can grow the business and have some margin improvement next year in 2015. So I'm going to look at what's working,
what's not working.
The other key issue for me right now, Jeff, is, in certain markets, emerging markets around the world, as I discussed
with my board today, the markets we've made significant investments the last several years, even going way back 10
years ago, but we've made even more in the last couple years. If I sense those markets are going to really struggle for
the next 12 months to 18 months, I will pull back the reins. And that would obviously – that's a function of my
concerns, or concerns about certain emerging markets, let's put it that way. Not total emerging markets, but pieces of
certain emerging markets.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And conversely then, Dave, what you just described, maybe you could say is a potential shift
from offense to defense. Should we then expect restructuring to go up, it came in a little lighter than I thought here in
Q3. What do you think about restructuring going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't think I'm moving to go to defense quite yet. I'm still offense – I'm still on offense, Jeff. I
think that from my perspective, I'm just talking about – I may go back and not – we've already made a lot of
investments. For instance, India is a classic example. We've made significant investments in India for the last four
years. India had a very difficult 18 months, its order pattern is up nicely, it's just starting to turn around. And therefore,
do I need to really put a lot more into India? We'll put some, but it's not going to be as aggressive as we have been
doing.
I'm not – definitely not shifting back into defensive mode right now, and I do not anticipate restructuring to be higher
next year than this year. I just don't see it. We've been – we've gone through massive restructuring where we've been
investing, and I think the world from a stability standpoint, from what we need to get done, we've got done. There's a
couple other places but I would bet right now, my restructuring number will be less in 2015 than it is in 2014.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah, maybe just...

<A - David N. Farr>: Pension.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Pension? Well, when we look at it right now, the discount rate is down about 50 basis
points from where we ended last year. So if that holds, we're going to see pension as a little bit of a headwind next year.

Moving on we'll hear from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thank you. Good afternoon. Dave, on the backlog – excuse me, up 20% year-to-date, I
think you typically have some pretty good build to this point in the year. What's sort of the normal range of how it
builds from the beginning of the year into entering the fourth quarter?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say the 20% is abnormal. I would say typically, and we had a discussion with the board
today, the directors are asking the very same question. I mean, as you well know, guiding this thing and what's going
on in the world right now is not that easy. But typically, if we were going to – if we're growing our orders 5%, 5.5%,
6%, we typically would see only a point and a half of that basically going into backlog. We would see backlog building
and we'd convert a little bit more.
So that's the order of magnitude normal. Right now it's a little bit higher than that. So we've had some bigger, larger
projects which are going to be over multiple years, which are built in our Process area. And we also have customers
who have had higher growth expectations, which they are dialing those back. So there's a little bit of difference going
on. I don't have any sense -the cancellations aren't an issue for us at this point in time, and we've not seen any
indication of that. It's just, I think people are being – they're stretching their investment dollars right now on us. And
therefore, that's what's causing this delta. So Delta is a – I would say about a point to a point – 150 basis points higher
than normal.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay. And do you have a year-over-year growth number for backlog?
<A - David N. Farr>: I do not off the top of my head. What we were in end of July last year. Are you talking about – I
mean June to June, correct?
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Yeah.
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't know. I don't know that off the top of my head. I mean, Pat can look it up. He's – Frank is
looking through his book right now.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay. That's good to hear.
<A - David N. Farr>: But I don't know – Pat doesn't do anything frantically. He's calculating right now. And Frank's
going, oh my God, Pat's going to give him a number [indiscernible] (33:33) by the CFO.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: We got to keep you busy while they're busy.
<A - David N. Farr>: That's it. Here we go. We got it right here.
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: It's up about 11% year-on-year.

<A - David N. Farr>: We historically reduced it in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Right. And then if you could even just vaguely sort of handicap the segments versus the
multiyear CAGRs you laid out earlier in the year for 2015?
<A - David N. Farr>: The multiyear okay – okay, right now, okay, yeah, I'll give you early, early gut. I'm not going to
give you numbers. I know what he wants. He wants me to say versus my long-term growth rate for the segment. I
would say right now, if you go February, you're talking February, you got the February picture, the February number I
gave you for Process is what, do you remember?
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: 5% to 7%.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say that Process is going to be in that – I would say that Process will be in the next –
that would be the next three years, I think I had there, three years is that what that was? What I've got there. Pat's got it
right here. You said 5% to 7%. I would say they're going to be in that range right now. They're still in that range. I'd say
Climate, net 6% is going to be in that range. Right now Commercial Residential will be in that range. Network Power, I
think has the potential to be in – slightly above the range I gave you of 3% to 5%. And Industrial Automation I think
will probably be in that range at this point in time.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Great. Thanks for that.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think the progress we've been making in Network Power on the global reach and the
technology and the product are really starting to pay off.

[Operator Instructions] Next we'll hear from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Rich. How you doing?
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: All right. Industrial Automation, in the next couple of quarters with CAT's numbers down on
the power gen side over the last few months; how do we think about that playing out near-term for the business? I
assume there's some deceleration here expected, but if you could provide some color that would be great.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, Caterpillar is not only a customer in this space and our non-CAT businesses are still been
doing pretty good. We've gained some other market space around the world, so we've seen a better non-CAT
environment. CAT is still working through its inventory issues, but the key thing for me right now is continued
improvement in our European business space for Industrial Automation. But right now the CAT is always a concern,
but right now I'm more interested in other non-CAT in the alternator space than anything else, which is [indiscernible]
(36:18)
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: So the momentum in the non-CAT stuff is there to at least to be a decent offset to what you're
seeing on the CAT side, is the way we should think about it?
<A - David N. Farr>: Correct.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay.

<A - David N. Farr>: Correct. And also the CAT stuff, CAT typically, what they're doing right now may impact us
further, maybe in three or four months versus today. Typically they don't react like – okay, they had a bad month this
month, let's adjust that quick, they may take a couple of months because they're volatile too and they have to be careful
they don't turn things up or down that rapidly.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Right. Okay. And then just on – staying on IA, just what do you see in terms of assets for that
business? I know that's the focal point for M&A dollars. And what are you seeing in terms of attractiveness of assets
and trying to bolster the portfolio there?
<A - David N. Farr>: We continue to look for assets. We have honestly have not made or found anything of substance
this year in the assets. It's been mostly a Process and a little bit of Network Power, nothing in Industrial Automation
and I would say right now we have nothing going on in Industrial Automation, even though that asset space is very
interesting to us. Prices are pretty high at this point in time. So we're still looking. We're not in any big hurry here.

Next we'll hear from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Mr. Tusa.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So just on Network Power, [indiscernible] (37:49) numbers previously. The margin in the third
quarter of 2013 ex-embedded was what? It's a lumpy business in second half, so I just wanted to make sure I was
looking at that the right way.
<A - David N. Farr>: About the same. About the same.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So, 8.1%?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, about the same. Around 8%.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So for the year, in Network Power, where do you now think that that margin is going to
come in? I think the prior guide was 9.7% to 10%?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say it's going to be at the low end. It's not going to reach 10% for the year. And so it's
going be the low end around 9%, between 9%, 9.2%, somewhere around there.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, okay. And so I guess in the context of stuff is growing a little bit here, again you're kind
of down year-over-year in the margin even though kind of I think the core revenues are flat to up, so is this – these big
projects are these kind of like the mix impacts on the big projects. Is that something that's with you going forward or
how does that dynamic change to improve profitability there over the next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think the key issue for us is, as we had a slowdown in the core what I call the traditional space,
in the last three or four months and that business is starting to pick back up. The project business is, it was a bigger mix
this quarter and that happens from time to time as this marketplace has changed. We see that happening. And as we
continue to work on the cost of the new products, so I see this business getting in a solid 9% EBIT margin for the year,
as we finish this year. And then move on up from there as we get into 10% plus as we go into 2015. That's how we see
it at this point in time. And you're always going to have this big project mix come in and out. But the key to me is
getting that install base in there and then getting our service organization and to create value for us in the long-term.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then just one last question, more detailed, you mentioned pension. In the last couple
of years, there has been ERP investment, incentive comp. There has been a lot of kind of non-fundamental stuff moving
around. Anything else now for [audio gap] (40:11) that you want to highlight with regards to the non-fundamental type
of stuff?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, we'll continue to – continue the investments in ERP as we go in and finish off Network
Power and Climate. The pension interest rate continue to drop and we'll have issue there, but I don't think it's going to
be a big headwind for us next year. I don't see us having a comp – comps can drop a little bit next year. So it's not –
nothing big at this point in time. Restructuring probably, the odds are pretty high. It would be slightly less than this
year. So I don't see anything big moving next year, Steve, to be honest, plus or minus.

Next we'll hear from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hi, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hi, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hey, Dave. So, I'm just thinking about next year. So it sounds sort of like we're building some
momentum in some of these businesses. We're going to do maybe 3% organic this year, hopefully a little bit better than
that next year. If you put it all together, how are you thinking about the prospects for perhaps doing double-digit
earnings per share growth in 2015 fiscal?
<A - David N. Farr>: A little too early to talk about that, John. I think that it's a function of – we got – I got to see –
it's definitely too early to talk about that because I've got to see how the underlying business spending environment
continues to improve as we finish this calendar year. I would say that we've been a little bit unusual, at least our
spending this year because we're making some strategic investments. And the question – some of our other customers
have not, so the question is, will they start turning it on, I think they're going to have to turn it on because they've, in
my opinion, they've been underinvested in certain areas. So it's really a function, can we get above – for me I need to
get this number above 4% underlying sales growth as you well know to really start see an acceleration. I'm not ready to
make that call yet. So I mean it's too early to call, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: That's fair. It sounds like if it's going to happen, though, it's probably – would it be fair to say it's
more likely to be a backend loaded year? Is that the way you're thinking about it or is that also too early to tell?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's too early to tell. I'm hoping that there's momentum going out of this fiscal year going into the
calendar year. But it's still too early to tell. It's really a function -okay, as we – they just put a GDP number out there.
It's a pretty decent number. Now, how real is that number and is there a momentum coming around that? And can
Europe sustain this improvement? And does the whole thing in the Eastern Europe/Russia situation, does that get
worse? And then also, can – China continues to improve for us. Can that maintain? So there are a lot of things going
our way, but there're also some concerns I have as I said in other parts of the world. So I think it's a little bit early to
see. There's too many, what I call, question marks out there.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, no, that's fair. The down Middle East numbers for Process, is that being driven by
presumably to a degree some of the political strife you're seeing in the region. Is it also a function of I think of some of
the energy companies redirecting perhaps some of their own CapEx dollars back to North America or is it more of an
Emerson-specific timing issue or what's really going on there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Not really a redirection of capital spend from U.S. companies back to this country. The
countries that are investing in the Middle East typically are going to continue to invest in the Middle East.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: It's just a function – our customers in Middle East basically are redirecting where they spend
their money and how they spend their money, and have really slowed down their spending on oil and gas and chemical
investments in the Middle East. And I think as long as the turmoil continues in the Middle East, I think that will
continue to be a concern for our customer base and then obviously for me.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. So you – it's not a question of redirection. You're saying your customers you think are
slowing in the Middle East simply because of the political turmoil that's kind of happening. It's like an uncertainty
climate or whatever. Is that what you think is happening?
<A - David N. Farr>: That's what we're seeing. That's exactly what we're seeing. They're spending money not with us
but with other people.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Understood. Okay and then...
<A - David N. Farr>: Other industries.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Other industries. And then just lastly, right, so we've had pretty soft industrial markets for a little
while, this pullback in industrial company share pricing. I mean, are you considering possibly some larger portfolio
actions on the acquisition or divestiture side? Or possibly even raising more debt, perhaps, you seem to have a lot of
debt capacity to repurchase your shares?
<A - David N. Farr>: Not at this very point in time. No. Let's see how the things unfold.

Next we'll hear from Jeremie Capron with CLSA.
<Q - Grace Lee>: Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. We have a
question on China. Hello can you hear me fine?
<A - David N. Farr>: I can hear you fine.
<Q - Grace Lee>: Okay. So our question is on China. Just wondering, the prospect of growth in China, noted that
Emerson has seen good growth from China for the past couple of quarters. Do you expect this growth to continue
through the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 amid a weakening construction market as well as a tight credit environment
in China?
<A - David N. Farr>: What we've seen so far, Grace, is as follows. One, we've had four very strong quarters. In fact, if
you take the last four, we've averaged over 8% for the last 12 months, underlying sales growth in China. Our orders
have been in that range too. We had a very strong fourth quarter last year. So I would expect our fourth fiscal quarter
this quarter to be positive, but not as good as we've seen in the last two or three quarters. It's just a comparison issue.
And so I just think we're going to have a good number for China for fourth quarter.
As I look at 2015, our investment profile right now is still decent. I expect us to see between 5% and 8% growth
coming out of China next year, based on what I am seeing from our new product, based on our customer base and
based on the industries we serve. So right now as I look at the current expectation from my folks and where we are
right now in China, China looks like it's going to be growing for us. And it might be growing slightly less or about in
line with what we saw this year.

<Q - Mark Douglass>: In Cleveland.
<A - David N. Farr>: Cleveland. Are the Indians going to make the playoffs this year?
<Q - Mark Douglass>: There's a good chance, but unfortunately I'm a Cubs fan, so.
<A - David N. Farr>: How can you be a Cubs fan in Cleveland?
<Q - Mark Douglass>: I grew up in Chicago.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. I'm kidding. I'm a Cardinals fan, if you hadn't figured that. And Frank's a Yankee fan.
And Pat, we can't figure out exactly what he is.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: He's a football fan.
<A - David N. Farr>: He's a football fan. But yeah, I've got a Yankee fan and a Cardinals fan here. And I think did we
win the last World Series against the Yankees or did you guys beat us, Frank?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: That would have been 50 years ago.
<A - David N. Farr>: You and I are 50 plus years, so we both were alive back then, I heard the game. I watched it.
Okay. Go ahead. Enough about baseball, Mark. Go ahead.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: All right. Yes. On Europe and Industrial Automation, I would assume it would have been a
little better just seeing some of the macro data to Europe, especially northern, it seems to be a little bit better. Was it a
broad pullback for you in Industrial Automation there, or certain regions or products that hampered the growth?
<A - David N. Farr>: Three things. We are very strong in Industrial Automation in France. That economy is still
negative. Next key market for us is Italy. I can't say much help there either. And the third key issue is our alternator
business with Caterpillar, it's still pretty weak in Europe. Those three things were the three issues that hurt us in
Industrial Automation. You take those three out, we did very well. But unfortunately, those were three big things.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Yeah, [indiscernible] (48:30) related to the mix and where you happen to be exposed?
<A - David N. Farr>: You got it. We need France to come back. France is – we are very strong in France.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: And the tour didn't help you out there, did it?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, did not. Neither the World Cup.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: On Network Power, how is Trellis doing in Network Power? Are you getting the results you
expected with the improvements there? And is that going to help margins, or is it still margin-dilutive right now? And
what are you seeing right now in Trellis and expecting to see...
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say the trend line's still positive. It's not as fast because of some of the North America
projects have been weaker for us in the last six months. But it's still positive, it's still doing better than last year, not
doing as well as we wanted to do. But it's still doing better than last year. It's got good momentum, the profitability is

good. It's not a profit dilution from that perspective. The key issue for us is, continue to try to get the North America
spend, in particular the financial industry which has not been very good to come back up. So I would say, we're still
pleased with the progress we're making on Trellis. It's not as far along as we want it to be, but we're still pleased with it.

Next we'll hear from Jonathan Wright with Nomura.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Hey, guys. If I could just go back to Industrial Automation for a second. So I think we
covered off the geographies. Just, in February you highlighted a lot of new product launches you had rolling out over
the course of this year. It seemed motors and drives are still struggling. I would have thought you maybe would have
got a bit of an impetus from that bit of the business. Can you just talk about the – how those products have been
received? I mean, just tell me what you expect to see sort of going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: The motors and drives part of our new products are doing very well on the order side. We have a
lot locked up in orders, have not converted to orders, in Industrial Automation in particular, and what I call on the
control technique side has – have been very good. We just have not converted them yet. The customer base is slowly
converting those things based on their projects as they slowed them down. So the conversion and acceptance of new
products on the order run rate is very, very good. It's just right now we've got to get our end customer to convert.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay. And then maybe just sticking with that, I think we've talked a little bit about
why people aren't converting. You've mentioned, sort of, political risk and the general sort of climate of nervousness
around economic growth. Why do you think the order growth is remaining so robust given those concerns? I kind of
understand the weakness on the conversion side, but the order growth seems quite strong considering that.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think it's – a lot of it is relative to our investments in the programs we have going on, as we
invest in sales organization and as we invest in our service and solution organizations. So we're actually expanding
what I would say are see and get, go out and find it and get it and convert it. And just the customer base has taken a
little longer to convert because I think they're uncertain.
But what I like right now is the momentum relative to the new products. The momentum on the sales side is very
positive, and now we've just got to make sure the customer base continues to take the product. And I think that
standpoint is very good, and I can understand why some of the customers are getting nervous about slowing things
down. But I like the fact that we're – I would say we're increasing our penetration and we're increasing our position on
a global basis based on my order pace, and that's a good sign. A very good sign.
<Q - Jonathan David Wright>: Okay ,great. Thanks, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, Jonathan. All the best to you.

<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question on your CapEx spending. Where are you spending your incremental CapEx?
Where are you adding capacity by geography or product-wise? And what are the areas that you're downsizing, as long
as we're on that?
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. Relative to capacity right now, I don't think I'm taking much capacity offline. From a
capacity standpoint, [indiscernible] (52:51) capacity quite a bit in Process Management. We're adding – and we're
adding capacity in Process Management both in U.S., Mexico, Eastern Europe.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And...
<A - David N. Farr>: And China. And then – and not much expansion on Industrial Automation. And then on
Network Power, we've been repositioning some of our North Asia assets to South Asia, and then also into Eastern
Europe. And probably early – probably the next couple months, Mexico.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Are you guys expecting to see any impact from Russia sanctions in the energy sector?
<A - David N. Farr>: If they continue to ratchet them up, eventually that will – eventually hurt our Process
Management business. And I mean as we've said in the past, we do about a half a billion dollars in Russia and very
much oil and gas-centric. If the sanctions continue to go up, then eventually we're going to see. And we've been seeing
our business weaken as it is anyway so we're already starting to have the impact on, in this quarter last quarter, it was
negative on us. And I expect that to continue.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just a follow-up question, on Climate; Europe actually seem to be pretty good. How does
this square with your comments about Europe slowing?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, Europe, it depends what part of Europe.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Got you.
<A - David N. Farr>: Now Climate's strength is primarily North Europe. And so from the perspective of the customer
base for Climate, the North Europe and some of the further parts east, it's been pretty good for them. And they're now
strong in Italy and strong in France. So the marketplace for those guys have been pretty good. And the technology
investments they are making for efficiency and some of the changes they're making in refrigerants have been positive
for us, so different dynamic. Unfortunately not all the market's reacting the same within our company right now.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Terrific. Thank you very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome Andrew. Take care now.

We'll take the follow up from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, sorry just...
<A - David N. Farr>: You snuck in the back door, Tusa. What are you doing? Are you trying to steal some apples or
something?
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah, it's my style. The Climate tech margins are pretty good obviously, 21%. And I think you're
going to end up being kind of flattish this year annually. Is that a process – similar to Process where you're investing a
lot of money there? And so should we think about 19%, 18.5% to 19% as a good, kind of longer-term run rate?

<A - David N. Farr>: I think for the next couple of years, I think that margin is going to stay about where it is right
now. It could start inching up. We have a couple of major investments going on right now in variable speed. We have a
couple major investments going on for the new refrigerants and we have a major investment and some very important
new product launches in the commercial space both in China and in North America that have increased our investment
profile. So I think that will continue for this year, next year and potentially part of 2016, but I would expect if the
business continues to trend well, we should be able to improve our profitability because our mix is getting stronger,
stronger towards commercial, the industrial, and server space. And that is starting to pay off as you can see from our
profitability.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So modest improvement with investment offsetting better mix?
<A - David N. Farr>: You got it.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then one last question, restructuring for this year, I don't think you mentioned a
number. It seems like it's going be coming in lower than the $75 million?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: I think it will come in $65 million, $70 million.
<A - David N. Farr>: $65 million, $70 million.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. $65 million, $70 million. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: If I was looking at next year, Steve, since you came in the back door, I would say $60 million to
$70 million.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: All the best.
David N. Farr
And I want to thank again everybody on the phone today. I really appreciate. I also want to thank all, again the
