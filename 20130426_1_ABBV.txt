Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for AbbVie's first quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. Today, we're pleased to report strong results in our first quarter as an independent company with
adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. We delivered this strong
performance despite the decline in TriCor sales due to generic competition. During the quarter, we executed on
AbbVie's key priorities. We drove continued growth of HUMIRA with more than 17% global operational growth. We
advanced our pipeline with continued progress across our mid and late stage R&D programs. This includes our Phase 3
HCV program which is well underway and enrolling rapidly and we delivered return to our shareholders through a
strong dividend.
As we said before, 2013 is a year of transition as we absorb the impact from the loss of exclusivity of our lipids
franchise. But 2013 is also a year of execution across both our commercial portfolio and our pipeline and we're off to a
strong start on all fronts. As I mentioned, we continued to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, particularly robust
growth in dermatology and GI. Our global launch of UC is going well with strong update in both the U.S. and Europe.
Beyond UC, we continue our development efforts for HUMIRA with several new indications currently in late stage
trials. We expect a cadence of data, registrations, and regulatory approvals over the next few years. This includes our
U.S. regulatory application for axial SpA, which is currently under review, and we also expect to submit our U.S.
regulatory application for pediatric Crohn's disease in the coming months.
HUMIRA currently offers the broadest label in the category. Several of the new indications we are pursuing will be
unique. Unique to our label and will help us further differentiate from competitive products and add to the
sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. All told we expect new indications including those approved in 2012 to
add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global peak year sales.
As we track new product entrants, performance continues to be in line with our expectations with HUMIRA continuing
to gain or hold market share across all indications. Bill will talk more about HUMIRA and our other product
performance in the quarter as well as our expectations for the year. But it's fair to say that HUMIRA's off to a strong
start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the product in 2013.
Now, moving to our pipeline, as a biopharmaceutical company, advancing our pipeline is paramount to our long-term
success. We're focused on delivering innovative therapies to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need and
we're encouraged with our progress. Over the past year, we've advanced two promising programs in the Phase 3
development including our interferon-free HCV program which I'll discuss in more detail here in a moment.
We also expect to advance seven additional programs in the late stage clinical trials over the next 12 to 18 months. For
example, atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in development with diabetic kidney disease. We'll present
results of our Phase 2b study at the European Renal Association meeting next month and we're on track to initiate the

Phase 3 program in the first half of this year. ABT-199, our next generation BcL-2 inhibitor in development in
partnership with Roche/Genentech has shown strong activity in hematological malignancies. Earlier this month, we
presented Phase 1 data showing patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with ABT-199 experienced rapid
tumor reduction. We'll present additional data at the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings in June.
As discussed on our last quarterly conference call, late last year, we paused dose escalations and recruitment in several
ABT-199 studies as we work to refine the dosing and monitoring approach for patients at risk for tumor lysis
syndrome. We recently proposed an amended study protocol for ABT-199 and CLL. Upon approval by the FDA, dose
escalation and new patient recruitment will resume. It remains our goal to initiate Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in
relapse or refractory CLL patients this year. We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm for this compound which
we believe holds promise in a number of hematological malignancies. ABT-888 is another compound within our
oncology pipeline poised to advance into Phase 3 in early 2014. ABT-888 is a PARP inhibitor. It has shown promise in
enhancing the effectiveness of common cancer therapy such as chemotherapy and radiation. It's currently in Phase 2b
for BRCA-deficient breast cancer and other cancers.
ABT-126 is our alpha7 NNR agonist currently in Phase 2b trials for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment
associated with schizophrenia. Data from our Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in Alzheimer's disease will be presented
at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July and we'll present results from the schizophrenia study
in 2014. Provided our Phase 2b clinical work is successful, we'll initiate Phase 3 trials in both indications in 2014.
ABT-719, our novel investigational compound for the prevention of acute kidney injury. Additional confirmatory
Phase 2b study is currently ongoing and will enable Phase 3 initiation in early 2014. Elagolix is a compound with a
unique profile, currently in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids, both prevalent conditions with huge
treatment options. Our Phase 3 program for endometriosis is ongoing and we recently initiated a Phase 2b study in
uterine fibroids. Again, pending success in our mid-stage trial, the fibroid program is also poised to advance to Phase 3
next year.
So as you can see, we have a number of exciting programs on track to advance to Phase 3 development over the next
year or so. In addition to these assets, we have several other promising compounds already in late stage development.
This includes daclizumab, which is in Phase 3 development in partnership with Biogen for relapsing remitting multiple
sclerosis. Data from the first of two registrational trials of SELECT study were recently published in The Lancet and
results of the second year extension of that study called SELECTION were recently presented at the American
Academy of Neurology meeting. We expect results from the second pivotal study in 2014.
And finally, a central program within our late stage pipeline is our interferon-free HCV combination. All the Phase 3
studies that will be included in our initial registration are now underway and enrolling very well, in fact ahead of
expectations. As we said before, the primary focus of our program is on delivering interferon-free treatments that offer
patients the best chance for cure. Our approach is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types from naive
patients to the most difficult to treat with the simplest possible therapy. Earlier this week, at the EASL meeting in
Amsterdam, we presented data from our large Phase 2b AVIATOR study, showing that conditions which reduce
response to interferon-based therapies, such as the level of fibrosis or IL28B genotype, do not impact response to our
interferon-free therapy. We expect our Phase 3 study to begin to read out later this year and into 2014. Supporting
registration submission in mid-2014, given that our compounds have been granted fast track status by the FDA, we
expect market entry in early 2015.
So in summary, we've delivered a strong first quarter and we continue to drive strong performance with our flagship
product, HUMIRA, as well as other products in our specialty focused portfolio. And we continue to make notable
progress in advancing our pipeline, which we believe includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to
address significant medical need. For a company of our size, the potential sales projections from our late stage pipeline
represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth beginning in the 2015 timeframe.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?

William J. Chase
Thank you, Rick. Today, I'll spend some time talking about our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to our outlook
for the remainder of 2013. As Rick said, we're very pleased with the strong first quarter we delivered. Total sales
increased 5.1% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable 1.4% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding
TriCor/TRILIPIX, due to loss of exclusivity, sales increased 8.6% on an operational basis. The first quarter adjusted
gross margin ratio was 76.2%, excluding intangible amortization and other specified items, in line with our expectation
for the quarter. This reflects both the loss of exclusivity within our lipid franchise as well as the effect of unfavorable
foreign exchange on the ratio.
Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in the first quarter including continued investment in our growth brands and the
incremental costs of becoming an independent company. This level of investment was in line with our expectations for
the quarter and we remain on track for a full year adjusted SG&A of around 26% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 14.6% of
sales in the first quarter, reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging, mid and late stage pipeline and the
continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications.
Net interest expense was $66 million in the first quarter, and other income was $18 million. The adjusted tax rate was
22.2% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and
specified items, were $0.68, which exceeded our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.60 per
share.
Turning to product sales in the quarter, HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $2.2 billion, up more than 17%
on an operational basis. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 24%, driven by continued market expansion and
share gains in the derm and gastro segments. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 13% on an operational basis, and
nearly 11% on a reported basis, as a result of strong market growth and some modest benefit from tender timing. As we
look to the second quarter for international's HUMIRA sales specifically, we'd expect a modest negative impact from
tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil. On a global basis however, we expect low double-digit sales growth
for HUMIRA in the second quarter, in line with our full-year outlook.
AndroGel sales were up low single-digits in the quarter following strong 2012 performance. AndroGel continues to
maintain more than 60% share of the testosterone replacement market. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a
moderation in the rate of overall market growth, as well as the year-over-year impact of rebating actions implemented
in mid-2012. Based on current trends, we're forecasting AndroGel sales growth in the mid- single digits for 2013.
Global sales of Lupron were approximately $180 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2013, we expect Lupron
sales to be roughly in line with 2012.
Moving on to our Lipid franchise, TriCor/TRILIPIX sales were $128 million in the quarter, down roughly 50% due to
the entry of generic fenofibrate in November of 2012. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $186 million in the quarter, down
2.6%. As a reminder, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a
decline of roughly $1.2 billion, which will be exhibited more acutely in the second half of the year. We plan to offset
our lipid franchise decline through growth of key marketed products including HUMIRA.
Moving onto Synthroid where U.S. sales were $119 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty
and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year, we expect to see
Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. U.S. sales of Creon were $90 million in the first quarter, up more than
32% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where
we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. This quarter, we received FDA approval for a new
dosage strength of Creon. The new 36,000 lipase-unit dose is the highest available, which may help to reduce pill
burden for some patients. This approval further strengthens our leadership position because we are able to offer patients
the broadest range of dosage strengths in the class. In 2013, we expect U.S. Creon sales to grow at a low double-digit
pace.
Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease performed well in the first quarter with growth of more than
8%. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. We completed registrational studies last

year and are in the process of pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.
Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook, we are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.03 to
$3.13. This guidance continues to contemplate sales somewhat above $18 billion, reflecting growth from key brands
offsetting the expected decline in lipids. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange
of slightly less than 1%. We're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% for the full year, excluding non-cash
amortization. This forecast reflects both the impact of loss of exclusivity events and the effect of unfavorable foreign
exchange.
We anticipate R&D expense to be approximately 14.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging
mid and late state pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. And we expect SG&A to be
around 26% of sales. We're forecasting net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year. And we
expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes
$0.37 per share of non-cash intangible amortization expense and certain specified items primarily associated with
separation related costs and ongoing restructuring activities. Earnings per share would be $2.66 to $2.76 on a GAAP
basis.
We're still in the process of quantifying certain one-time costs related to the separation. And we will look to further
refine our forecasts of these specified items as the year progresses. Finally, we expect approximately $6 billion of
operating cash flow in 2013.
Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.80. This excludes roughly
$0.12 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.66 to $0.68. Our
second quarter outlook reflects sales growth in the low single digits on a reported basis including a modest impact from
negative exchange. We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our full year guidance. And
we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full year outlook.
So in conclusion, we're pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Larry Peepo
Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, can you hear me okay?
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: We can.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay, great. So on HUMIRA, sales were up 17% on an operational basis. Bill, you talked about
tendering that could impact international sales, but still, your guidance for the full year of low double digit growth does
assume a, decline in the pace of growth throughout the year. And I'm just wondering if you can talk about why you
expect such a slowdown or if it's just too early in the year to make adjustments to your forecast?
And secondly, if John Leonard is on the phone, I just wanted to ask a question on ABT-199. And – it sounds like you're
making progress with the FDA in refining the trial so that you can remove the pause, but what gives you confidence
that the tumor lysis syndrome is based on a dose response mechanism and not based on the drug mechanism itself?
Thanks very much.

<A - John M. Leonard>: Thanks, Jami. Jami, this is John Leonard, I'll go first. Thanks for the question. Just for
everybody on the phone, let me remind you, we had, at the very end of last year, some instances of tumor lysis
syndrome in some of our early studies with ABT-199. We voluntarily paused enrollment in some of the studies that we
were doing and with the FDA, went on partial clinical hold for the CLL studies. In the last couple of months, we've
very carefully gone back retrospectively looking at all those patients to understand what might be any risk factors for
TLS. And now that we're working with the FDA, so let me give you a sense of exactly where we are.
We've identified risk factors that we think are clearly related to the tumor burden itself. In other words, those patients
that experienced any evidence of TLS all had large tumor burdens associated with it. And with that, we've taken that
into consideration going forward. So, I'm pleased to report that in many instances of multiple myeloma and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we've resumed enrollment, so it's actively going on. And we're in the very final stages of
working with the FDA to resume enrollment in the CLL studies. Essentially what's going on is some final work to
refine the actual prophylactic regimen for handling some well-known side effects of TLS. I think to your question,
Jami, we're pretty confident that one can step through dosing in a graded fashion and have tumor die at a controlled rate
and well-known, well-characterized prophylactic measurements – or measures. We believe that we should be able to
readily handle TLS.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Jami, this is Rick. So, let me answer your HUMIRA question. Certainly, we're off
to a strong start. Now, one of the things that Bill pointed out in his remarks is we did have some tenders move from
second quarter into first quarter, so first quarter is slightly up and we'll see that reverse in second quarter. But all in all,
still overall, if you looked at the average, we have very strong growth. We're also only a quarter into 2013, so it's
probably a little early to change any projections that we have for the product. But I – suffice to say, we're confident
with the performance that we've projected for HUMIRA and we'll just have to see how the rest of the year plays out.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks, Jami.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Good morning.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Good morning. I have three questions on separate drug candidates. First and – I don't think
it's worth going into a lot of detail because there would be too much ground to cover on HCV, but if you could
hopefully just frame, as you see it, the timing of launch for your all-oral regimen and if you could position that relative
to Gilead's timing, that would be helpful in terms of the all-oral regimen. And then second, with respect to ABT-199,
I'm just curious about whether there's any risk of the lower dosing constraining the efficacy, i.e., yielding lower
efficacy. And then finally, with respect to ABT-126, I noticed in the press release that you're hoping to start Phase 3
trials next year. Could you just talk about the timing of news flow for ABT-126 for Alzheimer's and also for cognition
in schizophrenia? Thank you.
<A - John M. Leonard>: Okay, I've been scribbling notes with your questions. Let me take them in reverse. So,
ABT-126, let me give you a sense of where we are, David. We're doing Phase 2b work as we speak and that's meant to
extend the proof of concept, call it, 2a work that was done with modest sized studies and limited dosing. So, what we
want to do is more fully flesh out what the efficacy curve might look like and with that, characterize even higher doses
that we were not in a position to test when we did our first study. Two different indications, you're correct, Alzheimer's
disease as well as cognitive disorders, so schizophrenia or CIAS as it's now called. With respect to the news flow, we
will share the data from that first 2a study in Alzheimer's disease in July at the Alzheimer's meeting and our plans right
now for the CIAS data would be in 2014. We haven't chosen a venue yet, but as we have that, obviously we'll share that
with you.

Let me move onto 199. It's sort of an extension, I think, of Jami's earlier question. The premise of your question, I
think, is a little incorrect if I understood it. I took it to imply that what we're doing is giving lower doses on a
continuous basis to patients, and therefore, the higher doses that we might want to get to may not be reached and
therefore, efficacy might be constrained. That's not what we're doing. Essentially, what we're doing is a walking up
through lower doses and we're convinced that as tumor dies the risk of tumor lysis syndrome will recede because there's
less material from the tumor to be dealt with and therefore you can get to those higher doses that have been associated
with the outstanding activity that we've observed today. So, it may take a little bit longer to get there, which is what
we'll be working out here as we go, but in terms of being able to deliver what we want to deliver for these patients,
we're very confident we're going to be able to get there.
And then finally, HCV was the first question, launch timing. I mean, it's no secret that we're all working as fast as we
can. It's a very competitive space. We have an excellent team on that. They're working flat out. We've communicated
along the way that we would expect a very early 2015 launch. We're confident that we will meet that and we'll see
where Gilead is with respect to that timing as well.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks, David.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just got two really. First off, on
the additional HUMIRA patents that you have submitted to the patent office already, I think they're mainly
manufacturing and formulation patents, can you give us any update on any expected timing of when we might hear
some more news on those? And also, just around that as well, when you might begin to flesh out how new formulation
work around HUMIRA and when we'll get some more visibility on that too. And then the second question is just some
updated thoughts really from you if you have any on the competitive positioning of your hep C cocktail following
recent updates from Gilead and in particular, Bristol-Myers as well. Thank you.
<A - William J. Chase>: Thanks, Jeff. I'll take the HUMIRA patent question and the reformulations and I'll let Dr.
Leonard or Rick go with the latter question. Certainly, we do have a number of patents that we have submitted at this
point in time. You're right to characterize those as process manufacturing, et cetera. Obviously, this is a very
competitive space and we're not going to provide a lot of granularity around what those look like and the timing, but it's
safe to say that we do have a fairly significant and robust portfolio of applications in right now. Obviously, trying to do
as much as we can to protect HUMIRA in the event that biosimilars do find a pathway to market.
In terms of reformulations, again, a similar story. We've talked about opportunities to enhance the product both from a
delivery mechanism as well as the product itself. We're not going to be very specific in terms of what that looks like
and the timing, but again, we are working on those. We have a window here. Our patents don't expire until later in the
decade and we're putting forth as much effort as we can right now to enhance the products such that if someone is
working towards a biosimilar of today's product, that may not be the product that exists down the road. So, I think I'll
leave it at that, Jeff. Hopefully that's helpful.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Jeff, this is Rick. So, on the competitiveness of HCV, as I said in my comments, I mean,
our goal is to basically deliver therapy to the marketplace. It gives patients the greatest opportunity to be cured. And we
want to do that as broadly as we possibly can across genotype 1 patients. We want to be able to do that for naïve
patients and we want to do that for even the very difficult to treat and all those fibrotic patients, et cetera. And I think as
we look at our data and the data we just presented last week at EASL, I think we're demonstrating that. You look at the
fibrosis data and the IL28B data that we presented at that meeting and I think we have outstanding performance, right.

It doesn't degrade at all. And so, I think we feel very good about the competitiveness of our program based on the
objectives that we have for it and we feel good about the timeline that we're operating against. And so, I think we have
a high level of confidence in our HCV program.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you, good morning. A couple of quick ones. First, is there any color on HUMIRA outside
the U.S. you can offer in terms of lumpy ordering patterns or tenders as we progress through the remaining quarters of
the year? Secondly, I was curious if you're willing to quantify your royalty burden on the product and how that changes
over time? And third, for John, I wanted your take on your strategy for – and sort of your take on overall the
breakthrough status versus fast-track status that is available to the industry and how that might apply to your novel
portfolio. Thanks.
<A - John M. Leonard>: You want me to go first? Yeah, okay. It's John. The regulatory question of breakthrough
status, it's an avenue that the Food and Drug Administration has opened up that we think is a valuable one in that it
permits more access and more opportunity to discuss data as it emerges and to have good planning. It doesn't
necessarily predict a regulatory outcome, however, or accelerate the review. So, we filed for breakthrough status on
some of our products and we're looking forward to hearing from the FDA so that we can, as always, welcome
additional interaction with them. But I think in terms of planning for review status and all that, I would treat it
essentially the same way that we always have until now.
<A - William J. Chase>: Hey Greg, its Bill Chase. On the – on your HUMIRA tender question, as you know, tenders
occur fairly choppily throughout the year. If you look at Q1 in international, even if you exclude those tenders,
international still had double digit HUMIRA growth. The tenders actually gave it about a 3% lift. We'd see that
basically coming out of Q2 and then the second half of the year, a little difficult to call at this point in time, but it does
have a tendency to move around a little bit on us and we'll certainly give you visibility as that occurs.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay, so a few percentage points in a given quarter is a decent way to think about it?
<A - William J. Chase>: Yeah, I think that's the right way to look at it.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Right. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And Greg, this is Rick on the HUMIRA royalties. We don't provide product level P&L
detail. So, we're not going to go through the royalties in any level of detail. What I would say is there have been reports
put out, Jami's report in particular that came out recently. I think the premise behind that report, we would feel is
accurate, is appropriate. And the range that was characterized in that report of 5% to 10%, if you looked at it across on
a global basis I think is a reasonable range to think about it. So, I think that should give you some clarity around the
royalties and the expiration of those royalties.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks, Greg.

<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much. Just a couple questions here. The first is, just with the
negative opinion from [indiscernible] (35:48) last night in Europe, just mention any thoughts you might have of kind of
what that means to the dynamic impact to the HUMIRA business, et cetera. The second question, just coming out of
EASL, I think there was some comments from the company that they would consider looking for partners in hep C. I
just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that and talk about any priorities there. And then finally on the oral
JAK programs, can you just update where we are there? That's – maybe as you're considering that, just maybe
longer-term, how important do you see having an oral agent in the portfolio and maybe second, how much
differentiation you believe you're going to see between the various JAKs that are out there. Thank so much.
<A - John M. Leonard>: Thanks for the question. It's John Leonard. Let me start with EASL comments. Scott's
comments were taken out of context and are not accurate. We're very confident in the work that we have with our first
generation program. We're also extremely excited and confident about the elements of our second generation program.
We've not been actively looking for partners. And I think the story was essentially distraction. With respect to JAK, the
importance of having an oral JAK, we shared that our longer term strategy in the immunology space is to try to enhance
the overall benefit risk of profile, and I think we've seen some evidence how important that is.
Our goal is to take some of the learnings that have come from the JAK space and try to tease that apart and build that
into our own oral program with the intention of getting to higher levels of efficacy than achieving – that's our primary
goal. And of course, that's what we're striving for. With respect to where we are, you undoubtedly know that we have a
relationship with Galapagos. They shared some early information on their compound which we think is very, very
exciting and moving into 2b work middle of this year. That will be dose-ranging that will test QD and BID regimens.
We're very excited about its profile, particularly with respect to what we think is a very attractive adverse-event profile
and the efficacy overall based on small patient numbers for a short duration we think is definitely intriguing and worth
pursuing. Our own internal JAK program goes for great specificity trying to select-out the JAK-2 activity which we
think has been dose limiting in some of the first generation compounds. And that's well into its Phase 1 program and
progressing well.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Chris, this is Rick. I'll cover the Pfizer comment. I mean basically we don't know much
more about the Pfizer situation than you do than what's been publicly reported. And so I think as far as the dynamics
are concerned, our projections would have been a relatively modest impact in 2013 anyway in Europe based both on
the timing and how difficult this market is to break into. I think you're seeing that in the U.S. launch today; the
challenges that any competitor coming into the market tends to face. And so I don't think it has any dramatic impact on
what we had forecast and we'll just have to see how it plays out longer term as Pfizer continues to pursue approval of
that product in Europe.
<A - John M. Leonard>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. First on Duodopa which we haven't talked about yet, can you just gives us a sense of
what are the major countries that it's doing well in, in Europe and just flush out how you're doing on the new delivery
system that you're working on? And then second on elagolix, the endometriosis, Phase 3, are we expecting data
potentially next year or is this going to drift into 2015? How long is that study? Thanks.
<A - John M. Leonard>: So with respect to Duodopa's launch primarily in Europe and is used most in the Nordic
countries. I think that's where it's getting most of its use. The new delivery system you asked about we have an active
effort to improve the pump and make it easier for patients to carry around and deliver the drug on a continuous basis
and that's something that we're very, very actively engaged in. It's early in that work and that's – I think we're not in a
position right now to characterize it further than that.

With respect to elagolix, recall that we're pursuing two different indications. The Phase 3 effort is well underway for
endometriosis and these are the largest studies that have ever been done in any endometriosis patient population around
the world and that in part dictates the timeline but also the pursuit of chronic therapy. So, they will play out over the
next couple of years, so I wouldn't expect to be in a position to share data until 2015 or thereabouts. And then recall
that the second indication is the uterine fibroid work and there we've announced that we've just begun our Phase 2b
work. So, that information lies ahead.

Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Tong from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Hi, good morning. Actually want to ask an AndroGel question. You made the comment about
the slowdown in the growth of that market. Do you think that's temporary or is that permanent and are you surprised
that the market growth has actually decelerated with a couple of new entries or recent entries into the marketplace? And
then second question is for Bill, if you can remind me your CapEx expectations for 2013. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Michael, this is Rick. On AndroGel, we have seen the market slow down and you have to
remember this is a market that grew very rapidly in 2012. So if you look at the average in the first quarter I think it's
down around high single to 10% kind of range. I think that's probably a reasonable expectation to think about it going
forward from a market growth standpoint that this market will grow roughly in the high single digit kinds of ranges
going forward. I don't think that surprises us that much. Every market tends to slow down over time and I think if you
look at the fundamentals of this market that's what we would expect going forward and so, our planning assumptions
are now built around that kind of market growth going forward for 2013.
<A - William J. Chase>: And Michael, it's Bill. On CapEx, this is a business that runs pretty lean on CapEx. We are
over the next couple of years obviously going to have to separate from Abbott which will increase CapEx somewhat.
But this year, we're anticipating about $500 million to $600 million.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a follow up on HUMIRA ex-U.S. and I
was wondering if I could ask a higher level question. I would love to get your insight about some of the trends you're
seeing in different geographies. For example, are things getting better in Europe? If you could elaborate a little bit more
in emerging markets. We know there are a few small biosimilars in a couple of emerging market countries. If you see
that as what your outlook is for that in general. Just an overall picture on – not just from arthritis, but also across the
different indications. Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Alex, this is Rick Gonzalez. So I think if you look at Europe and you've seen this for a
number of years now, we continue to see good, strong, robust growth in Europe in this particular area. And I think one
of the things that Europe has really adopted and values is the ability to be able to put the disease in remission and be
able to hold it in remission for long periods of time. So, we continue to see market growth in the double-digit range in
that market. And when you look at the penetration rates across all three major areas, the penetration rates are still
relatively low. And so, we would expect that we'll continue to see that growth going forward. An the programs that we
have in place, I think, have been demonstrated to be very effective at both helping market growth as well as driving
improvement in share, growth and share, in the indications, particularly derm and GI as I indicated. But also, we're

continuing to hold our own from an RA share standpoint. And so I think we feel good about the dynamics in Europe.
There are still problematic countries in Europe, for sure. But I think overall, if you look at Europe in general, it's
performing within our expectations and I think it's a market that we think is a good market for products like HUMIRA.
As far as the emerging market, I think one of the things that's important to remember is that the majority of our
business is still in the developed markets, roughly 85% of our revenues come from the developed markets. There are
some emerging markets like a Brazil that are relatively large markets for us, but there are also a number of markets that
are relatively small. And so we have not seen any material impact from any biosimilar competition in the emerging
markets or anything that we would perceive to be any kind of an issue for the business going forward in those emerging
markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Alex. Elan, we have time for one more question today.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Damien Conover from Morningstar Investment Services.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Good morning.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Just two questions, one on HUMIRA sales in the U.S., very strong growth. But in the press
release, rheumatoid arthritis wasn't really called out for the support of that growth. I was just wondering if you could
talk through some of the dynamics there. And then secondly, when you're looking at the hepatitis C market in a broad
picture, as these next generation of products come to the market with very strong efficacy and lower side effects, I was
wondering if you could share your thoughts on the expected treatment rate for this space, given that it's very low right
now, just so to take a look at the overall market growth. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Damien. This is Larry. On HUMIRA U.S. sales on RA we called out the more rapid
growers and that would be gastro and dermatology. Certainly we do still see growth in RA. It's certainly more modest
than those other two areas; call it mid-single digit growth for the market maybe a little bit stronger for us. And again,
holding share despite new entrance into the RA space, but certainly a lot of our growth continues to come from
dermatology and gastro; derma on the low end of penetration rates. We continue to see a lift in penetration rates which,
as you know, are still only in the single digits at this point in time in dermatology. So, we called out the two biggest
growers, but RA continues to grow and we're holding share in that space.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: And Damien, this is Rick on the HCV question. As we look at this market, we do expect
to see some acceleration – significant acceleration in market growth. I mean I think the frame, the size of the market
and give you some perspective on it. Today if we look at genotype 1 in the G7, we would estimate somewhere around
2.5 million people are currently diagnosed as being infected with the disease. If you go back to 2011, roughly 175,000
patients were treated and so, there is some clinical capacity constraints that exist today with the current therapies. As
we bring these next generations of products to the marketplace in that 2015 timeframe, they're obviously simpler
protocols to be able to administer from a physician standpoint and the side effect profile is dramatically improved from
the generation of products that exist today. And so, you would expect that you will be able to increase the number of
patients who are treated at that point. We're estimating that that number could grow to the kind of 350,000 range per
year.
As far as the patient types, I think our perspective on it is this is a disease that progresses very slowly and as these new
therapies come to market, we think the health care systems and physicians will prioritize those patients that need the
therapy the most. And I think particularly if you can bring a therapy to market that has a 90% plus kind of cure rate for
those patients which hasn't been seen before with the current therapies that exist today there will be motivation to go
treat those patients, the no-responders, the fibrotic patients, the cirrhotic patients, et cetera. And so, we think in the

early parts of the launch, the first few years, that we should see a significant number of those patients being treated.
