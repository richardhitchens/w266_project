John J. Stephens
Thanks, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being with us today and thank you for your interest in
AT&T.
Let me start with our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide 4. Consolidated revenue was a solid $32.1
billion, up $500 million or 1.6% on a reported basis and up an impressive $800 million or 2.6% when you exclude the
divested Advertising Solutions business. And we were able to do this with no lift from the economy. These gains were
due to solid revenue growth in wireless, strong gains in U-verse services and with improving revenue from our wireline
business.
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.71. That's up almost 8% over last year's second quarter. Our results this quarter
include about a $0.04 lift from the sale of some of our América Móvil shares. You may recall that América Móvil has a
share buyback program underway and we were selling shares to maintain our ownership closer to our historic level of
about 9%. When you exclude this help, earnings per share were $0.67. Our adjusted EPS is up about 5% for the year
and up nearly 2% in the second quarter.
Consolidated margins were down year-over-year, primarily due to success-based initiatives in both wireless and
wireline. Cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.5 billion, which
allowed us to have a strong capital investment in Project VIP and still have free cash flow of $4 billion. And in the
second quarter, we bought back about 90 million shares for $3.3 billion. And with our strong dividend, returned more
than $5.7 billion to shareholders.
Now let me give you the highlights for the quarter on slide 5. As you can see, we continue to execute at a high-level.
Our network performance is nothing short of terrific. We've posted impressive metrics across our key growth drivers
and, as a result, we have improved momentum heading into the second half of the year. And as I said, we see this
across our most important growth areas. That includes about 20% growth in mobile data, strong postpaid net adds and
record-setting smartphone sales. Total U-verse subs reached 9.4 million, while video subs topped 5 million customers
for the first time. Total U-verse revenues grew better than 30% and U-verse now represents more than 50% of
consumer revenues. And even with little help from the economy, business wireline showed sequential revenue
improvement as strategic business services grew by more than 15%. All of this resulted in improved revenue growth,
continued EPS gains, and strong free cash flow, even while investing more in our customers and in our Project VIP.
I now would like to turn the call over to Ralph de la Vega, who is going to update us on all the work going on in
wireless. Ralph?
Ralph de la Vega
Thank you, John, and hello, everyone. It's great to be with you today. Before we get to the wireless highlights for the
quarter, I'd like to take a moment to give you a quick update on our 4G LTE wireless network, which is now the
nation's fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network. Details are on slide 6. Our network team has done an incredible job
with our LTE deployment. All LTE networks are not built the same, they all don't use the same network architecture,
not all have the same network reliability and density, and they all don't have the fastest speeds. Our goal was to build
the best LTE experience from the very first market we deployed.
You can see by the high praise and recognition our network has received that the results speak for themselves. PC
Magazine called our 4G LTE network, the nation's fastest. PCWorld said we have the fastest average download and
upload speeds of any competitor in its tests for the second year in a row. And according to independent third-party data,
we now have the most reliable 4G LTE network as well.
We already cover more than 225 million people with our 4G LTE network today, and we are on track to reach nearly
270 million POPs by year-end, covering 400 markets. And we continue to move fast with our 4G LTE deployment. We
now expect to substantially complete our 4G LTE network by the next summer. Customers love our LTE experience.

We already have more than 35% of our smartphone subscribers on LTE, and that number is accelerating quickly,
thanks to our impressive line of LTE devices. The recognition is great to see, but this network also provides a solid
foundation for our wireless growth platforms, and those details are on slide 7.
Having the nation's fastest, the most reliable network gives us an advantage when it comes to data growth, and the
growth story is very powerful. Smartphone data usage is up 50% year-over-year, and more than 70% of those devices
are on usage-based plans with most taking larger data plans. This growth, plus an increasing number of smartphone
subscribers and new data devices being added to the network, drives the strong 20% mobile data growth that we're
seeing. We also rolled-out our first Digital Life markets in the second quarter. We're now up and running in 33 markets
and expect to be in 50 by year-end.
I already have Digital Life in my home and let me tell you, it's really amazing what it can do. We believe home security
and automation is a large untapped opportunity for us. Another opportunity is the connected car. You already know our
GM agreements to begin wireless connectivity for all GM vehicles in the U.S. market beginning in 2014. We've also
announced an agreement with SiriusXM Satellite Radio to provide mobile connectivity supporting a suite of security
and services for Nissan automobiles in North America, and yesterday we announced an agreement with Audiovox to
provide network connectivity to Audiovox telematics and location-based service systems.
You also know of our recent moves in the prepaid space. We recently introduced a new prepaid service, and the
proposed Leap Wireless deal will accelerate our expansion in this segment. We believe we have the right strategies in
place to make a stronger impact in the prepaid segment and I think there's a strong growth opportunity there as well.
And finally, last week, we announced AT&T Next, a program where customers can get a new smartphones or tablet
every year with no down-payment, no activation fee, no upgrade fee, and no financing fees. This is a great program that
provides great value for – and more choice for our customers. Many customers don't want to wait for the latest and
greatest device, and with AT&T Next, they don't have to.
Now let's move on to our second quarter results, starting with a look at postpaid net adds on slide 8. Led by solid gains
in tablets, we added more than 550,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter, and that's a 72% increase from the year-ago
quarter and our best second quarter postpaid net add quarter in four years. We added about 400,000 postpaid tablets,
which we expect to be the largest gain of any carrier in the second quarter. In addition, prepaid net adds increased as a
result of solid GoPhone sales. Total prepaid sales continued to be impacted by the migration of session-based tablets to
postpaid plans, which is a transition that we're happy to see. Gains in connected devices more than offset losses in the
reseller segment where we saw subscriber losses primarily in low revenue accounts; however, reseller revenue
increased by almost 30% year-over-year.
Postpaid churn was up slightly year-over-year, but down from the first quarter and smartphone churn was even better –
less than 1%. Strong postpaid net adds help drive solid revenue growth and those details are on slide 9. Revenues
continue to be led by data growth. We saw nearly 20% growth in data revenues in the quarter and that helped to drive a
4.1% service revenue growth. And total wireless revenues were up nearly 6%. The growth of smartphones, tablets and
other data devices is fueling this data growth. Mobile data is now nearly a $22 billion annualized revenue stream for us.
This growth can also be seen in our expanding postpaid ARPUs. Total postpaid ARPU which includes tablets was up
nearly 2% in the quarter, but phone-only ARPU was up 3%. Our phone-only ARPU includes smartphones, but also
includes our lower ARPU feature phones and wireless home phones as well, which make this growth even more
impressive. And postpaid data ARPU grew at nearly 18%. Smartphone sales were also strong this quarter and those
details are on slide 10.
A second quarter record 88% of our postpaid phone sales were smartphones. Smartphone subscribers now make up
73% of our postpaid phone base and that's an increase of more than 1.2 million new smartphone subscribers in the
quarter. These are the premium subscribers in our business. They have twice the ARPU of non-smartphone subscribers
and much lower churn. We also set another second quarter smartphone sales record of 6.8 million, an excellent
performance in a very competitive environment. This helped drive record Android smartphone sales both in total
numbers of phones sold and in the highest percentage of total sales. And we did this by also selling more iPhones than

we did a year ago.
Several promotions on our new low-cost trading program helped to fuel these strong sales, bringing in new customers
while also keeping existing ones on two-year contracts. And it also increased the number of LTE devices on the
network. More than 35% of smartphones now are on LTE. The move to usage-based data plans also continued in the
second quarter. Overall, more than 70% of our smartphone base has moved to usage-based plans and data use on these
smartphones is growing by about 50% year-over-year. So we have more smartphones on usage-based plans, data
growth is strong, and a growing number of subscribers are taking bigger buckets of data from us. About 80% already
take the larger data plans and we're seeing more than a quarter of Mobile Share accounts on data plans of 10 gigabytes
or higher. And, speaking of Mobile Share, we now have about 4.3 million Mobile Share accounts and those accounts
include more than 13 million subscribers on devices such as smartphones and tablets. And we continue to see a steady
movement of subscribers on unlimited plans to Mobile Share. More than 15% of subscribers to date moved over from
unlimited plans. And remember that our customers have a choice. They can keep the plan they have or move to Mobile
Share; whatever plan that works best for them.
Strong postpaid net adds, smartphone sales and upgrades impacted margins and those details are on slide 11. Our
wireless EBITDA service margin was slightly below our first quarter levels at 42.4%, but we sold 800,000 more
smartphones in the second quarter than we did in the first. We made a strong effort to get people into our stores or on
our website through promotions that allowed customers to trade in their phones and sign new contracts with us and that
strategy worked extremely well. Upgrades were much stronger than a year ago and the first quarter. And we had as a
higher percentage of customers on contract at the end of the second quarter than we did at the end of the first quarter.
The long-term value they bring is impressive, higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data growth, and greater network
efficiencies from our new LTE devices. The trade-in program also gave customers a chance to upgrade their phones
before upgrade period moved to 24 months. At the same time, our new AT&T Next program gives customers the best
choice if they want a new device every year.
So, as you can tell, we were very busy this quarter, introducing new programs and delivering a strong second quarter
performance, and you'll continue to see us drive strategies to grow our business as we move throughout the year.
John, those were the highlights from wireless and, with that, I'll turn it back to you discuss wireline results.
John J. Stephens
Thank, Ralph, appreciate it. Now let's look at our wireline operations, starting with consumer which you can see on
slide 12.
As I mentioned at the outset, we passed a crucial threshold with U-verse. It now accounts for more than half of all
consumer revenues. Two years ago, U-verse was less than a third of consumer. Now, it's more than half and growing
very fast. That's a remarkable benchmark as we transform our business. We now have 9.4 million total U-verse
subscribers. That's more than double the number we had just two years ago. We added more than 640,000 U-verse high
speed broadband subs in the quarter and 233,000 new U-verse TV subscribers, topping 5 million video subscribers for
the very first time. U-verse broadband now makes up more than 50% of our total broadband base, with total broadband
ARPU growing at more than 9% year-over-year. These gains helped drive overall consumer revenue growth of 2.4%,
with total U-verse revenues up nearly 30% in the quarter. U-verse is now a nearly $12-billion annualized revenue
stream, not bad for a business that was just started seven years ago. And it also shows clearly that we know how to
build and scale new businesses as we move forward with Project VIP.
Now, let's move to wireline business which you can see on slide 13. The economy continues to be challenging and is
not providing any assistance to our efforts here. But, on the bright side, we do see some signs of improvement from the
first quarter. Business revenue was down 2.2% year-over-year but increased sequentially, with both enterprise and
small business showing sequential revenue growth. Small business also showed growing customer momentum with
U-verse broadband net adds. Part of the business continued to do very well. Growth continued to be strong in strategic
business services; that's products such as VPN, Ethernet, hosting, and other advanced IP services, which were up more

than 15% in the quarter. These services represent a more-than-$8-billion annualized revenue stream and are
approaching 25% of total business wireline revenues.
And we continue to do well with wireless in the business space. We had our best-ever wireless business adds in the
quarter. More and more businesses want solutions that include wireless. For example, earlier today we announced an
agreement with Disney Parks that makes AT&T the official wireless provider for Walt Disney World Resort and
Disneyland Resort. We've talked often about the transformation of wireline from legacy products to advanced IP
services, but we are also seeing businesses transform to mobility. AT&T is well positioned to deliver these types of
solutions to the business market. Our full ownership of our global IP network and our leading 4G LTE wireless
network are a powerful combination when it comes to meeting business customers' needs.
Before we get to cash flow, let me give you a quick update on some of our Project VIP initiatives. Details are on slide
14. Ralph told you about the incredible progress, both quality and coverage, that we are making in wireless. But we are
also breaking ground on several wireline projects as well. Our network upgrades are on track, and we expect to boost
top U-verse speeds up to 45 megs per second in the next few months. And we are moving towards speeds of 75 megs
and 100 megs in the near future. We have increased our U-verse video consumer locations by about 500,000
year-to-date. Those locations also include U-verse broadband. We've also added 1.3 million U-verse broadband-only
customer locations so far this year. When you add those together that's nearly 2 million new U-verse broadband
locations to serve customers. This gives us more than 50 million U-verse broadband customer locations across our
wireline footprint. We're on track to hit our goal of reaching approximately 75% of our customer locations within our
wireline footprint with wired high-speed broadband by the end of 2015. Our fiber build to multi-tenant buildings is also
underway. We expect to reach approximately 250,000 of our 1 million customer location targets by the end of 2013.
We're just six months into our plan, but as you can see, we're making progress, and we are very excited about the
growth potential Project VIP brings to AT&T.
Even with our progress on Project VIP plus success-based initiatives, margins continue to be solid. Details are on slide
15. For the second quarter, consolidated operating margin was 19.1%, an increase from the first quarter but down
year-over-year, due largely to stronger – actually record – smartphone sales and higher costs associated with U-verse
adds. Wireline margins saw pressure from success-based initiatives in consumer and Project VIP investment costs.
Wireline pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements in the network, sales
and support functions, and solid execution of cost initiatives. As Project VIP moves ahead, we'll continue to look for
more opportunity to reduce expenses.
Now, let's move to cash flow which continues to be a solid story for us even as we increase investment in our Project
VIP. Our summary is on slide 16. In the first half of the year, cash from operations totaled $17.7 billion which is up
from last year's level. Capital expenditures were $9.8 billion as Project VIP investing starts to ramp. And free cash flow
before dividends was $7.9 billion. In terms of uses of cash, net debt was stable in the second quarter with a
debt-to-capital ratio of 46.6% and a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.6, well below our guidance of net debt in the 1.8
range and actually slightly lower than our ratio of 1.68% in the first quarter.
We also completed our second 300 million share repurchase authorization and began buying shares back from the third
authorization. However, the pace of buybacks slowed when compared to recent quarters. We repurchased about 89
million shares for $3.3 billion. With our dividend, this makes our total return to shareholders in the second quarter
almost $6 billion. Even with our progress on Project VIP plus success-based initiatives, margins continue to be solid.
During the quarter, we also took several steps to strengthen our balance sheet. We continue working with the
Department of Labor on a plan that would contribute a preferred equity interest in AT&T Mobility to fund our pension
plan. We're optimistic on the strategy and expect approval of this proposal later this year. During the quarter, we
monetized some of our shares of América Móvil stock while keeping our ownership levels roughly the same, about 9%.
We continue to keep our focus on the strong financial foundation. Our balance sheet is sound. Our debt metrics are
solid. Our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and make strategic investments such as
Leap Wireless, while returning substantial value to shareholders through our strong dividends.

Before we take questions, let me close with a quick recap of the quarter on slide 17. The second quarter was a story of
growing revenues and growing momentum. Our revenue gains were strong, our cash flows were solid, and we continue
to grow EPS. The mobile Internet drove strong wireless results, including strong mobile data revenue growth, growing
postpaid ARPUs, and our best second quarter postpaid growth in three years. Plus, our 4G LTE network has been
winning praise and recognition for being the nation's fastest and most reliable. During the quarter, U-verse hit an
important milestone when it exceeded more than half of consumer revenues, and with Project VIP, we feel the best is
yet to come. Our strong execution this quarter puts us on track to meet our full year guidance, including revenue
growth, EPS, free cash flow, and margins, so a solid quarter with strong momentum heading into the back half of the
year.
With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, John. Tony, we'll turn it back over to you. We're ready now for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And our first question in queue will come from the line of Phil Cusick
with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks. So, Ralph, if we could start with the net add number, can you just help us
break it down a little bit? 500,000 something, nearly 400,000 tablets, if you take out the home phone fixed devices and
Digital Life, was there growth in mobile voice postpaid? Thanks.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah. Phil, thanks for the question. We had a really strong quarter in all aspects, and in fact,
we ended up in June with significant gains in smartphone-only growth, not just wireless home phones. So we feel this
is one of the best quarters we could have turned in, especially considering the fact that one of our competitors got the
iPhone in the same quarter. To turn in the performance that we did, when you consider all the factors, was a remarkable
accomplishment, and we're very pleased with the overall phone growth, not just on smartphones, but feature phones
and wireless home phones. And we've shown in the ARPUs that we have given you the fact that even when you include
all those feature phones and wireless home phones, the ARPU is up in a very nice way. And the good thing about
wireless home phones, by the way, is that soon there'll be wireless home phones and Internet access. In the next few
days, you'll see us announce that we'll be adding data capability which will add substantial ARPU to wireless home
phones and we think that's going to drive significant ARPU growth to the phone-only category in the future.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Okay. And then second, if I may, can you just help us a little bit on Digital Life? Just round
numbers for that, was that single-digit, double-digit thousands in the quarter and then how should we expect that to
ramp through the rest of the year?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah, we're not providing that detailed information yet, Phil, but I can tell you that the early
responses by customers has been very positive. The ARPU is higher than we had planned. They're adding a lot of video
cameras to the services. And with every video camera, there's an additional charge. Customers love the product, and net
promoter scores are one of the highest that we have ever seen for any product that we have launched. We announced
recently that we added six new markets; that brings the total to 33, going to 50 by yearend. That platform is brand new,
but it's stable, and it's taking all the load that we can give it. And so, right now, we're cranking up the sales as we turn
up markets by markets. And I am very confident that our company-owned retail employees are going to do a bang-up
job selling this product. So far, what we have seen is a very nice lift, and we're going to continue to increase our
advertising spend to promote the product and continue to see it, I think, executed very well in our company-owned
retail stores.

<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: All right. Thanks, Ralph.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Ralph or John maybe, just some thoughts on what your tolerance is for
wireless margin pain? We've seen a lot of announcements from competitors recently. I'm just trying to set a sense
because if you look at the current guidance, you guys are talking about wireless margin expansion for the full year.
Year-to-date, it's down about 110 basis points. Maybe the upgrade in the – the change in the upgrade policy could help
the fourth quarter. But just trying to think towards the back half of the year how we should think about the puts and
takes? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Michael. Let me give it a shot and ask Ralph to join in. Let me give you a couple of
push points here that – reference points to start with. First of all, the change in the upgrade policy will certainly help in
the second half of the year. Second, if you will, AT&T Next, our new offering to allow customers to upgrade every
year will also help. Third, I think it's – something we need to point out, is that as Ralph mentioned, our phone ARPU
grew 3% this quarter, actually more than 3%. And we actually converted – we had actually 1.2 million smartphones
this quarter, many of those conversions from feature phones, which bring higher ARPUs. So we've got a lot of revenue
momentum going on in the business. When you add that to the growth we're getting out of Digital Life, connected cars,
and other things like that, one other thing that I will tell you is really strong and Ralph mentioned it in his remarks, data
usage is growing on a per-device basis over 50%. And so, as that data usage goes up, we are seeing customers buy
bigger buckets, bigger tiers of data. And so all of those things added together give us comfort that we will be able to
meet the guidance we gave in January. I think those are the points, if you will, Mike, to look to, to say how do we get
from where we're at to where we expect to be by the end of the year.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Mike, there is one other point that I wanted to add because I think it's important that you
understand. And I mentioned the advances that we have made with our LTE network deployment. What we're finding
out is the more we deploy LTE, the lower it costs us to produce a megabyte of data, so the cost structure in the future is
something that I think, as we produce more data, it'll be cheaper to produce it. We have over 90% of our backbone now
being enhanced backbone which means we typically have Ethernet to the cell site, so it's fiber Ethernet to the cell site
with LTE at the – with the radio head on the top of the tower. It's a very, very good architecture, and when we execute
it like we're executing, it has a tendency to make it more efficient in terms of how you run the network up to 50% more
efficient on spectral efficiency as well. And so we feel really good about the infrastructure cost. In addition to that,
you've heard us mention that we started the process of turning down the subscribers on our 2G network in order so that
we can turn off that network completely by 1/1/2017. And so, lots of work going on in the infrastructure, some of it
being short-term but also long-term as we turn down our 2G network. That'll be another source of margin
improvement.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, John, I'm sorry; you mentioned briefly regarding the third quarter initiative to increase
U-verse broadband speeds. Is that something you're seeing? We're hearing a lot about Wi-Fi offload in the home. Are
you seeing a huge explosion of usage in the home right now to drive the need to accelerate that program?
<A - John J. Stephens>: No, the plan to implement that was really part of Project VIP and really was just to give a
higher quality – continuing to improve the quality of service to our customers. We are seeing continued demand for our
U-verse product and, as we mentioned, the 640,000 sales in what has traditionally been a very slow quarter for us, a
seasonally slow quarter, and we're over 1.3 million broadband U-verse net adds for the year. So we're continuing to see
that demand. This just fits in with that program and with the overall Project VIP strategy.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Okay, makes sense. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. Two questions, well, first for John. With the 1.67 leverage ratio, plus the Leap
deal, you're getting up closer to that 1.8 times target. Could you talk about whether that's set in stone or if that could
potentially change going forward? And then maybe update us on any possibilities for asset sales going forward. And
then I've got a question for Ralph.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure. We're not changing our guidance. We feel really comfortable with the
net-debt-to-EBITDA in the 1.8 range and we're sticking with that. We believe that the cash flows we're generating from
the business are going to be able to allow us to successfully manage to that so we feel good about that. I won't comment
on any particular or specific asset sales, but I will tell you we do have a great collection of assets at the company and
we think it's our responsibility to manage those assets and manage the balance sheet. We believe that that management
includes putting focus on working capital, which we've done; lowering our borrowing costs, which we've done; and
monetizing the assets as appropriate when we can do that. I think you saw us do that in the second quarter with the cash
proceeds we received for our Yellow Pages and for América Móvil shares. And in both cases we effectively retained
the same ownership we had before we generated that cash. So we're going to continue that focus. But, with that and
with that balance sheet that we have and the cash flows we have, we feel real good about sticking with our
net-debt-to-EBITDA in the 1.8 range.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Got it. And then, Ralph, while we have you, the – if you could talk a little bit about the Leap
transaction, maybe the main drivers behind the transaction? And then if you could clarify the prepaid strategy; it looks
like you're going to have two brands going forward. How aggressive should we expect you to be in that market and
what the go-forward strategy is there?
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: John, the rationale behind the Leap transaction is basically to accelerate our entry into the
prepaid segment much more so than we would've been able to do by ourselves. We plan to keep the Cricket brand and
the distribution and I think that will ignite our growth into all aspects of the prepaid segment that I think has some
really nice growth opportunities for us. So that is our strategy. We'll keep the prepaid brand that Leap brings with it,
Cricket. We think it's a good brand and we'll leverage the distribution and that will fuel our entry into a nationwide
prepaid offering.
<A - John J. Stephens>: John, I will tell you – let me add to what Ralph says. I think what you'll see is we're going to
bring more competition, and we're going to bring more choices to customers. And the combination of Leap and our
resources will bring an acceleration and a further deployment of that offering into that segment than either one of us
could've done on a standalone basis. So I think this will be very good for the competition in the prepaid segment and
we're real excited about the opportunity it provides us.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, Ralph. The first, the 50% usage
per smart phone device, that's pretty impressive. Can you decompose that into the change from people going to 3G to
4G? Is that a big part of the growth and then what the 3G-on-3G or the 4G-on-4G growth is? And then, as you see more
Androids in the mix, are you seeing a lower per-device subsidy cost or a lower purchasing price for AT&T, either now,
or is there some hope that you'll be able to bring either subsidies or device purchase prices down going forward and
then lowering your equipment subsidy? Thanks.

<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah, Simon, I was really pleased to see the Android sales and they do carry lower subsidy
than some of the other phones we carry. We're seeing some nice opportunities as well coming up in the Windows
phone line with the Lumia 1020. That's a great device that I think is going to help to drive sales of Windows phones. So
we're really, really pleased with the diversity of the portfolio that's increasingly more diverse almost every quarter that
goes by. Now the thing about the usage – I think this is really a great highlight that I want to make sure everybody gets.
What we're seeing when we move customers from HSPA networks to LTE, we see a significant increase in the usage of
data. We also see them buy larger buckets of data. So more usage, buying bigger buckets, and guess what, the net
promoter scores on our LTE network are much higher.
So happy customers are buying more of our product and are buying it in bigger quantities. And I think that is what I see
driving it and we're just getting started. What I love about the LTE network that we have built is it's giving great service
but at the same time that that network is performing as good as any network, I think, on the planet right now. The more
customers and usage that we move to the LTE network, the better that the HPA (sic) [HSPA] (39:56) network
performs. So, as a result, we're winning in market after market where we deploy LTE. We're winning not just the
fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network; we're winning on voice reliability, text reliability, and data reliability. So I
feel really good that we have prospects to continue to grow usage and to get customers to buy bigger buckets in the
future.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Great, thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go
ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, David.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hi, John, thanks. So two questions if I could. Just the first one, strategic services had one of
its strongest quarters that it's had in a really long time. I think you guys added maybe annualized $500 million of
revenues this quarter in that segment. Could you talk about some of the drivers and whether those are going to continue
and whether we can look for that growth out of that segment for the rest of the year? And then the second question
would be, obviously, we've talked a little bit already on the call about the changing nature of competition as we look in
the back half of the year. Verizon, for its part, is suggesting that they think they cannot just keep share but take share as
they increase postpaid subscribers in the second half of the year. Obviously, Sprint and T-Mobile have their ambitions.
Could you map out what is AT&T's position on balancing market share, margin? What should we be expecting from
AT&T as an objective function for the business? You don't have to tell us your strategy, but what are you going to be
managing this business to in the second half of the year would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sounds great. Thanks, David. Let me take a shot at it and I'll ask Ralph to join in. First and
foremost on strategic services, we are just seeing that there is an acceptance across business for VPN, Ethernet, hosting
and those high-quality IP services. We are specifically seeing an improvement in our small business high-speed
broadband. I think we noted in our presentation that they were 81,000. That's a quarterly record for us that our small
business customers took so even in a difficult economic situation and in a difficult – in a challenged economic segment,
we are seeing customers willing to upgrade to higher quality speeds. With that, we are – also have a all-out focus from
our sales team on our sales effort on strategic services. They are really performing well. And the last thing I will tell
you that, with Project VIP, we are really now beginning to address the opportunities in buildings which we are now
taking fiber to and selling into those customer locations as we start that build process and we start making progress. So
it's all of those things, David, but in summary, it's a real focus and it's an acceptance by customers of the value of those
strategic services, even in some of the challenged spaces of the business segment.

With regard to – specifically with regard to wireless, as we've shown this quarter, we're going to compete. We are
generating good margins. We're going to improve those margins in the second half of the year, but we are going to be
able to compete. I will give you one just simple point. In this quarter where a new competitor got the iPhone, on a
sequential basis, our churn is down. So I think we need to put it in that focus. Our churn is down even in this quarter
where a new competitor comes in and even with all the new offerings that we're putting forth. So we will be ready to
compete. We are going to be smart about it. We're going to be customer-focused about it. And, quite frankly, we
believe that our network superiority is going to lead us to be able to perform very well in the second half of the year
and quite frankly for years to come.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Yeah, Dave, I'd like to add a couple of views here. First, let me speak about the postpaid
segment. I don't think we have ever been better positioned in the postpaid segment than we are today and that's
basically driven by the network performance that is the best that it has ever been, winning awards right and left, just
providing outstanding performance.
And, as the LTE network gets all those awards, as we move customers there, the HSPA network gets better. And so,
from a network perspective which is a key driver of churn, I don't think we've ever been better positioned. Our network
team has done a great job, and you can see dramatic improvements in dropped calls. It's just a great, great story.
In addition to that, we continue to find ways to differentiate on devices. We just are about to roll out the Nokia Lumia
1020 which I think is an exceptional device. We also launched earlier this year the Samsung Active which we call our
whatever-proof phone and so great network, great devices, and great service differentiates us at the postpaid segment.
In the prepaid segment, I mentioned that our GoPhone sales were on the rise and that's as a result of an upgrade in the
platform that now finally allows us to sell LTE devices on the GoPhone platform. And those sales are doing very well
as we populate the GoPhone family with state-of-the-art devices that prior to this we couldn't turn on GoPhones. So
GoPhone sales are doing very well.
Our prepaid service that we recently launched is doing well, and now with Leap and the Leap acquisition, I don't think
we've ever been better positioned on the prepaid segment. So I like our positioning for the second half of this year,
better than almost any second half that I have faced in recent history. And in addition to all of this, as we move our data
growth into LTE, it's improving our cost structure, and we feel good about that. So I think as you look out we're really
in the best shape that we have been heading into a second half that I have seen for a while.
<Q - David W. Barden>: That's great, guys. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great, thanks. A couple of questions. Maybe first on handset trade-ins which are
obviously set to be a little bit bigger part of the model going forward. I think, John, you talked about Next helping
wireless margins. Maybe if you can offer some more context around this, maybe a framework for volumes you'd expect
here and what you can make on a resale or refurbed device from a margin perspective. And then second question,
Verizon I think talked about promotions at third-party distribution channels negatively impacting wireless margins in
the quarter. I'm just wondering if you saw something similar to this that you'd call out? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Let me try the Next and ask – question and ask Ralph to join in. The way I view it is simply
this. In the marketplace for the last few years there have been high-quality used phones that neither the customer, nor
the provider – the transport provider have taken advantage of their value. So, when someone comes in and they get a
new phone, they often go in the drawer, they may be handed down, but they don't necessarily capture the value. What
Next allows the customer to do is by bringing that phone in – that high-quality phone that still has some value, giving it
to us, it lowers their cost to getting a new phone every 12 months. So they get value for it and then we have a network
of capabilities whether to use it in our refurbishing, in our insurance business, whether we resell it to a wholesaler, or

whether we resell it in our stores. So we're able to capture that value. Up to this program, it hasn't been a captured
value. And as you well know, those phones – many of the phones could have a $200 or $250 value. That's what makes
this project work. That makes this offering work for both the customers and for us.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Jason, there was new ones that we did that really drove up the volume of trade-ins something
like 500% to 600% compared to the prior period and the key was for customers to realize that they didn't have to worry
about what they were going to get for the handset. If they brought us a handset that was within three years old in good
working condition then we give them $100 off. All of a sudden they didn't have to worry about going in, checking what
it was worth. We would guarantee them that price. And we actually took the risk in what the value of that trade-in
would be. As it turns out, when they actually started trading them in, the value of the phone that they were trading in
was much higher than what we had anticipated we were going to get. And so, it was good for the customer. It assured
them that they could get a certain amount for it and for us it turned out to be a good strategy.
In addition to that, Jason, when we laid out our AT&T Next program, we knew that in order for that program to work
well, we had to have a very good trade-in program. So the trade-in program preceded AT&T Next and appropriately so,
so we could get customers educated on the value of the trade-in, so we could get our reps to process it and now it's part
of the AT&T Next program and I think it's going to hit with all cylinders firing as we have really educated the
customers and our reps on how to process and do trade-ins.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great. And then the third-party...
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Oh, I'm sorry. On the third-party distribution, yeah, we did see some upgrade activity through
third-party distribution. That's usually a little bit more expensive. But I would say that, that wasn't the big driver for us.
It was essentially the volume of upgrades that were done in the quarter that drove the pressure in the margins that you
saw.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Jason...
Operator
Thank you. And our next question in queue will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much. And good afternoon, folks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, Amir. How are you?
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. Ralph, I actually just wanted to follow up on some of the discussions around your
recent promotion plans. While I recognize it's still early stages, how successful have these plans been in helping to
manage equipment costs and ultimately fuel your belief in hitting sort of your margin expansion target for the back half
of the year? I'm thinking about sort of the extension of the upgrade cycle here. I guess, we're just trying to understand
the different drivers here given your comfort and sort of your guidance.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Well, before we introduced AT&T Next, we did a lot of customer research and there was
overwhelming support for a program just like the one that we have launched. We actually launched the program early
in a couple of markets and the response has been good. We're feeling real positive about the impact of this could have
both on customers and our financials and so we're proceeding full speed ahead, but I think the key with the program, as
we heard from customers, is that they essentially wanted to upgrade their phones in a yearly cycle, which is typically
when they get refreshed, and they wanted to do it with minimal outlay. And the fact that we can do that now for a zero
down, no upgrade fees, no activation fees and no finance fees, means that you can actually walk out the door with a
Lumia 1020 device with a 41-megapixel camera – the best-of-the-best in camera technology with zero money down
and a very reasonable payment.

So I think that, that is what gets me excited – knowing that we can put that kind of technology in the hands of people
and that they will enjoy it. But part of the process, Amir, was to get a trade-in program that was workable and we have
done that already as a result of the promotions that we have launched. And by the way, because of our large base of
iPhones, we stand to gain the most because the value of those smartphones is the highest.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, John, just a question on your capital
deployment strategy; you mentioned that your plan is to be opportunistic on your buyback going forward; clearly, your
focus on finishing the Leap deal. Where can we see other areas of capital deployment in sort of the near- to mid-term or
perhaps, I guess, the way to look at is what are your strategic priorities for capital deployment here?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Clearly, our strategic priorities – there are two things in the short-term, Amir, is finishing off
our Project VIP for the rest of this year which includes our LTE and additionally U-verse and fiber to the building
builds – all of those aspects of VIP. And secondly, being prepared to close the deals we have in place before the FCC
with regard to some of the spectrum deals, whether they be tuck-in or whether they be [indiscernible] (53:18) spectrum
deals. And then third to be – have all of that done where we're still can very easily – which is something we are very
confident we can accomplish – close the Leap deal whenever that becomes available. So those are the – our priorities, if
you will.
I've said this before and I'll say it on this call – our dividend is clearly a sacred matter for us. We clearly understand as
managers of AT&T the importance of our dividends to our shareholders. That's never a question. It's what we do after
we've taken those – satisfied those responsibilities. But those are the order of things. And with our strong cash flows,
we will continue to have opportunities to buy back shares. We'll just be opportunistic as we go through that.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Oh. Thanks, guys. I had two questions. First, John, maybe – it seems like the underlying
strength in the quarter is really somewhat driven by the improvements in the networks, both wireless and here on
wireline. Would you maybe think about accelerating velocity or extending velocity out a little further to maybe upgrade
the networks a little bit more given what we're seeing, it was really a great quarter in terms of acceleration in growth
and in volumes. And then I had a follow up for Ralph.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure, Tim, I agree with you. The performance of our network team in both wireless and
wireline has been exceptional and providing good quality service to our customers is always key to success. With that
being said, we are in a position from our balance sheet to fund things on an opportunistic basis and as we can get them
done efficiently, I think that's what you saw in the second quarter with our CapEx, stepping up to the near $5.5 billion
range, $900 million higher than last year and higher than the first quarter. We spent that money at this time because the
network team could get more done and efficiently get it done. And so we wanted to make sure we funded that and we'll
stick to that philosophy. With that being said, I still believe we're going to be in the $21 billion range for our CapEx for
this year.
I think the network team has continued to outperform all aspects of their LTE build. We had originally targeted $150
million for last year and we finished at $170 million, near $175 million. I think Ralph announced – mentioned today
that we're at $225 million and feel very comfortable that we're going to be in the near $270 million by the end of this
year. And we're expecting to substantially complete the whole build by the middle of next year. So we are doing
exactly what you're suggesting in the wireless space. And the wireline space will go through the same process. So we're
not afraid to go faster. We're just going to do it prudently and we're going to do it efficiently. So let me ask you for your
next question for Ralph.

<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks. Ralph, just [indiscernible] (56:38) two small ones. But have you seen a slowdown
at all in the iPhone impact that T-Mobile has had on you? It usually lasts about quarter or so, or when do you kind of
expect it to hit? And then secondly, I guess on wireless data, are customers starting to bump up against their caps in a
way that might will be – with the pricing lead to some elasticity? Are you worried about that at all or seeing that at all?
Thanks.
<A - Ralph de la Vega>: Okay. First on the iPhone impact, we have seen what – in terms of T-Mobile and them
getting the iPhone, the same impact that we saw when Sprint got the iPhone and when Verizon got the iPhone. There's
usually a spike in the port outs in the timeframe that they get the iPhone and then it comes back down. Quite frankly,
the spike that we have seen from the T-Mobile getting the iPhone is significantly less than the spikes that we saw with
Sprint and the spikes that we saw with Verizon. And my expectation is that they will continue to come down over time.
And so that's kind of where we stand today.
In terms of wireless data and people hitting the caps or bumping against them, we're not seeing a lot of that. What we
are seeing, which was part of our strategy all along, Tim, is we know that there is an explosion going on with tablets.
And our firm belief all the time was we needed to get Mobile Share out in the marketplace so customers could easily
add a tablet and at the time they add the tablet, then they increase the size of the data bucket. That's exactly what is
happening. So as customers add tablets, they're being smart enough to add or to increase the size of the data bucket.
And so we're not seeing anything at this point the gives me concern, especially from a customer satisfaction point of
view in terms of usage.
Customers are being smart. They can monitor their usage now more than ever before and they're being cautious to
make sure they don't have overages. So I really think that this is huge for us and that's why you saw the emphasis that
we have on getting tablets. Those tablets are getting added to the network. Data usage is going up and the size of data
buckets is on the rise as well.
<A - John J. Stephens>: To add to that, I mean, as Ralph had mentioned, 80% of the customers we have on tiered data
programs, 80% of them are picking the higher tiered buckets of data. So they are buying and we are pleased with our
Mobile Share where over 25% are buying the 10-gig bucket. So it is working out, just as Ralph mentioned, where those
customers are buying those bigger buckets and generating that revenue, which is generating our service revenue growth
and allowing us to continue to have great ARPU growth on our phones.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from line of Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple clarifications and then maybe one higher
level question. First, is it possible to breakout the dilution that you're seeing from VIP from an operating perspective,
both for the second quarter and for the full year 2013? And the second clarification is last quarter, you talked a lot
about the impact of USF on the revenue and I was wondering if you can give us an update. Was that also a headwind in
the quarter? Or was there any help from USF? Just maybe directionally how that changed from the first quarter to the
second quarter. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, Mike. Let me – this is John, let me take the first – let me answer the second question
first and that is the out of balance situation with USF rates – those rates being different from last year to this year. The
same situation occurred in the second quarter at about the same level, at about the same amounts in the same
relationship as it did in the first quarter. And so, our numbers that we reported to you are overcoming that pressure,
both on the wireless side, in the wireless ARPUs, and also in the wireline side for both business and consumer. So
there's no change in that situation. We've overcome it in these numbers that have been reported.

<A - John J. Stephens>: On the breakout, we don't do that, Mike. But let me say it to you this way. If you look at our
CapEx spend on a year-over-year basis for the quarter and on a sequential basis for the quarter, it's about $900 million
in both cases increased. We don't give a trailing expense impact on our capital, but I will tell you that even our
construction projects have some level of trailing expense. And then, quite frankly, our software projects have a much
higher level of trailing expense. The pressure for the quarter really relates to the – what I would view it is that $900
million increase times whatever percentage you'd apply to it. I would suggest to you that numbers could vary in
anywhere from 10% to 20% to 25%. We're not going to get into what ours are specifically, but I don't think in the
industry those kinds of percentages would be unusual. I will leave it to you guys to determine your own.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: And then just one higher level question on the wireline business and also this would apply to
the enterprise business. So you've talked about in the second quarter that you stepped over that line where you had
sequential growth, albeit still down year-over-year. And I feel like if you go back historically, we've crossed that line
into positive sequential before, but we've been brought back to that negative territory for a variety of factors from time
to time, whether it was USF, whether it was the legacy parts of the business. Are there – in addition to your comments
on the strategic services, are there aspects of what you're seeing in the legacy or other aspects of your portfolio that
make you believe that the step over to positive sequential growth could be more sustainable on a one or a two-year
basis?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah. Let me give you two different perspectives on that. One, on our consumer business,
that's now greater than 50% U-verse, that is growing nearly – on the consumer U-verse piece, nearly just below 30%. I
think the math will show you that when you've got now more than half of the business growing at somewhere between
25% to 30%, it's a more sustainable situation than it was a year ago or two years ago when that was – the percentage of
the business was 40% or maybe a third. So the math is different with regard to consumer because that base is so much
bigger and so much bigger piece.
On the business side, I agree with you, the economy has given us challenges. We're pleased that we've gotten our
strategic business services up to nearly 25% of our business revenues. But the economy is still uncertain such that we're
not in that same point. And that is why we mentioned that we were slightly positive on a sequential basis and we'll have
to see how this plays out the rest of the year. The one encouraging piece there is what we mentioned in small business
and how well our team has done in beginning to put U-verse or high-speed broadband into our small business space and
the 80,000 high-speed broadband net adds they had this quarter. And we're optimistic about what we can do with that
going forward, particularly when you look at our trend, that's the highest quarter we've had on record and significantly
better than the first quarter or the fourth quarter of last year.
<A - Susan Johnson>: Tony, I think we've got time for just one more quick question.
Operator
Thank you. And that question will come from line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Thanks very much. Two quick questions, if I may. First of all, could you – you may have
mentioned this earlier, but I didn't hear it – give us the number of iPhone sales in the quarter? And secondly, just...
<A - John J. Stephens>: Jonathan, we're not – just so you know, we're not disclosing that number. I think we disclosed
the total number of – in our slide presentation of smartphone sales, the 6.8 million, and I think we've disclosed that we
had a record Android sales, but we're not giving the specific iPhone number.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. Okay. And then, could you give us a little bit more detail, John, just around the
synergies that you expect from the Leap deal, and how quickly you expect to be able to realize those?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, let me say this, Jonathan. We will get into synergies and realizations and all of the
normal impacts that we've discussed as we get the deal close, so we're not going to be in a position to talk about those
now. We do – we are confident, we are expecting that the transaction is going to get closed and after the government

carries out its responsibilities and does a fair review. I will tell you, we're looking forward to getting this done. We
believe that Leap is going to provide us the opportunity to expand services to customers in a segment of the mobility
market that is now underserved. So we're excited about it, we believe it's going to be a positive, but we're going to wait
and let the DOJ and the FCC go through their normal review process.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Got it. Thanks, John. Thanks for taking the questions.
John J. Stephens
Thank you. Let me close now. I want to thank you for being with us this afternoon. We have delivered a solid quarter
with strong subscriber gains, growing revenues, and improving networks. At this time, we're going to continue to invest
in our business with our Project VIP, and we believe it is on pace to provide us even more opportunity going forward.
With that being said, we think this gives us strong momentum as we head into the second half of this year and into the
years to come. So we're very excited about where we're at in our business, we believe our plans are playing out well,
and we look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you very much for being on the call, and as always, thank
you for your interest in AT&T. Have a good evening.
Operator
Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. We do thank you for your
participation and for using AT&T's Executive TeleConference. You may now disconnect.
