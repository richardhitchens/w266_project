David E. Simon
Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up a great year. We opened, started and completed several new
development and redevelopment projects. We successfully executed several capital market transactions, extending our
average term and reducing our weighted-interest cost. We continued to achieve strong operating and financial results.
Our full-year 2015 FFO per share was $9.86, which beat our initial guidance range of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, even with
a net $0.11 loss recorded during the year which was derived from $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt, partially offset
by $0.22 gain upon the sale of marketable securities that occurred in the year, as well as a – $0.12 of negative impact
from foreign currency devaluations.
On a comparable basis, excluding the impact of – from WPG spinoff in the prior year, and the net loss mentioned
above, full-year FFO increased 11.4% to $9.97 per diluted share. We posted record FFO results once again and have
achieved a compound annual FFO growth rate of more than 14% over the last five years.
For the fourth quarter, FFO of $2.40 per share included a $0.33 loss on extinguishment of debt and exceeded the
consensus estimate by $0.02. On a comparable basis, excluding the loss on the extinguishment of debt in the quarter,
FFO per diluted share increased 10.5% year-over-year.
And let me turn to operating metrics and cash flow. Our Malls and Premium Outlets occupancy ended the year at
96.1%. This was 100% – 100 basis points lower than year-end 2014 due to the timing of lease-up of more than 2
million square feet of new space we brought on line this year from expansions and new developments, as well as
replacing the 1.3 million square feet of space loss due to tenant bankruptcies during the year.
Importantly, we are more than 90% leased on the new space we brought on line this year. The timing of the lease-up on
the remaining space to be leased impacted our year-end occupancy by approximately 50 basis points.
By the end of the year, we replaced more than 70% of the space lost to tenant bankruptcies and the remaining space to
be leased impacted occupancy by 50 basis points as well. Put the two together and that's a 100 basis point differential.
Leasing activity remains healthy as evidenced by the Mall and Premium Outlets' recorded leasing spreads of $10.62 per
foot, an increase of 18% and the base minimum rent was $48.96, which was up more than 4% compared to last year,
reflecting strong retailer demand for our locations.
As I mentioned, retailer demand for space remained strong. Retailers who want to grow their business are adding brand
extensions and creating new brands and pure-play e-tailers want physical locations to increase their revenues. E-tailers
who opened bricks-and-mortar stores experienced increased consumer awareness and subsequently greater organic site
traffic and lower customer acquisition costs. We have repeatedly heard from retailers that online sales is directly
influenced by the presence of a physical store in that market.
When a retailer opens a physical store in a market, they see their online sales increase. And likewise, if they close the
store, they see their online sales in that market decline. Successful omni-channel retailers are increasing their "buy
online and pick up in store". This functionality not only increases convenience for shoppers, but also facilitates
incremental purchases and upsell opportunities when the shopper enters our retail environment.
For 2015, sales per square foot for our Mall and Premium Outlets were $620 a foot compared to $619. Comparable
sales per square foot for the malls increased 5.7%. We were up a greater amount at the mills, and we were down
slightly at our tourist-oriented Premium Outlets, and up slightly at our non-tourist outlet centers.

We have great centers in key tourist locations that generate incredible sales volume and is the envy of the industry. The
strong dollar, however, impacted tenant sales at these unique centers which negatively affected our overage rent for the
quarter.
I know you've all heard about mall traffic decreases. Well, let me give you some facts based on our internal data across
the largest retail portfolio in the U.S. and not just estimates derived from arbitrary algorithms. Traffic at our Malls was
flat for the year, including the holiday season. Traffic at our Premium Outlets increased 1.5% for the year and more
than 2% for the holidays, and traffic at the mills increased slightly for the year as well.
Comp NOI increased 3.7% for the full-year 2015 and increased 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2015. For the fourth
quarter, overage rent declined $13 million year-over-year due to the lower sales volumes that I mentioned already at
our tourist-oriented centers. The lower overage rent impacted our comp NOI for the quarter of approximately 100 basis
points.
I will strongly remind you, we do not include lease settlement income, new acquisitions or the impact of recently
redeveloped or expanded centers in our comp NOIs, in our comp NOI number. Total NOI from our consolidated and
unconsolidated properties increased more than 7% to $5.8 billion in 2015. That was on top of 6.7% growth in 2014.
And this includes any NOI contribution from Klepierre.
Now, let me quickly talk, as we could spend hours on our redevelopment and expansion. At the end of the fourth
quarter – but I'll give you some highlights. At the end of the fourth quarter, redevelopment expansion projects were
ongoing at 29 properties across all three of our platforms with a total committed spend of $1.5 billion. During the
quarter, we opened two significant expansions and completed a number of other strategic redevelopments including the
new Fashion Wing at Del Amo which includes a new Nordstrom and more than 100 exceptional brands, an expansion
in the Colonnade at Sawgrass where we added 20 small shops, very high-end small shops and two restaurants, and the
redevelopment at Phipps, Woodfield Mall and Menlo Park. We also started construction on several new projects during
the quarter including the shops at Riverside and Copley Place. Construction continues on other major redevelopment
and expansion projects at some of our most productive properties including Roosevelt Field, Stanford, King of Prussia,
Woodbury Commons, The Galleria in Houston, most of these projects will be completed in 2016 and Houston Galleria
will go into 2017 as well.
Now, on the – not to be ignored, we continue to be active on new development. We opened two new outlets during the
quarter in Tucson and Tampa, both off to very strong sales start. Construction continues on two new domestic outlets in
Columbus and Clarksburg, both scheduled to open later this year as well as a designer outlet in Provence, France which
is scheduled to open in the spring of 2017.
We also started construction in upscale outlet center in Seoul, Southwest Seoul, Korea, scheduled to open in the spring
of 2017. This will be our fourth there. And we also recently announced a new partnership with Ivanhoe Cambridge to
develop the Premium Outlet collection at Edmonton International Airport which will be our fourth outlet in Canada.
This is expected to open in the fall of 2017.
Two new full-priced developments are ongoing, as you know, one in Miami at Brickell Centre opening this fall and
Fort Worth at The Shops at Clearfork scheduled to open in early 2017. Leasing demand at both are great. Brickell will
be anchored by Saks; Clear Fork will be open-air and anchored by Neiman Marcus.
Portfolio changes, we sold the shops at Sunset Place, and we recently completed the sale of Columbia Gorge outlet.
And we also recently acquired, with our partner, McArthurGlen, the majority interest in a leading outlet center in
Ochtrup, Germany, Northwest Germany. This successful center is well positioned within the market and has significant
value-added expansion opportunities.
Let me run through the balance sheet. Two senior note offerings totaling $1.9 billion was done last year with an
average weighted coupon of 2.34%, term of 7.5 years. We redeemed four series of senior notes totaling $1.7 billion
with a weighted average coupon of 6%. We closed 23 new mortgages with an average interest rate of 3.2% and 8.5
years.

Our liquidity was $5.5 billion at the end of the quarter. Our fixed charge coverage is up to 4.5 times. And recently, we
completed a very successful senior notes offering earlier this month, raising $1.35 billion at an average interest rate and
term of 2.9% at 8.2 years in a very volatile capital market scenario.
Dividends, we paid a record dividend in 2015 of $6.05 per share. This has achieved a compound annual growth rate of
more than 18% over the last five years. We announced our dividend today to be paid this quarter of $1.60, which is an
increase of 14% year-over-year. Okay, that's pretty busy.
Now, let me talk about our guidance for 2016. It's $10.70 to $10.80. This range represents 9% to 10% growth compared
to the FFO per share of $9.86 for 2015 and again will be industry-leading. Our range is based on the following
assumptions; comp NOI for our portfolio of malls, outlets and mills of at least 3.5% and total NOI growth of more than
6% for the portfolio.
No additional planned acquisition or retail disposition activity than what we recently completed. Continued unfavorable
impacts related to foreign currency devaluations which should affect us by approximately $0.05 compared to 2015.
And importantly, we are not assuming any additional share count decrease, so an average diluted share count of 362
million.
We are now looking forward to your questions. Operator, are you with us?

[Operator Instructions]
<A - David E. Simon>: Hello? Operator?
Operator
Yes. Can you hear me?
<A - David E. Simon>: We don't have any question, ma'am. Let's go to the next.
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum, UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: David, you touched on the link between retailers having stores at your malls and Internet
sales in that local market. One of the questions I get recently from investors is the concept of occupancy cost being
measured as a percentage of sales just at that mall store.
When you're talking to retailers now about the rent they should be paying, how is the conversation going such that you
can capture some of those Internet sales in the rents that you're charging them at the physical mall? Because, to me, that
seems like an important shift in the business going on.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I don't – again, I – let's separate the media narrative to reality. But we are including any
sale that comes from their store, and it could be driven by the Internet, is in our sales that come from that store. So,
we're getting the benefit of that. And so, I still think occupancy costs are still going to be very important to the overall
negotiation of what the rent they're able to proceed.
However, it is important to note that stores for these retailers are part of their distribution network. And when they look
at whether or not they're going to keep a store open, they're also going to evaluate what their decrease in overall
Internet sales might be in that market. And that is a benefit to us, not that we have a lot of stores that are at risk for

closures other than through bankruptcy. So – and at 12.3%, given our productivity and given where our rents are and
what you've seen from the history, I mean we've got – we still have a very good runway to continue to increase our
rents.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay. And then second question, can you touch on your interest in Macy's real estate now
that they're clear that they may want to do something there? And in particular, I guess in theory, it would be with your
Hudson Bay joint venture, but maybe just touch on your interest level there. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, they've been a very important partner of ours, and obviously, they have very good
real estate. So, I can say nothing really is happening that's material or meaningful other than our normal ongoing
business, and that's been very productive. And we have an excellent relationship with Macy's both from a real estate
and a corporate point view.
They've been very supportive in our efforts to enhance the quality of our real estate through our expansion and
redevelopment activity. And if they've got ideas on how they want to look at the real estate, we're happy to do it either
as part of the HBC JV or on our own, but nothing really is happening other than day-to-day business.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And the only thing I would add, in the course of that day-to-day business, we acquired a
Bloomingdale store at Stanford, demolished it, creating small shop. They built a new Bloomingdale store. We
combined three Macy's stores into two at Del Amo to facilitate our expansion. So, that day-to-day business does
involve activities with respect to their existing stores.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Thanks, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: And, look, I think it's very interesting that the market needs to understand on these retailers, a
Macy's and a Penney and down the list. I mean, the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of their stores have four-wall profits.
And Rick and I just did a tour in Texas this week. And I'll let you guys figure out who the retailers are – of major note
in Texas are. And we hear that repeatedly, so Macy's, I'm sure the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of those stores that they
have are – have four-wall profits.
So, I don't anticipate there to be significant changes, but we'll see. And I think it'll give us the opportunity. I think Rick
made a great point in that if we can pick off a Bloomingdale's at Stanford in the middle of a mall and re-lease it to
high-end shops and they can build a new store, that's a win-win for everybody involved. So, I think there will be a few
of those as well.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy, Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Hey, David. It's Michael Bilerman with Christy. Just question about the balance
sheet. And as you think about your very conservative balance sheet with exceptional cost of capital and access to
capital, and I'm curious as you think about maintaining that really strong balance sheet, how much of it is thinking
about opportunities down the road? And I don't know how quickly those opportunities will come into view and how
much is it your concern, perhaps about the macro environment.
And I recognize as a use of capital, you can buy back stock which you haven't really done in the back half of the year.
And you have a very large development and redevelopment pipeline which is funded by free cash flow. But your
overall leverage metrics and access to capital have never been better in the company's history. And I'm just trying to
think about what's driving that in your mind as you run the company.

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think it's a great point and it ignored a lot in terms of how people look at our company.
But I love the fact that our interest coverage was 4.5 times given the size of our – I should say fixed charge coverage,
not just interest coverage. And I love the fact that we can fund our development and new development from our free
cash flow and yet, at the same time, have a compound annual growth rate dividend increase of 18%.
I mean, you can't put those kind of metrics against anybody. And you can't issue in a day, paper at under 3% when the
CMBS market is cracking and the life company market is cracking and the high-yield market is cracking, and yet we're
able to go, whether it's in the Euro market or the U.S. fixed income market, but place that kind of paper in that kind of
speed. And it's undervalued by the equity markets. To me, that is sacrosanct. And I have been very reluctant to enter the
big deal business; I continue to be. And we are so busy.
I mean, I – as you know, I have a hard time speaking generally. When we write our script, I can barely get the words
out because I didn't take elocution classes in high school. But the fact of the matter is, we are extremely busy building
and adding value to the portfolio using our external free cash flow; that remains the focus. I think we'll be very
conservative on buying our stock back in today's market. And my view on the big deal business really hasn't changed.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Hi, David. It's Christy here. Just following up on some of the stats that you mentioned earlier,
with traffic in the malls flat, but sales up 5.7% which is encouraging. I'm wondering if you have a sense for what's
driving that differential. Are people staying in the mall longer, visiting fewer stores, are conversions higher? Just with
several retailers out there commenting that mall traffic is down and the impact that that perception is [inaudible]
(25:19) share prices, just any information that we can get from your data would be helpful.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I think it's a very important point to make the following distinction. So, remember, we
get the overall traffic number. And yet most of the folks that quote – most of the folks that quote numbers are based on
algorithms. So, it's not real, necessarily, data like we have. And number two is, it is derived from certain stores.
So, it doesn't necessarily equate to mall traffic. And it gives you store data, but not mall traffic data, and that's the
distinction that I – really important to make. And I will tell you the trend, though, with mobile technology is that the
consumer today clearly is going to the physical environment, more educated, they're doing less browsing, and they're
going to less stores.
So, we think that the store data that you get is, in fact – maybe it's a little bit not that far off, but it doesn't represent
mall traffic. And I just think the consumer is going to a few less stores because they're doing less browsing because
they're more informed prior to their visit. But overall, the mall traffic is what we say it is, our comp sales are what they
are.
And it's so operator-driven. You could be in a category where one retailer is excelling and another one is not. And it's
not a tide that's lifting all boats, but it's really retail and operator-driven. And the good news is, overall – and given the
size of our portfolio, we have a pretty good handle on this, overall, we're having pretty good comp sales increases.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: So the bottom line is, the same number of people are coming to the mall, but sales are up
5.7%. They're just spending more while they're there.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's the bottom line and they may be going to a few less stores, I think. Yeah, you're
probably right. I probably could have shortened the explanation, but that's the bottom line.
<Q - Christy McElroy>: Thanks David.

<A - David E. Simon>: I hope that's Craig. I hope that's Craig.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Yes. It is Craig. No transformation. My question is really on the future role of anchors
at regional malls. How is your view changing of the anchors? I mean, there seems to be a lot of repurposing going on
such as the JVs in Seritage. And I'm also thinking about what you've done at Florida Mall, and what you're going to be
doing at Shops at Riverside. It seems like you're taking a somewhat different view of what the anchor's role is.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think it's such a – and I'll let Rick weigh in here. I mean, it's such a real
estate-specific equation. But in a lot of cases, the vendors that go into a department store, in certain cases, would rather
have mall stores. And when we feel as if that's the case, well, we'd rather just have the mall – we'd just rather have the
vendor as a retailer, and we don't necessarily want to rely on the department store to bring those vendors.
So, again, it's specific, and it's all about creating the right environment and experience. And in some cases, having this
department store as part of that is vital, i.e., take Del Amo with Nordstorm. They built a fantastic store. It is so
complementary to what we've done. We couldn't be prouder of that redevelopment in that Nordstrom store and the
environment it's helping us create.
In other cases, the vendor – we had a Saks store at Riverside. They don't do well in New Jersey at all. And we feel like
those vendors that were in that store actually would have a better experience in our redone environment than they
would in the Saks box. So it's – and Florida Mall is a great example of just taking an underperforming Saks that was
not attracting the consumer. We went from, I think, a $10 million Saks to $50 million of revenue generated after
repurposing that box. And that's what it's all about. Rick?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah. Well, the only thing I would add is that every mall has its own story. So for –
frankly, at Roosevelt Field, the addition of Neiman Marcus is going to be a fundamental expansion of the market area,
that's a traditional fashion anchor. At Florida Mall, we added the Crayola Experience that – and that market is just
doing great business and expands the trade area of that property. What we're all about is trying to put in the appropriate
retailers to maximize the importance of our properties in the markets that they serve.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. And how is some of the progress on your JVs with Seritage?
<A - David E. Simon>: Pretty good. I just had breakfast with Ben. I think hopefully, we'll get four or five started this
year, Rick, right?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah.
<A - David E. Simon>: That is the plan?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yes. Literally, we've got pro formas, plans done. Frankly, the most interesting timeline is
working with Sears as to how their store is going to be reconfigured, and that just takes some time. But we've identified
their replacement tenants. We've identified the pro formas. And as David said, we anticipate having developments
underway in at least half the properties we have in our joint venture this year.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thanks, Craig.

Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows, Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Hi. Good morning. Just on the topic of occupancy costs, it has been steadily increasing over
the past few years as you've done a good job of really being able to push the rents despite slower sales growth. But I
was just wondering is this something we should be concerned about? And to what extent are retailers pushing back, or
are the higher occupancy costs just a part of doing business in a strong mall now?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I mean at 12.3%, I would not worry at all. And I think we have to put in
perspective how much our growth is ahead of GDP growth. I mean, we are in a – I mean, if you look at our results this
year, and what we did above and beyond our expectations, if we take out the extraordinary gain and loss that I
mentioned. But if you just look at our numbers and the fact that we overcame a relatively softer retail environment, a
lot of things going into that move toward durable goods and increased in healthcare costs and taxes, and general
economic malaise, we overcame our foreign currency translation from outside of the U.S. here.
And then obviously, the strong dollar, if you look at our outlet business, I mean, traffic was up across the portfolio. Yet
sales were down there because the international tourists spent less. It's pretty good execution with some of the
headwinds that we've done. The 12.3%, the way I look at it, is an insurance policy against a slow growth U.S. economy
that we continue to well outperform GDP growth. And if it were up 15%, 16%, maybe that's when we would raise the
alarm. But at 12.3%, we've got great insurance to continue to grow the cash flow.
And if you look at our comp NOI, which is a real number, okay, which is a real number of at least 3.5%, and what's the
Goldman – tell me what the Goldman – today's Goldman – get the conservative economist at Goldman, not the bullish
one. Get the one that you've got in the closet. What's their GDP growth? What are they saying, 2%, 1.5%?
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, tell me. What are they saying, Caitlin? Say 1.5%.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Yes.
<A - David E. Simon>: I mean, we're 200 basis points above that and part of that is because we do have leases that are
under market and we'll be able to continue to push that. At the same time, our business is all about repeat business.
We've got to find a win-win with our retailers. We try to do the best we can meeting the expectations of our growth for
us, for our investors. At the same time, we want our retailers as strong as possible. It's challenging to find that
equilibrium. We do a pretty good job of it, and I'm confident we can continue to do it, not completely. Sometimes we
screw up at all the various ends there. But at the end of the day, we try to find that equilibrium that will satisfy our
retailer partner, satisfy our own internal expectations, satisfy our investors. That's why we've been able to grow our
earnings 14% per annum, increase the dividend 18% per annum over a long period of time, industry leading. We try to
find that equilibrium. We have an insurance policy.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Got it. Okay. So it sounds like we shouldn't be concerned yet there. And then just...
<A - David E. Simon>: I will let you know. Okay?
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: Okay. And then just regarding your current share price, the market appears to be supporting
other mall REITs that might have some takeout potential, while perhaps punishing you as a potential buyer. So the
stock is down today. Can you comment on basically turning this argument over by buying yourself and repurchasing
shares? I know you mentioned before that you'd be very conservative with doing that in the future.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think what Bilerman asked earlier, I mean we are out of the big deal business. So
people can speculate all they want. And I do think the market should understand, and as our plan that we will be
conservative on buybacks as some of the higher – I understand, Tom, that some of the higher estimates out there on
First Call were due to the buyback numbers. So that's part of the issue there. We're going to be conservative there. I
love having a great balance sheet. This is not a short-term game here. This is long-term. But I'm out of the big deal
business. Somebody wants to call me up and talk to me and show me how to make money, I'm happy to have that
conversation. But my opinion hasn't changed since really last spring. So I don't really know what else I can tell you on
that front. And we won't be afraid to buy back stock. It's just we're not planning right now. We have the authorization
to do it. People are betting against us for whatever reason. That's the markets. But we have a growing dividend and
growing earnings. And that's usually a bad thing to bet against.
<Q - Caitlin Burrows>: I agree. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Good morning, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you doing, Alex?
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Doing well, doing well. So just quickly, I'll go to the second question first and then I'll
go to my first question second, because you mentioned dividend. Last year you guys raised the dividend quarterly.
Obviously, it was up almost 20% for the year. This year should the expectation – you didn't raise it from fourth quarter.
So should we think about just more normalized sort of annual increase, or do you think that we'll see a steady-state of
increases throughout the year? And part of that is just trying to read into cash flow use. Maybe with what's going on,
you guys are trying to husband more cash or maybe it was just that, hey, you raised it a lot last year and now you want
to go back to an annual increase?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I think, look we've been chasing our taxable income, as you know, and there's a lot that
goes into that equation. If we kept it at $1.60, that would 6% growth year-over-year. I would think that that would be at
the bare minimum of what happens, but I would start to like to get into a normalized once-a-year raise, so we don't do it
sequentially like we've been doing it quarter after quarter. I think that should be your expectation going forward. And
we'll probably assess that near the end of each year now as we had in the past. But that's subject to change, obviously,
with the input of our taxable income calculation as well as obviously our board's input. But at the very, very least, over
6% growth. I would like for it to be annualized and – I am sorry, once a year when we evaluate it, which would
probably most likely be in the back half, so we can position it for the subsequent year. But as you know, with our NOI
growth of at least over 6%-plus, our taxable income is going to be increasing. And so that'll be driving our dividend
increase up as well.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then the second question is, I think it was in your response to Christy's
question. If shoppers are getting more selective and visiting fewer stores: one, it sounds like a merchandising issue
from retailers; and then, two, does that mean that we should expect higher retailer turnover, like we should see more
stores closing if they can't get their merchandising right, or your view was the retailers that had trouble attracting
shoppers last year are quickly addressing their merchandising issues?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, I think the retailers clearly are in that boat, and they're not as – look, we did
experience in 2015 a number of bankruptcies of kind of the really poor-performing retailers. There was clearly a
slowdown in retail sales in the back-half of the year. And then when you couple that with the tourism issue, you couple
that with the warmer weather, it was, so to speak, a perfect storm. And it took a lot of retailers out. We've seen this
movie. I don't know if it's Rocky VII. I'm ready for Creed, okay? So, we don't have to keep seeing this movie over
again.
I think our retailers are pretty sophisticated adapting, very aggressive. And I think part of the responsibility of driving
traffic to more stores is – the onus is on us, meaning we've got to create an environment which does and is able to
communicate to the consumer what's going on in the malls, so that they can visit kind of more stores than they have and
that they leased it in 2015 and take advantage of them when they're in our store. And I think clearly as our retailers
sync up their information, drive traffic to the stores, fulfill out of the stores, return out of the stores, all of that is going
to be incremental as their systems get more sophisticated. That I think hopefully will extend stays and allow people to
visit more stores.
So it's all the work in progress. We've got to do some of that ourselves. And as you know, we're doing a lot of that.
We're at the forefront of a lot of that activity to try and figure out how the best way to communicate to the consumer so
they go see eight stores or 10 stores as opposed to four stores, five stores or six stores.

<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then just for your – I know how much you love your Crooked Stick
suggestion box. But as you guys do a lot of the development and redevelopment, it would just be helpful from our end
to have a table in the supp that just sort of quantifies the amount and quarter that developments and redevelopments
will come on line just from a modeling perspective.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. I think I'm happy to do that. Now I will say this. I know there was a comment or two that
said about our returns going down; absolutely not. Our mix changes every quarter, which we – probably Tom could do
a better job of pointing that out. And I assure you that if we are going to deliver, we do have to have a materiality
threshold for the size of our company, but I assure you and the market that if we have a major development or a major
redevelopment where we're going to lay an egg, we'll let you know.
That's not what happened in today's supplement. We had some things come off and we had some things come on just
like we do every quarter, and Tom is happy to walk you through what went in and what went out. But I assure the
market if we're going to lay an egg on anything that's new, whether it's new or redevelopment, we'll let you know, with
some materiality threshold, obviously. But that's not the case with the changes in our development pipeline and
redevelopment pipeline.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, David.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Just I guess two quick questions. You mentioned that, I guess, comp sales were up, I think, you
said 5.7%. When I look in the supplemental and just look at total sales, it's basically flat December to December. And I
realize that comp sales are only a piece of the overall sales, but as you replace weaker tenants with new ones, I would
think there's an uplift. I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile the strong comp sales.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, remember, our comp, you got to be in the place for 24 months. So that's not the case.
That's number one. And number two, I mean, we did have slippage in our tourist-oriented centers, not just the outlets
but in a number of the malls that we had to deal with. And again, it wasn't a traffic issue and it's not anything other than
– and I know we've seen it from the retailers, but the tourism that is important to the economic growth of United States
of America, they have come but they spent less. And we have unbelievable great properties that in the long run are
fantastic. And the sales have come out – I mean, we have small shops and medium-sized shops that do $30 million, $40
million of volumes in some of these places, but the tourism affected that. And as you know, we've got a lot going on in
some of our major properties moving tenants in and out. So you put it all together, total sales were relatively flat. We
don't view that as a big deal.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Any sense as to what – of the overall sales, comp sales make up what percentage of that
total sales number? Is it two-thirds of the bucket, three-quarters, a half?
<A - David E. Simon>: 70%.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: 70%. Okay. And then, I guess, in terms of bankruptcies this year, I mean, I realize you guys got
hit pretty hard last year. You're working through. What is your expectation for bankruptcies this year and how is that
impacting that sort of 3.5% NOI number that you're giving us?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, it is. I mean, we still have lease up from last year, and we have budgeted in some
of the weaker tenants whether they go bankrupt, or we renegotiate short-term deals, while we replace them with

stronger tenants. I mean, that's all factored in there. So we've been conservative on overage rent. We are not a perfect
science model, nor is this U.S. economy. So we do the best that we can, budgeting the best that we can, being as
conservative as we can. We clearly thought in 2015 we would hit 4%.
We didn't because of the overage rent thing that we did mention and that was – as you know, overage rent you hit
breakpoints or if you're over the breakpoints, there's a lot of volatility. The fourth quarter is important in total sales.
That's hard to necessarily model. But we took a very conservative approach in how we looked at the books at year-end,
and we're taking a reasonably conservative approach.
We still have work to do, but conservative sales, conservative lease up, conservative restructurings of certain tenants,
whether in or out of bankruptcy, is all factored into that number. But importantly, Steve, and this is the true distinction.
I mean our 3.5% NOI is different than most people, okay? So you have to put that into perspective.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: I do. I appreciate that. I'm just trying to get a sense, do you think the $1.3 million will go up or
down in 2016? Do you think you have similar amounts or...?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think it will go down. I think it will go down. 2015 was a big year.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan, Canaccord. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Just in terms of the impact you mentioned, if I understand correctly in terms of occupancy
from the space that was added but wasn't and if leased wasn't occupied at year-end. Was that sort of part of the budget
that maybe we just didn't fully understand going into the quarter, or was there any openings that may be kind of slipped
into the first quarter that were expected for the fourth quarter?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I think when you open a new project and you get to 90% – what was it, 90.7% or
whatever it was – I mean, when you open a new project and you're at 90.7% year one that's pretty good. It's just not at
96% or 97%, and that creates a little bit drag on the overall occupancy. So that's just real estate development. I don't
know of any project that opens 100% occupied. Maybe a few do. And as I think we mentioned in the third quarter, we
did put a lot in the system last year. So our resources were maxed out between all the redevelopments and all the new
stuff. Again, it's not like we're delivering these things at 60% occupied or 50%. 90%, 90.7% at the end of year one is
pretty good. So I think that's pretty good execution.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Yes. Okay. And then you've got a lot of your kind of A plus assets that are under construction
right now with expansions and redevelopments. Is there any dislocation that takes place rather than the numbers or just
in terms of traffic? Some of the malls are kind of getting torn up in pretty major ways as you're doing the expansions.
Does that trickle through to sales in your expectation or CAM or anything that's material?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we don't want excuses. But yes, we've ripped up Roosevelt Field, we ripped up
King of Prussia. And those we didn't take them out of our sales numbers, and those things – you move tenants around.
We had a number of those scenarios this year, which is investing in the future, and it's not an immediate return.
So I would tell you that all of those – we had a setback in Copley because we're ripping Copley to shreds, moving
tenants around, making room for the potential of the apartment/condo towers. So that's clearly affecting us. But at the
end of the day, we're just not going to use that as a basis to say, here is a little bit of a slippage. But, yes, it clearly
affected 2015 both from an NOI point of view and a sales point of view, because a lot of these we're moving traffic

around, we're closing entrances, and there is absolutely dislocation going on.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Thanks. And then just lastly, any update on your current thoughts about mixed use. You've
got, obviously, some of it in your redevelopment pipeline. But as you think about your shadow pipeline, kind of both
with your own properties and then specifically with some of these heritage opportunities, how big a piece of your
portfolio is residential or other mixed use sort of something we could see over the next decade?
<A - David E. Simon>: I still think it's going to grow but selectively. I kind of view this as – the good news in that, it's
almost like our international investments. We've had such great results from our international investments. I mean, if
you looked at what's on our books and what the value of this real estate is, it's a homerun, a homerun. If you look at the
yield on cash flow returns, a homerun. That gives us – the only wrinkle on that is we lost $10 million in China, but if
you look at Klepierre, McArthurGlen, our own development in Japan, Korea, Canada, homerun. We've also had great
experience and I can't think of a problem we've had, Rick – in our mixed-use developments.
So, as we gain more confidence in that business, I think, we'll continue to do it. But as you know, that's so driven by
supply and demand, and it's so specific to the real estate. But we like it, we've had good success in it, we'll continue
with it, so we can continue to produce the results that we produced in that area.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Adornato, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Paul Edward Adornato>: Hi. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could compare the performance of
your top tier properties minus the noise of any redevelopments versus the bottom tier. The market seems to dislike
Class B properties, and I was wondering if your lower tier is subject to some of those same risks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well – look I think that our portfolio is – our results and our averages kind of – indicative of
kind of what results were. So, I don't think there is any unusual trend. I think the market sometimes maybe overreacts
to the only game in town mall. We think that business is good and very viable. If that only game in town market has too
much retail, it's going to be hurt. But that could be in an A market, too.
I don't think we had any real unpleasant surprises in the not-exciting markets that we still own. The only thing that was
a little out of the ordinary from our results this year was the tourist spend that we've mentioned. And obviously, that
happened at some of our most unique landmark properties. I mean, we can't hide from that fact. Not a long-term issue, I
hope.
And – but the tourists reigned in a little bit, they reign in in New York City, Madison Avenue, Fifth Avenue, down in
Miami, north and south of the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso. We have Mexican nationals that shop at some of our
premier properties. We've got the Canadian snowbirds. I mean, that happens. That's the only trend that I would say is a
little bit different than what we've experienced, not the only game in town which is we are in some of those markets.
But they continue to perform very well.
<Q - Paul Edward Adornato>: Thanks. And as a follow-up, could you talk about rent growth at the luxury side of the
retail business, what should we expect given the dollar?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think it's good because, as you know, a lot of that even with the growth, even with the
tourism spending down, most of those leases are well below market, number one. And number two is there is still
unique enough properties that when the opportunity presents itself that the demand is still there for that real estate. So
very few people, I'd say, very few retailers don't – that are – of that nature that we want in those properties, don't look
at the long-term opportunity. But if there is a difference, it's on the margin. But we're still pretty insulated from that.
Demand is good and our leases are under market there.

Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim, SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. So David, hypothetical question, given that we know a little bit more about the market
and what the equity markets are doing versus last spring, all else equal – and I know Macerich has sold some assets, but
in your mindset today and what you know about the world, would you still be a buyer of Macerich, all else equal, if it
was back in the market today?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm not going to comment on that.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: All I'm going to comment on is where we are today and I've explained that a couple of
different places, okay?
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Okay. And then the second question on your outlet business, you've already talked about the
net traffic or tourists being down a little bit. But does that eventually translate into lease spreads where it's not just the
overage rents that are taking a little bit of a hit, but if this continues, are your lease spreads that the tenants are willing
to pay eventually become more at risk?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, the reality is I wish they were at market because then the volatility – just so you know,
when we roll over a lease, we try to get effective rent, which is base rent plus overage rent. And the reason we have a
little more volatility is because the lease hasn't expired. So, the good news is as these leases expire, we're going to be
able to get them at market rent. I mean, that's why we had a little exposure in the fourth quarter because we're not at
market rent. We're not at market rent.
So, even with today's decrease in tourism spend, the important point, though, also is that the traffic was up. And so
that's an important point. I mean, the traffic was up. It was really just the spend was down. And I think that's just going
to be an adjustment until we get where the currencies are a little more stable and anniversary themselves. But it's our
intention to make that overage volatility go away, and that's marking the leases to market.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Yes. Good morning or good afternoon. Just curious, going back to the 1.3 million square feet of
bankruptcy space that was taken back, I thought I heard earlier that 70% had been re-let as of the end of the year. And I
apologize if I missed this, but I guess how did that stack up relative to your expectations? I mean, would you have
expected to have more of that re-leased by now? And just – well, I'll leave it at that.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Hi. This is Rick. In fact, we were doing very well with that re-leasing. What we are going
to do is we're not going to put our space on sale. We're holding our margins. In fact, the rent per foot of the space that
has been leased are above the rents of the tenants that left because of bankruptcy, and we're making sure that we are
getting in the right tenants at the right price, at the right space. So, we're on track with that. And there, well, you'll
continue to see the benefit of that coming into this year as more of those leases open.

<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks. And on a slightly different topic, just going back to sort of the changing profile of
the mall and maybe the decreasing importance of the anchors, particularly as a traffic driver, just curious if this or if
you think about shortening lease terms from the traditional lease deals, five years or so, just so you have more control
over how to control and create that experience, given that tastes change pretty quickly and things like that?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: When we do our leasing, every space and every tenant has their own situation, and we are
strategic about our terms. If we feel that it's a tenant that is underperforming the mall, maybe we'll do a shorter-term. If
it's a tenant that we are highly desirous of having in the mall, we want them to remodel, we may give them a longer
term. So, there's no overarching strategy on term. It's really a lease-specific strategic decision.

Your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund, Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - George Andrew Hoglund>: Yeah. Hi. I was wondering if you could give some additional color on the trends in
asking rents, because what we've been hearing is that asking rents are down year-over-year in the A malls, as it's
getting a little bit tougher to backfill space and the sort of balance of power may be shifting a little bit towards the
tenants. I was wondering if you could just give some color on that?

mean, is it mall space?

okay? And, I mean, I know everybody wants all these metrics, but you've got to look at what we're all about, which is

growing earnings, growing dividends, investing for the future. And I do think there's this move on metrics that I just
want to put in overall perspective that it's not how we – we don't stress over metrics the way others might. We're just
focused on increasing our cash flow, investing for the future, making our properties the best they can be in a particular
market for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers. And we will just tell you that as we model all this, we're
expecting an increase in occupancy. It takes a lot of work. How many leases did we sign this year my friends?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Over 10 million.
<A - David E. Simon>: 10 million square feet, right? So, it's hard to model, but we've had a pretty good track record.
But certain things are out of our control; bankruptcies, tourism spend, and so on. So, again, it's a slight uptick, and we
hope to be able to achieve that.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. And then may be a quick, Andy, question. It looks like interest income tripled in
the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Just wondering what's driving that. I know it's not a huge number in the
grand scheme of things, but still.
<A - David E. Simon>: We can get back to you on that.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. Great, thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum, Boenning. Please proceed.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: David, Floris. Quick question on your NOI growth. You posted 7% this year. If you do that
for 10 years you've basically almost doubled your NOI. Is it reasonable to expect that kind of growth going forward,
sort of the 3% on top of your same-store numbers that you're expecting to post?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it's a good question. I can't – 10 years is a hard time for me to project. But look, I think –
the redevelopment and development pipeline that we've got, I mean, I think we've got a pretty decent shot at continuing
that as we go forward. I mean, I think the fact is, Floris, as you know, a lot of people have doubted our ability to grow
our earnings because of the size of the company. And obviously, math does make it a little bit harder.
But the fact is nobody in our industry, and when I say industry, I'm talking about retail real estate – nobody in our
subsector of our industry, retail real estate, has been able to do that over a – sure, a quarter here, a quarter there, a year
there, a year there. But over the life of our company, nobody has been able to do this. I mean, we started out with, I
think, if I can remember the math, $200 million of earnings. We're at $3.6 billion, okay. That's not too shabby, as I said
in my Annual Report, quoting Adam Sandler, that nobody liked but I kind of thought it was funny. But the point is, I
don't know. Well, we got a good runway for the next three years, Floris.
<Q - Floris van Dijkum>: One follow-up question maybe, David, on Aventura. I noticed there is – it's not in your
supplement, but there are potential plans for, I guess, an expansion that Seritage is suing Turnberry over. Can you make
any comments on that?
<A - David E. Simon>: We're not named in that lawsuit. So, we have no – and we haven't seen the complaint, so we've
got nothing more to add.
And the one question on the other income was the cash flow that we got from our investment in value retail, which
tends to happen year after year. But since we only – we cost account for it, for those of you old like me, you know what
that means? We don't equity account for it, so we only book the income upon receipt of cash, and it happened to be in
that quarter. But it tends to happen year after year. Operator?
