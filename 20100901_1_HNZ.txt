MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone
to the H.J. Heinz Company Fiscal Year 2011 Quarter One Earnings Call. This call is being recorded at the request of
the H.J. Heinz Company. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers'
remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].
Thank you. I'd now like to hand the call over to Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. Nollen,
you may begin your conference.
Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you Chris, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our conference call and webcast. Copies of the
slides used in today's presentation are available on our website at heinz.com. You'll notice that our slides have a new
look about them. With the start of a new fiscal year, we switched to a white background that's easier to print and copy
and uses far less ink, in line with our sustainability goals.
Joining me on today's call are Bill Johnson, Chairman, President and CEO; and Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President,
Finance. Before we begin with our prepared remarks, please refer to the forward-looking statement currently displayed.
This is also available in this morning's earnings release and in our most recent SEC filings.
To summarize, during our presentation we may make forward-looking statements about our business that are intended
to assist you in understanding the company and its results. We ask you to refer to our April 28, 2010, Form 10-K and
today's press release, which lists some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in

these statements. Heinz undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by securities laws.
We may also use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation, as the company believes such measures allow for
consistent period-to-period comparison of the business. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and
reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are available in the company's earnings release and on our website at
heinz.com. Please note we plan to file our first quarter 10-Q by the end of the day today. Our related financial
highlights pages or stat pages are available now in the Investor Relations section of the website towards the bottom of
the page. Importantly, these stat pages provide a quarterly historical restatement for discontinued operations.
Now on to today's call. Bill will review Heinz strong performance and the current business climate. And Ed will
provide a financial review of the quarter. Bill will return to discuss our full-year outlook and offer concluding
comments. Then, of course, we'll be available to take your questions.
We'd like to request that you limit your questions during the Q&A session to one in order to ensure adequate time for
all who wish to participate. With the formalities out of the way, let me now turn the call over to Bill Johnson. Bill?
William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Meg, and good morning everyone. Today I will briefly review our company's solid first quarter performance
since Art Winkleblack, our CFO, who would typically do this call could not be with us due to an urgent family matter.
And we wish Art all the best.
As we reported this morning, Heinz delivered strong results in the first quarter despite a very tough economic
environment. I will have more to say about this challenging climate in a few minutes. Globally, we grew organic sales
by nearly 4% driven primarily by our 22% growth in emerging markets, where Heinz is well positioned and winning,
and strong growth in ketchup.
We also improved gross margins on higher productivity and net pricing, increased brand investments by almost 10% to
drive growth, delivered growth of around 10% in operating income and EPS, which increased to $0.75, achieved 13%
growth in net income and drove an increase in operating free cash flow of nearly 80%.
Overall, Heinz is off to a good start to the year. Our results from continuing operations were even stronger on a
constant currency basis, as we grew sales by nearly 4%, OI almost 13% and EPS by about 15%. Foreign currency's had
an unfavorable impact on sales, operating income and EPS, as Ed will discuss in a few minutes.
I'm proud of the fact that Heinz has now delivered 21 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth. Emerging Markets
delivered 12% volume growth to lead the way for Heinz. Excluding our U.S. Foodservice business, we also delivered
2% volume growth in developed markets, despite weak economies, driven by North American Consumer Products.
U.S. Foodservice delivered strong profit growth, reflecting our success in simplifying the business, but its sales
mirrored the industry trend of lower restaurant traffic, as consumers continued to dine and entertain more at home.
When the U.S. economy finally improves and trends in away from home dining turnaround, we believe that our
Foodservice business will return to sales growth.
Importantly, Emerging Markets continued their accelerating momentum as the most powerful growth engine for Heinz,
accounting for almost 18% of our total sales, a company record, and generating virtually all of our organic sales
growth. Our strong growth in sales and volume was propelled by nutritional beverages in India, infant feeding in China,
dynamic ketchup growth in Russia and ABC products in Indonesia, where we got a boost from the timing of the
Ramadan holiday.
Globally, our top 15 brands also performed well, delivering nearly 6% organic sales growth, reflecting our focus on
increased innovation and marketing. Our focused core categories also performed well as Heinz delivered more than 5%
sales growth in both Ketchup and Sauces and Infant/Nutrition.

The first quarter was also good for our flagship product, Ketchup, which grew 8% organically around the world. We
also achieved our highest U.S. ketchup market share in at least two years. Ketchup volume grew 7% in Europe, and we
were number one in 10 of our top 12 European markets as shares continued to grow, led by almost 40% growth in
Russian retail sales.
Heinz is focused on increasing Ketchup penetration significantly across Europe, as we outlined during our May Analyst
Meeting. Overall, Heinz Ketchup is now the number one brand in seven of the world's top 10 ketchup markets, but we
see plenty of room for growth behind our initiatives to drive trial, usage and penetration.
Looking at Meals and Snacks, Heinz delivered 2% volume growth in Frozen Meals and Snacks led in the U.S. by
Smart Ones, which gained share in the quarter. However, the Nutritional Entrée category continued to reflect weak
trends, and there is not likely to be much strength until the economy turns around.
Ambient Meals and Snacks were down primarily on lower soup sales in Australia and Europe where we are seeing
increased competition and category softness. Our Infant/Nutrition category continued its growth momentum, fueled by
our strong brands in India, China and Russia. Our nutritional beverages in India delivered nearly 30% volume growth
driven by Complan and Glucon-D. And in China, Infant/Nutrition volume grew more than 30% on higher sales of
jarred baby food and baby cereals and our launch of infant formula. In Russia, Heinz infant cereal continued to grow as
the number one brand.
It was a solid quarter for North American Consumer Products with higher sales driven by volume growth of more than
5% led by Ketchup, Smart Ones and Classico. Our strength reflected increased marketing and promotional spend in the
U.S., and I was encouraged that our increased spending was effective in driving incremental sales.
Turning to innovation. The launches of Smart Ones mini-cheeseburgers and breakfast entrees, Ore-Ida Sweet Potato
Fries and new varieties of T.G.I. Friday's in the U.S. were key to our strength in Frozen.
A terrific example of our leadership in innovation is Dip & Squeeze, the revolutionary dual function ketchup package
that offers U.S. consumers two convenient ways to enjoy Heinz Ketchup. We believe Dip & Squeeze will drive quick
serve restaurant traffic and host food consumption benefiting our customers as well as Heinz.
Dip & Squeeze is testing well in select markets and is on track for launch later this year. Across the Atlantic, we just
launched an exciting innovation in Fridge Pack Beanz, a very timely value solutions at difficult times given its reusable
twist off lid, which allows consumers to refrigerate and enjoy the beans for up to five days after opening.
Our global focus on innovation is also clearly at play in China, where we are pleased with the progress of our first
Heinz Infant Formula launch in the world's most populated nation. Our initial focus has been on building distribution,
which is ahead of plan, and we expect to ramp up marketing support in the coming months.
Now I'd like to spend a few minutes on several of the most important C's for Heinz, as you recall we talk about the C's
in most of our earnings calls. The C's I want to talk about are cash flow, currency and consumers. Ed will discuss
another important C, commodities in a few moments.
Starting with cash flow, our first quarter performance was exceptionally strong. Our nearly 80% increase in operating
free cash flow was driven largely by improved operating performance and working capital management. Strong cash
flow has become a Heinz hallmark that has enhanced our financial flexibility and enabled us to invest in our businesses
and brands, while raising the common stock dividend by 67% over seven years, including the $0.12 increase for fiscal
2011.
With more than 60% of our sales generated outside the U.S., we continue to experience the impact of currency
movements which, as Ed will show you, reduced our bottom line by $0.03 in the quarter. The unfavorable impact of
currency in the quarter was in line with our expectations, and our forecast for the full year is still tracking with the
projections that we outlined at our May meeting.
Before I turn it over to Ed, I want to share my view of the adverse economic climate and how it is impacting
consumers. While Heinz is successfully navigating the challenging environment guided by our proven growth plan, we

are seeing the worst economy in my 35 plus years of CPG experience. Whether it's a single dip or double dip recession,
the fact is that consumer confidence has not returned. Although Heinz has continued to deliver growth in this recession,
especially in emerging markets, the near-term economic outlook for the U.S. and Europe remains pretty dreary, marked
by high unemployment and low consumer confidence.
As a result, I believe many consumers have gone into what I like to term as economic hibernation, eating at home more
often, eating out less, reducing spending and worrying more about the future. Despite this environment, Heinz had a
solid first quarter, and we remain on track to meet our fiscal 2011 outlook.
However, we cannot take success for granted, and we'll be vigilantly focused on productivity, spend management,
emerging market opportunities and Ketchup growth, as ways of overcoming the effects of this daunting environment.
We're all going to have to work smarter and harder to sustain growth in this unrelenting recession.
Now I will turn it over to Ed to walk you through our strong financial results.
Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller
Thanks Bill, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our Q1 results, which shows solid
improvement in all of our key financial metrics, despite the challenging global economic conditions.
Looking first at EPS. Since currency and last year's discontinued operations have had an impact on our comparisons,
I'll start with three key perspectives on our results. First, we think it's helpful to look at the results on a constant
currency basis, which continues to be an important measure to focus on given the volatility of foreign exchange. I like
to point out that our constant currency definition only includes translation and related hedges. We no longer including
any transaction currency impacts. Constant currency EPS was $0.78, up almost 15% versus last year. Our current
period results were impacted by about $0.03 from unfavorable currency. These were largely due to the euro and the
pound as well as the devaluation in Venezuela, which occurred at the end of the third quarter last year.
Reported EPS from continuing operations was $0.75, up more than 10% from prior year. And, finally, including the
$0.01 unfavorable impact from discontinued operations last year, total company reported EPS was up $0.08 or 12%.
Now let me focus on our P&L scorecard. We've delivered improvement in every metric on both a reported and constant
currency basis. Net sales grew by 1.6%, and on a constant currency basis was up 3.7%, well within our 3 to 4% target
for the year. The organic growth was 2.5% volume improvement and 1.1 increase from pricing. Our focus on gross
margin is paying off with an improvement of 90 basis points to 36.6%.
Productivity improvements are the main driver here, which along with higher pricing and favorable mix have been able
to overcome increased commodity costs. In addition, the gross margin comparison benefited from the $7 million in
productivity charges we took last year. We continue to increase our investment in consumer marketing, particularly in
emerging markets and Europe, with an overall 12% increase on a constant currency basis.
Operating income increased 9.9% on a reported basis and 12.6% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by gross
profit, as the net impact of SG&A expenses and marketing were flat to prior year. At $0.75, EPS was up 10.3% on a
reported basis and 14.7% on a constant currency basis. Our higher operating income along with lower effective tax rate
offset lower interest income and an increase in our shares outstanding.
I'll now take you through a bridge from our reported to constant currency results. This chart summarizes the impact
currency has had on our results, which is less significant than we saw last year but nevertheless a headwind of 2% on
sales and 4% at EPS. Stripping out the impacts from both translation and translation hedges from both years, EPS was
unfavorably impacted by $0.03, $0.02 from translation and $0.01 from the hedges.
At the top line, we've had pluses and minuses from most of the currencies around the world that virtually offset, leaving
the $50 million reduction from Venezuela's devaluation flowing through to our reported results. Looking at several
important currencies for us, the pound and the euro have experienced a downward trend since the end of last calendar
year, with average Q1 rates below last year by 7 and 10% respectively.

In Venezuela, the government's devaluation in January cut the exchange rate in half. On the positive side, the
Australian dollar has appreciated, and the average is almost 10% better than last year's Q1 rates but on a much smaller
sales and profit base than Europe.
Turning to the P&L. I'll focus on few of the items that were not on the scorecard. Gross profit exceeded $900 million,
up 7% on a constant currency basis. SG&A was flat on a constant currency basis and improved 70 basis points as a
percentage of sales. Last year, we funded about $9 million in productivity charges in Q1, which drove savings in selling
and distribution this year.
The SG&A savings enabled us to increase marketing while the full gross profit improvement dropped through to
operating income. I'll go deeper on the drivers of sales and operating income on the next few slides, so I'll cover the
activity below operating income here.
Net interest and other expenses are up $13 million, largely due to last year's gain on the total return swap of $20 million
and the cost of the translation hedges I mentioned earlier. These were partially offset by lower interest rates this year.
The company's 25.3% effective tax rate for the quarter was favorable 320 basis points, primarily due to increased
benefits from foreign tax planning and the statutory rate reduction in the UK. We still expect the annual tax rate to be
about 28%, the same as last year's rate.
Now let's take a deeper look at sales. As I said, the first quarter delivered organic sales growth of 3.6%. Volume
improvements were the largest contributor, up 2.5%. Volume drivers included our emerging markets, up 12% this
quarter, as well as the U.S. and UK retail businesses. These were partially offset by declines in U.S. Foodservice and
Australia.
Net pricing is contributing less to our sales growth than last year, as we've now lapped the majority of the pricing we
took to offset commodity inflation. Overall, pricing increased sales by 1.1% as price increases in emerging markets,
particularly Latin America and U.S. Foodservice, were partially offset by increased trade promotions in the U.S. and
UK retail businesses.
Foreign exchange translation rates reduced sales by 2.1%. Acquisitions had little impact on sales for the quarter;
however, the company signed an agreement to acquire Foodstar, a manufacturer of soy sauces and fermented bean curd
in China. This acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions of closing and is another
step towards our strategy to accelerate growth in our emerging markets.
Turning to net sales performance by segment. You can see that the segments containing the majority of our emerging
markets, Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, performed extremely well along with our North American Consumer
Products segment.
North American Consumer Products sales grew 2.6% organically with a 5.3% increase in volume, which was partially
offset by a 2.7% price decline, due to increased promotional activities around our Consumer Value Program, which
drove 7% volume in the United States. In total, reported NACP sales were almost 5% up, including the 0.3%
contribution from the Arthur's acquisition in Canada and a 1.7 per cent favorable impact from Canadian exchange rates.
European sales were roughly flat on an organic basis, which we believe is a relatively good performance given the
environment in the region. Reported sales declined almost 8% due to the 7.5% unfavorable impact from foreign
exchange. Volume increased 0.2% due to the strong Ketchup performance across Europe, particularly in Russia, and
was offset by softness in soup. Net pricing decreased 0.4% as a result of increased promotional activity across most of
the region.
In the Asia-Pacific segment, organic sales grew 9.3% with a 6.9% increase in volume and 2.4% pricing improvement.
This growth was driven by the emerging markets of Indonesia, India and China while Australia remains a tough market
with intense competitive activity. Total reported sales for Asia-Pac increased by 19%, including a 9.7% favorable
impact from foreign currency.

U.S. Foodservice continues to face softness from the restaurant industry, this factor along with our pruning of lower
margins SKUs has resulted in overall sales decline of 2.3% with 5.1% due to volume. However, pricing was favorable
up 2.8%, largely due to prior year increases on Heinz Ketchup and tomato products to offset commodity and delivery
costs.
The Rest of World segment increased 24.3% on an organic basis with a 20.5% price increase, primarily in Latin
America. Volume increased 3.8% driven by the Middle East, new products, geographic expansion and increased
marketing and promotions. This was partially offset by volume declines in Latin America. Reported sales for the
segment were down 12.6% with foreign exchange translation rates, particularly the devaluation in Venezuela,
decreasing sales almost 37%.
As I noted earlier, our gross margin increased 90 basis points to 36.6% on a reported basis and improved 110 basis
points on a constant currency basis. The major factor behind the increase was productivity improvements, along with
higher pricing, which offset higher commodity costs.
During Q1, we saw market prices rise about 5%, primarily behind dairy and resins. However, favorable contract pricing
allowed us to keep our net inflation to below 1%. We expect that the inflationary impact of dairy and packaging for the
remainder of the year will be offset by favorable costs for tomatoes and potatoes, which we will see coming through the
P&L in the coming quarters, as this year's crop moves through the supply chain. Based on these trends, we're
maintaining the estimates we provided in May of market increases of approximately 2% and the net impact to us even
less.
Turning to operating income by segment. North American Consumer Products grew 3.7% as productivity
improvements and favorable volume more than offset increased commodity costs and trade promotion investments.
Excluding the favorable impact from foreign exchange, NACP's operating income increased almost 2%.
Europe's results were down 2% on a constant currency basis, stripping out the 8.4% impact of currency translation.
Gross margin improved this quarter as a result of productivity and improved mix despite higher commodity cost, while
we invested more in marketing and G&A. Our G&A investments include Project Keystone, and I'm pleased to say our
Benelux business has successfully gone live on SAP just last week, another step in our global rollout of Project
Keystone.
Although we're not adjusting for the UK cross-rate currency impact on our constant currency results this year, without
that operating income on a constant currency basis would have been positive for the quarter in Europe.
Asia-Pacific segment's operating income was up 35% on a reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis, driven
by both top line and bottom line performance in the emerging markets. Within the Asian emerging markets, Indonesia
had a particularly strong quarter aided by holiday timing and new products. We expect them to continue to drive top
line growth throughout the year, but they will face substantial increases in chili and sugar costs next quarter due to
temporary local supply constraints.
U.S. Foodservice operating income continued its dramatic improvement, up 24%. Pricing and productivity driven by
business simplification more than offset higher commodity costs particularly for packaging. We will continue to focus
on productivity while we weather the softness in the overall food service industry.
And, finally, the Rest of World segment delivered great results this quarter, up 41% on a constant currency basis, but
the devaluation in Venezuela caused the reported results to be down 12%.
Now let's move to the balance sheet scorecard. Capital expenditures of $56 million were 2.2% of sales, up 20 basis
points from the prior year, while our full-year estimate remains at about 3% of sales. Our first quarter cash conversion
cycle was 44 days, down 5 days from the prior year and operating free cash flow showed significant improvement from
last year, up $96 million.
Net debt-to-EBITDA improved 0.5 times, driven by both higher profit and lower net debt. Finally, ROIC was 19%, up
80 basis points from this time last year. This excludes the impact of losses from discontinued operations of about 80
basis points.

Quick operating working capital was favorable $100 million and CTC better by 5 days with progress on all three
components. Receivables accounted for 2 days of the improvement, which is primarily due to the impact of our
accounts receivable securitization program. We achieved a 1 day improvement in inventories, as we maintain our focus
on a more efficient supply chain.
Finally, accounts payable improved 3 days. The decrease in net debt was a result of our outstanding cash flow
performance throughout last year, which continued into the Q1 of this year.
As I mentioned earlier, operating free cash flow was up almost $100 million from Q1 of last year. Higher profits and
improved QOWC management drove most of the progress, while the net of reduced pension funding and lower
proceeds from our receivables securitization program accounted for about one third of the improvement.
Finally, dividends reflect the 7.1% increase we announced in June. In summary, we are pleased with our excellent
performance again this quarter, our ability to continue driving and executing our strategies and improving productivity
has resulted in continued growth.
With that, I will now turn it over to Bill for a few final comments.
William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Ed. Now let me quickly wrap up. As I outlined yesterday at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, we are
reaffirming the full year expectations for fiscal 2011 that I announced on May 27 at our Analyst Day.
On a constant currency basis, we expect sales growth of 3 to 4%, and operating income and EPS growth of 7 to 10%.
We also expect to deliver operating free cash flow of more than $1 billion for the second straight year. Here are a few
more details about the rest of the year as we see it.
First, while quarter one marketing was up almost 10%, I still expect full-year marketing to approximate that of fiscal
2010. Second, we plan to accelerate investments for the rest of the year, ramping up the second quarter for initiatives
like Project Keystone significantly. This will increase productivity by harmonizing global processes and systems.
Third, after posting an effective tax rate of 25.3% in Q1, as Ed said, we still expect the full year rate to be around 28%.
And finally we expect shares outstanding to be slightly higher than last year. Reflecting these factors and while I really
do not like providing quarterly guidance, I would anticipate that Q2 will mirror our first quarter profit with slightly
higher earnings in the third and the fourth quarters.
In summary, we're off to a really good start in a very difficult environment. Our business fundamentals are healthy, our
people are executing extremely well, and we continue to focus on the things that will make a difference as we work to
generate high quality earnings and strong cash flow.
Now I'll turn the call over to Meg, and then we'll open it up for your questions. Meg?
Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Great, thanks, Bill. Just wanted to let everyone know that Heinz will be presenting at the Barclays Back-to-School
Conference on September 8 at 2:15 p.m. We hope to see you there and if you can't make it, please dial in to heinz.com

<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: I guess my question will just be in the quarter, one of your largest customers was running
some substantial promotions, and we were hearing, and I think most people were, in Ketchup that was of no cost to
you. Could you just discuss how that affected your sales and your volume and how that might impact sales in the
balance of the year in terms of, will there be some give back or anything?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. I think overall, you got to
remember that organic Ketchup sales for the quarter were up about 8%, 7% volume growth in Europe. So this was all
not a function of that large customer that you're referring to. I think with that large customer we saw a couple of things
happen. One, our share in that large customer rose precipitously, much of which was due to pulling retail volume away
from competitors, not from Heinz.
Additionally, our retail businesses did pretty well, as you could see by our market shares, which grew. I think it's fair to
look at it, if you want to get into the detail, about a quarter of the U.S. retail volume increase came from the
incremental Wal-Mart volume. So let me repeat that, about a quarter of the U.S. retail volume increase came from
incremental Wal-Mart volume for the quarter. And as we told you once before, our case rate to the customer did not
change. And so I think generally, we felt that we came out of it pretty well, we saw again huge competitive shifts to our
business as noted in our share at that large customer and our retail businesses continue to do pretty well. But also Smart
Ones, Classico and our other businesses had a terrific quarter. And then more encouragingly was we grew 7% volume
in Ketchup in Europe. So just generally, our Ketchup business globally is doing extremely well.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay, thanks very much. I'll let others ask follow-ups on this.

Our next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron of RBC Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Great. Actually I just want to follow-up on, on the prior question if I could. I was wondering,
Bill, did you see other retailers follow suit and sponsor some promotions of their own on Ketchup? And then should we
be at all concerned about any pull-forward of demand from the second quarter here and how that might affect volume
in just the very near term?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: A couple of comments on that. First,
no, we did not see that program replicated at many other customers. Although remember in the first quarter, we see a
lot of the Memorial Day activity and the July 4 activity. So we do get promotion activity, as we try to work through the
major holidays, which are big ketchup consumption and uses times. So while we do not see it replicated, we had a very
strong quarter from the perspective of retail merchandising and that's why our shares were so good.
I think on the second quarter, time will tell, and we'll see how we go through the quarter, but again a great percentage
of the incremental volume we picked up came from competitors. We saw a significant shift from private label and other
branded competitors from retail to Wal-Mart in order to buy Heinz Ketchup at a dollar. And one of the things it does
show is in our mind and the thing we always balance against is the power of that brand priced competitively. And so it's
something we continue to balance against. But again I want to say very clearly that a great deal of the incremental
pickup came from competitors outside of retail and moved in to buy the product on special at Wal-Mart. And our retail
business did well behind our July 4 and Memorial Day promotions.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks. And one quick follow-up if I could just on the gross margin. You're tracking a bit
above your full year guidance, which I think was for about 50 basis points. You did mention plans to accelerate some
investments, is it fair to assume that those investments show up in the gross margin line and that's why we should mix
back upside on that line item for the full year because I don't think the inflation outlook changes much over the balance
of the year, if I heard correctly?

<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Right, I don't think my comments
mention that we didn't expect upside in gross margin for the year. So I still think we're, we feel pretty solid about 50 to
100 basis point improvement in gross margin this year. And the investments are going to be fairly significant, and they
will primarily hit us at the SG&A line for investments in Project Keystone based on the successful rollout we've
experienced in the Benelux. We'll continue to push rapidly on that. But our gross margins for the year should be in line
or better than we said at the May meeting and offset somewhat by the incremental SG&A that I expect us to get this
year as we ramp up the rollout on Keystone.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Hi, good morning, Meg and Bill.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning Chris.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: I just had two questions for you. The first one was, in this quarter if you look at the
shipment of the infant formula in China was that a meaningful factor in kind of your emerging market volume or even
your volume growth in China?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No. It certainly contributed to the
volume growth in China, but it was not a meaningful factor at all in the overall emerging market performance. In fact, I
wouldn't expect it to become a meaningful factor until probably the latter part of this fiscal year. We don't ramp up
marketing until – well we're starting to ramp up some in September but really October, November. And so it was
pipeline build, but no -- it certainly contributed to China, but it was not material to the emerging market performance
for the quarter.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then, do you have any kind of a better look at the transaction FX – benefits, I
think it's going to be a benefit now, between the pound, euro. Is that looking to be positive for the year if you just take
current rates?
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: Well, the first quarter is an
unfavorable comparison to last year. After that, we think we're going to be pretty close. The reason why we pulled it
out of our constant currency measure is that for this year it'll be relatively small impact, still looks slightly unfavorable
but not the 40 and $50 million figures that we're seeing the last two years.
<Q - Christopher Growe>: Okay. And then I think that pretty well covers it. Thank you.

<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't know that we'd say we have
to give up on it, Eric. But we're certainly not seeing it coming back in droves right now. I mean remember there's two
components to that cost rate. You've got the dollar-pound cross rate impact in terms of transaction, and you've got the
euro-pound cross rate impact. And we're obviously not seeing the pick up in the dollar-pound cross rate that we would
have hoped for. We are seeing some in the euro, and it pretty much balance each other. My perspective is, until you see
the euro-pound cross probably the 80, maybe 81 deciles and get down into the upper 70s where it was a couple of years
ago. And until you see the dollar come back against the pound or the pound come back against the dollar to the $1.60
plus level, we'll see some gradual incremental improvement, but we're not going to see a full return to picking that up.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: Okay. And then I guess as -- just to switch over to the Foodservice business. I noticed that -- a
couple of questions around that. I noticed that you highlighted that you won some more McDonald's business, so
congratulations on that.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Eric Katzman>: And I guess I'm just – you continue to circle the U.S., the U.S. is the biggest market, is it
possible for you to especially given the lower cost base with the restructuring in U.S. Foodservice, is it possible to
quantify kind of what it could mean if you were to take over McDonald's in the U.S.? And then was, given that there
was $0.99 ketchup out there, do you think that there was any – let's say, family dining as opposed to a QSR, but like
family dining that may have gone over to Wal-Mart and purchased Ketchup product there rather than ordering through
tabletop food service account?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Maybe very little. But let me break
out Foodservice sales for you to give you some perspective. Our Ketchup organic growth, we actually had organic
growth in Ketchup in Foodservice in the first quarter. We're up between 3 and 4% organically on Ketchup in Q1. The
big hit on Foodservice in the first quarter was primarily frozen deserts and frozen soup. Frozen deserts related to some
special one-off promotions we had last year with a couple of key customers that we do not repeat this year and some
softness in the mid-tier restaurant chains and the same thing with frozen soup. So if you bifurcate the Foodservice
business, our Ketchup business actually had a pretty decent quarter in U.S. Foodservice, and it was really pulled down
by the frozen businesses, predominantly frozen deserts.
In terms of the McDonald's question, Eric, how many angels can dance on the head of a pin? I want to be very careful
with my answer there because while we pick up their business outside of the United States, it's been a difficult slog for
us in the U.S. to try to get traction outside of Pittsburgh and Minneapolis. I can say this to you without terribly, without
terrible quantification. It would be a meaningful impact to the company's Foodservice business in the United States
from both a top line and potentially from a profit standpoint.
Obviously the question would always be, at what cost did you provide to get that business? But it clearly is something
we continue to strive for, clearly is something that would have a material benefit to the organization, and clearly is on
the radar for us to keep pushing. We now have a lot of their business outside the United States. We have a great
working relationship with them. We'll start shipping the products in Asia towards the latter part of this fiscal year. And
so I think we just continue to push ahead and prove to them that we can be the kind of partner that they can be proud of
and that they can depend on. And once we then crack that, then I can be a lot more specific. But it clearly would have a
benefit to the company's Foodservice business.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: And for those that didn't see that in the release, you
might want to expand on the new business.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we picked up – it depends on
the business, but we picked up Ketchup in a number of markets, and then we picked up Ketchup and toppings in a
number of other markets in Asia. We are adding capacity, which I think we mentioned at the Analyst Day meeting,
although I don't recall. We're adding capacity in both Indonesia and in China to address the incremental volume needs
that we anticipate. We'll ramp up and start shipping this product again towards the latter part of this fiscal year, and so
we should have virtually a full year's benefit in fiscal '12 from most of this. There'll be a couple of markets where we

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Good morning. I know you don't like to give quarterly guidance, but you kind of did and...
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's what I said, I don't like to
give but I did.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: But operating profit's flat quarter-to-quarter, and then the tax rate is going to be higher too. So
I think consensus numbers are a little high for second quarter, can you give us a sense of just fundamentally though is
there anything that you think will be different in the October quarter versus the July quarter? Is it, will sales be a little
bit weaker because of the comparisons to the Ketchup promotion in the July quarter. Or do you, is there anything in the
next three months that you're doing in the market to -- that's anything different from the July quarter just in terms of
what you're doing with consumers?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, I don't think Ketchup has any
impact on what I said. I think the impact comes from a couple of things. We're going to get a significant hit in
Indonesia from the rising cost of chilies and sugar. We were having very difficult time even procuring chilies enough to
support our Chili Sauce products in Indonesia. So we've now resolved that problem. It's going to be towards the latter
part of the quarter, the beginning of next quarter that we're sort of out of the woods on the chili and sugar issue in
Indonesia. And the chili issue was a big issue for us as they had a significant crop failure.
The second thing is you're going to see a significant ramp up in SG&A in the second quarter to fund some of the
Keystone initiatives as we're very encouraged, I hope not prematurely so, but very encouraged by the success we had in
the ramp up in the Benelux, and we're going to continue to accelerate those efforts including looking heavily in the
United States and other European markets as we push that ahead. That'll be a significant investment in Q2 in SG&A.
And then I think the third thing is we will continue to ramp up the launch of Infant/Nutrition in China. You'll see some
incremental spending behind the Infant/Nutrition, March, in that quarter. And then obviously the Ramadan timing –
with Ramadan coming back into the first quarter and out of the second quarter will have somewhat of an impact on our
volume.
And then we've got some FX issues in the second quarter. And then obviously, you mentioned the tax rate, but
generally, what I would like to say is the fundamentals of our business are sound and frankly in this economy, very
sound. But I just want everybody to be careful and let us not get terribly euphoric about the continuation of our great
performance and believe me first quarter was a darn good quarter on top of the five great -- four great quarters we had
last year. But I just think we're trying to be cautious as we approach the rest of this year. And so there is a lot of sort of
small items that add up to bigger items in Q2. Ed, you have anything you want to add?
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: Yeah, I just think that again it's
just that the timing we're still very confident in the full year outlook, 3 to 4% top line growth, 7 to 10% OI and EPS
growth.

<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Right. And I think Art had added at Analyst Day the
incremental spend on our Keystone project is about 35 million this year. So that launched at the end of July, and you'll
see that ramp for the rest of the year.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You'll see pretty significant
spending in Q2 behind Keystone. Remember, we just ramped up in the Benelux on August 23. So the bulk of that
expenditure is going to hit us in Q2, and I feel good about margins, I feel good generally about the fundamentals of the
company, but we're going to have some shifts in spending.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: The shift of the quarters this year will look a little
different.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think Ed's point is the right
point. We are still very highly confident in the year so.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Hey Meg, can you quantify for us the upfront spending this year versus last year,
maybe you've done it before but how much more on the upfront are we doing this year and then Keystone I guess is
part of that?
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: If you're referring to Keystone
that will be up about 30, $40 million this year.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. But there's also upfront spending that's called out in your release today? Isn't that
Keystone?
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: That's prior year.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: That's referring to the upfront
spending that we did last year in Q1 if you recall. We spent about $16 million or so on some downsizing activities in
Europe and the U.S.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And we still have some of those
coming in the second half, and actually last three quarters of this year behind some initiatives we're looking at in
Europe. And so there will be some incremental spend in the last three quarters. I don't want to quantify yet because
frankly we have not taken the board through it. We gave them a preview of it the other day. But we'll have some
one-off spend in the last three quarters of the year for something that I think we're very enthused about in Europe. We'll
get back to you on that, probably during the November call, certainly no later than CAGNY.

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks. A couple of things. First I guess, Bill, I wanted to try and take advantage of having you
on the call also from a broader industry question, maybe to start it off. I don't want to dwell too much on the calendar
second quarter for the industry, but it just seemed like a lot of things changed in that second quarter for the industry and
not a lot of it was for the better. And there's been a lot of theories on kind of what happened and why things got so
promotional, was it manufacturer led, was it retailer led, and I'm trying to get a sense from at least your own
perspective, what happened? And do you think the second quarter marks a peak from an industry sort of

competitiveness promotional perspective or not? And if so, why? And I guess what does this means for also your own
CBP program going forward in North America?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. A couple of things for us that
I think are kind of interesting. We no longer break out D&A spending for a lot of reasons. But I can tell you that our
D&A spending, our deals and allowance spending, in the first quarter was actually slightly favorable to the third and
fourth quarters last year for Heinz. So that may surprise some of you, but our trade spending was no higher, in fact
slightly favorable to the last two quarters of last year. However, we are seeing an industry and, as all of you I hope
know, I'm very direct on this and I don't make many friends. But we're seeing an industry that is fundamentally lacking
in my view in discipline when it comes to trade spending and they're not seeing the pickups in terms of volume and
share that they have historically associated with the kind of incremental spending that we're seeing in some of the
categories.
Again, I come back to Frozen Entrees. There's absolutely no sense in chasing consumers out the door, and that's exactly
what's happening in the bulk of our Smart Ones business benefited in the first quarter from a partial promotion, but
partially from the innovations particularly in the breakfast area where we're doing very, very well.
The second thing that I think is changing, Eric (sic) [Andrew], and I think the industry is wrestling with are
commodities. Commodities which looked to be very favorable 4, 5, 6 months ago are now changing, particularly
packaging commodities. Glass, resin have shifted direction. Now oil prices have been bobbing all over like a fish on a
line, and I don't know where that's going to end up. But I think the commodity cost plus the impact on the increased
grain costs recently is something that I think the industry's wrestling with.
Third, the inability or the unwillingness, and I'm frankly not sure which it is, of the industry to take appropriate actions
to improve margins through a combination of factors whether it be mix, whether it be cost, whether it be price, with just
a fundamental shift in terms of the mix is something that I think a lot of the industry is really wrestling with.
Fourth, the retailers are trying to figure out ways to drive volume. And we're seeing this not only in the United States,
but in Western Europe and to a bigger degree frankly in Australia, where the customers are struggling to try to drive
their top lines in the context of an industry that's seeing some of its volumes still shift to the dollar stores, to
non-traditional outlets, to a very aggressive retailer out of Bentonville, who's trying to regain its mojo. And so I think as
you look at all this, you've got that working against you. And then finally, I used a term in there that we sort of
contrived the other day of economic hibernation. The consumers are going into stores, now we keep reading about their
shopping payday. That may be true to a degree, but I think that's being over-hyped. What we're seeing instead and I
talked about this at CAGNY almost 18 months, we're seeing consumers walk in with coupons and shopping lists and
they are not deviating.
Historically, consumers would walk into a grocery store, roll down the aisles, and they would pick up things just on an
ad hoc basis that maybe they weren't necessarily on their list. We're not seeing consumers deviate from those shopping
lists now, and we've done a fair amount of work on that. Nor are we seeing them move away from coupons and things
that they can use to create a discount. That's true at all income levels. And so I think you've got those fundamental
factors occurring.
Food service trends are still not great. While sales may be up in some accounts because of pricing or other things, the
fundamental traffic trends are still not very good that we're seeing. So between a combination of commodities, the
economy and the impact on consumer confidence, promotion intensity, food service trends and then obviously the lack
of direction on FX for the multinational companies, I think you have businesses that are trying to figure out how do we
deal in an economy like this. And this is were for Heinz being positioned as well as we are in the emerging markets,
which are showing really the only sustainable growth in all the countries we operate in and where consumers are
getting increasingly confident and where we're seeing the migration to the middle class. I mean it positions us well for
the longer term and, as I told our board, and as I've said to you, all of you, we're going to continue to push aggressively
in terms of incremental investment in the future into those emerging markets because otherwise you're simply chasing
consumers deeper into their cave of hibernation. Now, eventually they may or may not come out of it depending on
what happens in the U.S. and Western European economies.

But just in the last four or five months, the external environment has changed precipitously. And I think for a company
like Heinz, we have to be extraordinarily cautious and at the same time carefully analytical about where we're getting
returns on our spending and whether or not chasing consumers out the door or trying to outcompete the next guy is
really the thing that's going to be in the best interest of our company, our employees and our shareholders as well as our
customers and consumers. So we're doing a lot of analytical work, but I think the surprise to the industry is that the
historically steady, almost dependable, if I give you more promotion dollars, I get better volume, is going away. And I
think that's shaking a lot of companies.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: Following up on that comment,
about a month ago, we had the trade finance groups together from the 7 or 8 largest business units we have around the
world. I think over the last few years, we've spoken a lot about the progress we've made on trade spending and
controlling that, understanding the returns we're getting. And what we did was we saw the changing environment last
year, and I think we, as Bill said, kind of steadied it out this year, tried to get those teams together to make sure that
we're sharing the best practices at the levels where these guys are giving feedback to their sales teams. So we got all
those folks together in Toronto about a month ago, making sure that everybody understood the best practices in
analytics, what are they doing? How are they measuring IRI Nielsen impacts in terms of lifts and that sort of stuff.
We're also involving that with the Global Sales Council led by Chris Warmoth to make sure that the finance teams, the
sales team and the marketing teams are working together to make sure that, as their environment changes on these
returns, we're adapting quickly and making sure we're getting the best return on the investment we can.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: That's key. I think we're seeing a variance by category
in terms of responsiveness and so we're able to identify where it's not as responsive and take that money and put it
where it is so.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, we're moving money around
pretty aggressively. And again I think you see us going forward. You're going to see considerable shifts long-term in
resource allocation to the markets that are going to give us quick returns versus those that aren't. That may not be the
greatest thing to ever happen to the United States or Western Europe, but it is a good thing to happen to our
shareholders and to the long-term health of this organization.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I appreciate that perspective. And to close a loop on that, my sense is then from your remarks
that it's probably a little early from an industry perspective to kind of say, hey, it was the peak and maybe it just gets a
little less bad from here. We'll have to see how things play out, but my sense is with merchandising programs being sort
of set, whatever it is, two quarters in advance, we've got kind of brace for still a bit of a rough road on the competitive
front for a period of time I would assume.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's sort of my sense, Eric (sic)
[Andrew], and the other thing is the only thing that's going to get them out of this is real innovation and news and
market shifts in terms of where resources are allocated, and as you know, those don't happen overnight. And I think
frankly a lot of companies have been caught flat-footed by what's gone on because these are tried and true remedies
that we've used historically to cure whatever ails us. And they're simply not as effective now as they have historically
been. And I think in that context, I think the real play for us long term is continuing to find ways to develop and grow
in these emerging markets.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Yeah. Last thing, and I appreciate it. It came up in I think the meeting in May was a lot of
obviously food companies are starting to think about ways of giving cash back to shareholders. There's been some ramp
up in share repurchase activity for a bunch of names. I think we're expecting some more in the not too distant future.
Your cash flow, as you mentioned, really is outstanding and again what's the balance there, or the hold back around
that, is it just M&A opportunity that you're seeing around those investments and resource allocation in emerging
markets or just trying to get a perspective there?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It's a good question, Eric (sic)
[Andrew], and one we've been kicking around quite a bit both internally and with the board. Or, Andrew, I'm sorry, and

I think in that context, two things to keep in mind. One, we're seeing more M&A opportunities in emerging markets
now than we've seen maybe in the last five years. And we're trying to figure out the best ways to deploy our capital, not
just to produce a short-term benefit but long-term health of the organization. And with emerging market sales
representing almost 18% of the business in the first quarter, and I still think for the year we'll be somewhere between
16, 17%, somewhere in that range. Our goal is to figure out ways to continue to drive that while building the
infrastructure and the reach necessary in some of the void markets where we aren't and in some of the markets now
where we think we can leverage it, much like Foodstar in China, which we're waiting on the government to approve.
And so my preference beyond dividends is to still continue to look for those M&A opportunities that exist in the
emerging markets. I can tell you factually, we are not spending much time looking for M&A opportunities in the
United States or Western Europe. Our focus is almost entirely on the emerging world.
Secondly, we are looking at ways to mitigate the dilution that we've suffered somewhat on the shares outstanding. And
so I think we'll be more definitive as we get through the next quarter and get back to you in November. But we're trying
to figure out the best way to balance both those against the opportunities for a share buyback.
And the final thing I would say, Eric (sic) [Andrew]. And this is, the market knows this with me, I'm not a huge
proponent of buybacks because you always buy at the wrong time and at the wrong price. And I don't know what's
going to happen to the market or to the economy, so I would much prefer to see us put our money into assets and to
businesses that make a difference over a 3 to 5 year period then do something that makes the difference over a 2 to 3
quarter period. And so that's really where our focus is. And as I said, we have significant opportunities that we're
looking at.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Good morning.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: Good morning.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Just two questions if I could. The first and I guess this maybe follows up on some of the
comments that you just made in response to Andrew's question. Bill in the, at the Analyst Day, I think that you were
talking about the economic environment and the consumer as having improved or that the environment was improving.
So if you could just talk about how you're adjusting or if you're adjusting your plans for the balance of the year given
now you're kind of seeing that the environment isn't improving and may actually be deteriorating. So does it mean that
you dial back on your plans for innovation, do you shift spending in one region to another? Just, at all, how you adjust
your plans relative to that? And then, the second question for Ed just in terms of the cash flow question. Given that
refinancing rates are as good they are now, is there an opportunity for you to refinance some of your notes in order to
drive the interest rate down even further?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll let Ed answer that in a second.
On your first question, we're changing the channel. I think you have to look at taking money and deploying it where
you know you're going to get a return like we have seen in the emerging markets, where we get a very responsive
reaction to consumer spending. And we'll balance the trade spend against consumer spend, against other ways to
continue to drive the business. And so our focus right now is continuing to improve innovation, continuing to drive
growth in the emerging markets, disproportionate growth, continuing to funnel money behind Ketchup on a global
basis to improve trial and penetration and that's having a huge impact on us in Europe and in some of the other markets.
Continuing to look for customer opportunities much like the McDonald's move in the Asian markets.

And then I think being cautious with spending in some of the developed markets where you want to avoid pouring good
money after bad and where you want to be cautious about, as I've have said, and I have been using this term for almost
18 months now chasing consumers out the door. Because that -- no matter what you do from our promotional
standpoint, you're not going to change their mind set unless you get to the point where it becomes silly, which is I think
has happened in some cases. But I think overall for us it's a balancing act of putting resources behind those businesses
in those areas where we know we're going to get a return, behind those innovations that we think have a high likelihood
of success or if successful would be a huge return to the company, like Infant/Nutrition, and watching very carefully
our spend by business in each of the developed markets in which we operate.
And so, I think for us, Bryan, it's just a balancing but in some markets we're changing the channel. I mean we're
looking at an entirely different way to try to entice consumers back into the business or excite them again about the
brands and the business. And try to figure out ways to tap into the increased usage at home and so forth. We're
spending a lot of time reviewing marketing plans and initiatives and activities including a lot of activity in social media
for the last nine months of this year. So I think it's fair to say that this -- I've never believed in changing the game plan
at half time, but I do think you'll see some different plays called in the second half of the year that should impact our
business, and I'll let Ed answer the debt question.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: Yeah, on debt, the Treasury
team's looking at that very actively. We have no long-term debt coming due this year. But we do in the years to come.
We're aware that the rates do look pretty attractive, but as we've discussed in the past, a lot of our long-term debt we've
swapped fixed to floating and those rates are significantly below anything we could lock on in the mid-term. So we're
making sure we've got access to liquidity, the markets look very good. But even the rates today necessarily wouldn't
make a refinancing attractive from an average interest rate perspective. But we will be out there, we're not going to wait
till the last minute to move forward.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport. Please proceed.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Good morning.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Ann.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Most of my questions were asked. But I just wanted to understand emerging markets as a
percentage of sales, should we assume that you're going to hit that target sooner than expected either through
acquisitions or through the strong performance we've seen?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Are you talking about the 20%?
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: Right.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think there's a chance. How's that
for an answer.
<Q - Ann Gurkin>: That's great. And then second, can we get an update on the adoption of Dip & Squeeze from your
customers?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. The equipment is still not in
facilities yet. It goes in this fall, and we should begin shipping by the end of the year. The customer reaction has been
very positive. We've actually got a lot of retail testing going on and that reaction has been quite positive. And I think
the biggest issue for us is going to be basically stopping the fighting going on at the President's Council meetings
between the presidents, all of whom want this for their own market. We've had some very interesting discussions with
the business unit leaders, who want to know why that the U.S. should get it first. The U.S. keeps reminding them that it

was their idea and they keep reminding me you've said origination of ideas doesn't matter. It's he who's got the best
opportunity. So I think our biggest issue is an internal issue on the feuding that is occurring over, let me have it in my
market. I think -- I'm still very optimistic about Dip & Squeeze. It's being launched into a very difficult food service
market. So we'll see how it plays out, but we start shipping at the end of the year. And I'm very optimistic.

Our next question comes from the line of Bria Orie Gupta of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q>: Good morning. Given your commentary around the increased focus on emerging markets and greater M&A
opportunities, are you still looking to continue with a buy and build strategy? Or would you look to entertaining the
idea of doing something larger scale?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Define larger scale.
<Q>: Not bolt-on.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: That's very helpful. We are looking
at businesses of all sizes in the emerging markets. Our preference is still the buy and build approach, which has worked
so well for us. But the beauty for us is, if you look at our regions where we have emerging markets, whether it be Asia,
whether it be Eastern Europe and Russia, whether it be Latin America, whether it be Africa, we now have management
teams in places that are perfectly capable of handling incremental businesses of almost any size and producing growth,
much as we've done by taking out our Egyptian partner now and that business is doing extremely well for us in the
Middle East.
So I think it's going to depend on the opportunity. I think it's going to depend obviously on the cost return. I think it's
going to depend on the capabilities of the management team and the strength of the business. But my preference is buy
and build, but I want to be very clear that does not preclude us from doing something of a larger scale.
<Q>: Now how willing would you be to flex your current ratings in order to do something one time nature that's just?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We like -- we like where we are
now and right now certainly based on what we're seeing and what we're talking about, that should not be an issue for
us. Again if something and I've said there forever if something dramatically material came up that fundamentally
changed the company and made us a far better company, that's obviously something we discuss with the board. I have
also said historically I'm not going to bet the farm on something or bet the ranch on something I don't fully understand.
So we are committed to the rating we have now, we like the rating, we have room within the rating to do the kinds of
things we're talking about doing. But again, as I've said in the past, if something significant came up that really was
fundamentally transformative and made us that much better, we'd obviously always take a look in concert with the
board and with an understanding of the rating agencies that we are committed to where we are now.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: I think if you take a look at the
cash flow we've driven over the last couple of years and the discipline we've had on capital management, the flexibility
we have for these types of acquisitions is much greater than what we'd been looking at just a couple of years ago.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And Ed raises a point that I would
like to comment on as a further answer to Andrew's question earlier. The other thing I think the industry's going to have
to do is manage its capital better. I mean there's a lot of capital still going into an industry with a consumer that's
scratching his or her head trying to figure out what they want to do. And I think capital discipline and management is a

Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer of UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - David Palmer>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, David.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Palmer>: Hi, Meg. Hi, Bill and Ed. A question on Europe. You said increased competition in Europe amid
category softness in your prepared remarks. Could you maybe give a little bit of color there? Where is the category
softness increasing, of course that means the consumer? And I'm wondering if you think that as you read between the
lines in the categories is the consumer environment worsening or just kind of remaining at the same soft level in key
markets, perhaps driving some desperate discounting by competitors. So any color would be useful, thanks.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. The category that's most
weak that we are seeing globally weak is soup. I mean, we are seeing soup weakness everywhere, Europe, Australia,
United States in Foodservice, I mean, soup is just weak. And I don't know if we're seeing a move to homemade soup.
We're still trying to assess it. Our shares are doing reasonably well, but the categories are soft. So that's really where we
saw softness in Europe in the quarter in both the UK and the German soup businesses.
There are some competitive issues, but that fundamentally is not my concern right now. My concern is the category on
a global basis. Condiments and Sauces seem to be doing relatively well in Europe, our beans business has been fairly
solid, the launch of Fridge Pack will be okay. So basically in Europe what we saw was soup. Now the other area of
weakness we saw was the infant feeding category in Italy. Category has been very soft for the last 18 months or so as a
function of, I think, the Italian economy and the Italian consumer really trying to figure out what they're going to do.
Our shares have been holding okay and our Italian business from a profit standpoint is fine. But I think that
Infant/Nutrition in Italy and as a category and soup generally everywhere, I cannot think -- for us anyway, of a soup
category that is doing particularly well anywhere around the globe.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: Yeah. I think despite the
softness in the soup category that we mentioned, UK volume was actually up for the quarter.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yes.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: So the balance of the portfolio
there is doing reasonably well.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Yeah. The UK business is clearly outperforming our
peers.
<Q - David Palmer>: The only separate thing I wanted to mention is in the U.S., is it at all troubling to you or even
telling to you and this kind of goes on the heels of your previous comments that more and more packaged food

categories and companies are complaining about the consumer confidence and just cyclical factors in general,
meanwhile in the U.S., you're seeing concurrent strength maybe even improving strength in fast food and on-the-go
channels, like C-stores, that just matter of months ago, we would have thought would be more cyclical than these
at-home food categories. It's tough for me to reconcile for my perspective. But perhaps a bit of the blame goes back to
the energies that have been applied to those categories. But any thoughts would be helpful there?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think there is a clear trend,
David. Obviously, as I said earlier, our Ketchup business in Foodservice from an organic sales standpoint was positive
in the first quarter. So we're seeing some of the same things you're seeing on Quick-serve. But to me the thing is, and
I've been around a long time, you fish where the fish are. And I think people are throwing the hooks deeper and putting
more bait on the hooks into markets where there are no fish, or the fish aren't biting. And so we're going where the fish
are biting, which are markets where the middle class is emerging and still aspirational inclined towards westernizing
some of their food purchases but more importantly westernizing their lifestyles in terms of better ways of living.
And so to me the industry itself over a period of time has to make the shift away from a dependence on things that have
historically been fairly easy for them to understand and shift to those areas where the real opportunities are, whether it
be aspects of the customers that are different, whether it be aspects of the globe that are different. Whatever it may be
and for some reason, and I've said this to you guys publicly before, and, as I've said, I don't make many friends in this
industry. But for some reason this industry is incredibly slow at adapting and adopting to the changing realities of the
world. And I think that's where our company frankly is well positioned because of the mindset of the management team
that we have that's focused on fishing where the fish are.
<Q - David Palmer>: Thank you.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Can we move quickly. I know there are several people
that somehow got stuck in queue, and we're way past time. But I want to give everybody a quick opportunity, but let's

Our next question comes from the line of Terry Bivens of JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Hi, good morning everyone.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Are you sunburned or you need an
umbrella?
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Bill, I'm going to be under a hurricane watch here right by the end of the day. So I'm, let's say,
I'm a furniture mover today trying to get everything inside. Just I know it's late, so I'll be quick with this. Most of our
data indicates that the lift from promotion is really decaying pretty rapidly for a lot of categories. Judging from your
remarks on Frozen is that the case with you guys in Frozen category, and if you could give us a wee bit of color on
what Nestlé is up to there post acquisition?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I don't want to comment on
anybody else, other than to say that I think people are slowly learning that we're chasing consumers out the door in
entrees and I said in my prepared remarks that until the consumer is more confident in the economy, we're going to see
this. Now interestingly enough in Australia, we're starting to see a turnaround in the category as the economy is doing a
little bit better and so the nutritional categories are starting to do a little bit better in the markets where we're seeing
some improved economic behavior. But I also said in early response to a question, Terry, that I think the industry is
simply not seeing the lifts they've historically enjoyed by aggressive promotion activity. And I think that consumers are
waiting for them or consumers are growing in disciplined against a shopping list. They may not include a product that
you're promoting aggressively or merchandising some way. And I don't think anything's going to change that except a
higher level of confidence.

I mean our discussions with consumers are fascinating. I mean consumers are absolutely unclear as to what to do about
anything. And I think from that perspective, I don't think anything is going to change short-term. Now having said that,
on Smart Ones, the other thing that you can look at is we've innovated aggressively in breakfast. Our breakfast business
was up pretty significantly in the quarter. And a lot of that's due to innovations and to hitting a convenience area with a
hot meal that I think people have really enjoyed, and our T.G.I.F sliders and our Smart Ones sliders, which I predicted
to you at CAGNY would do really well, are doing really well. So people are looking for comfort food, they're looking
for convenience, but they're not deviating from their lists.
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Right so it's not, interestingly on Smart Ones that I
know a number of you – there's just some interest in these through that Nielsen data. So a lot of our innovation has
been the sliders, the pizza, the wraps, et cetera, and those are showing up in Chill's frozen sandwiches, which many of
you have not been incorporating. So it's, yeah, Smart Ones is doing quite well.
<Q - Terry Bivens>: Okay. And just if I could ask just one point of clarity. Second quarter you said would mirror the
first quarter in terms -- was it operating income or earnings per share? I missed that.

but it's generally across the whole profit line, Terry.

Our last question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Investments. Please proceed.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Driscoll>: Good morning. And I appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to go back to Foodservice,
certainly a wonderful report on profits there. Bill, can you talk a little bit and maybe you said this in the discussion, but
I just need to hear it very clearly, what does the full year look like given the strength that you saw in Foodservice in
Ketchup, does that really drive significantly better than expected profits within that segment for the year?
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We're expecting a good year
profit-wise in Foodservice. And a part of that's productivity and part of it's mix. And obviously the more Ketchup we
sell in Foodservice on a relative basis to anything else in Foodservice, the better the mix, because the margins are
higher. So I think it's fair to say that we have expectations. I always like to underline that word when my lawyers are
around. But we have expectations for a good profit year in Foodservice. And our hope is, and I'm not even underlining
expectations here, our hope is that we start seeing a top line change in the second half of the fiscal year predicated on --
off weak quarters last year, predicated on some return of the consumer in the second half of the year, and predicated on
some of the activities we're undergoing and the fact most of our SKU rationalization will be behind us.
But I think we're not counting on it a whole lot because until there's some clarity on this economy and until we get
some sense on what the U.S. government is going to do from a policy standpoint to help get us out of this predicament,
then I think it's fair to say that the mix in productivity, SKU rationalization and our focus on customers where we really
make money in Foodservice is really going to be the key that's going to drive what we expect to be a pretty good year.
<A - Ed McMenamin, Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Controller>: I think that business for well
over year, we're seeing some pressure at the top line and certainly over some of that time pretty significant pressure at
the bottom line. They reacted significantly, and we talked a lot about SKU rationalization and all that sort of thing. A
year down the road, they're really able to drive the efficiencies from that, focus on longer runs, better pricing and really

drive even through the distribution system improvements that you're seeing hit the bottom line now.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think let me summarize, we are
running...
<A - Meg Nollen, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations>: Way over.
<A - William R. Johnson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: ... way over, but let me summarize.
Again, as I said yesterday to the shareholders, I think generally the fundamentals of the company are sound. We are
working very aggressively to make sure we do not do foolish things in an environment where being foolish is much
easier than not. We continue to redeploy resources against those opportunities that we think have better long-term
leverage and will create better long-term value. We, as Ed said, we've reaffirmed yesterday our outlook for the year of
3 to 4% top line on a constant currency basis and 7 to 10 EPS and OI.
And I will be very blunt that of those 3, I think the top line will be the one that will challenge us probably the most.
Today I don't see any reason to deviate from that. But it will be more difficult given the environment. Fortunately, our
Emerging Markets businesses are strong enough and our resource allocation processes are robust enough that we're
putting money where we get our best return. So just in general I want to thank our management team whose being
open-minded and sufficiently vigilant enough to see us put money where money's going to give the shareholders a great
return.
So with that, thank you all for your call. I would like to say that keep Art's family in your prayers. He could use them.
He is fine other than he's dealing with a very difficult issue right now. We've gotten word that should be okay and
everything should be fine. He should be back very shortly. We've missed him. I hope he's listening, actually I hope he
is not listening. We've missed him and we want him back as soon as we can get him back. So thank you all for the call.
