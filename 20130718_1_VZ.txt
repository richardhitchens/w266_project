MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host,
Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Michael T. Stefanski
Thanks, Brad. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike
Stefanski. And I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the Investor
Quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this
call will be available on our website later today.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains
statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and
uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which
are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of
these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.
Before Fran takes you through the details, I'd like to make you aware of a non-operational item included in the
quarterly results. For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a GAAP basis. These results
include $147 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share, for the favorable affect of an interim actuarial remeasurement

associated with one of our pension plans due to settlement accounting. The non-cash credits were due primarily to an
increase in the discount rate assumption used to determine our current pension liability. On an adjusted basis, EPS was
$0.73 compared with $0.64 a year ago. Our discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation
exclude the effect of the non-operational gain. In addition, the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are
on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.
Francis J. Shammo
Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our strategic investments in 4G LTE, FiOS, global IP and cloud services
continue to drive strong operating performance. We are executing well in these key growth areas. Overall, consistent
top-line growth, along with a strong focus on cost efficiency and profitability, resulted in double-digit growth in
operating income and earnings per share in the second quarter. In fact, we have posted double-digit earnings growth in
five of the last six quarters.
Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.73, up 14.1%. Year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share were $1.41, representing
14.6% growth. As you know, our strategic focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation
and growth. Underpinning our success is the consistent investment in these networks and platforms, which position us
to take advantage of growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving wireless and wireline markets for broadband, video
and cloud services.
Operationally, we are focused on increasing value by delivering products and services to customers in the most
efficient and effective way possible. In Wireless, our Share Everything Plans are a great example. We have simplified
decisions for customers, making it easy to add new devices and manage their share data usage.
Our FiOS Quantum offer, where customers can upgrade broadband speeds themselves, is another example of
improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency. Throughout the entire business, there are many
examples where Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted and we are realizing the efficiency gains in a
number of areas, including customer care, supply chain and systems support.
As we move through the year, we are confident that successful execution in our key strategic areas will continue to
drive incremental revenue and promote operating efficiency, resulting in sustainable growth in free cash flow and
earnings.
Let me shift now to our second quarter performance, hitting a few highlights. Our Wireless results were strong, once
again effectively balancing growth and profitability. We added 941,000 retail postpaid connections, up nearly 40%
sequentially. Service revenue grew more than 8%. EBITDA growth was up double-digits and our EBITDA service
margin was 49.8%, solidly within our annual margin guidance.
We also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth in FiOS. Revenues were up nearly 15% and we added
161,000 new subscribers in FiOS Internet and 140,000 in FiOS Video, roughly 20% more than we added in the second
quarter last year.
In global enterprise, strategic services revenue grew 4.8%. Our consistent operating performance, together with
disciplined capital spending, is driving higher free cash flow. Through the first half of the year, free cash flow increased
by more than 20%, resulting in an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.
Now, let's take a brief look at consolidated results starting with Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 4.3%, sustaining
our solid top-line growth performance. For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues, coupled with effective
cost management, resulted in 11.8% growth in adjusted operating income. On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA
increased to $10.5 billion and our EBITDA margin expanded by 90 basis points to 35.1%.
Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 5. We have emphasized that consistent
investment in Wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. Our

commitment to 4G LTE covers a wide range of activities, including the securing of necessary spectrum, the allocation
and deployment of capital for both coverage and capacity, our leadership in fostering a robust device and application
ecosystem, and the success of our Share Everything Plans in driving device adoption and stimulating usage. Once
again, our second quarter Wireless results demonstrate the effective execution of this strategy.
Total Wireless revenues grew to $20 billion, representing 67% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. We sustained strong
service revenue growth of 8.3%, making it the third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 8%. EBITDA increased
to $8.5 billion and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 80 basis points year-over-year to 49.8%, representing
another very strong quarter of growth and profitability.
Let's now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 6. Service revenue growth
continues to be driven by increasing connections, smartphone penetration gains and data usage. The simplicity and
value proposition of our Share Everything Plans is driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in
increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account.
During the second quarter, retail postpaid service revenue per account, or ARPA, grew 6.4% to $152.50 per month. We
have 35 million postpaid accounts and the average connection per account increased to 2.7, up 5.5%. Our Share
Everything Plans have been very successful. The plans have been available since June 28 of last year and customer
adoption has been very strong. In just one year, more than 36% of our postpaid accounts are on a Share Everything
Plan. The value proposition is simple and straightforward and customers increasingly recognize the value of shared
data across multiple devices.
Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 7. As I highlighted earlier, we added 941,000 new retail
postpaid connections, up from 677,000 in the first quarter and about 6% higher than a year ago. We also added 97,000
retail prepaid connections. So our retail net connections totaled just over 1 million in the quarter. As I stated on our last
earnings call, we expect to continue to see sequential quarterly net add improvement in 2013. Total retail connections
topped the 100 million mark in the quarter. Our industry-leading postpaid base stood at 94.3 million and we have more
than 5.8 million prepaid connections.
Our connections growth was driven by another strong quarter of gross additions. Postpaid gross adds of 3.6 million
were up 14.2% year-over-year. The number of customer upgrades also increased, both sequentially and year-over-year,
with a postpaid upgrade rate of 7% for the quarter. We continue to expect that our annual upgrade rate will be about the
same as last year. Our upgrades remain high quality, with 36% of customers purchasing a smartphone for the first time.
We also maintained a high quality mix within our postpaid net adds. We added 472,000 in the phone category. Of this
total, 974,000 were smartphones, with the balance representing the decline in basic phones. We added 371,000 Internet
devices, including tablets. The balance of just below 100,000 included Home Phone Connect, HomeFusion and other
connected devices.
Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn was 0.93%. The sequential improvement was
due primarily to an expected reduction in involuntary churn, as discussed coming out of the first quarter.
Next, let's turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations
totaled 10.1 million in the quarter, representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase. We had a high quality
device mix once again, with 88% of the activations being phones. Smartphone activations totaled 7.5 million and 72%
of them were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced. Roughly 51% of the activations were iPhones. Our
smartphone penetration continued to improve and we ended the quarter at over 64%.
We had another strong quarter for Internet devices. Activations of these devices, which include mobile hotspots,
Jetpacks and tablets, topped 1 million again this quarter. Adoption of 4G LTE smartphones and devices continue to
accelerate. One-third of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G LTE, compared to just 12% one year ago. 46% of
our smartphones and more than two-thirds of our Internet devices are 4G LTE. Currently, 59% of our total data traffic
is carried on the 4G LTE network, which is five times more efficient than the 3G network.

In terms of geographic coverage, we now cover 500 U.S. markets with 4G LTE and have essentially completed our
build out by matching our 3G footprint. Our LTE network covers more than 99% of our 3G footprint. And when you
include our Rural America partners, LTE is available to about 301 million people across the nation.
Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to invest, adding capacity to our existing 4G coverage, ensuring that
customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices. I will
cover our capital spending outlook in more detail during our discussion of cash flows.
Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting on slide nine. Our Wireline investments in platforms, such as FiOS,
global IP, security, cloud services and Machine to Machine, enable us to deliver the services and leading-edge
applications and solutions that customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will
help improve our cost structure in the long run.
Total Wireline revenues decreased 2% in the second quarter, as growth in FiOS and strategic services were offset by
softer Global Enterprise and wholesale revenue from legacy transport services and CPE. In terms of Wireline segment
margin, second quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion and the margin was 22.2%, up 80 basis points sequentially.
We continue to believe we can improve the Wireline segment margin in 2014.
Let's take a closer look at the revenue components starting on Slide 10. In the Consumer and Mass Markets business,
we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by sustained FiOS revenue growth. Consumer revenues grew 4.7%,
driven by FiOS, which now represents 71% of Consumer revenue. Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased
9.4% to more than $109 and we sustained a blended FiOS ARPU at over $150 per month. Two-thirds of our FiOS
customers are triple play, which have a higher amount of recurring revenue per month.
As I highlighted earlier, we had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 161,000 new
FiOS Internet additions and now have 5.8 million subscribers, representing penetration of 39%. Overall, net broadband
subscribers were a positive 45,000.
In FiOS Video, we added 140,000 new subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 5 million, which is over 34%
penetration. In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS
Quantum offers for higher broadband speeds. Sales of our FiOS Internet product, at speeds in excess of 50 megabits per
second, increased during the quarter and existing customers continue to buy up in the speed. At the end of the quarter,
one-third of FiOS Internet customers subscribed to Quantum, with speeds ranging from 50 to 300 megabits per second.
We continue to make steady progress with copper migrations, increasing the number of service upgrades each quarter.
During the second quarter, we converted more than 86,000 customers. Through the first half, our total was 169,000. So
we are more than halfway to our target of 300,000 for the year. This network evolution initiative is important for us as
we reduce our dependency on older technologies.
Aside from the maintenance expense savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, convergence to fiber also
provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional ARPU over time.
Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail
residential connections declined by 5.2% compared with a loss of 6.6% at this time last year. We expect that continued
strength of FiOS, the copper migration initiative and the benefits of labor contracts and work rule flexibility will have a
positive effect on Wireline profitability this year.
Let's move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 11. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $184
million, or 4.8%. CPE sales, which were down 34% year-over-year, represented $162 million of the decrease.
Excluding the decline in CPE, Global Enterprise revenue was down less than 1% on a year-over-year basis. Strategic
services, which now comprise 57% of enterprise revenue, grew 4.8%. In the second quarter, a continued decline in
legacy transport services more than offset the growth in strategic services.
We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space. Many of our customers are focused on
improving their cost structure, which can result in reduced services with us. In addition, many customers continue to be
cautious regarding new investment decisions.

Moving next to Global Wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $141 million, or 7.7%, due primarily to continued
declines in the transport services. Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a
more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services.
In terms of profitability, while growth in the enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume
declines in the rest of Global Enterprise and Wholesale continue to put pressure on Wireline margins. Through our
Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling
efforts, which we believe will improve our operating efficiency.
Let's turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation remained very strong. For the first
half of the year, cash flows from operations increased by 12%. Free cash flow was up by more than 21%. Capital
expenditures for the quarter totaled $4 billion and were $7.6 billion year-to-date, up 2.5%. Wireless capital spending in
the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion. Through the first half, Wireless CapEx totaled $4.3 billion, 8.6% higher than
last year.
As I noted earlier, we have essentially completed our initial LTE build out by matching our 3G footprint. Throughout
the rest of the year, we will continue to invest by adding capacity to our existing coverage as we begin to deploy AWS
spectrum throughout the network.
In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date, which was down 5.9%
from last year. Strong connections growth, driven by 4G LTE, and our Share Everything Plans has resulted in higher
demand forecasts and the need for increased capital investment. As such, we are increasing our full-year capital
spending outlook from flat at $16.2 billion to between $16.4 billion and $16.6 billion. We remain focused on improving
investment returns and capital efficiency and we continue to expect our CapEx to revenue ratio for the full year to
improve, even with the additional investments in 4G LTE.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was just under $50
billion and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2 times.
Let's summarize on Slide 13. Our second quarter results showed consistently good performance in the key strategic
growth areas. So at the halfway point, the key year-to-date financial and operating metrics were strong: consolidated
revenue growth of 4.2%; operating income up 15.6%; adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, representing 14.6% growth;
in Wireless, service revenue growth up a very strong 8.4%; average revenue per account up 6.7%; retail postpaid
additions of 1.6 million, up 16.5%; EBITDA growth of 14% and an EBITDA service margin of 50.1%. We are on track
to deliver on our 49% to 50% margin guidance for the full year.
In Wireline: consumer revenue growth of 4.5%, driven by FiOS growth of nearly 15%; 349,000 new subscribers in
FiOS Internet and 309,000 in FiOS Video. We are on track to meet our 600,000 plus FiOS customer growth target. Free
cash flow generation is up better than 20% year-over-year and our balance sheet remains very strong, all in all, a very
good first half. We are now focused on continuing the momentum, which should result in a strong second half of the
year.
With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.
Michael T. Stefanski
Fran, thank you. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I guess two around Wireless, first, you talked about
sequential improvements in adds in the third and fourth quarter. Given that Sprint's not going to be ceding a number of
iDEN subs into the market in what's traditionally not a strong third quarter, can you help us see why you're more
confident there? And second, can you talk about how you expect margins to track through the rest of the year? Given
the upgrade comment you just made about being flat year-over-year, that's a little higher than I would have thought,
given the commentary, or the change for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about those? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, Phil. Thank you. Good morning. So on the sequential third and fourth quarter, it's
similar to the trend that we saw last year. When coming out of the first and second quarter, I said we would sequentially
continue to see growth in the third and fourth quarter. And again, this is around what we expect the road map to be on
additional device launches throughout the third and the fourth quarter. But the momentum that we have, and you see
that momentum coming out of the second quarter and I'll talk more to that in a second when we get to the margins, we
continue to see this high quality subscriber coming on to the Wireless 4G LTE network and we don't see that changing
at this point.
From a Sprint and porting ratio, I won't get into specific individual carriers, but, again, pretty consistently positive with
all carriers from a porting ratio perspective. On the margin side of the house, I think we have to put this in perspective.
So again, we are fully engaged on the 49% to 50% guidance that I gave to you in the beginning of the year. And if you
look at the first half of the year at 50.1% for the first half and coming out of this quarter at 49.8%, and I think you have
to look at what's behind that. So if you look at on a year-over-year basis just between the quarters, we improved our
profitability by 80 basis points. In that, if you look at that, we moved 7.5 million smartphones. 1.6 million of that was
additional smartphones over last year.
And then if you just look at the 4G devices, we moved 3.1 million more 4G devices this year than we did a year ago.
And in that, if you look at the service revenue growth of 8.3%, that's up 100 basis points over where we were last year.
So you can see the quality of these adds. And if you take what we added in the quarter of nets with 472,000 net phone,
it's a pretty good indication of what we're going to drive from a margin perspective. And then if you look at the network
side of this with 4G LTE, we now have 33% of our customers on that network, 36% of our customers on shared.
We had a growth of 5.5% in the connected devices. And I've said that our growth is really dependent upon two things.
Number one, the 4G LTE network and, as people move over there, the usage of stimulation drives them into higher
tiers, from a tier perspective on the shared plan. And then, of course, the second piece is, as they get on the shared plan,
they start to connect all these additional devices. And you can see that with the continued momentum of our Internet
category and some other things that will be coming to market similar to what we did in the fourth quarter last year, as
for the camera. So combination of all of these, Phil, I am very confident that we will continue on the margin track that
we set out at the beginning of the year.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Great. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Brad, we can take the next question now.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great, thanks. Good morning. Fran, there's been, obviously, some buzz around Verizon
investing in Canada. Maybe you can help us, in terms of where you see the opportunity. Is this tied into a roaming
footprint? Is it tied to maybe serving your own enterprise customer base? Or is there sort of a consumer retail presence
you might have in mind tied to this? And then second question on FiOS, very good volumes in what's generally a
seasonally weak quarter. You talked about the 600,000 plus, but it seems like you have the opportunity to maybe be
meaningfully above that result. I'm just wondering, does this – what you've seen in 2Q give you the opportunity to

maybe set the bar higher for the year? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Jason. So on Canada, again, let me emphasize this is really an exploratory
exercise for us. As you all know, they've delayed their spectrum auction until January. So again, we continue to just
look at this market. I think it's everything that you said, Jason, that we're kind of looking at. If you look at the
population of Canada, about 70% of that population is between Toronto and Quebec. That's adjacent to the Verizon
Wireless properties.
Again, if you look at the spectrum auction, it mirrors up exactly what we launched here in the United States on the 700
megahertz contiguous footprint. So we're looking at all these, but, obviously, some of the cautions here are the
regulatory environment, a foreign investor coming into the Canadian market and what does that mean? So again,
cautiously looking at it, not ready to make any announcements today. And we continue to explore and have
discussions, but, at this point, it's just really just an exploratory exercise.
On the FiOS volumes, again, we've put a lot of effort around continuing the superiority of the FiOS product. Bobby and
his team have done a great job in around the FiOS Quantum offers and a lot of the stimulated growth that we see here is
coming from the Quantum offers that we have and upgrading those Quantum offers to the 50 and 75 Megabits per
second services.
So, look, we set a target for 600,000. Obviously, if we can exceed that target, we will. We're ahead of that target, but I
will tell you that the third quarter, again, is always a seasonally challenging quarter for us from a move perspective. So
let's continue on the track that we are and if we can over-deliver, we will, but we set the target at 600,000.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, we can take the next question now.
Operator
Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, thanks. Good morning, guys. First, quick question on Wireline and then Wireless, first
on Wireline, Fran, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a couple of issues driving Wireline profitability that you
see some improvement. Now, I just wanted to see if we can get a little clarification. Are you talking about the
year-over-year trends for the whole year or just the second half? If you could just sort of fill in those blanks for us,
that'd be great. And then secondly, on the Wireless CapEx increase, if you could just talk a little bit about what's
driving that? Is it more 4G devices or is it more usage per device or is it maybe the competitive environment, what
you're seeing from other carriers? What's really driving the change there? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure. Thanks, John. So in Wireline profitability, look, I mean, we set the bar that said our
margin would be flat year-over-year. Going into, obviously, in the third and fourth quarter of last year, compared to
what we think we can do this year and coming out of the second quarter, I think in the back half, I have to improve the
profitability in order to continue to make that guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year that said we would
be flat on a margin basis. So I think we're on course to do that. And mathematically, the profit has to get better in the
back half of the year in order to sustain that guidance.
As far as the CapEx on Wireless goes, there's a couple of things here that are driving us. So if you look at over the last
three quarters, the growth that we've had, the number of 4G devices we've moved and if you look at just the first half of
this year versus the first half of last year, we've added 6.2 million more 4G devices on the 4G network than we had a
year ago, from just an overall sale perspective. So when you look at that and you look at the usage, currently 59% of
the data traffic is now running on the 4G network and that's being driven by 33% of the base.
So again, from just a growth perspective on the top-line, we've always said, again, that as customers move into shared
and they realize the viability and speeds and the consistency of this 4G network, it's going to drive them to use higher
usage. And if you look at where video is going in the future, obviously that's going to continue the proliferation of the

usage on this network. And we look out two years ahead of where we think our curve is going to be. And given the past
success we've had and the usage patterns and the amount of 4G devices that we've already moved and the road map that
we see coming, we need to accelerate really the capacity that we previously thought and it's really all to drive what
customers want.
So the incremental investment will more than pay for itself on top-line growth from what I see and, again, this is really
a shift in our capital discipline between Wireline and Wireless. And we're going to maintain our lead on the most
reliable, consistent 4G LTE network. So that's what's driving the increase for the CapEx.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Great. Thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Brad, we're ready to take the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks very much. Good morning, Fran. Other Wireless service revenues were very strong,
up about 20% year-over-year. I imagine that you've got some MVNO and other – and maybe roaming and other stuff.
Perhaps you could just comment on the drivers of that and the sustainability of that. And then on the enterprise side,
you talked about continued cautious behavior and cost focus. Do you see any signs of a second half pick up? I think
there's some better news on unemployment and generally macro trends improving in the second half. Are you seeing
any of that or is it pretty much static from your point of view? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Simon. So on the other Wireless revenue, obviously, what's included in that other
Wireless revenue is our reseller base. I don't like to refer to them as MVNOs. That's a bad word for me. But on the
reseller base, it's really driven from the prepaid providers that we have on that side of the business. And again, coming
out of this quarter, we did a fairly substantial number of net adds there. And again, our prepaid strategy is between what
we sell on the retail side under our own brand. And we had a positive quarter again this quarter with 97,000 net adds.
But we also drive the, if you want, to the lower end market through resellers and mainly through the relationship with
Walmart through TracFone. So that drives a lot of volume and that has been good revenue growth for us.
The other things I would tell you, though, is that in addition to that, I mean, obviously, roaming is in there. Machine to
Machine, which we don't really talk about much, we're gaining a lot of momentum around Machine to Machine and
that is driving incremental revenue, albeit very low individual unit per subscriber type revenues, but, again, as we start
to gain momentum and sell hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these types of devices, that's going to contribute to
those revenues and contribute to the overall growth of Wireless. So that's the component of that.
On the enterprise side, look, I understand the unemployment is there, but it's not large enough and steady enough to
give me confidence that something is going to turn here in the near future. And again, if you look at the enterprise
space, mainly what everybody is focused on is cutting their costs. And obviously, when we talk about cutting costs in
enterprise, they come to us and figure out how they can reduce their spend with a Verizon and have us give them
solutions that help them reduce their spend and, of course, we're happy to do that, but it does cause some top-line
pressure.
And also I think that, again, the uncertainty of what's going on around the government sector in two-fold. Number one,
a lot of this pressure in enterprise this quarter, if you look at the decline of 4.8%, over 60% of that was in the
government sector for us this quarter. So there is a big impact from the sequestering activity and the pullback from both
state and local governments, and also within the Federal government. As I look forward, though, the uncertainty around
this tax situation and if you think about it, I mean, we're now mid through the year. It's highly unlikely that we'll get tax
reform this year.
So again, we're faced with another cliff at the end of this year if Congress does not extend the tax provisions that are
currently on the books for another year. So hopefully, they'll do that soon and put some of the uncertainty at rest, at

least until the next 18 months until we can get to all the difficult issues around tax reform, which, as you know, we
have a lot of subgroups working in Washington to help and give suggestions on how to get this done, but that's going to
take some time.
So again, it's hard for companies to say we're going to invest in new technologies and new things when we're not
certain what the future of the tax laws hold for the books and records. So I still don't think anything is going to change
drastically from where we are. And as I said before, at least from where I sit, the best we can hope for is a flat
performance. And if you take CPE out of the equation this quarter, we're at a 0.8% decline. So that's probably about
where we'll be. Zero to slightly decline or slightly positive is kind of where I'm at, at this point in time.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Okay, very helpful. Thanks.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Okay, Brad, we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks. Good morning. Fran, if you could just give us the update on the net debt calculation
for Verizon Wireless. And then with respect to the business, I think the metrics that you threw out there on the LTE
network implies about 1.8 more usage on the LTE network versus the 3G network. And I was wondering if you could
expand on that a little bit more and maybe give us a sense of what the usage trends are for your customers. And as they
move into the shared data plans, maybe give us a sense of that kind of stimulus that you're seeing on the consumption
front. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, thanks, Mike. So on the update of the net debt for Wireless, gross debt is at $10.1
billion and net debt is $9.7 billion. And, as you know, we did a distribution at the end of June of a total of $7 billion out
of the partnership to both of the owners. And also just to keep in focus here, we have about $1.5 billion of Wireless
debt coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another approximately $3.5 billion coming due in the first quarter
of next year, and we plan to pay that debt off at this point in time.
On the LTE network, Mike, it's – you're right on. And obviously, what's happening is, as people come from the 3G
network over to the 4G network, you can see that incremental usage, whether it's a smartphone or a Jetpack or a dongle
and as they start to share all this data. And the video consumption is increasing year-over-year and
quarter-over-quarter.
So again, as we – I mean, others in the industry have put out their projections of usage over the 4G data. If you look at
some of the things that people have printed and the escalation that the future holds from a data consumption standpoint,
as we start to move into more symmetry between in the home and out of the home content, we don't see that slowing.
So again, yes, we do see an incredible jump when someone moves from 3G to 4G in the usage that they have on their
smartphones and other devices. So that's what's driving the growth.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks very much.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, next question, please.

Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, guys, thanks. Fran, maybe just a comment on Wireless margin, I know you've got the
sort of 49% to 50% expectation for the full year. Last year, the fourth quarter had very high volumes that sort of really
dragged down margins a bit. Are you getting comfort that the new upgrade policy should have a muting impact on that?
And then just secondly, on FiOS competition, maybe just some comments regarding the triple play pricing environment

out there and also how well you're doing in the MDU market? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Mike. So on the Wireless margins, obviously, again, we're very confident around
the 49% to 50%. As far as the fourth quarter of last year, you have to keep in mind it was the first quarter that there was
a free iPhone on the Verizon Wireless network and we won't have that repeated this fourth quarter.
Now, that's not to say that we don't see increasing volume. And again, I continue to say that we'll see incremental net
adds through the third and into the fourth quarter. But from a margin perspective, if you look at just year-over-year and
the amount of volume we moved, we actually ate through all that volume and improved the profitability of this
business. And that goes into managing the entire business.
So from an upgrade policy standpoint, some other things that we'll be launching, I mean, you probably saw Verizon
Edge and some other options that we'll have on payment plans for our customers to acquire a smartphone. All of these
things considered, we are very, very positive on the margin progress and the profitability progress of Verizon Wireless
and the continued growth of Verizon Wireless.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hey, Fran, just on the Edge comment, is that something that you're hearing your customers
actually demanding, this sort of equipment financing option?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. So I mean, if you look back here in time, I mean, the – first, I mean, we were the
first carrier to launch LTE technology. We were the first ones to launch the shared pricing around LTE technology. We
launched in the fourth quarter of last year an installment pay plan on tablets. That was something that our customers
were asking for. We delivered that to them. And at that point in time, we started to look at and I said we were looking
at other options for smartphones.
We've done a lot of focus groups in the last six months. We've done a lot of market research. And we've come that says,
yes, our customers are asking for another option, two-fold. Number one, we have a lot of customers in the technology
Edge that want to be able to upgrade sooner than they would under our historical legacy subsidy model, if you will.
And we have other customers who, quite honestly, don't want to pay upfront for the large cost of the phone. They'd
rather pay over time.
So I'm not going to get into all the details of Verizon Edge, but – I'll let Wireless do that. But that's something that our
customers have been asking for and I think we have a differentiated plan to launch to the market and Verizon Wireless
will have more to say on that.
From a – going back to your other question on triple play and MDU, obviously, we continue to gain momentum here.
Look, this business has always been competitive around a triple play. But I think what's differentiating us right now is
the superiority of our product with fiber into the home. And as you get that fiber into the home, I think what customers
are realizing, and we see this with the copper to fiber migration, when they move and they see the speed that they can
get on their – just their Internet capacity, we're seeing customers upgrade.
And what I've said is we are seeing our legacy copper customers who we have migrated over to the FiOS network, they
are paying between $10 and $15 more in ARPU a month after about 60 days on our network, because they're upgrading
freely into that 30 and 50 megabits per second service. So that's really what's differentiating us in the market. We will
continue to advertise around that superiority and I think that momentum will carry us into the third and the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Fran, just a quick follow-up on the FiOS side, is there a point at which you guy are
going to migrate to all IP video network?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I mean, obviously, we've already started that with the copper to fiber migration, but
that's going to be quite some time in order to deactivate the copper switches and take all of that plant and equipment
out. We have the plans to do that, but that's not something that's going to be done within this year or next year.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great. Thanks a lot, Fran.

<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Jennifer Murtaugh Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Most of my questions have been
answered, but I did want to ask about prepaid, Fran. With AT&T doing the IO and now with Leap's purchase and
Cricket in the fold and T-Mobile and Sprint obviously having their own brands, is there any interest on your part in
launching an independent prepaid brand under Verizon separate from Verizon?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. Thanks, Jennifer. I think, look, I think from a prepaid perspective, we are very
happy with how we approach this market between our own prepaid product, which obviously you've heard me talk
about in the past, which is just strictly on our 3G network. We do not offer prepaid on the 4G LTE network.
And, as I said, we will become more aggressive over time in the prepaid market on that 3G network because, again, as
we look at the 3G versus the 4G and we move 3G customers into our 4G network, we want to make sure that we keep
that 3G network as full as possible. Because when you think from an investment return, we're not investing any more in
that network. And the fuller we can keep that network without detrimenting the service, the contribution margin of that
network is very, very high. So prepaid is really the pillar of how we will continue to utilize that 3G network.
So you'll see us become more aggressive around that when we need to be. You saw us change some pricing in the last
two quarters around prepaid and that has stimulated some growth for us. And then, as I said previously, our other path
is through our resellers for the lower end market.
I don't see the need, at this point, to do a secondary brand around the Verizon Wireless network. We have built our
brand around the quality, the reliability, a superior network. I don't think that a secondary brand helps our overall
brand, at that point. The other thing I'll say is I'm not going to comment on anything around the AT&T deal with Leap,
but I will put to bed the rumors out there that Verizon Wireless may be interested in that asset and, thee or me, we're
not interested in that asset.
<Q - Jennifer Murtaugh Fritzsche>: Okay, thanks, Fran.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: So thanks for taking the question. I'm not going to ask you about Leap, but that deal is
spectrum-driven and you guys have indicated that you're starting to deploy your AWS-1 spectrum. Maybe that's
happening a little sooner than we thought, although you're seeing network traffic ramp very quickly.
I'm just curious if you can maybe give us a status update on your spectrum portfolio. Do you still feel like you have
sufficient spectrums you get through the next auction? Do you still see an opportunity to buy spectrum in the market
right now from other carriers? And have you started to think about maybe some supplemental solutions, for example,
maybe revisiting Wi-Fi as another way to put capacity into your network?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So around spectrum, I mean, look, we did our AWS deal last year
and that put us in a very good spot for our 4G LTE strategy. We started to launch AWS last year. We started to
pre-position that. We are accelerating the positioning of the AWS, based on my comments before, around the usage
around Wireless. But, again, we are very comfortable with our spectrum holdings and we are good shape for three to
four years.

Obviously, we will participate in the auction with the FCC here targeted for 2014 around the broadcast licenses. That's
something we will participate in, but we are not under any spectrum pressure. If you look at our frequencies and the
way that we deployed our CDMA spectrum, we can actually take very small slivers out of that CDMA spectrum and
reallocate that to our 4G LTE spectrum on a needed basis.
And that's where we get into this balancing act between the 3G network and the 4G network, but we are very satisfied
with our holdings for the next three to four years. Obviously, we're always opportunistic in spectrum acquisition and
we do actually buy spectrum every quarter. You probably don't see it because we do little markets here and there. But,
look, we're always opportunistic, but, at this point, we're satisfied and there's nothing out there, at this point, other than
the auction, that we're concentrating on.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: And on Wi-Fi, anything new there maybe involving your cable partner?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, from a Wi-Fi perspective, I mean, obviously, we always like people to offload when
they're in their home in a secured Wi-Fi network. You've heard me talk before about Wi-Fi networks are not secure in
the public domain. They have a purpose for us in certain instances around major sporting events and so forth, but our
customers are very concerned about their privacy and security. That's why they ride the LTE network as much as they
do, but we do want offload in certain circumstances and so that does relieve some of the Spectrum.
We obviously, from just a utilization standpoint for people that are in their homes, it's not good if they're inefficient to
run off of the LTE network. They should shift over to their Wi-Fi network in their house. So we do encourage that. But,
again, not major, massive, public Wi-Fi is interesting for our customers, at least in this point of time from a security
standpoint.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Great. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple, if I could. Just following up a little
bit on that, Fran, I was wondering if you could kind of give us a status update on the activities and development that's
going on inside that joint innovation entity with the Comcast group and what progress, if any, is being made on some of
the digital content rights stuff? And then, I guess second, would be kind of along those lines, because you kind of
elaborated a little bit on your relationship with NFL and kind of some of the strategy behind that content relationship
and if that's the beginning of a series of potential new moves to acquire content.
And if I could, just one quick last one, I noticed the strategic services sales in enterprise were a little over 6% growth
year-over-year last quarter. They kind of slowed down into the 4% ZIP Code this quarter. I know overall enterprise has
been fairly soft, but strategic services has been kind of a core strength. So if you could kind of address that slowdown,
it would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, David. So around our joint venture with the cable companies, I mean, obviously,
our Converged Solutions team has been working and defining consumers as to what they want, both in the home and
outside the home. And obviously, what we're learning is the 4G LTE network plays a very critical role in that. We
continue to work with them. We have expanded into 968 Verizon Wireless stores across the U.S. and we have about
2,500 indirect locations. The marketing material and we continue to showcase these types of products.
But I will say that as we continue to work through this, it's hard for Verizon Wireless to sell a cable product outside of
the FiOS footprint because it's new and it's hard for the cable companies to sell a Wireless product outside the footprint
because of distribution channels. So as we continue to work through this, we're gaining some momentum here. But I
think the one last point from all of this is, we're obviously very focused on the content rights. And you come into the
NFL agreement, and the NFL agreement we think is just a new way of how content rights can be delivered into the

Wireless segment. And obviously, our strategy is around both type of multi-casting a sport – a live sporting event, and
you saw our comments that the 2014 Super Bowl will be a multi-cast type event to our Wireless customers.
So that's really the breakdown of the wall between what can be delivered in the home and out of home. And obviously,
we now have the rights to take some of the NFL live games out of the home and deliver them on the mobile devices. So
from a content standpoint, this has to develop, obviously, over time. The other point here is around content, is we are
starting to see where we're getting inquiries from content providers that they may want to pay for their content rather
than having the consumer pay. Those models are still being worked, but we'll see where that goes. But I look at that as
the old 1-800 number, where the actual vendor pays for the usage and not the customer. So we'll see how that strategy
develops over the course of time.
As far as our strategic services go, we continue to have good momentum in our strat services, as we refine exactly what
we're doing. We have very good momentum in the Terremark and the Hughes platforms and around our cloud services.
The slowdown, quite honestly, has been around our PIP exercise and that's more of – it's not – it is growing, but it's
more a price compression within the industry. So we are facing some of that going forward and we knew we were
going to face some price compression around PIP and we have to accelerate on the other strategic services to outpace
that. So other than that, we have good momentum on strat services.
<Q - David W. Barden>: And, Fran, just to clarify, PIP is?

<Q - David W. Barden>: There you go. Thank you very much.

Operator
Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Tom O. Seitz>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just give us an update on your expectations for
VoLTE?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Sure, Tom. Thanks. So we're still on course for VoLTE. We will start testing and have our
first handset in the market at the end of this year. And then we will probably commercial launch sometime next year.
But, again, as I've said in the past, the critical piece for us is that we have to make sure that our 4G LTE coverage
footprint, from a VoLTE standpoint, equates to our 3G footprint, because the VoLTE call is not backwards compatible
with the CDMA network.
So when you establish a call on VoLTE within our network, if you move outside of the LTE network, you will have a
hard drop on that call. And obviously, that's not something that our customers would expect from a premium provider
like Verizon Wireless.
So we're taking our time here. We will thoroughly test this. But we are on track to commercially launch in – sometime
in the first half of next year. And then taking that out, as I've said, at the end of next year, we are on track to have our
first only LTE handset to be able to provide to the marketplace as well. So we're still on track with our VoLTE strategy,
but it is a critical one for us to make sure that we get right when we launch.
<Q - Tom O. Seitz>: So the implication, though, then is that the 4G network is going to be essentially everywhere that
the 3G network is by sometime in first half of next year?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, the 4G network is everywhere, as I said in my opening remarks. 99% of the coverage
of our 4G network is equivalent to our 3G network. But now we have to go back and fill in that capacity to make sure
that, from a voice call perspective, it will hand off, because voice is different than the data piece. So we just have to

make sure that a customer who's on 3G today, when they go to VoLTE, they would see no difference in their service
from 3G to 4G.
<Q - Tom O. Seitz>: Okay, great. And if I could, could I just follow up on Dave's question? There were – yes, there
were press reports that ESPN was considering subsidizing mobile video consumption and you sort of alluded to that as
well. When – how soon do you think we'll see a material third-party payer model? I mean, is it this year? Is it next? Is it
a couple of years out? I mean, just – can you just sort of frame the timeframe of what you're thinking about?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Yeah. I think the big barrier right now is, is how does the content provider get the value of
how many people watch their content on a mobile device to be able to go back to their advertisers in order to monetize
that content? And right now, that's where the barrier is and we're working on that. But until that gets solved, I think this
model will be slow to come at this point in time.
Now slow to come, I'm thinking maybe next year. But it's certainly not any time in this year that that model will break
through and – because they have to recognize the benefit back to their advertisers to be able to monetize that content
into our network. But it is something that's being discussed. They realize that the linear model will not work as it does
in TV. In the wireless market, you can't assume that someone is going to pay $8 a sub on 100 million subs. So that
model does not work. So we are looking at other models, but the barrier is, is how do you measure everything to get
back to the advertisers for the perceived value on that content?
<Q - Tom O. Seitz>: Thanks very much for the color.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thank you.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, if we can take another question, please.

Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much and good morning, folks. Just on the capital expenditure front, on
the back of this capital expenditure rise for the year, I wanted to ask how we should think about the capital intensity of
the business going forward. It does seem as though your competitors are healthily ramping their efforts to try and
improve service quality. Do you feel as though you'll need to continue to put your foot on the gas in order to maintain
the quality of your network here, Fran?
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, I mean, let's put this in perspective. I mean, we've moved our consensus by $200
million to $400 million, so this is not a huge step-up in our capital expend. We just wanted to make sure everybody
realized that we were going to accelerate some of the 4G LTE. But as we've said in the past and as you look at our
results through the first half of this year, we continue to really be disciplined around the capital investment across our
businesses, but also within the Wireline segment.
So you see that come down year-over-year. We expect that trend to continue. So that will offset some of the pressure
that we may see on the Wireless side. So I don't anticipate that there's going to be any major accelerations, but, again,
it's too soon to tell where we're going to come out in 2013. I'll talk more about that in the coming quarters. But right
now, the focus is on this year and it's between $200 million and $400 million increment.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you. And then, if I may, you know, we've clearly seen a pickup in terms of your
shared data plans. I think you mentioned that it's more than 36% of your subscribers are on these plans. I was thinking
from a strategic perspective, as we've seen increased promotional activities by some of your competitors to try and
wean subscribers onto their networks, do you feel as though this is a potential mode in terms of protecting your
subscriber base from some of these more aggressive pricing plans that are available on the market? Should we expect to
see more promotional activity to try and ratchet this sort of percent of subscribers on shared data plans up in the coming
quarters?

<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Well, look, I mean, this industry has always been an extremely competitive industry and,
obviously, some of the promotions around unlimited, unlimited have been there for the last year when we launched
share pricing and continue to take market share. We continue to grow our revenue very strongly.
So, look, I mean, we will – Verizon Wireless will do one thing very well. They will compete very well in the market,
but we are a balanced company. We will compete, grow revenue, grow profitability and grow our subscribers. And at
the end of the day, customers make choice, not really just based on price, but the quality of the network and that's what
we've built our brand on, so quality of the network, consistency of the network, the reliability of the network, the value
that we provide to our customers through these shared plans.
And, again, will we do promos [ph] here and here (60:32)? Of course, as I said before, we'll launch the Verizon Edge,
which will give our customers another, yet another, choice of how they want to enter on to the best network there. So I
think the key here is give our customers choice and continue with what we built our company on, which is the strongest
network.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much for the incremental color.
<A - Michael T. Stefanski>: Brad, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Our last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks. Just two questions on Wireless, Fran, you talked about the fact that your LTE
network is enabling you to attract the higher quality customers, which has clearly been the case for a long time with
your network, but do you have any evidence of that on maybe credit scores? Are you finding with what you've done on
LTE and the shared data plans that you are, you think, attracting higher credit quality scores, maybe losing lower credit
quality score customers? And then secondly, on the shared data plans, can you maybe talk about what you're seeing in
terms of customers needing to increase their data buckets? Are many customers bumping up against headroom or do
you expect to see an acceleration of that in the next year, or is it more like two to three years out? Thanks.
<A - Francis J. Shammo>: Thanks, Tim. On the high quality, I mean, obviously, we give a lot of our customers choice
of various price plans and how to enter into our superior network here. And, of course, credit scores have always been a
component of that and I won't really get into how we differentiate the credit scores, but, obviously, you can see that
from the growth that we have and the revenue growth that we have, this is not a major issue for us. And we watch this
very closely, but we're gaining customers across all aspects of the business. Let's just put it that way.
Shared data plan, as far as acceleration of data usage, again, what we see and if you've experienced this yourselves, we
continually communicate with our customers throughout the month as to when they get to their usage and then when
they get up into that 90%, we give them the ability to upgrade through their phone to the next tier.
And we see some very good results from that. Customers are upgrading when they need to. So again, based on our
trajectory of data usage, especially with where we see video going, we continue to see that the uptake in the shared plan
will continue. The usage will continue to accelerate and our revenue growth will be reflective of that.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thank you.
Michael T. Stefanski
Okay. That's all the time we have for questions. But before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Fran for
some closing comments.

All right, thanks, Mike. I just want to leave just a couple of few points of emphasis here. So our strategic investments
and operational execution drove strong financial performance in the first half of this year. While we are pleased with
the overall performance, we obviously know we have more work to do. We are committed to driving shareholder value
by continuing to execute our strategy and improve on the fundamentals of the business.
We are focused on delivering superior customer service and providing the best portfolio of products, along with the
most reliable and consistent performing network. Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key
strategic areas, while we also transform our service delivery and cost structure.
As always, we will continue to be very disciplined around our capital investments, investing in those platforms for the
innovation and the growth of the future. Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive incremental
cash flow and earnings growth, both in the second half of this year and into the future. Thank you again for joining us
and, everybody, have a great day.
