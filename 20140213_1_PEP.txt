morning's earnings release and to the Investor section of PepsiCo's website under the Events & Presentations tab.
And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Indra Nooyi.
Indra K. Nooyi
Thanks you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us this morning. As we close
out 2013 and look ahead to 2014 and beyond, we have a few key themes we'd like to share with you. Through a
multi-year process, we've largely transformed PepsiCo for sustained performance. We are executing on our plan to
deliver on our stated goals. Now, this execution has enabled us to deliver and, in many cases, exceed all of our financial
goals in 2013. Our portfolio is complementary. Our geographic and product portfolio positions us well for sustainable
growth. We believe that our portfolio, as currently constructed, positions us to maximize value creation. As a result, we
are not making significant structural changes, including to North American Beverages. We are extending our $1 billion
in annual productivity savings target through 2019.
Our 2014 guidance is in line with our long-term financial targets. And the actions that we are taking to execute our
strategy provide us further confidence in the long-term durability of these targets. Consistent with our commitment to
disciplined capital allocation, we are increasing our cash returns to shareholders by 35% in 2014, significantly stepping
up both our dividends and share repurchases to a total of $8.7 billion, while maintaining appropriate capital investment
in the business.
Finally, and most importantly, our recently completed all health survey tells us that our associates are motivated,
engaged and positive about being part of, and the future of, PepsiCo.
So let me walk you through each of these themes. As you know, over the past few years, we've had to address a number
of macro trends that have reshaped and will continue to shape our industry. We made the required investments and
changes to preemptively transform ourselves to capitalize on the opportunities these shifts presented and to position the
company for long-term growth and value creation.
First, we expanded our presence in faster growing developing and emerging markets in response to a shift in the
sources of global growth. Second, we've continued to balance our portfolio of offerings to include more nutrition and
healthy offerings, while increasing the permissibility of our social snacks and beverages by reducing calories and
sodium in key products to address consumers' growing concern with health and wellness.
Third, we stepped up investment in R&D, digital capabilities and food quality and safety in acknowledgment that social
media is an ever-increasing powerful force, with greater availability of more sophisticated tools and product
formulations and food safety and security are now greatly enhanced by more tools providing ingredient traceability.
Fourth, we invested to enhance the equity of our 22 $1 billion brands, which, together, account for more than 70% of
our total revenue. We also upgraded our revenue management skills to give us the ability to take pricing. Fifth, we built
a culture of productivity into the company to deal with the reality of our volatile and inflationary commodity
environment. Sixth, we designed sustainability into our operations in response to growing environmental
consciousness. And lastly, on the talent front, we upgraded our skills through selective hiring in several new and
emerging areas. And we've completely revamped our talent management processes and training curriculum, with a
view to equipping our people with skills needed to perform better in a volatile environment.
Through these transformative actions, we have fundamentally changed the profile of the company. Our product profile
has grown from Fun-for-You to a more balanced offering of Good-for-You, Better-for-You and Fun-for-You products.
Geographically, we've shifted PepsiCo to a company with a more balanced global footprint. And our culture has shifted
from a decentralized one with businesses operating completely independently to what we refer to as connected
autonomy, a model that combines the best of an entrepreneurial ownership culture with the benefits of global scale and
coordination.

As a result, PepsiCo today is positioned to deliver, over the long-term, top-tier financial performance and value creation
for our shareholders. Our 2013 results demonstrate our portfolio strength and our execution capabilities. Despite a
challenging macro environment, we delivered a strong and well balanced operating performance in 2013. Organic
revenue grew mid-single-digits, both gross and operating margins expanded, cash flow is very strong, and we managed
our portfolio of businesses effectively.
Let me comment briefly on each of our businesses, beginning with North American Beverages. You know, we're
encouraged with the progress we made in North American Beverages, where the category remains challenged. We've
manage the business responsibly, achieving 2.5 points of price realization at retail, while stabilizing our share
performance in measured channels and generating profit growth. We were especially pleased with the successful
innovation at North American Beverages with four products, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Gatorade Frost – Glacier
Cherry, Starbucks Iced Coffee, and Lipton Pure Leaf, on track to achieve $100 million in annual retail sales. This
success was realized through strict execution against initiatives and the stepped up investment levels we made in 2012.
So we feel good about North American Beverages.
Frito-Lay North America delivered consistent solid performance throughout 2013. Organic revenue growth of 4% in
the quarter and for the full-year was well balanced between volume and price. Our innovation was also very strong at
Frito-Lay, including Tostitos Cantina, Lay's Do Us A Flavor, Cheetos Mix-Ups and in new flavors of Doritos Jacked
and Tostitos Artisan. And the business delivered solid operating leverage and margin expansion, with core constant
currency operating profit growth of 7% for the quarter and 6% for the full year.
We have good momentum, and we're seeing returns from all of the investments we've made to strengthen our insight
capabilities, brands and go-to-market systems. So, again, we feel very good about the outlook for this business.
Our other developed markets also showed solid performance during 2013, with organic revenue growth in our overall
Western Europe business. While macro economic data shows signs of improvement, developed world economies
outside the United States remain sluggish. We have relatively limited exposure to slower growth areas, such as
Southern Europe and Japan, so the shape of our portfolio shields us from these challenges, to a degree.
Turning now to our developing and emerging markets, these continue to perform well, despite some volatility in key
regions. As a group, our D&E markets posted 10% organic revenue growth for the year, with double-digit growth in
China in both Snacks and Beverages; double-digit growth in Pakistan; high-single-digit growth in Saudi Arabia, Brazil,
Mexico, and Turkey, just to name a few.
These markets have a long runway for growth, driven by increasing demand for our convenient, on-trend, affordable
products supported by rapidly growing middle class. The investments that we've made in these markets place us in an
advantaged position. The shape and resilience of our portfolio, combined with strong execution across the value chain,
enabled us to meet and, in a many instances, exceed our 2013 financial goals. Organic revenue grew 4%, in line with
our mid-single-digit target.
Core operating margin expanded 40 basis points, in line with our goal of 30 to 50 basis point expansion. We delivered
over $900 million of productivity savings, slightly ahead of our target. Core constant currency EPS grew 9%, ahead of
our 2013 guidance and at the high end of our long-term high-single-digit goal. Free cash flow, excluding certain items,
was $8.2 billion, well ahead of our 2013 goal, driven by exceptional working capital management and disciplined
capital spending. Core net return on invested capital improved 110 basis points, 60 points ahead of our target. And cash
returned to shareholders was $6.4 billion, right in line with our target.
So we feel very good about the financial performance of the business. Just as importantly, we've continued to invest in
the business to ensure the sustainability of our performance well into the future. A&M as a percentage of sales was up
70 basis points compared to 2011, and we continued to invest in innovation. Our R&D spending has increased over
25% since 2011. We improved our capabilities in food quality and safety, invested in multiple process technologies,
both to reduce cost and deliver new capabilities, and we invested in product innovation. In 2013, we had one of our
most successful years ever in new product launches, with six new products in the United States, on track to achieve
$100 million in annual retail sales, and this is a first for PepsiCo. So we feel good about our 2013.

Turning now to our portfolio, it is evenly distributed across Snacks and Beverages, both of which are attractive global
categories. And within these categories sits a highly attractive portfolio of nutritious products, including brands like
Quaker in grain, Tropicana and Naked in fruits and vegetables, and Gatorade in sports nutrition. Our geographic
footprint is very well balanced, with 35% of our net revenue in high-growth developing and emerging markets and
about two-thirds in stable, highly profitable developed markets.
Our portfolio is also truly 'Better Together', or what we refer to as the Power of One. Our entire portfolio is focused on
taste and convenience. Our products are purchased together and consumed together. Our presence in Beverages
supports our Snacks growth. And the heft of our portfolio positions us as the largest food and beverage business in
many of our key markets, and this makes us a key partner to retailers and foodservice customers.
And we realized $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings by operating our business as one. Our priorities for
managing this portfolio are very clear. In developed markets Snacks, where we have an incredibly strong business that
combines high market shares and high margins, we intend to defend and grow our share of Salty Snacks. We want to
grow organically into the broader macro snack space and this will leverage our core Salty Snack foundation's
capabilities to capture a broader range of day parts and occasions. And we want to leverage our Beverage business to
increase our snack presence in the large, profitable, foodservice business.
In developed market Beverages, it's a huge category, where we have good competitive positions in many markets.
Here, we intend to sensibly defend our LRB share and improve margins and returns, with an intense focus on unlocking
productivity, especially in North America. And we are focused on achieving product disruption and differentiation
through science-based R&D, especially in the area of sweetener innovation.
In our developing and emerging markets, where we have strong Salty Snack shares in most markets and leadership of
priority system beverage positions in many key markets, we intend to continue to build our share positions, capture our
fair share of growing beverage occasions and selectively pursue tuck-in acquisitions to build out our scale and our
geographic footprint.
And in the nutrition arena, where we are one of the leading players globally in everyday nutrition, we intend to benefit
from the high growth of this category, leveraging the presence and scale of our existing businesses. Now, these
category country combinations will be a demographic tailwind and related product diversity give us the line of sight to
our mid-single-digit organic revenue growth goal. From a category perspective, we expect our Global Beverage
business to grow revenue in the low to mid-single-digits and Global Snacks and Nutrition to grow revenue in the
mid-single-digits.
From a market perspective, we expect developed markets to grow revenue low to mid-single-digits and our developing
and emerging markets to grow revenue high single to low-double-digits. Based on this growth profile and because we
have full operating businesses in Snacks, we expect about two-thirds of our revenue growth will come from Snacks
and, from a geographic perspective, about two-thirds of our revenue growth to come from developing and emerging
markets.
As a result, over time, our business mix will gradually shift to be more heavily weighted toward Snacks and more
heavily weighted towards developing and emerging markets than we are today. This revenue growth profile is the
foundation of PepsiCo's reliable long-term growth model.
So how does this all translate to future results? From a geographic perspective, each market type plays an important
role in our portfolio. Emerging markets have primarily top-line growth drivers, with some potential for margin
improvement in the short-term. Developing markets drive balanced top-line growth and margin and ROIC
improvement. And developed markets contribute relatively less to top-line growth, but have very attractive margins and
returns and are prodigious cash flow generators and this is true of both Snacks and Beverages.
So holistically, this portfolio provides a platform for balanced growth, margin and return improvement, for sustainable
future growth opportunities, cementing the durability of our long-term core constant currency EPS algorithm and
superior cash returns to shareholders, all of which leads to top-tier total shareholder return.

And, as many of you know, we did commit to re-examine our North American Beverage business' role in our portfolio,
especially given some of the recent challenges in the category. So let me start off by saying that our highly integrated
food and beverage portfolio positions us as a vital supplier to our retail trade customers, where we are the single largest
supplier, in many instances. Decoupling our Beverage and Snack businesses in North America would significantly
reduce our relevance to our customers. Within most of our largest grocery channel customers, we would fall from being
the top supplier to a top four or below supplier. And in the mass merchant drug channels, we would drop below the top
10.
In addition, we would forfeit a number of synergies within North America, including shared procurement, Consumer
and Customer Insights organizations, joint advertising and use of major properties, like the NFL and Major League
Baseball, and joint promotion and display activity and coordinated national account activity.
So with all of this as a background, we undertook our evaluation of the overall category and our competitive position
within it. Let me provide you with some facts. First, Liquid Refreshment Beverages in North America continued to be
the largest food and beverage category by a wide margin. It drives tremendous traffic and cash flow for retailers. It also
plays a very important role in Food Away From Home, where foodservice customers are increasingly using beverage
offerings to drive excitement and profitability.
And PepsiCo is competitively well positioned within the LRB category. We are the LRB leader in measured channels.
We are the clear share leader in non-carbs, with leading positions in many segments. Our CSD portfolio has a 0.8X
relative market share, with Mountain Dew the fastest growing CSD trademark. We are making slow and steady
progress growing our share in Food Away From Home. We believe the opportunities are many.
There's no question that the growth of the LRB category in North America has slowed. And within this overall
industry, the Cola segment is particularly challenged, as consumers look for alternative beverage offerings. PepsiCo's
exposure to Colas is less than 25% of our total North American Beverage portfolio and less than 15% of our total North
American Business. You know, we believe that the Cola category is still relevant to consumers, but is going through a
secular change as consumers look to address the twin issues of calories and artificial sweeteners.
We have several great tasting cola product variations using zero calorie natural sweeteners rather than sugar that we're
testing in various markets in the world. And so far, these test results are promising. However, our U.S. launches of
these sweeteners will begin this year, primarily with non-cola products, to build and test consumer acceptance before
we launch lower-calorie naturally sweetened cola products.
Additionally, we are encouraged by the progress we made in 2013 in our North American Beverage performance. Our
objective was to hold or grow LRB value share relative to our primary competitor. And, as you can see, our LRB value
share performance for the full-year of 2013 was even with primary competition, based on IRI all measured channel
data.
What's noteworthy is that we also achieved very strong net price realization at retail across virtually every major
subcategory, while holding our value share position. Net-net, we feel cautiously optimistic about our prospects in the
North American LRB market.
So when we evaluated structural alternatives for our North American Beverage business, we established very clear
principles to guide our decision. First, we would not return to the conflicted Franchisee-Franchisor model of the past.
We needed a structure that ensures rapid decision making with low coordination costs and friction. We needed to limit
value chain decoupling and operating redundancies. We did not want to competitively disadvantage our North
American Beverage business and we wanted to maintain control over core strategic activities of our Global Beverage
business, such as Marketing, Innovation and R&D. We knew we had to maintain or advance our alignment of national
accounts and it didn't make sense to sacrifice meaningful scale advantages of the PepsiCo System. So our assessment
was driven by a highly objective consideration of what structure would create the greatest, most sustainable,
shareholder value.
And we studied numerous structures, from a full separation of North American Beverages from PepsiCo to a separation
of some elements of the traditional bottling operations and everything else in between. We used the best bankers and

consultants to think about structural alternatives, all with an eye to creating long-term shareholder value. And after an
exhaustive analysis and review with our Board of Directors, we concluded that North American Beverages creates
value and is optimized within PepsiCo's structure today.
Any structural separation would, among other things, result in loss of significant synergies, both between Snacks and
Beverages in North America, and between North American Beverages and the balance of our international beverage
operations.
It would significantly decrease our relevance to U.S. retailers and jeopardize our ability to grow in foodservice. It
would make our remaining international beverage business less competitive. And finally, it would forfeit the potential
value creation of investments we've made in sweetener technologies, the full benefits realization of our A&M
investment and year-end productivity savings.
So we've concluded that ownership by PepsiCo of the North American Beverage business in its current form
maximizes shareholder value, because our current ownership structure allows for optimally aligned objections and
execution, allows us to capture potential upsides from innovation and productivity, enables us to continue to benefit
from scale advantages. And finally, it continues to provide access to the U.S. cash flow that is so important to our
shareholder cash return model. So that's North American Beverages.
Let me now turn to productivity. You know, back in 2012, we announced a major three year $3 billion program,
enabled, in part: by our SAP investments, which began in 2002; and our new operating model, which we put in place in
2011, that allowed us to lift and shift best practices across the company to improve both the efficiency and
effectiveness of our enterprise.
Last year, we also told you that we had begun work on the next tranche of productivity, mostly enabled by our
operating model, which is gaining traction in the company, and the availability of new technology and tools. So today,
we are pleased to announce this next productivity program, $5 billion of over five years, beginning in 2015, and also to
tell you that we are on track to achieve the $3 billion three year program we announced in 2012.
So as we enter our next phase of productivity, let me provide some color to the areas we are focused on. The first is
embedding more automation in our operations to replace labor with capital. An example here would be further
automating packaging in our snack plants, where secondary packaging of our products remains a highly manual
process.
The second area is expanding shared services, including global financial shared services for the handling of routine
back office transaction processing. The third area is restructuring manufacturing to optimize our global manufacturing
footprint. Examples here would be evolving from local to regional manufacturing networks and adopting more
third-party manufacturing.
And the fourth area is restructuring our go-to-market systems to optimize our distribution network. Let me give you a
couple of examples under the go-to-market systems. The first is our Global Enterprise System, or GES, at Frito-Lay
North America. You know, GES is significantly reducing the amount of manual handling of our products up and down
the supply chain. Because we have such a high transaction rate, every touch of a case or a bag drives a lot of labor cost.
GES minimizes product touches between the plant and customer location through streamlined distribution center
networks, in some cases delivering direct from the plant to the store. The benefit extends to capital, labor, inventory,
and fleet fuel reductions.
This model continues to roll out across Frito-Lay North America and is now being applied to the North American
Beverage business, where we are maximizing asset utilization by reducing distribution centers, leveraging automation,
deploying fleet and route trucks more efficiently and reducing inventory while improving service and product
freshness. We're encouraged by the progress being made and have a long runway of savings opportunities ahead of us.
Another initiative is the implementation across PepsiCo of the Global Transportation Management System, a leading
example of global IT systems driving productivity at PepsiCo. GTMS enables the data analytics and processes to
effectively manage our consolidated transportation network. We can model different asset choices, consider inbound

freight to optimize traffic lanes and maximize every load. And we can do this regardless of whether it is a common
carrier or a company-owned fleet. And leveraging this North America System's foundation, we have now developed a
global template and our GTMS is live in Mexico, Brazil and Russia, is now being expanded to Egypt Saudi, Australia
and other parts of South America. So these are some of the examples of initiatives that enable the five-year $5 billion
productivity program.
A portion of these savings we generated from labor cost efficiency. As you can understand, such initiatives have people
implications globally at all levels. In addition to providing transition support, PepsiCo's establishing a fund for eligible
front-line employees to provide job training to assist them in their pursuit of employment opportunities outside the
company. Over the next 60 days, we will finalize the details of how this fund will be administered. The cost of this
fund is captured within the economics of our productivity program.
So let me sum up before I hand off to Hugh for the 2014 guidance. First, execution of our strategy enables us to meet
and exceed our 2013 financial goals. Second, we are confident that our continued execution will enable us to do so
again in 2014. Our geographic and product portfolio positions us well for future growth and, at the same time, provides
an attractive shareholder cash return model. We're announcing a new five-year $5 billion productivity program through
2019, strengthening the durability and duration of our expected financial performance. And finally, we are substantially
increasing our cash returns, up 35% versus 2013, consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.
So let me now turn it to Hugh Johnston. Hugh?
Hugh F. Johnston
Thank you, Indra, and good morning, everyone. Let me spend a few minutes discussing our outlook for 2014, which is
in line with our long-term objectives. We expect another year of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. We expect
operating margin expansion, as top-line growth and productivity should offset negative geographic mix and cost
inflation. Below the division operating profit line, we expect corporate cost efficiency and approximately 25% core tax
rate and a reduced share count. All-in, we expect core constant currency EPS growth of 7%. Foreign exchange is
expected to impact revenue and core earnings per share by approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, based on current
market consensus rates.
Taking our 2013 core EPS of $4.37, and applying our guidance implies a 2014 core EPS of approximately $4.50. Our
outlook appropriately factors in both tailwinds and headwinds. To the positive, we expect to generate over $1 billion of
productivity savings in 2014, which will offset operating cost inflation. We feel very good about our innovation
agenda, which should enable us to sustain our organic revenue growth rate.
Our share count will benefit from stepped up share repurchases, although we won't recognize the full benefit of the
2014 repurchases within 2014, as they'll be made throughout the year, with some of the share count reduction falling
into 2015. Our tax rate will be lower and is estimated to come in for the full year at approximately 25%, which we
expect to be able to sustain for the foreseeable future. And we will realize a modest benefit from pension expense, due
to a higher discount rate.
In terms of headwinds, the food and beverage taxes enacted in Mexico will impact both top-line growth and
profitability. The rate of our commodity cost inflation will be higher in 2014 than in 2013. Foreign exchange translation
and, to a lesser extent, transaction will be a significant drag on our U.S. dollar results. And we expect continued
challenges in demand for colas.
Finally, as you model out the quarters for 2014, please note the following. For the first quarter of 2014, we expect
foreign exchange translation to have an approximately 4% impact on net revenue and 6% impact on core earnings per
share, based on current market consensus rates.
In addition, we expect structural changes, primarily the re-franchising of Beverage operations in Vietnam, to impact
first quarter revenue by approximately half a percentage point. The second quarter of 2013 included a $137 million
gain from the re-franchising of our Vietnam operations, the majority of which was invested back into the business

during Q2 through Q4. The phasing of this gain versus reinvestment will impact core EPS growth during Q2 through
Q4. Finally, our stepped up share repurchase activity will occur throughout the year, but should have a more
pronounced impact in the back half of 2014 and into 2015.
Our long-term goals remain intact: mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; core operating margins expanding 30 to
50 basis points per year; high-single-digit core constant currency EPS growth; free cash flow, excluding certain items,
growing roughly in line with earnings; and core net ROIC improving 50 basis points per year. We intend to responsibly
manage the business for top-line growth, drive productivity and reinvest appropriately to position PepsiCo for
sustainable growth for the long-term. And we plan to remain highly disciplined toward our capital allocation, with the
vast majority of free cash flow, after capital spending, being returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and
buybacks.
So based on our assessment of the strong and sustainable cash flow generation capacity of the portfolio, driven by our
expectation of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, robust productivity programs, and efficient capital investment,
we're pleased to announce today that we'll substantially increase our cash returns to shareholders in 2014. This decision
is consistent with our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our strong bias to returning cash to our
investors.
First, we're increasing our dividend per share by 15%, beginning with our 2014 June payment, to $2.62 on an
annualized basis. This represents the 42nd consecutive year of annual dividend increase and approximately 60% payout
ratio, based on 2013 core EPS. At today's stock price, it represents a 3.2% yield and will bring our 10 year annualized
dividend per share compound annual growth to 11%. And we're further increasing expected shareholder cash returns
with a targeted $5 billion share repurchase target. This represents a 67% increase over our 2013 repurchase and is
approximately 4% of our market capitalization. While doing so, we expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access,
enabling us to retain low cost, highly accessible financing.
Taken together, these actions reflect a 35% increase in total shareholder cash returns compared to 2013 and will bring
our cumulative 10 year cash returns to shareholders to over $60 billion. As many of you know, we have stated
disciplined capital allocation as a top priority for our management and our board and we trust these actions will be seen
by our shareholders as tangible evidence of this commitment.
With that, we'll take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: So, Indra, on the NA Beverage side, it sounds like the decision to not pursue structural
options is more of a permanent one, as opposed to a decision just for now given the current environment that could
change down the road. Is that the right way to think about the decision? And then also, can you give us more insight on
how you expect to turn around trends in NA Beverages going forward in its current state, given you're not making
structural changes and we're still seeing weakness here in the market share trends in profitability?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: So let's start off with the performance in 2013, Dara, because it's very important to put NAB in
context. If you look at measured channel performance, because that's where we are now disadvantaged, because in past,
clearly, in foodservice, we were disadvantaged. In real [ph] LC, (36:29) which is measured channels, we actually held
share value versus our primary competitor in 2013. So we feel very good about that. This is a focus on value share. We
got price realization. We played the game very responsibly, which is what you do in categories that are going through

the volatility that LRB was going through and, importantly, in many sub-segments of the LRB business, we gained
share. And even within CSDs, products like Mountain Dew did exceedingly well. So I'd say that the core metrics on
LRB performance are trending upwards.
On foodservice, which, as you know, good size of the market, these are long-term contracts and you've got to enter
those markets very, very carefully. And where we did bid on foodservice accounts, we did win them. And so we feel
good about the fact that our integrated portfolio of Snacks and Beverages is now giving us some wins. And I think this
has tremendous run rate for growth and we feel good about that, too, so park that core performance aside.
Let me now talk about our decision. We studied North American Beverages and Beverages in total in our portfolio
exhaustively. We spent a whole year looking at this and there isn't a stone that we didn't turn over. And I tell you, at the
end of the day, we concluded that long-term value is maximized with NAB staying in PepsiCo's portfolio. And I think
it's very, very important we return to focusing on running the business, minimize the disruption, but, more importantly,
I think it would help hugely if we could just let our North American Beverage business employees focus on running
their business, as opposed to worrying about what their future is going to be.
I think the study we've done was exhaustive. There isn't a banker or consultant that we didn't use that had an idea. And
at the end of the day, we have to go off and run the business. It's a great business, big, profitable. It generates a lot of
cash. Yeah, there are segments of that business, large segments of the business, going through a secular change. We
have to reinvent it with technology. We're going to start launching products this year with the CVS sugar combinations
in non-cola products, while we test the cola products with these combinations in some markets of the world.
So I think we have to allow this transformation to play out, because it's too big a business and too profitable a business
not to allow the transformation to play out. So the long answer to your question is, yes, the decision has been made.
We're going to go back to operating it.

Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Just to follow-up to Dara's question, if, I guess, would be interesting to know as you went
through the analysis on North American Beverages, the markets changed a lot, right? The channels are changing and
blurring, potential to sell product over the Internet. Coke is going to experiment with more single-serve product or
potential for single-serve product at home. So that, plus the potential to use technology to change the production and
manufacturing, make it more efficient, how do you fit your franchise bottlers into that changing market? Is the next
step here, or an important step, to really improve NAB to make some changes with the way you interact with the
franchisees, to get the franchisees to sort of come along as you kind of bring them into a kind of a different world, or a
more modern world? So does the franchisee become an impediment or, in some way, how are you going to change the
way you interact with them?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Bryan, actually, it's a great question and, in a way, you explained why it's critically important
that you own the system, because the amount of disruptive change coming, you've got to reduce the friction in the
system, so that you can actually go with the flow. Having said that, on the online shipping things through various
fulfillment companies, we are looking at all of that and, in fact, doing tests with all of them. In terms of single-serve
products at home, we are participating with multiple single-serve home delivery product tests. And I think it's very
important that we ultimately commit and play with people where we know the technology is working. I think it's too
premature to commit without having a technology that actually works.
And finally, you know, our franchise bottlers are also seeing all the changes. We have a good relationship with
franchise bottlers are also seeing all the changes. We have a good relationship with our franchise bottlers. I think Al

Carey has done a terrific job building the relationships with the franchise bottlers. And they're seeing the changing
environment, too, and they want to work with us to make sure that, together, we grow the overall franchise. So I think
this is not about conflict. This is about how we work together to solve a market disruption. And that's what we're going
through right now. The good news is that 75% of the system we own. So, we have far fewer bottlers to deal with and
they're all smaller bottlers. We don't have the overhang of a big independent bottler to deal with anymore.

Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes. Hugh, can you talk a little bit about your earnings target, in terms of, instead of giving a
range, you gave sort of a 7% number here? So can you talk about this? Is the sort of 7%, plus or minus? And then, to
sort of keep on the North American Beverage bandwagon here, a little more micro, can you talk a little bit about how
you guys are perceiving the pricing environment, less so in terms of what we're seeing in the market right now, but
more so what you guys are building in heading into the summer selling season? Thanks.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: On the North American Beverage pricing, we've said very clearly that we intend to play a very
responsible game. We got a couple points of price realization last year. And our goal is to make sure that we take the
price increases if we have to, because in categories that are going through the kind of change that the Cola category in
CSDs is going through, particularly, John, it's very important that we don't take down pricing, because a lot of the
research is showing that just taking down pricing is not going to drive consumption. So it's very important that we
execute responsible pricing and that's what we're doing. A couple points of pricing going forward is really what we're
looking for in North America Beverages. And with that, let me turn to Hugh to talk about the earnings target.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Sure, happy to, Indra. Good morning, John. Obviously, John, we give long-term guidance of
high-single-digits in order to be as transparent as we can in terms of what we think the portfolio is capable of
generating. Then, as we get to the beginning of the year, we really try to give you a four quarter target, as best as we
can estimate in this volatile uncertain world, of what we think is a likely delivery. This year, as we looked at that, we
pinned 7% as the likely number. And I know it sounds specific, but I think our investors appreciate the specificity in
terms of what we do. As we go through the year, we'll update on that as the year progresses and as the world evolves,
but when we say 7%, yeah, we're saying 7%.

Our next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. Two things, one.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hi. So, two things, the first just, if you could, Hugh, quantify the Mexico tax effect, because we
look for 2014, better taxes, better buybacks, better cost-cutting. You can kind of model commodity to currencies, but
the Mexico quantification, we have a little trouble with. But the second question is a broader one. So you guys today
talked about, for example, yesterday, both with guidance that was really tough on top-line, but very significant
cost-cutting to get to kind of mid-single-digit type ex-FX growth rates. Do you think that this kind of running very fast
on cost-cutting, more return to shareholders, is going to become essentially the new norm in this industry, especially to
your earlier comment, where pricing is not up as much as it probably should be? And if that's the case, because I kind
of think it is, but if that's the case, can you give us a sense of what you think your ongoing, not just EPS growth target
is, but it's almost a TSR, so EPS plus dividend that investors should think about in this new industry norm? So thanks
for those two questions.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Ali, I'm going to let Hugh give you some information on the details of the question that you
asked about and then I'm going to give you some overall observations. So, Hugh, let me.

<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Sure, happy to do that. First, Ali, regarding your question on Mexico, obviously, this is a
difficult one for us even, with all the information that we have to ascertain. Because what it's created is a substantial
price increase to consumers in the Mexican marketplace regarding our products. Further, obviously, Mexican
consumers are facing significant price increases across a broad variety of their baskets. So our traditional elasticity
models just don't extend out to the size of the price increases that people are seeing. We've obviously put a number in
as a part of the guidance. I think what we'll do instead of sharing specific numbers right now is, as the situation evolves,
as consumers kind of get through the sticker shock of what they're facing and we settle into what is a new demand
level, I think we'll probably just update you quarter-to-quarter on what's happening inside of Mexico. So I think that's
probably the most efficient way to communicate this, because it is a challenge right now for everyone to sort out what
the likely impact is in Mexico.
Regarding your broader question, I don't think we've entered a new era of cost-cutting alone. I think it's always going to
be a balancing act in our space. Certainly, our geographic and product portfolio provide us with the opportunity to grow
the top-line in a pretty reasonable way, hence the mid-single-digit long-term guidance. That said, we will certainly
always look to be more efficient with the resources that we have, some of which we'll deliver to the bottom-line, some
of which we will invest in capability and invest in innovation and brand building in order to fuel that top-line growth to
continue the virtuous cycle.
Regarding TSR, we've talked about high-single-digit as our long-term earnings per share growth target. Obviously,
we've taken the dividend up, and those tend to be pretty permanent. And that's north of 3% right now in terms of the
yield. So I think that's reasonable math for you to be working with. That's certainly our best estimation as a
management team.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Then, I think, Ali, just in terms of overall observation, I'd say now is a time that we have to
keep growing in emerging and developing markets. You can't back off that growth, because all the competitive
positions are being established. So as you grow rapidly in emerging and developing markets, the margin profile is
different. And cost inflation there is very different than it is in developed markets. And when you have a slowdown in
developed markets and you have continued accelerated growth in emerging and developing markets, in terms of the
overall portfolio, you've got to make sure that you look at the dilutive effect of the emerging and developing market
growth and offset that with increased productivity so, overall, the portfolio works.
And that's the whole portfolio play that we are focused on, but it's very important that you don't talk about it as
cost-cutting, because if you cut costs for the sake of cost-cutting, it's very different than meaningful productivity
programs to fundamentally change the cost base of the company. So when we talk about a productivity program, we're
saying, okay, we put in the SAP system starting 2002. We now have more visibility. We can harmonize processes, so
we can do shared services, or we can ensure compliance when we lift and shift ideas. So there's got to be a very
deliberate program to fundamentally take the cost structure to a new level, not just cut costs to deliver one year of
earnings growth.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Bill
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey, obviously, 2013 was a terrific year for Frito, both in terms of the growth and market
share, so can you just give us some indication as to what's coming in 2014? And then, obviously, a lot of that growth
was driven by a terrific step up, especially in North America in marketing spending. So do you still intend to,
obviously, increase that capability in 2014? And then one very quick one after that, do you have any interest in home
carbonation? Obviously, the Green Mountain co-partnership was announced, and I know Bryan asked about it briefly,
but I didn't hear the response. Thanks.

<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Well, we'll try to answer both your questions. The first on Frito-Lay North America, you're
absolutely right. Frito-Lay North America had a terrific year, but let's just talk about the Frito journey. From about
2011 to 2012, those years we revamped Frito-Lay. We relooked at the Insights model. We tried to understand what was
going on in the consumer landscape, how should we think about our product positioning, our brands, which
composition to go after. This was a fundamental relook at everything we did at Frito-Lay. We re-looked at the costs.
GES really took root during that time. And in 2012, we stepped up investment behind this whole model on demand
spaces and insights that we'd worked on.
So we're beginning to see the benefits of that in 2013. And you'll see more of that going into 2014, 2015 and 2016,
because we have the entire macro snacks space that we can go after with our Salty Snack base, our strong salty Snack
base. And that's our plan, to selectively go after certain demand moments with the salty Snack base that we have.
The good news is that a lot of that Insight work, the demand spaces work that was done at Frito-Lay, we are now taking
to Beverages. And since 2013, we've been working at fine-tuning the Beverages Insights engine, so it can get to the
Frito-Lay North America level. So we have great optimism for how this whole North American business is going to
think about consumers, brand, innovation, demand growth. I think the future looks good.
Let's now talk about in-home carbonation. Well, the way you should think about this is another distribution channel for
carbonated beverages or sparkling beverages. GMCR is one option. Interestingly, there are multiple, multiple, multiple
technologies out there. What we've been sorting through, I'd say at least for 12 months, is making sure that we don't
lock and load with any technology until the technology is proven out. There's only one technology today that's
functioning, but it's based on a system that's very different than what GMCR is thinking about launching. But we have
to make sure that we align with partners who we are sure will commercialize product. So we are working with multiple
people, stay tuned.

Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So I think the – when I look at your revenue target for 2014, it's mid-single-digits, so that's in
line with your long-term target, which is different than, I guess, you're EPS target that's at the low end of your
long-term target. So I just wanted to get an understanding of within your revenue growth target, you have confidence in
high-single to the low-double-digit growth that you expect to see in your emerging markets. And just maybe a bit more
color around some of your key markets, what are you expecting in markets like Russia, China, et cetera? And then,
Hugh, just on the currency guidance, I just wanted to understand what you're baking in for Venezuela?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Okay, Judy, I'll just talk to you about overall emerging and developing markets, rather than
individual countries. I tell you, taken together, and it's very important that we look at emerging and developing markets
as a portfolio, because in any one year, you're going to see some markets go through volatility and other markets
perform well. If you look over the last 10 years, that's been the case. And so I don't think we should pick out any
individual country. When something goes up, something else goes down. So as a portfolio, our emerging and
developing markets will deliver the kind of numbers that we talked about. We feel fairly confident, barring any major
crisis, which we do not anticipate, we think our emerging and developing markets will deliver the number that we
talked about. On Venezuela...
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, happy to take that one, Indra. Yeah, and, Judy, as you know, Venezuela is certainly an
interesting and challenging environment right now. You know there are two rates out there. There is the 6.3 rate and
then the 11 rate. We haven't seen any "official devaluation" yet out of Venezuela. The planning assumption that we're
using, based on the blend of the two rates, is 10. So that's our operating assumption right now. Obviously, until the

And our final question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: A question about how you're thinking about the balance sheet and the leverage, nice to
see the return of cash exceeding the free cash flow. What do you think of having some sort of EBITDA target, you
know, a 2.5, even a 3 times target or how are you thinking beyond 2014 treating the leverage, given this more
aggressive approach to returning cash?
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, I'm happy to take that one. Mark, what we talked about rather than getting into
specific leverage targets and specific long-term ratings targets is maintaining access to Tier 1 commercial paper. I think
that's the best way for us to think about it, because for a company that generates a lot of cash, for a company that has an
excellent business rating from the various rating agencies, Tier 1 CP access is really the thing we'll probably manage to
more than anything else. So that's the way we're thinking about it on a go-forward basis, rather than getting into
specific leverage targets or long-term ratings targets.

And we have time for one additional question. Our final question comes from Caroline Levy with CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Oh, good morning, everyone. Thank you.
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Morning, Caroline.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Morning,
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Just a question, which I think I know the answer to, but I have to ask it again. Given that
you've got this valuable distribution system and the fastest growing carbonated drink out there right now is still in the
Energy category, do you still rule out the idea of acquisitions?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Yes.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Can you explain why, because, I mean, you're not participating in a business that appears to
have legs? Do you think you can go after it in another way?
<A - Indra K. Nooyi>: Well, Mountain Dew Kickstart is our version of the energy drink that's right for the masses and
we distribute our other energy drinks. Caroline, I'll tell you something. We've looked at this category long and hard and
we look at what we can do with those businesses and whether it's value creating for shareholders if we were to make
any acquisition. And all our analysis says it will not. And so, you know, we've chosen not to do an acquisition here.
<A - Hugh F. Johnston>: Yeah, Carolyn, if I can add to that, as well. From the standpoint of the Energy category, I
think you're aware that we do have a distribution arrangement with ROCKSTAR. That is a distribution arrangement
that's worked very well for them and it's worked very well for us. And that is our play in the Energy category in North
America. Mountain Dew Kickstart plays around the Energy space, but it's not in the Energy space in a similar way that
Starbucks Frappuccino and Iced Coffee and other potential innovations go down that path as well. So I think we have a
full complement of products to meet the energy need state for consumers and I think we're positioned well.
