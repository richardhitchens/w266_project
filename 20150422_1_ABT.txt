MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.
All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions]
This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the

I would now like to introduce Mr. Brian Yoor, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Brian B. Yoor
Okay. Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Miles White, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer; and Tom Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Miles will

In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on
our website at abbott.com.
Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange,
unless otherwise noted.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay, thanks, Brian. Good morning, everybody. I'll be brief this morning and leave some time for questions.
Our first quarter performance exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines. We reported double-digit
operational sales growth, exceeded both our gross and operating margin targets in the quarter, closed on the sale of our
EPD Developed Markets business to Mylan, and launched a number of new products across our portfolio.
I'll summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Tom and Brian for some further detail.
Operational sales increased 10% in the quarter, with particularly strong performance in our branded generics,
international nutrition and global diagnostics businesses as well as double-digit growth in emerging markets, and that
did include the additions of CFR and Veropharm.
While currency was a factor, including a 7% negative impact on the top line, we continue to manage through its effect
on the bottom line. Our first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.47 exceeds our previous guidance range and
reflects growth of 38%. But again, as I said, that includes the addition of CFR and Veropharm in the comparison.
Our full year 2015 adjusted earnings per share guidance was $2.10 to $2.20 remains unchanged and reflects
double-digit underlying growth, excluding the impact of currency.
So in the quarter, starting with Nutrition, sales increased more than 6%, with continued double-digit growth outside of
the United States. The new pediatric products that we've launched into China and other fast-growing geographies are
continuing to perform well, products like Similac QINTI and Eleva, and we've got strong performance in the online
segments. These new products drive share expansion and contribute to our growth in the market.
The International Adult Nutrition business has consistently delivered high-single-digit to double-digit sales growth. Our
adult nutritional, Ensure, is roughly a $200 billion brand globally today, and we launched it into the retail segment in
China early this year.
In March, we also opened a nutrition pilot plant in Singapore. This facility, in addition to the others there, allows us to
customize more of our products to meet consumer preferences across Asia.
In Medical Devices, Diabetes Care returned to growth this quarter, as we expected. We've had a very positive early
response to the launch of our new FreeStyle Libre device. As I mentioned last quarter, we're already expanding
capacity to meet this demand. Libre is a highly differentiated technology that helps people self-manage their diabetes
without the need for routine finger sticks.
We're also building a portfolio of products based on our sensor technology, and FreeStyle Libre Pro is our first
professional use device that was launched in India earlier this month.
Our Vascular business also performed in line with our expectations. Operational sales growth in the quarter was driven
by a high-single-digit performance of our Endovascular products as well as double-digit growth of our structural heart
product, MitraClip. The market opportunity for mitral regurgitation is significant but still in its early stages, and
MitraClip is the only product on the market to-date that can treat this disease in a minimally invasive way.

In Medical Optics, sales were impacted by market dynamics in our cataract and LASIK businesses. We recently
launched two new cataract lenses and saw a pickup in our cataract lens growth as the quarter progressed.
In Diagnostics, we delivered 6% growth in the quarter. The continued success of our commercial strategies with core
laboratory customers are driving share gains in the U.S. and emerging markets. We continue to invest in the
development of next-generation system platforms across all three of our Diagnostics businesses.
In Point of Care Diagnostics, sales increased double-digits. In the U.S., we've had success with large healthcare
networks standardizing their point-of-care testing with our i-STAT system. Outside the U.S., our expansion efforts
continue in both developed and emerging geographies.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, we're executing better commercially. That's something I've given a fair amount of
attention to on past calls with you. We're expanding our product portfolios in our therapeutic areas of focus and driving
more awareness of our Abbott brand with consumers, physicians and pharmacists.
Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm, sales in our key emerging
markets increased in the low-double digits, with above-market growth in India, Brazil, China, Russia and Colombia.
With the sale of the Developed Markets business to Mylan completed in February, EPD is now focused solely on
Emerging Markets.
We received 110 million shares of Mylan stock for the Developed Markets business and recently sold roughly a third of
our position. The net proceeds from the sale of Mylan shares and our strong balance sheet provide us with additional
flexibility to invest in strategic growth opportunities to continue to shape Abbott for long-term growth.
So in summary, we reported first quarter results ahead of our expectations. We're building on the momentum we had
exiting 2014, and we expect high-single-digit full year operational sales growth and continued progress on margin
expansion. And we're well on track to achieve our financial objectives in 2015.
I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles. As Miles indicated, today we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing
operations of $0.47, above our previous guidance range and reflecting growth of 38%. Sales for the quarter increased
10% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact of 7% from foreign exchange. Reported sales increased
3% in the quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by strong performance in Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Established
Pharmaceuticals, which included the impact of 2014 acquisitions. Sales in emerging markets increased strong
double-digits in the quarter.
The first quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.1% of sales, somewhat above our forecast and up nearly 500 basis
points over the first quarter of 2014. The year-over-year comparison was driven by gross margin improvement
initiatives across our businesses and, in part, the comparison relative to an unusually low ratio experienced in the first
quarter 2014.
In the quarter, adjusted R&D investment was around 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was around 34.5% of
sales.
The over-delivery in the first quarter EPS compared to our guidance was in part the result of the dynamics of exchange
on our results, including the timing effects of hedging activities on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L. We expect
the first quarter favorability on this line of the P&L to partially reverse in the second quarter, with the remaining net
gain for the year to be offset on the operating income line of the P&L over the last three quarters.

As we discussed last quarter, while the weaker euro impacts our top line, movements in the euro have a minimal impact
on our bottom line due to our euro-denominated cost base. Therefore, the further weakening of the euro that we saw in
the first quarter of the year does not impact our 2015 EPS forecast.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2015, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $2.10 to $2.20 from
continuing operations remains unchanged.
Regarding our full year 2015 outlook for the P&L, we continue to forecast operational sales growth in the high-single
digits. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 7% on our full
year reported sales, up over our previous projection in January of around 6%. This would result in reported sales
growth in the low-single digits for the full year 2015. Brian will provide more details on the 2015 outlook by business
in a few minutes.
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales for the full year, driven by gross margin
improvement initiatives across our businesses. We forecast adjusted R&D investment of around 6.5% of sales and now
forecast an adjusted SG&A expense of around 31.5% of sales. Overall, we continue to expect to expand our full year
adjusted operating margin by over 100 basis points in 2015.
We now forecast net interest expense of around $120 million, reflecting changes in the interest rate assumptions on
both our debt and some of our investments. We forecast an exchange gain of approximately $35 million on the
exchange gain/loss line of the P&L for the full year, reflecting some reversal of the favorability we saw on this line in
the first quarter, as mentioned previously. And we forecast around $5 million of non-operating expense for the full year
2015.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter. We forecast ongoing EPS of $0.49 to $0.51, reflecting double-digit
underlying growth largely offset by the impact of significant foreign exchange headwinds on operating results, as
discussed on the January call, as well as the partial reversal of favorability in the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L
from the first quarter, as previously mentioned.
We forecast operational sales growth in the low-double digits in the second quarter. At current exchange rates, we'd
expect a negative impact from exchange of somewhat above 8%, resulting in reported sales in the low-single digits.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 57.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 6.5%
of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales in the second quarter. We forecast net interest
expense of around $35 million and approximately $15 million in expense on the exchange gain/loss line of the P&L.
Finally, we project specified items of $0.23 in the second quarter, reflecting the same items as we identified for the full
year in our earnings release.
So in summary, our full year ongoing EPS guidance remains unchanged. As we start the year, we're well positioned to
deliver another year of strong EPS growth in 2015 despite a challenging currency environment.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights and outlook. Brian?
Brian B. Yoor
Thanks, Tom. This morning I'll review our first quarter 2015 performance and second quarter sales outlook by
business. As I mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth.
I'll start with our Nutrition business, where global sales increased more than 6% in the first quarter. In our International
Pediatric Nutrition business, sales increased 11.7%, driven by double-digit growth in China and Latin America. We
continued to capture market share with new infant formula products we launched into the fast-growing market
segments and geographies over the past year. This includes Similac QINTI and Eleva, which we launched into the
premium infant formula market segment in China in 2014.

International Adult Nutrition sales increased nearly 11% in the quarter, driven by strong double-digit growth in Latin
America. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth in our International Adult Nutrition
business.
We continue to expand the adult nutrition category internationally and recently launched our Ensure brand in China
into the retail market segment, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Abbott. We also continue to
expand our local presence in key markets. As Miles mentioned, in addition to the three manufacturing plants we opened
last year in China, India and the U.S., we announced in March the opening of a new nutrition pilot plant in Singapore.
This state-of-the-art facility will serve as a second global R&D hub.
In the U.S., Pediatric Nutrition sales were up 4.5%, driven by market share gains in the non-WIC segment of the infant
formula market and double-digit Pedialyte growth as a result of a strong flu season.
Adult Nutrition sales in the U.S. were impacted by competitive and market dynamics, including softness in the
institutional segment. We expect a modest improvement in the U.S. Adult Nutrition sales growth over the course of the
year as we launch new products.
For the second quarter, we are forecasting mid- to high-single-digit growth on an operational basis in our Global
Nutrition business, driven by continued double-digit operational sales growth in International Nutrition.
In our Diagnostics business, sales increased 6% in the first quarter, with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets.
Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales increased 4.7% in the quarter. This above-market growth was driven by strong
growth in our Core Laboratory segment as this business continues to increase its win rate and gain share with its
customer-focused solutions. The U.S. growth was impacted by a comparison to a strong first quarter of last year when
sales increased double-digits, driven by higher blood screening sales.
Last week, we announced a partnership agreement with the number one coagulation company in Japan to provide
coagulation testing solutions to core laboratories worldwide. This partnership broadens our diagnostics offering to meet
our customers' needs and to deliver high-quality results and efficient workflow as part of Abbott's total solution.
Coagulation testing is approximately a $2 billion market segment of the in vitro diagnostics market that's growing in
the mid-single digits.
In Molecular Diagnostics, sales increased 7.4% in the quarter driven by growth of our core business segment, infectious
disease testing. Growth was also favorably impacted this quarter by the timing of tenders in emerging markets.
In Europe, we're early into the launch of our IRIDICA infectious disease testing platform, which helps identify serious
infections such as sepsis.
For the second quarter, we expect relatively flat growth in our Molecular Diagnostics business as we project growth of
the infectious disease business to be offset by the declines in our non-core oncology and genetics businesses.
In Point of Care Diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 15.5%, with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and
internationally as this business continues to build and expand its presence in targeted developed and emerging markets.
Strong growth in the quarter was driven by continued performance in the large hospital segment as well as continued
adoption in the physician office laboratory and ambulatory settings where small, portable solutions such as Abbott's
i-STAT help improve efficiencies.
For the second quarter, we expect our Global Diagnostics business to generate mid-single-digit operational sales
growth.
In Medical Devices, sales in our Vascular business increased 2% in the quarter. Sales of our MitraClip product for the
treatment of mitral regurgitation increased strong double digits in the quarter both in the U.S. and internationally. Last
month, we presented data that reinforces MitraClip's ability to reduce mitral regurgitation and improve a person's
overall health, and it supports further adoption of this device.

Our Endovascular business continues to have momentum, with sales growing high-single-digits in the quarter driven by
strong growth in our base business, including vessel closure, as well as our peripheral stent, Supera.
And in our drug-eluting portfolio in the U.S., we have gained sequential market share following the XIENCE Alpine
launch. XIENCE Alpine is the only drug-eluting stent with an indication to treat chronic total occlusions. We've also
recently announced the launch of XIENCE Alpine in Japan.
For the second quarter, we expect sales in our Global Vascular business to increase low-single digits on an operational
basis.
In Diabetes Care, global sales in the first quarter increased nearly 3% as this business returned to growth after lapping
the impact of U.S. reimbursement changes. Outside of the U.S., strong consumer and physician adoption of our
revolutionary new glucose sensing technology, FreeStyle Libre, has exceeded our initial expectations, driven by a
successful direct-to-consumer campaign.
We continue to expand FreeStyle Libre to new geographies. Earlier this month, we announced the launch in India of
FreeStyle Libre Pro for professional use. Libre Pro uses the same sensor-based technology as our consumer-focused
FreeStyle Libre product and helps doctors obtain the comprehensive data they need to make treatment decisions. India
is a logical target market for Libre Pro because there is a large diabetes population but self-monitoring of blood glucose
is not a common practice.
In the U.S., we have and will continue to segment our products and our commercial strategies to drive profitable
growth. And last week, we announced the launch of FreeStyle Precision Neo, a new compact, easy-to-use blood
glucose meter that allows people with diabetes to easily access a well-known multinational brand in the
over-the-counter market segment.
For the second quarter, we're forecasting low- to mid-single-digit operational sales growth in our Diabetes Care
business.
In Medical Optics, sales were down 3.4% in the quarter. While this performance was below our expectations, we
expect improved sales growth in our Medical Optics business over the rest of the year as we launch new products.
Earlier this year in the U.S., we launched TECNIS Multifocal Low Add, which provides more range of vision options
to patients and surgeons. And just last weekend at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery Meeting,
we launched our TECNIS Preloaded in the U.S., which improves the ease-of-use for the cataract surgeon and enhances
predictability of the procedure.
For the second quarter, we expect our Global Medical Optics business to grow mid-single-digits on an operational
basis.
And lastly, our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, where sales increased strong double-digits in the
quarter, including the impact from recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm.
In February, we completed the sale of our developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business to Mylan. With
this business now focused entirely on emerging markets, we saw low double-digit underlying sales growth in our key
emerging markets, which include India, Russia, China, Brazil and Colombia, along with several additional markets.
Performance across the Latin American region was strong during the quarter as we're starting see the benefits of a more
complete product portfolio and sales infrastructure due to the integration of CFR. Additionally, Influvac sales were
strong and benefited from the production capacity expansion we completed last year.
For the second quarter, we expect similar strong double-digit growth in EPD on an operational basis, including the
impact of the acquisitions I mentioned.
In summary, our first quarter earnings per share and operational sales growth exceeded expectations. We launched
several new key products across our portfolio of businesses. And our outlook for the year remains unchanged as we are
well-positioned to deliver another year of strong growth.

We will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering
if you could just, like, comment from a big picture perspective. You've now really done a great job of re-shifting the
portfolio with the disposition of the developed Established Pharmaceutical business and bringing in CFR and
Veropharm. Just how are you thinking about just kind of shaping Abbott going forward? It doesn't necessarily seem
that you need to be in a rush to certainly deploy any of the cash, you have plenty of flexibility, but just how are you
thinking about just kind of more from a big picture strategic perspective, kind of what's next?
<A - Miles D. White>: Thanks for the question, Kristen. I'd say we want to grow and we want to get bigger, and I
think there's obviously two dimensions to that. One is organic, and organic can be expansion of products or expansion
of geography. And then there's – I think our footprint could benefit from being a lot bigger in a number of our
businesses or even as a corporation in the diverse mix of businesses we have. So that would imply some M&A activity,
et cetera, and nobody would be surprised to hear that out of me, I don't think.
So, I think both dimensions are important to us and we're putting a fair amount of attention on both. The notion is I
think we've got the right core. It's a very solid core businesses that are performing well or they're in markets that we
know will continue to be healthy and drive good growth and have great opportunity for us.
So, I think we've got the core of the company well-positioned today for the attractiveness of both product markets and
geographic markets that we think there's a lot of opportunity for investors for. But beyond that, I think we can do more,
and I think we can do a lot more and particularly if we're bigger in a number of these spaces. So, my intention is to get
bigger. I think strategically, that's how I'm thinking about it.
And to your comments about resources and timing and so forth, as I've said in the past, I don't feel particularly
capital-constrained or resource-constrained, and yet I don't feel like I'd have to rush out urgently either. I think we can
afford to be thoughtful and prudent, but at the same time, that doesn't mean sit on our hands.
So I think the deal market or the M&A market out there, I'd love to say we all go out there with a plan, we have the
following priorities, we have the following targets, et cetera. Those plans are always dead on arrival. The market tells
you either who's willing to talk to you, who's willing to engage, what valuation may be, what the circumstances in any
given geography or industry may be. Those things always tend to determine the timing of opportunity, and I think what
we've been good at is being ready when opportunity aligns and when people's willingness to engage aligns and so forth.
And I can't always predict the timing of that, but I can tell you, if you're not ready when the things line up, then you'll
not able to take advantage of it.
So we're obviously, I think, always tracking, always studying. And we've always got an idea of what our priorities
would be; the market will tell us what order we get to address them in to some degree. But you're right, we're sitting in
a very, very good position, I think, right now in terms of our readiness, our ability to have resources, et cetera, to invest,
the condition of our underlying business. We've given a fair amount of attention to our cost structure, to our supply
chain structure, to our back office structure, our G&A, all those sorts of things over the last couple of years, really to
ready ourselves for bigger business and greater expansion, particularly geographically.
And I'd say that's all fallen very nicely into place. You can see it in the results, you can see it in the gross margin, you
can see it in the G&A line, you can see it in the efficiency of the business, you can see it in the growth rates of some of
the businesses and so forth. I think I feel pretty good about the foundation, and that's the kind of foundation you want to
add to. You don't want to add to a weak one with a lot of problems or a lot of things you're trying to fix. You want to

add to a strong one. So, I think we're in a really good position right now. I feel good about it.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And you've been really re-shaping Abbott to be more of a consumer-focused business. Is
that how we should think about M&A priorities going forward in terms of things that could really leverage kind of the
Abbott brand and stay within that structure?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I wouldn't say to an extreme degree. I think the word I've used a lot in the past is balance.
I think historically, particularly in developed markets, a lot of our businesses were reliant on government
reimbursement or single-payer systems and so forth. And we wanted a different balance of that where there was
consumer choice, consumer preference, consumer pay, et cetera. The very nature of the mix of our businesses now is
much more like that, not just because of the businesses but because of geographies and the structures in those markets.
So I'd say we have – and for example in our branded generics pharmaceuticals business overseas, those are very much
consumer pay markets. Economic structure of those markets is a little different. They're more attractive to us. We've
targeted those countries with that structure in particular as opportunity. So I'd say to the degree that that opportunity
exists for us, yes, it's very attractive. But I would not rule out Europe, the U.S. or the traditional markets as
opportunities for us for some of our businesses. I just want a different or a more balanced structure so we're not
over-reliant on heavy concentration in given geographies where there's an awful lot of decision control at a central
point.
And then – a lot of European countries are like that. It's one of the reasons Europe hasn't been as high a priority for us
as emerging markets. But I wouldn't weight to one side of the boat either.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Perfect. And then, just a quick follow-up for Tom. Tom, would you be willing to provide
just the organic growth in the quarter for Abbott overall? And then just a comment on...
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, on the top line it's mid-single-digits adjusted for the acquisitions.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Perfect. Okay, thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks. So just to clean that up, so Tom, anything more precise than mid-single-digits
on the organic growth?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Right around 5%, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And then, the beat on the quarter but then not raising the EPS guidance, is that just
the timing of that impacting the P&L over the course of the year?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: I'd say a little bit of it is that. Certainly in that exchange gain/loss line I talked about, that
should be considered to be a little extra in this quarter, offset by some negatives over the last few quarters in the
currency area.
I'd say overall though, it was a really good high-quality quarter when we look at how the businesses progressed both on
the top line and particularly in the gross margin area, and we're just pleased with that progress at this early point in the
year. And I think it sets us up nicely to continue to build on that as we progress through 2015.
<A - Miles D. White>: Mike, I would add to that. The analysts and investors who cover us have all paid a lot more
attention in the last couple of years to currency than they've had to in years past, and partly because multinationals have
expanded so much in a lot more countries. I mean we all used to be so euro-focused and yen-focused. A lot of
companies still are, but because so much of the growth for many of us is Asia, Latin America, other emerging markets,

we've all had to pay a lot more attention to a lot more currencies. And I think that's made it harder to forecast and
predict, particularly the mix and the shifts and so forth. Although when it all goes in one direction like it did the last
couple of quarters, that's pretty easy.
But for us, at least in terms of the currency piece, I think all of us were caught off guard somewhat by the magnitude of
currency shift in the fourth quarter last year. Although maybe we shouldn't have been, but we were. And in our case, as
I've pointed out in the past, we're less vulnerable to the euro – very much less vulnerable to the euro than a lot of
companies might be just because of the mix of our business and where we produce and offset the exchange.
But then, that means we've got a bigger basket of currencies to look at. I look at those currencies and I say, okay, well,
the ruble improved on us in the first quarter, thank God, and quite substantially, while the Brazilian real did not; it went
the other way. China is very stable. India is pretty stable for us right now. So the big currencies that you'd normally
think would affect us or could affect us, I knock on wood and I look at it and I think, okay, this should all be pretty
stable for the year barring events I can't predict in the external world.
With regard to guidance, which you asked about and I'm circling back to, I just think it's early in the year to do any
changing of guidance. I'm kind of a Murphy's Law believer, that the minute we make any kind of confident move,
something is going to go wrong with currency or something – I don't know. I just think it's a little early in the first
quarter.
I have to say though, to echo Tom, the underlying performance of the company is real good. And to the extent that this
momentum continues and there's no change to currency assumptions and so forth, you're going to be pressuring us on
this point again in a quarter here or so. And that's all good, but I think I'd just like to see more cards played before we
move in that direction.
I looked back over our last seven or eight years to see how many times we had adjusted guidance in the first quarter
and I think, God, we just gave it to you a couple of months ago, so to change it two months later, does that make sense?
I think I've only change guidance a couple of times in the first quarter in the last eight years, and I'm not even sure why
I did it then. Because I think in general, I ought to see half the year played before I've got a good feel for how things are
going to lay out. Because generally, the second half of the year is different than the first half of the year for all of us,
and it's usually around currency or some catastrophic event and world events, and I'd just like to see another quarter
played. And then, if we're cranking along like we seem to be, then you're going to be pressuring us, and I'm going to be
nodding and saying, you told me so, you were right.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. So, let me switch to strategy. So, Miles, depending on what plays out with Mylan,
I could see where you guys end the year with maybe $12 billion to $13 billion of cash. Probably everything except for
$0.05 of that will be outside the U.S. You'd have still, let's call it, $5 billion of net cash at that point. Does the cash
position and the fact that really all of it will end up being outside the U.S., does that really drive you to an acquisition
of O-U.S. assets or O-U.S.-domiciled assets? And do you think you can put – given the opportunity set, do you think
you can put that cash and your balance sheet to work?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, let me go in reverse order. Do I think I can put the cash on the balance sheet to work?
Yes. The timing of when I can put it to work is kind of the question, which I was sort of addressed to Kristen here a
little bit ago. I can't predict timing very well, Mike. I can predict intent. And my intent is, yeah, I will put it to work.
I think we've always found a good balance here. We're pretty stable, reliable, predictable in terms of dividend, the
payout and so forth, and we've been pretty solid about balance of share buyback and capital deployment. But we've also
been pretty good about deploying to higher-return investments and so forth, and I think our deal record speaks for
itself. So I'd say, yeah, the intent's there; the timing's a little harder to predict. But I'm not sitting on my hands, as I said
earlier.
Now having addressed that, gee, am I stuck with only opportunities overseas because of the structure of the tax system
in the world? No, I don't think so. I'm not ruling out the U.S. I'm not ruling it out at all. And I think – let's just say we
got great tax guys and great management of our cash flows and access to our cash if we have to, and I think we've got
good borrowing capacity if we want to and so forth. And I think I've got enough flexibility that I don't have to stay in

an external world.
Now, I think there's a lot of reasons that overseas is, say, economically more attractive. We all know what those are.
But I think those are all sort of financial, tax, cash related. At the same time, I think there's opportunities that are
attractive to us strategically for our business that aren't overseas, and I don't think I can rule those out. So, I don't feel
constrained to being overseas. I don't feel like our ability to finance what we may be interested in is constrained that
way. So while I'm always looking in other geographies of the world for opportunities to expand our footprint, I would
tell you I have not failed to fish at my own dock here in the U.S. and look at opportunities in the U.S.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: And, Miles, last question and I'll let some others jump in. It's been relatively quiet over
the last six months since the Treasury action on U.S. corporates inverting to outside the U.S. Is that something Abbott
might still consider?
<A - Miles D. White>: I'm not looking at it, let me put it that way. I may naively think that Washington will come to
its senses eventually here and make adjustments to the tax code to make U.S.-based multinationals more competitive
globally with all the companies that we compete with -
I mean there's a lot that's been written about this and my position on it's been clear; this tax code disadvantages U.S.
companies and puts a for sale sign on them for European and other companies to buy us and arbitrage tax rates. And I
strenuously object to the philosophy of the U.S. government on that line, because I think it in no way enhances job
growth and creation or business creation or economic recovery in the United States when you advantage everybody
else to buy our companies. So I hope at some point that both parties in Washington will address that, and I think so.
Again, I'm a Murphy's Law guy. I think the minute we did something around inversion or otherwise, the Congress
surely would change the tax code and I'd wonder why I bothered. And I'm not even sure I'm enough of a tax technician
to tell you whether there's a path to do that anymore. I think right now, the way things have been structured and the way
the Treasury addressed it in affecting the trend toward some companies looking at inversion I think has clearly
advantaged the different M&A environment for non-U.S. companies to look at U.S. companies. I think that's absolutely
clear and you'd have to be blind not to see it.
So, it's not on my radar screen, Mike. I'm looking at things more strategically and more traditionally, meaning I look at
the strategic fit to the business or what we can do with it and what we can expand it and so forth and I look at whether
those economics work, and I'm not trying to subsidize our M&A analysis with tax arbitrage.
Now, I think a lot of other companies x-U.S. are definitely subsidizing their analysis with tax arbitrage because they
can. But we're not. And that said, I'm not seeing the expectation of tax inversion premium in values. I think values are
high. I kind of always think they're high. I think they're high around the world for a lot of reasons. A lot of deals are
getting done at expensive prices and expensive multiples. They're not because of inversion or tax, they're just
expensive, and that's driven expectations in a lot of places up. But I always think that it's extensive out there. And my
job is to make the best deal I can for the company, but it's pretty hard to get a real deal in some cases unless you've got
a plan for you're going to do with the business and how it's going to operate in your hands.
So I guess to summarize all that, the short answer is I'm not focused on inversion for the benefit of tax. Doing those
things is temporarily pretty disruptive to a company. And there's a long-term belief that you need to do that as some
companies have done. Then, it must hit them strategically. In our case, I don't know that we need to do that. And I
rather hope here that our government will fix the tax code in the next couple of years. And if they do, I think it's going
to dramatically enhance the competitiveness of companies like us.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay, perfect. Thank you, Miles.
<A - Miles D. White>: I know you teed that up as a commercial for me, but that's kind of the deal.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you. Good morning, Miles, Tom and team. I wanted just to start with the
business actually and specifically around Medical Devices, where actually I think the overall growth rate of that
business looks to be trending a little bit better than where it has. So, I was hoping you could just go into a little bit more
depth on the turn in the Vascular business and then also what gives you confidence specifically on the Medical Optics
side that we'll see a turn in that franchise through the balance of 2015?
<A - Miles D. White>: Okay, let me start with the Vascular side. I think what we've seen occur here over the last few
years and, of course, stent business in particular because everything kind of revolves around the stent business, is a
certain amount of stability out in the marketplace. There's always price pressure, there still is. The major competitors in
the market are pretty competitive. And physicians that use our products, they use all of us and they kind of balance it.
So, I think what you've seen is the value of incremental innovation has diminished and the market has kind of
stabilized. One might even suggest it's commoditizing to a degree. But it's kind of stabilized. And so, I'd say there's
constant drumbeat of price pressure as governments or payers or hospitals or whatever the case may be are trying to
manage their own budgets. And in some ways, I think it just forces us all to be a lot more innovative about where our
next frontiers are, et cetera.
And I think that in the Medical Device business, there's a lot of opportunities for innovation. And rather than look at
much broader footprint of very mature products, we're putting our focus on a lot of innovation at a venture level and a
smaller level where there's a lot of opportunity for growth expansion and continued improvement to healthcare.
I'm not prepared to talk a lot about that today, but I would tell you that's where I'm headed with that, is to grow and
expand that Device business but perhaps a little differently than what people might expect. But I like the core of what
we have. I think we're going to have to manage it a little differently going forward, but I think the expansion for a lot of
other related areas is there.
On Medical Optics, there's kind of two stories here. Am I pleased with our performance? Sometimes. We had three or
four very strong quarters in a row and then the business kind of hit a wall. There's several explanations for that. Part of
it is us, part of it is our own competitiveness or responsiveness, a part of it's one our main competitors kind of waken up
again and responding to the share that we had taken in the cataract business. I would sort of attribute that to just the ebb
and flow of competition, which is good.
There's also some structural things going on there in the Optics business. We're seeing some customer consolidation in
the LASIK market. We're seeing lower utilization in the LASIK market. We've been seeing that for a number of years
now.
The cataract business remains strong. Super. We've got a great drumbeat here of innovation coming steadily. Our R&D
group has done a fabulous job, I think, over the last several years, and they continue to with just constant product
innovation and launch.
So, I think there's some tactical things we've got to do a lot better. I like this business. It's one I want to expand in. If
you've got things you got to adjust internally, it makes a little harder to expand. You like to add to a strong and well
operating core. So we know we've got some improvements to do on our own performance, and I'd say Optics remains
on my radar screen as one to expand because I think there's a lot of opportunity there.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe, switching gears over to the Nutrition side. I think in
your prepared remarks, you said that you had entered the Chinese market in Adult Nutrition with Ensure in retail stores
there, and I know that that's an opportunity that's sort of in its infancy right now. But would you sort of agree with an
assessment that over time, the Chinese adult opportunity can be a low kind of $1 billion – $2 billion, $3 billion dollar
opportunity sort of using the Vietnam template as an example and just looking at kind of the demographic opportunity
in China? And how long would it take you to realize something like that?

<A - Miles D. White>: I'm breathless at your expectations. Look, I would tell you, I haven't envisioned for it to be a
pretty big business. I'm not sure I'd put a two or three in front of the billion yet. I'd like to get to a few hundred million
and kind of get some critical mass and momentum. I do have an ambition for it to be a very substantial business, kind
of along the lines you're directionally headed. I'm just cautious about getting ahead of myself here on that. I've got a
couple of businesses here at Abbott that I've had those same ambitions for for 10 years, and they're still around $0.5
billion. So, I don't want to perpetually be a visionary because it never comes true. I'd like for it to actually happen.
And so in this case, I'd say I believe that opportunity is there. I believe that potential is there. We've got to establish the
category. We've got to establish the use. We've got to establish the brand. And I think what we've seen in the past is
that every country we've done that in, it's been pretty substantial. We create the category. We are the category. We got
to do that in China. There's an adult category in China. It's a little different than what Ensure is or does, but there's been
some regulatory change there that's been favorable to us and it's allowed us to establish this category at a more rapid
pace.
And I think it's really attractive and I think there's a big upside here. So, you and I would at least be conceptually
aligned. I'm just afraid to put that kind of specificity around size, because I don't know how long it might take. You
could be right. And wherever we are, when you are right, I want you to send me a note and let me know, you were
right, because I'll be very happy if we are. But I think there's a lot of opportunity to get big like that.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. Well, I guess to make you feel better, we never put a timeline on it. So, it was
more of a peak opportunity...
<A - Miles D. White>: In that case, I think you're going to be right. As I said, if we get to a few hundred million first,
we'll stop and have a temporary celebration, and keep moving on. I mean this is kind of like a having a kid in Little
League and you want him to be Derek Jeter. I think he'll be Derek Jeter, let's just take it one step at a time here.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: I'll look forward to that celebration. And maybe just lastly on the P&L, Tom. As I
look at your kind of guidance for the year on operating margin, you've obviously done a tremendous job expanding
profitability over the past couple of years. But still, as I kind of look at where your margins are versus your peers, it
looks like there's still some room to go, even after where you end up this year. Are we still sort of in a period where you
think Abbott is under-earning versus the peer group in certain segments with room to go on the profitability side?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, I don't like that characterization so much. I mean when I look at the steady annual
progress of, really, a complex multitude of initiatives really from top to bottom line across all these businesses, I think
it's just exactly the way to go about it.
But to answer your question directly, I definitely see more margin expansion opportunity across a number of these
businesses, and that's part of our expectation as we move forward. And I think you're already seeing it in the first
quarter here. And we have objectives in 2015 for that 100 basis points plus, and there's no reason to stop there. I think
each of these businesses is moving forward and it's a huge priority for the management team here as we look at the
business.
<A - Miles D. White>: David, let me add to that a couple of things that underlie it. One is, at least on the cost side,
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit early on that one can get. Okay, that, got that. There's other stuff that's structural,
whether it's supply chain related or plant related, where the plant is, costs of labor, cost of inputs, cost of commodities,
distribution, all those sorts of things. Right?
The structural ones take longer. And if I look at the Nutrition business as an example, where we've been at it for four
years or five years, there was a steady drumbeat every year. But what we're seeing the benefit of now is the bigger
structural investments we had to make that took two years, three years to realize, even four years in some cases because
of plants, plant location, supply chain, et cetera, and we're now starting to see the benefits of that. So sometimes, you've
got to actually change process, system, et cetera, to get at it.
Second piece of it is that affects your margin is price, and we're protecting price. This is a little bit of two steps
forward, one step back. Exchange keeps erasing some of the advantage off the top line. And you can say, well,

exchange advantages you on the bottom line too at least, or to the extent that you can put your costs in the right places,
and that's true.
But for the last few years, we've watched tremendous advantage gained in gross margin management and cost
reduction erased by exchange, and all multinationals are seeing that to some degree. So we look at it and we say, okay,
we just got to have pretty aggressive targets here to improve these margins steadily. You got to treat exchange almost
like a cost at this point each year or a price reduction.
And so constantly, we look at the balance of that exchange, how we manage it, in effect treating it like an erosion of
price, because that contributes to margin, too. So, you got multiple factors at work here, and we've been very
intentional about how we'd spread our business, spread our cost base, manage exchange, hedge exchange, all those
sorts of things, to protect that, because honestly it hurts to gain it through cost and give it back through price erosion or
exchange every year. And we've affected mix, the markets we choose, the products we choose and so forth – the mix in
profitable segments versus unprofitable segments or less profitable segments. All that affects it. Some of it just takes
time. Now, to give you the bottom line answer to your question, is there still opportunity? Yes, there is, and it's not just
a little. We keep plugging away at pretty big chunks of opportunity here.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay, great. I appreciate all the detail. Thanks, guys.
<A - Miles D. White>: Thank you, David.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Hello, good morning. Miles, just coming back to the Mylan stake here, your treatment here of
this stake has been more patient than I think some expected, which at least so far is working out to your advantage. I
wonder what are your thoughts on here and...
<A - Miles D. White>: Working out to our advantage just fine.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: That's right. Patience is perfect. But I wonder what your thoughts are here and how you're
balancing sort of access to capital and the potential optionality of Mylan. And there seems to be this view among the
investor community that you're spending a lot of time thinking about this stake and what to do with it. How much time
are you spending on it? Is this just sort of important to you and how are you balancing these different factors?
<A - Miles D. White>: I just love the voracious impatience of the investor community. We didn't even finish this deal
till February. That was two months ago. And I know you could say, well, you could've been thinking about it all ahead
of that time. Yeah, I know. But until it's done, it's not done. And now it's done, right?
I'd also say I don't feel constrained at all by the form of our capital, whether it's a Mylan stock or cash or anything else.
The fact is it has no bearing on what we can or can't do from a strategic standpoint. Because for whatever reason our
capital was tied up in Mylan, I'd just probably borrow until I unlocked it. So, I don't feel like I've got any constraint at
all.
And I'm happy to have been patient. When this deal was done, you'll recall the original value put on the sale of the EPD
business was $5.3 billion. And as I'm watching the great theater out there that is surrounding Mylan, and a team I have
respect for, the value of our position has risen because investors have valued Mylan stock. So you can say that's lucky,
and I'll take good luck any day. But I'm happy that we've been patient, because it's clearly accruing value to us as an
owner and investor of Mylan stock. I think Rob Coury has got an aggressive team there, he's got aggressive plans.
Obviously, other people have aggressive interest in them, and all of that is in our favorable interest financially and it's
not inconsequential. What was a $5 billion value is well north of $7 billion now. And that's just more optionality for
me, and I'm happy about that so I don't feel like I have to be in a real big hurry to do anything to resolve that standing.

I mean one of the reasons that we only sold a third of the stock is because that's all we wanted to sell. We didn't want to
sell any more than that, nor would we have. And I like where we are with it. I think it's been prudent to hold it. It's
proven to be a great value-gainer for us and it's not a constraint. So, there's no hurry on Mylan, other than we don't
intend to be long-term holders, but there doesn't need to be a hurry. If I put it into cash, I can tell you right now I can't
earn as much on that as I'm earning leaving it in Mylan. So until I need to sell it, I think it's in a nice place.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, very clear. And if this whole CEO thing doesn't work out, I guess you can always be a
PM, Miles.
So, the other question I wanted to go in, Tom, is gross margins. I think there's been a lot of commentary on margins on
the call here. But specifically, this is the strongest gross margin quarter I think we've seen since the spin – actually even
going back before the spin, at least the four quarters before the spin. So, could you just talk specifically in this
particular quarter, any specific drivers of gross margin? It does seem largely sustainable into the second quarter, but
what's really driving it, the strongest number we've seen in three years?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: It's just business mix, continuing focus on cost reduction, everyone focused on expanding
and, really, it's across-the-board in the businesses. There's probably a slight amount of this euro benefit coming through
there as well, but it really is – really operating focus, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. And, Miles, just one last quick question and I'll jump back in queue. There were two
businesses you called out about a year ago as areas you were going to see more intensive management focus. I think
one was U.S. Nutritionals and the other obviously was EPD. Between those two, it does appear that there's more
sustainable growth efforts sort of coming through or fruitful on the EPD side than the U.S. Nutritional business. But I
wonder if you can just update us in terms of that management intensive focus and where you see those two businesses
today. Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, the EPD business has been pretty transparent to all of you. You've watched what we've
done there over time. I mean, there were several things going on. One, we came to the conclusion that we wanted to
focus on emerging markets, not developed markets, and the Developed Market part clearly was strategically a better fit
within Mylan, in a much larger business focused in those developed markets. And so, we did that.
Now, you'll note we also acquired a wonderful company, CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America, which gave us a very
strong position in Latin America and enhanced the one we already had. And we made a fairly significant move in
Russia that got done during the core of the whole Ukraine issue, which was – again, Murphy's Law, if you believe that
if it can go wrong, it will. Boy, everything kind of aligned badly and we still got that deal done. And fortunately, we did
it in rubles, so it didn't hurt us when the ruble collapsed.
So, that was really good strategically. And I think that what we've got now in our EPD business, which was done fairly
transactionally, is a complete redirection of that business, refocus, reemphasis, where I think the biggest opportunities
from our standpoint are for what we're focused on and interested in. And so, that's been good. That repositioning has
been good. It's been very intentional. It took us about 18 months to get it done. Frankly, I think that was faster than we
might have expected. Things aligned very well for us.
And so, I look at the underlying growth rates of the countries that we're focused in in EPD, they're strong. I look at our
own performance, it's improving. Could it be better? Sure it could. But right now, it's double-digit and above its market
rates in its countries, and I think that's all good. So I like the positioning of that, and that's a core that I can add to.
On the Nutrition side, we've gone through quite a bit of change, too. There's been some management change in the
businesses. I like the management team we have in place right now a lot in terms of its capability. It's just getting its
feet under it. Most of our leaders there have been in place for better part of six months to nine months, if there's been a
change, that's good. Some of that's organic, some of it's from outside. We've made some changes in how we're
investing in the business and, frankly, how we're marketing.
All of that has been a strong improvement. I think the Pediatric business is well-positioned. We'll see a fair amount of
improvements in our marketing coming forward here, new product launches and other things that I'm pretty excited

about that I think will be good for that business. So, I've actually got a pretty strong comfortable feeling about the U.S.
I think our Adult Nutrition business is weak – or weak relative to what I would expect of it. It's a strong business. We're
large in the category, as you know. And I think there are some things that we're working through there. We've got a
good team there. And it takes a while to see the results of the changes in marketing that we put in place and the changes
in product, et cetera.
So I think we've just got to be – I hate to say the word for you guys – a little patient to wait for the results to show. But
the actions that we've taken, which were pretty deliberate, are in place. Now, I can remember years ago in Chicago,
Dave Wannstedt coaching the Bears, saying all the pieces are in place, we're going to win the Super Bowl, and I don't
think we were even 500 that year. I think the pieces are in place, the right management's in place, and I'm pretty pleased
with where we are with that business. You don't see it as much from your perspective, because it wasn't so transactional
like divesting or acquiring companies was at EPD.
But I think the Nutrition business is now well-positioned. When I look at the international part of it, we've weathered a
number of events, whether it's recalls or other things, in that business. And if I call out one example, I'd say the team in
China has done a wonderful job regaining lost market, lost share, lost position from that recall a couple of years ago.
That business is going well – the Pediatric business I'm speaking of now. And the shares, somewhere between 8.5%,
9%, whatever the way we measure it, and trending well. Growth rates are trending well. Our position in a number of
other countries improving well. So, I like the underlying fundamentals of what I'm seeing out of our Nutrition business,
and I'd like to see a couple of quarters of evidence of good momentum here and I think you'll see it.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - Brian B. Yoor>: Okay, we'll take one last question from the queue, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick strategy questions, one on devices
and one on EPD. First, Miles, like from your comments that the strategy in traditional device is going to be a little more
focused on smaller innovation-based deals, and I was wondering is that the right way look at it? Because I assume your
comments on wanting to be a lot bigger don't really apply to traditional non-consumer-facing med tech.
<A - Miles D. White>: Let me clarify. I wouldn't say exclusively. So, I wouldn't want you to think you're only going to
see little out of me, because it's probably not accurate. But I think you can't just assemble large and mature, either,
okay? You've got to have a foundation and a presence and a core, but the future of any core or foundational business in
devices almost always depends on innovation, replacement, cannibalizing yourself with future renovation, et cetera. So
there's got to be a balance there. And I think we're at a point where we've got this very strong core, probably not
enough of the innovation that comes from the smaller kinds of companies, et cetera, and you can't do everything in
your own R&D in that particular business. You can in Diagnostics, but you can't in Devices.
So, I'd say you might see both. You might see that – I can tell you intentionally, you're going to see we're going to be
investing in smaller opportunities that could get a lot bigger because we want to build the breadth of that business. But
you're right, we may well have to pay attention to the foundational base as well. So I wouldn't rule it out. But I don't
want to give you the impression that I'm just looking at a couple of big add-ons or something here, because I am not.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Okay.
<A - Miles D. White>: Does that make sense?
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: It does. It does, yeah, and we'll follow up a little bit more offline because I wanted to
ask one other one just about EPD. Because you've done a couple of deals lately. I'm just curious, are there others out
there in EPD from an M&A perspective, or is this an area where you've kind of found what's available, acquired them?

I'm just curious how hard it is to fine assets in EPD, since it looks like that's an attractive business long term.
<A - Miles D. White>: It is not hard at all to find assets. That part's easy. And it's not hard to find really good assets.
That part's easy. And it's not hard to find assets with good management, good fit, good products, good geographic
location. That part's actually easy. And I think our people and our team and some of our contacts and stuff, I think we
have a unique advantage there geographically and internationally on that particular dimension. I can think of one or two
other companies that historically, I thought, were thinking about it the same way because we keep bumping into them
everywhere we go. When we're out hunting, fishing, whatever you want to call it, looking at opportunities, we keep
running into the same one or two companies out there doing the same thing. So, I know that they think a little bit like
we do.
But I would tell you that part's easy. The hard part is getting beyond the recognition of it and getting to something
where either somebody is interested in a transaction or it's at a value that doesn't make your nose bleed. And that's
sometimes a challenge. A lot of the things that we would be interested in in some of the international markets are
family-sponsored, family-owned or privately owned, et cetera. And sometimes it's just more complicated. It's not easily
transacted. It takes, well, what I'd call a lot of relational time, getting to know each other and getting to become familiar
and comfortable to get somewhere with a deal.
I would say that the CFR transaction, this is a fabulous company. It was a family company even though it was public. It
had a 90-year history. It was an emotional thing for them to sell the company. And the company has super high-quality,
the management is high-quality. I couldn't be more pleased. And it's a great home here at Abbott for it. It's a great
performer. That deal took a while to develop competent comfort and relations and so forth, and that's how a lot of them
are. That's how a lot of them are. Piramal in India was the same way. And I think it just takes time.
So if you ask me, do I think there's opportunity out there? There's a lot of opportunity but they're not fast.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Terrific. I appreciate the comments. Thanks so much.
