Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks everyone for joining us today.
This was a good quarter for us and a good end to the first half of the year. We've continued to grow our community in
size and engagement, with 1.32 billion people now connecting on Facebook each month and 63% of them visiting
daily. Our momentum remains especially strong on mobile. There are now 829 million people using Facebook every
day, with more than 650 million people using our services on mobile every day.
One thing that's exciting is that there's still so much room to grow. On average, people on Facebook in the U.S. spend
around 40 minutes each day using our service, including about one in five minutes on mobile. This is more than any
other app by far. But overall, people in the U.S. spend about nine hours per day engaging with digital media on TVs,
phones and computers. So, there's a big opportunity to improve the way that people connect and share across how we
all engage with the rest of media as well.
Now when it comes to our business, we continue to be pleased with our growth. This quarter, our total revenue grew to
over $2.9 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 67% from a year ago. Mobile now accounts for 62% of our
advertising revenue, which is a good sign of how the growth of our community on mobile is also producing better
business results for our partners.
The results this quarter show our continued focus on improving our core product and business. We're going to continue
investing aggressively in areas that are important for our mission and long-term strategy, but we're also going to stay
focused on our core product and business. This is the best way for us to continue creating value for our community.
Now let's talk about how we're making progress in our three big company goals: connecting everyone; understanding
the world; and building the knowledge economy.
Our strategy for connecting everyone has two basic approaches. Our first approach is Internet.org, our effort to bring
affordable Internet access to every person in the world. Our second approach is about giving everyone more tools for
connecting, so they can share all the different kinds of content they want with the right people. Instagram, Messenger
and our Creative Labs apps are a part of the second approach.
So, with Internet.org this quarter, we've continued to deepen our partnerships with mobile operators and lay the
foundation for running tests in more countries. Already, our initial partnerships in the Philippines, Paraguay and
Tanzania have helped around 3 million people connect to the Internet who had no access before. We're really proud of
these early results.
In June, we acquired Pryte, which has a lot of expertise bringing affordable Internet access to communities, by
partnering with mobile operators, app developers and content providers. Later this year, we expect to launch a broader
set of free basic Internet services in a number of other countries as well.
In our app efforts, we're continuing to build momentum with messaging. People now send more than 12 billion
messages a day on Facebook; and in April, we reached 200 million monthly actives on Messenger.
Last month, we announced that David Marcus will be joining us from PayPal to lead our messaging efforts. We expect
David to continue growing Messenger, building out new experiences to serve our community, and ultimately to build
Messenger into an important business.

Instagram continues to make great progress in giving people new ways to share their stories through photos and videos.
Last month, we made one of the biggest updates ever to Instagram by adding new creative tools that allow people to
refine exactly how their photos look and feel. This is an important part of building out Instagram's capabilities as a
platform, and serving the creativity of the Instagram community.
Next, let's talk about understanding the world. As of last month, on average, more than 1 billion search queries are
made every day on Facebook. This is a great milestone, and it shows we're in a unique position to answer a lot of
questions for people. But this is just a start, and over the next few years, as we make progress on building out search
and our broader efforts in Artificial Intelligence, I expect us to deliver even greater utility for people.
Our progress on public content is also very promising. As part of helping people better understand the world, we want
to help you connect around important public moments and personalities. And now, nearly 800 million people on
Facebook are connected to public figures. These connections are driving conversations at a huge scale. During the
World Cup, over 350 million people made over 3 billion interactions on Facebook.
To enable even more of these conversations, we've improved the ranking of videos in News Feed and launched new
APIs to help TV and media organizations use Facebook content in their productions. Public content will continue to be
a growing focus for us over the coming months, and we plan to invest in building more great product and partnerships
in this area.
Now, building great social experiences to serve our community isn't something we do alone. Supporting developers is a
key part of our strategy, and at our f8 Conference in April, we announced new ways to help mobile developers build,
grow and monetize their apps.
Over 1 billion people use Facebook on their phones every month, and more than 80% of the top apps on iOS and
Android now use Facebook logins, so we think we're in a great position to be the cross-platform platform that lets
developers build great apps across every platform.
So far, we're very encouraged by the reaction from developers. App Links, our new method of deep linking to specific
content in any app, is now being used by hundreds of apps across iOS, Android and Windows Phone, with links to
more than 1 billion individual destinations in these apps.
We also launched our Audience Network, our first big effort to help developers monetize on mobile, and we've
received a lot of interest from developers. We're rolling out the Audience Network gradually; we're going to continue to
ramp this up over the coming months and are excited by the opportunities ahead.
Finally, let's talk about our efforts to build the knowledge economy. This has been a strong period for us, and we've
reached some new milestones in the business. Now more than 30 million small businesses use Facebook pages to
connect with their customers, and more than 1.5 million of them are active marketers on Facebook.
To continue delivering the best returns for marketers, we've been very focused on improving the quality of the ad
experiences for our community. Our goal here is to make ads as interesting and useful as your friends' content on
Facebook.
We're investing heavily in this area, and this quarter, we launched a number of efforts to improve the quality and
relevance of our ads, including our new ads preferences tool, interest-based advertising, and improvements in News
Feed designed to reduce low-quality content.
In some countries, our surveys indicate that our ads are getting close to the quality level of organic content. But in most
developed countries, we still have a lot to do. We expect to continue focusing on this for a long time.
So that's my update on how we've been executing over the last quarter. It's been a quarter with good performance and
continued momentum. So, I want to thank everyone who works at Facebook and is part of our community, including
our shareholders and partners. Because of your efforts, we're continuing to make progress towards our mission to help
connect the world, and we're improving hundreds of millions of people's lives every day. I'm grateful for your support
and to have the chance to work with all of you.

Thanks, and now here's Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. As Mark said, we had a strong second quarter. Ad revenue grew 67% year-over-year
to more than $2.6 billion. Mobile ad revenue grew 151% year-over-year and now makes up 62% of our ad revenue.
We continue to focus on three key areas in investment: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of
marketers using Facebook; and building our ad products. These investments continue to generate broad-based growth.
All geographies and all marketer segments performed well this quarter.
Our team has a really strong belief in what we're building; the world's first ad platform that delivers personalized
marketing at scale. But we believe it's still early days. We're pleased with the progress we're making, and I want to join
Mark in congratulating our global teams on their continued execution.
Today, I'm going to focus on two of our key marketer segments; small business and brand marketers, as well as cover
some of the investments we're making on the product and Ad:tech front.
We believe that personalized marketing at scale can drive results for all types of marketers. Just a few weeks ago, I was
in India and I hosted our first India SMB Roundtable. One of the entrepreneurs I met, Vivek Prabhakar, sold his house
just a few years ago to raise the money to start his and his wife's stream business, Chumbak, a company that makes
India-inspired products.
Facebook is Chumbak's leading marketing channel and is responsible for 35% of online revenue and 38% of their
website traffic. Their Facebook ads deliver a 5x return on advertising spend and have helped the company grow to
more than 150 employees in three offices.
We have more than 30 million active small business pages, and over 19 million of these are active on mobile. We think
we have a big opportunity to help SMBs like Chumbak grow their businesses, and I'm pleased to announce today that
we have over 1.5 million active advertisers. We're also ramping up our engagement with this community.
In the U.S., we're hosting Facebook Fit workshops in cities like New York, Chicago and Miami to help small
businesses. And we're doing this globally, including forming our first European SMB Council.
We're also making great strides in our work with larger brands to increasingly recognize how our scale, targeting and
measurement capabilities can drive great results. For example, P&G's Gillette worked with us and agencies, IBS and
MediaCom to launch its Vector 3 Razor to men in India. 80% of the 100 million Facebook users in India are on mobile,
and a majority of these are using feature phones. This was our first feature phone-only Facebook campaign in Asia. It
reached 60% of Gillette's target audience and generated significant lift in both message and ad recall.
As we work with brand marketers around the world, we focus on how they can leverage our technology platform to
build their brands to create a storytelling. We saw many great examples of this at the recent Cannes Lions Festival. We
were excited that campaigns that make Facebook a key part of their effort took home prestigious awards.
The World Cup also provided a great opportunity for brand-building on Facebook. Facebook was an important part of
this global event, with 350 million people joining the conversation, generating 3 billion interactions. The final was the
single most talked-about sporting event in Facebook history, generating 280 million interactions from 88 million
people; brands such as Visa, Nike, Ford, and McDonald's capitalized on this global conversation.
McDonald's worked with agencies, OMD, Framestore and ARC sponsorship, as well as Facebook's Creative Shop, to
produce 30 videos that used French Fries as players. FryFutbol recreated the most spectacular World Cup moments and
ran it as videos the very next day, with the French Fries acting as the players. This campaign reached 125 million
people in 158 countries.

We also remain committed to investing in products development to drive higher returns for all of our marketers. Our
Custom Audiences' capabilities which enable better targeting are being adopted quickly, and are now being used by 91
of the Ad Age 100.
Earlier this year, we launched website Custom Audiences, which enable marketers to target recent visitors to their
websites. This is likely targeting, but it's even more effective because it works across both web and mobile. We're
pleased with the early reaction from marketers.
We also introduced premium auto-play video ads this year. Video on Facebook helps brands extend their TV
investments by combining traditional reach-focus campaigns with our unparalleled targeting abilities.
Today, we run about a dozen campaigns, and the early data show promising results. We'll continue to roll this product
out slowly and carefully. Similarly, we're seeing positive early demand from marketers for ads on Instagram, and we're
rolling these ads out carefully as well.
In all of this, we remain focused on the transition to mobile. Our recently launched Audience Network lets advertisers
use Facebook targeting, while extending their campaigns beyond Facebook. This can improve the relevance of ads
people see both on and off Facebook, and we're encouraged by the early response.
Finally, earlier this summer, we announced the acquisition of LiveRail, a leading online video advertising platform that
enables customers like MLB.com and A&E Networks to monetize their video inventory efficiently. We have a lot to do
here; but with LiveRail, we're investing in tools that can improve the relevance of video ads across the web.
In summary, we're pleased with our performance and the progress we're making. We're the first platform that can
deliver personalized marketing at scale, and marketers are increasingly recognizing the great results we can drive for
them. Staying focused and executing will remain a major theme for us moving forward. Our teams know that our future
success depends upon our continued execution, and our plan is to stay focused.
Thanks. And now here's Dave.
David M. Wehner
Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us across our key operating and financial
metrics. We generated strong revenue growth and operating margins, and delivered $872 million of free cash flow. And
we continued to make investments to drive our core business as well as to support our long-term strategic priorities.
Let's start with a review of our network. We are executing well on our ongoing mission to connect everyone. 829
million people use Facebook on an average day in June, up 130 million from a year ago. This represents 63% of the
1.32 billion people that use Facebook during June.
Mobile continues to be a strong driver of our growth, with over 1 billion people using Facebook monthly on mobile. At
the same time, we're enabling more ways for people to connect and share beyond the core Facebook app. For instance,
both Instagram and Messenger have each passed over 200 million MAU and continue to grow nicely.
Turning now to the financials; total revenue in the second quarter was $2.9 billion, up 61% or 59% on a constant
currency basis. Total ad revenue was $2.7 billion, up 67% or 65% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue growth was
strong around the world, with each of our four geographic regions growing by over 60%. Mobile ad revenue was
approximately $1.66 billion or 62% of ad revenue compared to approximately $660 million or 41% of ad revenue last
year. Desktop ad revenue was up 8% year-over-year.
In Q2, the average effective price per ad increased 123% compared to last year, while total ad impressions declined
25%. The decrease in ad impressions continues to be driven by the shift towards mobile usage, where people are shown
fewer ads compared to desktop. The increase in the average price per ad was primarily driven by an increase in the
percentage of our ads being served in News Feed. The price volume trends were generally consistent across all four
reported geographic regions.

Total payments and other fees revenue was $234 million, up 9% versus last year. As we have noted in the past, we
believe the more meaningful comparison that better reflects the organic growth rate of the payments business comes
from looking at payments volume from games specifically, which was up 1% in Q2 versus last year.
Our current games payment revenue comes entirely from desktop usage, and we are seeing declines in the number of
people using Facebook on desktop, a trend that will make growing this business challenging going forward.
Turning now to expenses; our Q2 GAAP expenses were $1.5 billion, up 22%, and our non-GAAP expenses were $1.2
billion, up 18%. Note that cost of revenue grew 2% on a GAAP basis and 1% on a non-GAAP basis, mainly driven by
unusually high expenses in 2013 related to the transition of certain lease data centers. This flatness in cost of revenue
was the primary reason, overall expenses grew relatively slowly.
Operating expenses, excluding cost of revenue grew 33% on a GAAP basis and 31% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended
Q2 with 7,185 employees, up 36% from last year.
Our Q2 GAAP operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 48% operating margin, up from 31% last year, and
our non-GAAP operating income was $1.7 billion, representing a 59% non-GAAP operating margin, up from 44% last
year.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 43% and 36%, respectively. GAAP net income was $791 million or $0.30
per share, and non-GAAP net income was $1.1 billion or $0.42 per share.
In Q2, we spent $469 million on CapEx and generated $872 million of free cash flow. We ended Q2 with
approximately $14 billion in cash and investments. This excludes the impact of the Oculus acquisition, which was
closed earlier this week and included an approximately $400 million cash payment.
Now looking forward, let me start by noting that the forward-looking comments I'll share today for 2014, include the
impact from the recently closed acquisition of Oculus, but exclude except where otherwise noted, the impact from
WhatsApp, which we continue to expect will close later this year.
In terms of expenses, we expect that our total 2014 GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue and stock compensation,
will likely grow in the neighborhood of 30% to 35%, and that our total non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue,
but excluding stock compensation, will grow at a similar rate. These rates are slightly lower than our prior expectations
due to efficiencies in areas like cost of revenue and G&A. However, we believe that we are still in the early days of
building out all of the services to maximize Facebook's impact on the world, and we intend to continue to invest
aggressively in people, products and infrastructure in the second half of 2014 and beyond.
Though it is premature to give a specific outlook for 2015 expenses, I wanted to note that we expect significant
stock-based compensation and amortization expenses as well as substantial incremental operating costs related to the
acquisitions of Oculus and WhatsApp. These will add to our overall expenses in 2015 and subsequent periods. These
costs will be incremental to core Facebook expenses, which will continue to grow significantly in 2015 as we ramp
investments in people, products, and infrastructure.
For taxes, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP rates for the rest of 2014 to be similar to our Q2 rates, although these could
vary widely depending on our international revenue and expense mix and other factors, most notably the impact from
acquisitions, including the expected closing of WhatsApp later this year.
We continue to anticipate that 2014 CapEx will be approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We expect shares
outstanding to grow from around $2.6 billion at the end of 2013 to approximately $2.9 billion at the end of 2014, again
assuming WhatsApp closes by the end of the year.
Turning last to revenue; as we saw in Q2, our year-over-year growth rate declined from 72% in Q1 to 61% in Q2 or
59% on a constant currency basis. This is consistent with our comments on the Q1 call when we indicated that over the
course of 2014, the year-over-year growth rates in revenue would decline meaningfully as the comps became more
difficult. We expect this trend to continue over the course of the second half of the year.

While we are excited about the long-term potential of our ads initiatives like Instagram, auto-play video, and the
Audience Network, we are still in the early days of building these businesses and expect their revenue contribution to
remain small in the near-term.
We remain optimistic as ever about the long-term opportunity to grow revenue by improving the quality and relevance
of our ads and increasing the value we bring to marketers through our products, tools, and technologies.
In summary, we're very pleased with our overall performance in Q2, and in particular, the continued growth of our
mobile audience, the strength of our ads business, and the investments we're making to build long-term shareholder
value.
With that, Jay, let's open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
We will now open the lines for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from
the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please go ahead.
<A - Deborah Crawford>: Should we go to next question?
Operator
Next, we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. We have our question from Eric Sheridan. Your
line is open. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Sorry about that. I don't know if you've heard the question but, Sheryl, one on sort of
Audience Network and LiveRail. Maybe you can just give us a little better sense of the depth of the conversations with
advertisers, and what that might do for the platform longer-term 2014 and beyond, in terms of broadening out
Facebook's advertising effort. And second question, Dave, on the Oculus and WhatsApp, is there any way to get a
sense of employee count at the companies, or the pressure that we might see from OpEx going forward? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, I'll start. One of the goals we have, we talk about in all of these calls, is to make ads
more relevant for people and marketers. And increasingly with the Audience Network, we have a goal to do that for
publishers as well. Video is really important, it's one of the fastest-growing ad mediums out there on both desktop and
mobile, so LiveRail has a leading online video advertising platform, and we think we can use it to effectively expand
video ads to marketers and to publishers outside of Facebook, and offer greater audience-reaching ability to sell to
video advertisers.
When you look at the Audience Network, we're still in really early days and we only have some publishers in our
network, but we see this as an opportunity to provide greater reach for Facebook marketers and developers, again to
improve the relevance of the ads people see both on and off Facebook.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Thanks, Eric. On Oculus and WhatsApp, we're very much in investment mode on our
overall business, and we expect to continue to ramp investments in the core business through 2015.
And like I said, we'll be layering on top of that costs related to Oculus and WhatsApp. But we're not getting into more
specifics on the exact headcounts on those, but we believe those are significant opportunities in the long run and so
we're going to be investing aggressively accordingly.

Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thanks again for the question. Two quick questions for me. First would just be, if
you could share with us any qualitative commentary about the breadth of mobile ad revenue. There's always a lot of
debate back and forth about how big mobile app installs are, and if there's anything you could share with us about, how
the breadth of these – the breadth of mobile has kind of been changing over the last year or so?
And then the follow-up question would just be related to how your conversations with advertisers are changing. As
people start to think collectively about their TV and video budget together, I'm just wondering if you're starting to see
your conversations with the big TV advertisers start to change somewhat over the last six months or so? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, when you think about our mobile ads, and I'm really glad you asked this question, I do
think sometimes people think that mobile app install ads are all other revenue or a great majority of the revenue, and
they're not. They're only part of the mobile ads revenue.
Our mobile ads revenue is broad-based. We have large brand advertisers, small SMBs, direct response advertisers, as
well as developers, using our mobile ads. The mobile app install ads, which are run not only by developers, but also by
large companies that want to get people to install apps, are growing. They remain a good part of our mobile ads
revenue, and we're excited about the opportunities there. But we see our opportunities in mobile ads as much broader
than just installing apps.
To the second question, I do think one of the things that's happened in the last really year, year and a half on Facebook,
is people understanding how strong the creative opportunity is. We've built out the technology platform and made our
product investments, and we've really created, particularly with the move to mobile on our ads in News Feed, an
opportunity to do great creative storytelling. A great recent example is Progressive's Baby ads, if you've seen them.
They're really engaging and really fun, but they're making a really important point, which is, people should be buying
their own insurance. But the ability for them to do that ad is based on the technology we've created, and also the great
work they've done with Arnold Worldwide, their agency, on the creative part.
And so, I think for a long time, people have thought TV was for creative storytelling and online ads were for more
targeted [indiscernible] (27:45) results. And I think we're seeing that change, which means that the way people
approach TV, they'll also approach Facebook and are starting to, which makes those budgets work much better
together.

Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two things I wanted to ask. First, Mark, there's
been talk, I know it was on your blog, about testing a buy button within the platform, so I was hoping you could talk
about how important you think commerce is to Facebook going forward and then perhaps also payments as well.
And then secondly, Sheryl, you mentioned some of the major brands that advertised during the World Cup. Can you
talk about how you get the follow-through from those brands now that that major event has passed, and how you keep
those ad dollars on Facebook? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, on the buy button, we launched a small test in the U.S. only, which enables people to
hit a buy button, and on pages or in page post ads on Facebook. It streamlines the process of buying from our clients.
No one's buying from us, we're just streamlining the process of buying from our clients.
I think commerce is really important and is a growing important part of our business as our marketer segments are
growing, but I don't think people should confuse that with Facebook selling things directly. The more people buy
online, the more people buy things they discovered through their mobile phones, the more people discover things from
a News Feed and go on to purchase, the more important we are in driving e-commerce, and I think we are increasingly
important. That doesn't mean we're going to or have to sell products.

<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. And then I'd just add to that, because some of the question was about
payments, but we will clearly do work in payments to accept payments for advertising and on platform and other things
that we do. But just because we'll do that doesn't – we still basically view ourselves as a partner to other companies in
the payment space, rather than trying to compete directly for that. Our main business is advertising. And I think we're
mostly to the extent that we do payments, it's going to be supportive to that.
I wanted to make one more point just related to that, because I think some of the questions around payments are
connected to what we're planning on doing in the other apps outside of Facebook, right? So, things like Messenger and
WhatsApp over time, when that closes and Instagram. And I really do just want to emphasize that there's a lot of work
to set up the foundation for having a good business community and ecosystem in those that we think is going to be
years of work before those are huge businesses for us.
And I kind of, I liken where we are now on something like Messenger to where we were on Facebook in like 2006 or
2007, where it was primarily consumer products at the time where you really only communicated with friends. And a
bunch of people asked us and said that we should put ads in; but before we did that, we wanted to create really good
organic consumer experiences for people to interact with different entities. So, we created pages, so people could
interact with organic businesses. And then in order to make it that businesses and public figures and folks would create
pages, we offered Insights and different products and we gave all those things away for free.
Pages were free and continue to be free and that's partially why we have 30 million businesses today using pages on the
platform. And Insights, we kind of gave away for free in order to enable more folks to use pages. And only after we had
a good kind of organic interaction that people could and would want to interact with these different businesses and
entities, did we really layer ads on top of that and start to build the business that we have today.
So, I just think it's worth emphasizing this, because we've said in a number of comments that we think that some of
these newer initiatives are going to ramp over time. We really do mean that and we are serious about doing this the
right way and building up these ecosystems. And I think that for some of these other apps, we're just going to build all
the infrastructure that we need to make it be something that's scalable over time rather than trying to have this be an
impact that you'll notice in the next – I don't know, short-term period of time.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: To the World Cup part of your question, brands certainly used the World Cup and big
events like this to launch things that they continue those ad campaigns. They also have other big events that come along
as well as their own events around product launches. And so, we think obviously not every day is the World Cup, but
there are lots of opportunities throughout the year and through the product cycle to work with brand advertisers in big
ways.

Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. Thanks. I had one question for Mark on the product side and then one for Dave. Mark,
so App Links just launched. If you go out a few years, how much do you think something like deep linking could
increase engagement or ad effectiveness for Facebook? And for those 1 billion links that you have up and running
already, what are you seeing in those early tests?
And then, Dave, we know you don't break out the price versus volume metrics for mobile, but just directionally, could
you give us some color on how the ad impression growth in mobile compares with the 31% MAU growth in mobile?
Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Sure. So, I don't have much color that's useful to share here on App Links. It's still
early. People have marked up a bunch of apps with this metadata that allows us to search for it. But search for
Facebook is going to be a multi-year voyage. And there's just so much content that is unique to the Facebook
ecosystem that you – we can answer questions for you that really no other service can. I mean, just like the other day, I

was curious about finding out which of a person – which of one of my friends like worked at a company. And it's like I
don't know any other service where you can just go do that query but on Facebook you can.
And the secret to this is going to be basically just over a long period of time indexing all of the different content that's
on Facebook in every different way. So, we started off with people. There's obviously a need to be able to find people
in order to use the product and add friends and just have our core kind of ecosystem work. But we're indexing more of
the connections and now we're getting into more of the content and it's a huge amount of content. I think there's more
than a trillion posts, which some of the search engineers on the team like to remind me is bigger than any web search
corpus that's out there.
But that's just kind of a one part of the data and we're going to keep on doing more and more. We're going to start off
focusing on stuff that's unique to Facebook that you couldn't really answer those questions elsewhere.
App Links by definition of being outside of Facebook are not going to be unique to Facebook. So, we'll get to that over
time. I think it'll be a valuable part of the ecosystem. But honestly, we're mostly interested in that to enable value for
other developers and pushing distribution to them than we are for our own search.
It's going to enable interesting ways for a developer to be able to make it so that people and their apps can share content
on Facebook and then link directly to the right part of the app. It enables some engagement ads, so that way a developer
can say, a person was using my app and they were going to buy something but they dropped out of the check-out flow,
so now I'm going to have an ad that helps them link right back to the check-out flow, so that they can complete their
conversion and you want deep linking to be able to enable things like that, but it's going to take a while for this to play
out in search.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Yeah. And, Ross, on your question on mobile ads – mobile DAU is ramping nicely, 39%
growth and we're seeing it grow nicely across all of our geographic regions. Of course, mobile ads are ramping as well.
In terms of pricing, we don't break it out but on the reported pricing trend, as I think I made clear, the 123% increase in
price was driven by mix shift with a higher percentage of News Feed ads. And News Feed ads are really effective for
marketers and that includes mobile News Feed ads as well. They deliver a lot of value for marketers. That's why they're
getting a higher price in the auction, [indiscernible] (36:20) really correlates to the value that they create and we
continue to focus on making those ad units better and better – more relevant and targeted for the people who use
Facebook as well as for marketers. And we're seeing good results. Marketers are getting good ROIs and they're coming
back and spending more with us. So, we're pleased about all of that.

Your next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. I'd like to follow-up a little bit on the ad pricing. Obviously up 123%. Sheryl, maybe you can
comment a little bit about the organic growth – like-for-like ads there? And do you see opportunities to continue to see
nice pricing growth as you look out the next couple years? And then as you think about the new ads formats – video
and other things, would you think that could continue to drive pricing higher meaning new ad formats could drive even
more value than the existing ads that you have on Facebook? Thank you.
<A - David M. Wehner>: Hey, Justin. It's Dave. Yeah. Just following up on that, in terms of the pricing, as I said, it's
really about the mix shift towards the News Feed. News Feed ads is what's driving the overall reported pricing trends,
but we are focused on making our ads all better and driving better returns for our marketers and we see that reflected in
the price.
There's other things, for instance, we're making our right hand column ads more effective by changing the format of
those. Those will be higher value to our marketers, because they'll drive more engagement, but there'll be fewer of
them, so that will impact pricing.

Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. Two questions please. Anything you could share with us regards to China and
efforts to develop more of a presence there? And then maybe a follow-up question on David Marcus coming over and
it's something with a huge payments background running the messaging product. It's kind of like hiring signing a messy
up to the Miami Heat, like it's a little bit of an odd transition. Are we looking at it wrong? Is there any particular reason
why he wouldn't be more focused on payments? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So, I'll talk about China. Our mission is to enable everyone in the world to share and
connect. And so, we've been studying and learning about China for a number of years and we remain very interested.
We are seeing Chinese-based companies use Facebook to reach a global audience and we think we have an important
opportunity just with their export market and we're focused on that for now.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. And on Messenger and David, I think he's just a real talented product
generalist. He's done a number of different things including in the past, he ran and built a messaging company. Most
recently, clearly, he ran a very important company and I think was pretty successful in helping get really good results
there. Messenger will have over time – there will be some overlap between that and payments, but I guess, what I'm
just trying to say is two things.
One is that the payments piece will be a part of what will help drive the overall success and help people share with each
other and interact with businesses, but we're really focused on the interactions overall rather than the mechanisms; and
David shares that view.
And the second thing is just that there's so much groundwork that we need to do in order to make it, so that people are
communicating with businesses and public figures and entities in these other apps that we're building, which is part of
the business ecosystem.
And I really can't underscore this enough that we have a lot of work to do and we could take the cheap and easy
approach and just try to put ads in or do payments and make some money in the short-term, but we're not going to do
that.
So to the extent that any of your models or anything reflects that, we might be doing that; I would strongly encourage
you to adjust that because we're not going to and we're going to take the time to do this in the way that we think that's
going to be right over multiple years.

Our next question comes from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Neil A. Doshi>: Great. Thanks, guys. Sheryl, I think attribution could be a very big opportunity, especially for
local businesses to help them realize ROI, people going from online to offline; with 30 million businesses now on
Facebook, how are you helping those businesses realize the online to offline conversion through Facebook in order to
drive more dollars going to local businesses? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: I agree strongly that this is a huge opportunity. Our goal with all of our clients from the
biggest to the smallest is to drive their business results, and that's usually selling a product, sometimes online but often
in stores. We've done a lot of work over the last year or two on measurement. We talk about measurement in all of
these calls and that's because investing in measurement and connecting not just from online to online, but online to
offline is super important, because if we can prove those results to our marketers, large and small, they'll continue to
invest.
We think we have a real advantage here, that we have real identity. We have real identity across the desktop and across
mobile. And we have found ways, and very privacy protective ways, to work with third parties, third-party users of data
to connect offline and on – offline sales to online ads, and those investments remain a very big focus for us.

Your next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore. Your line is open.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Thanks. So, you mentioned over a billion users, 80% of app developers use the Facebook login on
iOS and Android. When we think about Facebook as a platform, can you provide any stats on the number of developers
who are starting to build their experience on Facebook? And then how integrated do they need to be to see things like
app linking, native formats, auto-play video or other? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: So, we've shifted to this model on mobile, where developers aren't really building
their apps inside Facebook, right? So, we're not an operating system. We had a little bit more of this dynamic with
candidates on desktop, but now we've shifted the strategy to helping developers with three things; build, grow, and
monetize their apps. And we have a number of services that developers can plug into their apps to help out with all
three of those.
So for example, we have – when we're helping people build their app, we do things like login, and when we have
services like Parse that help developers build apps more easily, that stuff is all great for helping folks build social apps
in a way that's faster than they could have otherwise.
In terms of growth, I mean we offer tools like sharing and messaging that people can enable – or a developer can
enable their users to be able to organically spread the app. We also have things like app installs and engagement ads to
make it so that developers can pay to increase that.
And then on the monetize side, we are rolling out the Audience Network and then I guess on Canvas we have things
like payments to help developers monetize, and that's an increasing focus as well.
And Audience Network is new and it's getting started. So, again, it's one of these things that will be pretty slow for a
while, because we really want to do it right, but that's going to be an important part of this as well.
So, I think that's kind of how you want to think about developers. And right now, we're really proud of that 80% of the
top developers see value in touching a part of our platform. We obviously want to get the last 20%, but we're excited
about the progress so far.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: And in terms of those developers using our different ad products, as we say, we rollout
slowly, and slowly usually means we pick a handful of advertisers to work with. That's certainly what we've been doing
on auto-play video ads, but [indiscernible] (45:27) our goal is to make our ad products available to all of our marketer
segments and that's what we'll work on. So over the long run, any developer, any small or large business, whether

Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with SIG. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian T. Nowak>: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the video ads. You mentioned
it's the early days on video advertising and – just wondering, if you could talk to some of your early learnings and what
you're pleased with. And where you see areas for improvement? And which metrics you're engaging to kind of
determine when to undergo a broader rollout?
And then secondly, I think you mentioned a larger higher quality right rail desktop ads. There's been some changes in
experimentation around the inventory. How has the advertiser receptivity been to those ad units compared to the old
right rail? And where are those dollars coming from? Is that new dollars to the platform? Or are they shifting from old
sponsored stories or old right rail? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: So, I'll talk about video and then Sheryl can turn on the right-hand column. The
biggest thing that we want to make sure is that quality is really good as we roll this out. And that's going to be the same
on all of these different initiatives. And one of the reasons why we're optimistic about video ad is – sorry in auto-play
specifically as a format for both organic and paid content is that you're scrolling through feed and if the content catches
your eye and you like it, then it's playing and it's loaded and you can just easily continue watching it or otherwise the
person has complete control and if they don't like it, they can just keep on going through it. So, the content has to be
really good and we think that that's going to be a really high quality experience.
There's still a number of things that we really want to prove and make sure that we're doing well here. We want to
make sure that when people see an auto-play video that's not only paid content we want a lot of that to be organic
content as well. So, we're trying to ramp up the amount of good public content and content that people share at the
same time as we're ramping up on the auto-play video ads.
We also want to make sure that this doesn't consume a lot of people's data. So, we're just being really careful about how
we handle that and getting that really right across different markets, that's going to be a different thing that we want to
be really sensitive to.
So, it really just – in a word, this all comes down to quality and we're more focused on just making sure this is the right
and best thing over time than something in the near-term. And that I think is a theme of a lot of the areas that we've
talked about, whether it's the new apps that we're building, things like Messenger or Instagram and what we're doing
there or things like Audience Network which we just announced or video ads.
There's just a lot of things that we're super excited about and we obviously will talk about them publicly, because we're
working with partners and we're excited to talk about them here as well, because we do really think that these are going
to be great things to help build businesses over time. But we want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves,
because these things are early and quality is the most important thing for growing this the right way over time.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On the right-hand column redesign, the redesign was driven by making the ads more
consistent with News Feed, which results in fewer but larger ads. [indiscernible] (48:42) from any one place, and I
think when you think about Facebook's growing part in the ad ecosystem, you really have to think about ad dollars
shifting online as the majority of the driver of budget shifting and ad dollars coming on to mobile. We are pleased that
we see higher engagement rates from the people that were shown the new ads compared to the old, which makes us
optimistic that these are more valuable.

<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great. Thanks for the question. Maybe a question in different direction regarding privacy and
maybe you could just walk us through your current thoughts. The reason I ask is, because Facebook recently introduced
the Anonymous Login product at f8 this year, and new services like save or hidden from friends unless users
specifically opt in. Can you just give us a sense of this kind of a change of strategic shift in thinking or tone with
regards to privacy? Thanks so much.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: It's a really important question. I think something that's misunderstood about
Facebook. One of the things that we focused on the most is creating private spaces for people to share things and have
interactions that they couldn't have had elsewhere. So, if you go back to the very beginning of Facebook, rewind 10
years, I mean there were blogs and things where you could be completely public and there were e-mails, right? So, you
could circulate something completely privately. But there was no space where you could share with just your friends,
right? I mean it wasn't a completely private experience, but it's not completely public and it's 100 or 150 of the people
that you care about.
And creating that space which was a space that had the kind of privacy that no one had ever seen before was what
enabled and continues to enable the kind of interactions and the content that people feel comfortable sharing in this
network that don't exist in other places in the world.
So, we're constantly looking for new opportunities to create new dynamics like that and open up new different private
spaces for people where they can then feel comfortable sharing and having the freedom to express things that you
otherwise wouldn't be able to. It's one of the reasons why I'm personally so excited about messaging, because like right
now I think at some level there are only so many photos that you're going to want to share with all of your friends. I
mean we still think that there's more to do there.
But like the amount of messaging and how quickly we see that growing is crazy, because like there's just a lot more that
people want to express and that they need the tools to express with smaller groups of people, not just one person at a
time, but smaller groups as well.
Things like Anonymous Login totally unlock different behaviors, right? How many times do you want to sign into an
app, but you don't necessarily want to share a lot of information with that app. But if you can do it anonymously we
think that's going to unlock a lot of different interactions and experiences that people want to have.
So, we view our job as like very fundamentally providing people with these spaces and tools, which I think is very
different from how a lot of people think about what Facebook is. But it's an important thing to think about how we do
our product development.

curious what you are seeing in terms of the ad load threshold? So, you're at the point now where the relevancy and
quality of ads means that you can tick that up perhaps a little bit?

generation of computing platforms. When mobile was getting defined, we were basically just getting founded, right? I
mean 2004, the first smartphone came out in 2003 and we've mostly been a company that has played on top of the
different mobile foundations that other companies have built.
And one of the things that I care really deeply about on kind of a 10-year arc for the company is having a different
relationship to whatever the next set of computing platforms are and investing accordingly now to make sure that when
the next set of computing platforms get defined, we can help define what the next generation of computing is going to
be.
So, I think virtual reality, augmented reality, vision, some of the AI work that we're doing is all going to play into this
in an important way. And I just think, while I was emphasizing that we're early on some of those businesses and we're
not going to rush those, the flip side of the coin is to emphasize that we're also going to spend a lot and invest very
heavily in a bunch of these things to do it right over the long term.
And so I think, Dave pointed out that we expect to continue investing heavily and that our cost will increase. And I just
want to underscore that as well, because I expect that's going to continue to be true. And it's not that we're necessarily
going to go out and have a lot more new strategic priorities, but we expect to go very deep on the priorities that we
have to make sure that we completely nail them all whether it's a 5-year or a 10-year timeframe.
<A - Deborah Crawford>: Operator, I think, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Your last question will come from Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Thanks for taking my question. Mark, you talked about a focus on public content. Does that
include a focus on exclusive content and should we expect that you'll pay for or have revenue shared agreements for
exclusive content with some key public figures?
Then separately, on search, I think you still have quite a large team working on improving search; but from our vantage
point, we haven't seen many changes since the original data graph as part of launch. So, when should we expect to see
those improvements? And how would you rank search in terms of your priorities?
And finally just a quick housekeeping question, Dave, has the D&A continued to trend down over the past few
quarters. Why is that happening and should we expect that to continue? Thanks.
<A - David M. Wehner>: I can take the D&A question first, if you'd like. So, ultimately depreciation is going to track
more closely against the CapEx, so in the first half of the year, we've been aggressively investing in the things we want
to invest in. That includes infrastructure, so CapEx is up 40% in the first half of the year.

There are some investments that we're making notably in the Iowa data center also the new headquarters we're building
where those facilities have not gone into service, so they're not hitting depreciation yet. So, we're making the big
investments in CapEx that will ultimately flow through in depreciation. So, I think, in short, the answer to your
question is, we'll see depreciation come up as those things come online.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: And I guess I can answer the others. So, on public content, we actually do get a lot of
exclusive content. We don't pay for it, but so this week for example, I think, Shakira hit her 100 million fans moment
on Facebook and part of the reason why some of these public figures and political leaders and folks have such big
following is because they're constantly providing insight into their lives and unique types of content that other folks
that you can't get anywhere else.
And there's a format that I think makes sense for Facebook. You're not going to come to Facebook to watch a movie or
watch a whole TV show. That's really long form stuff. But in the mode that we have today in our service that kind of
attracts and is the best place for a number of types of content like this that we're starting to see that we get.
So, we're mostly focused on driving success for partners, whether they're news organizations that are publishing
content that people share or public figures and individuals who are engaging directly on Facebook. Our view is that the
more success in distribution and engagement we can drive for them, the better the content and the quality that they're
going to invest in and build in for Facebook.
And tied to search, I think the – I mentioned in my opening remarks that this quarter I think for the first time we are
over on average 1 billion searches a day, which is awesome and it's something that we're really proud of and have
worked a lot on, especially given that we've generally found that people search a little bit less on average on mobile.
So, we went through a period where in order to have that increase we had to do some really good work and make it a
lot faster and improve ranking and do a lot of the basic things that needed to get done. There's just so much more
content that needs to get indexed.
If you want to go find that Shakira video that I was just talking about, I don't know if today the product fully delivers
on that, but we will soon and in the next six months we're going to be able to do that and then if we do well and then a
year later we're going to have more content in the system and be able to index that better.
So, it's an ongoing thing. There's huge potential. There are a lot of questions that only Facebook can answer that the
other services aren't going to be able to answer for you. We're really committed to investing in that and building out
this unique service over the long-term.
And I think at some point, there's going to be an inflection where it starts to be useful for a lot of use cases. But there
may still be years away, but we're just committed to doing this investment and then making this right.
