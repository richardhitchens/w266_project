MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Well, good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Oracle Corporation Quarterly Conference Call. Today's
conference is being recorded.
And now I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations for Oracle. Please go ahead, Mr.
Bond.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Chelsea. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision of these
forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few
prepared remarks.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone.
As you can see, we've made some significant changes in our financial reporting and in our guidance to match our
company's fundamental transition. We are now firmly into the transition to the Cloud and though we had previously
disclosed our SaaS revenues in the 10-Ks and Qs, as the Cloud revenue has become larger and more significant, we've
gone ahead and disclosed them on the face of our income statement.
You may want to actually take out your income statement as we go through this just so that you can follow me. What
we previously reported as new software license and Cloud subscription is now reported on two separate lines, new
software license and another line for Cloud software-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service, SaaS and PaaS. At this
time the bulk of the revenue is software-as-a-service, but we expect platform-as-a-service to become very important as
we do the full launch of platform-as-a-service this fall.
Also, we previously reported in service – what we previously reported in Services is now reported on two separate
lines: Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, IaaS and Services.
We have summed new software license, SaaS and PaaS, IaaS, and software license updates and product support as a
total called Software and Cloud revenues. Our Services line now includes consulting, advanced customer support
services and education. The expense lines were also broken out in more detail where appropriate.
So to start, I'm going to go over the Q4 results with our new details and then sum it up using our old disclosure for
comparability to my previous guidance. Then I will move on to the guidance for Q1. Generally, I will be using
non-GAAP measures in constant currency unless otherwise stated but will point out GAAP numbers or U.S. dollar
growth rates when the difference is important for comparability to last year.
So using our new reporting, Software and Cloud revenue totaled a record $8.9 billion in Q4, growing 4%. New
Software License was $3.8 billion, flat in U.S. dollars, declining 1% in constant currency while new software license
application revenues were up 6%.
Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS were $327 million growing 23%. Cloud infrastructure-as-a-service was $128 million growing
13%. Software license updates and product support was $4.7 billion, growing 6% in constant currency and 7% in U.S.
dollars. Software supported cash and renewal rates were strong as usual. To most closely compare these numbers to my
guidance last earnings call, new software license and Cloud SaaS and PaaS added together were $4.1 billion, up 1% in
constant currency, and 2% in U.S. dollars.
With our new presentation, you can see that our on-premise-based software business, which is new software license
and software license updates and product support, has steadily grown over time to $8.5 billion this quarter. On top of
that, we are building our SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS Cloud business which grew nearly 20% and is already approaching a $2
billion run rate with $455 million in revenue this quarter.
Hardware System revenue was nearly $1.5 billion growing 3% on a GAAP basis and 2% on a non-GAAP basis.
Hardware product were $870 million growing 3% and hardware support was nearly $600 million growing 2%.
Engineered Systems had another good quarter with double-digit growth and represents one-third of hardware product
sales. In addition we saw very strong growth in NAS storage in the quarter.

Hardware product gross margins were 49%, down about two points from last year as we continue to put more value in
our product without raising prices thus grabbing significant market share as all our major competitors shrink. Keep in
mind that as we've increased hardware support attach rate hardware support margins have steadily improved and total
hardware systems margins are unchanged from last year at 56%.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $11.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Operating income was $5.8
billion, up 2% in constant currency, 3% in U.S. dollars, operating margin was 51%, same as last year.
Unlike new software license transactions where we recognize the revenue up front, we recognize the revenue from
Cloud software over time. In the short term, in the short run, it delays revenue, but over the medium and long term, we
can expect more revenues as we do more of the work for our customers while our customers can expect to pay
substantially less in total with savings in the form of large reductions in the cost of implementing and running their own
systems. Over time, this contributes to our business model, particularly given our differentiated product in each of
SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.
As we get to the operating income line, I want to remind you that our GAAP operating income last year benefited from
a $269 million reduction in the purchase price of an acquisition. This was entirely excluded from a non-GAAP purpose,
but did show up in our GAAP, in the GAAP numbers which flow all the way through.
In addition, both on GAAP and non-GAAP results, include another foreign-currency loss this quarter. This time for
$102 million from the devaluation of our Venezuelan net assets compared to the dollar. This of course was not included
in my guidance last quarter. Our net asset value in Venezuela have now devalued so much that it will not have any
meaningful impact on our numbers going forward. Were it not for the Venezuela currency loss, EPS would've been
$0.02 higher.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The GAAP tax rate was 20.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were
$0.92, up from $0.87 last year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, unchanged because last year our GAAP EPS was
helped by the $0.04 reduction in the purchase price for the acquisition I just mentioned.
So I want to make sure I said that correctly so you understand what happened; we got a $0.04 benefit last year in our
GAAP EPS. This year, we obviously don't have that benefit and without that benefit it would've been $0.76, not $0.80.
Operating cash flow increased $14.9 billion and free cash flow grew to $14.3 billion over the last four quarters. Both
are record Q4 results. For the fiscal year 2014, total Software and Cloud revenues totaled a record $29.2 billion,
growing 5% in constant currency. New software license was $9.4 billion, up 1%. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.1
billion, growing 20% non-GAAP and 24% GAAP. Cloud Infrastructure as a Service was $456 million, growing 1%.
Software support was $18.2 billion, growing 7%. Hardware system revenue was nearly $5.4 billion, growing 2%. Of
that, hardware products were $3 billion, down 1% for the year, and hardware support was $2.4 billion, growing 5% for
the year. Services revenue was $3.7 billion, declining 4% as a result of the continuing move of our consulting business
to shorter, faster, cheaper engagements for our customers as they move to the Cloud.
Total revenue grew 4% to a record $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 47%. Earnings
per share were $2.87, growing 8%. We've successfully grown the company's revenues and earnings through every
transition, whether it was mini computer database to a complete suite of products, client/server to Internet, commodity
hardware to engineered systems and now on-premise to Cloud. We are well on our way into our most recent transition.
We have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is more than $14 billion.
Deferred revenue now stands at $7.3 billion, up 2% from last year. In Q4 we repurchased more than 49 million shares
for a total of $2 billion and for the full year, we repurchased nearly 281 million shares for a total of more than $9.8
billion. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share between dividends and buybacks.
This year we returned nearly $12 billion or more than 80% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.
Now let's move to the guidance. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes new
software license, software support, SaaS and PaaS and IaaS is expected to grow 6% to 8% in U.S. dollars, 5% to 7% in
constant currency. SaaS and PaaS, one of the line items on a non-GAAP basis, is expected to grow 25% to 35% in U.S.

dollars, 24% to 34% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS on a GAAP basis is expected to grow 27% to 37% in U.S.
dollars, 26% to 36% in constant currency.
Now another one of the lines, Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, is expected to grow 10% to 20% in U.S.
dollars and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware Systems revenues on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which
includes Hardware Systems products and Hardware Systems support, is expected to be between -1% and +3% or -2%
to +2% in constant currency.
Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% to 5% in
constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.62 and $0.66 in U.S. dollars, $0.61 and
$0.65 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.49 and $0.53 in U.S. dollars and
$0.48 to $0.52 in constant currency. Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22% and a non-GAAP tax rate of
23.5%. Of course, it may end up being different.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Safra. Okay. Oracle is focused, focused like a laser on one goal over the next few years: becoming the
number one company in Cloud computing's two most profitable segments: software-as-a-service, SaaS; and
platform-as-a-service, PaaS.
We expect to become number one for three reasons. First, we have the most complete and modern portfolio of SaaS
products in the Cloud: CRM sales, CRM service, Marketing. In Human Capital Management [HCM], we have core
human resources, recruiting, talent management, and payroll. In ERP we have accounting, procurement, supply chain,
project management, and more, the most comprehensive suite of products in the Cloud by far.
Second, all of those SaaS applications run on the world's most powerful platform in the Cloud, the Oracle in-memory
multi-tenant database, and the world's most popular programming language, Java.
Third, we have dramatically expanded, specialized and lined up our sales forces to sell SaaS and PaaS subscriptions
against the new generation of Cloud software competitors. And it's working. As we enter our new fiscal year, we're
already number two in overall SaaS subscription sales. In FY 2015, our plan is to grow our SaaS bookings over 50%.
That will allow us to close in on the number one spot. We already have a huge lead over Workday in Cloud ERP. We
acquired 120 new Cloud ERP customers in Q4 alone. In HCM, we are dominating Workday in Europe. And beating
them in dozens of core HCM deals here in North America.
Mark can give you details and highlights regarding our Cloud wins and our great Q4 quarter in the Cloud. Mark?
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks, Larry. Let me just actually start with hardware a little bit. We're now roughly in the middle of transitioning our
Hardware business. Engineered Systems were our strategy. They're now a significant part of our Hardware and we've
grown Hardware for the second quarter in a row. The change in mix away from commodity hardware to high-value
Engineered Systems that transformed the business to an integrated Engineered Systems business that brings with it
extremely attractive annuity. Let me give you some facts about Hardware.
Engineered Systems grew to record levels in Q4 while our competitors, as Safra described, are declining. We will ship
our 10,000th Engineered System in Q1. We're at scale. Our Hardware Support margins are now approaching 70% and
this business is sticky. SPARC's SuperCluster bookings grew triple digits, Exalytics, Big Data clients and Oracle
database clients, all grew double digits. Oracle has become the hardware company taking share, growing, and doing it
profitably. And as I said we're in the middle the transition.

Now I'll talk about Cloud. We're actually just starting this transition. We're the only company that has a whole suite of
Cloud applications. We're Salesforce.com's primary competitors, Workdays' primary competitor and in the Cloud we're
many times the size of Workday. We're bigger than SAP. And we're going to pass Salesforce in the Cloud. Let me run a
few facts by you about our Cloud.
As the industry analysts build their waves and quadrants they need Cloud leaders in specific Cloud areas and Oracle
today is the leader across more Cloud solutions than Salesforce, Workday and SAP combined. Cloud bookings grew
37% last year. Q4 was the best ever for bookings. Fusion Cloud bookings growth were three times the overall growth
rate. Fusion ACM, ERP and salesforce automation revenue all grew triple digits.
We added 870 Cloud customers in Q4 including in HCM nearly 320 customers, with Fusion, 110 HCM customers. If I
take Workdays' reported number of 75 new customers, we're adding customers at 4 to 5 times the pace of Workday. In
customer experience we added 430 customers with 120 plus Fusion salesforce automation wins. With BlueKai now on
board along with Eloqua and Responys we are the clear number one in marketing automation with bookings growth of
200% this quarter. In salesforce automation bookings grew more than 80% and revenue was up triple digits. As Larry
referenced we added 120 ERP Cloud customers in the quarter, all Fusion.
In just Q4 we added more ERP Cloud customers than Workdays' total customer base for financial. More than 70
customer go lives just this quarter with hundreds already live. We're about to deliver release 9 of Fusion this summer.
With Fusion we have built the most attractive Cloud solution in the industry. We've acquired the most attractive SaaS
companies in the industry. We're already number one or number two in every SaaS category and we won't stop until
we're number one in every category. Just like Hardware where we focused on Engineered Systems, in Software we are
focused on the Cloud. We're executing, we're winning, and we're going to be number one.
And with that, we'll turn it over for questions.
Kenneth Bond
Before we go to questions, Chelsea, I want to call out that we understand that some of you may have had difficulty
hearing part of Mark's comments. So we will continue to move forward with the call and we will try to address some of
Mark's comments into the Q&A.
Chelsea, if you'd start the Q&A please?

Will do, Mr. Bond. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Safra, just on the revenue recognition changes, I'm just curious if you
could just walk through why now and I think you stated in the press release that you are seeing a shift to ratable
revenue recognition versus upfront and if you could maybe just talk through how long you think that will take to
accelerate the sales process to align to this new model?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Okay. So thanks for the question. Let me clarify my quote. Really, we have – we always
recognize SaaS and PaaS, Cloud subscriptions over time. That's always been the way we do it. New licenses, we
recognize up-front. We haven't changed any of our actual accounting. What's happened is that more of our software
revenues are coming in as SaaS subscriptions, which we recognize over time versus new license deals, which we
recognize up-front.
So we haven't actually changed any of our accounting, it's just that with our focus on Cloud and the fact that we're
selling more Cloud, we recognize that ratably over time as appropriate on that contract. And so a bigger piece of

Software and what we used to call Software and Cloud Subscription, new software license and cloud subscription, a
larger piece of it is recognized over time. Did I – did you understand me? Or should I try that again?
<Q - Brent Thill>: No, that's great. And I guess just from a go-to-market, for maybe Mark, just that process of putting
that in place, how long does that take to get the sales aligned to that process?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, as Safra was recognize – can you hear me okay now? I just want to make sure. I'm – I
have a different microphone. But when you hire a salesperson who's selling Cloud, they're really selling ARR, which is
annual recurring revenue. Roughly speaking, ARR is a third of a license. It's not precisely right, it differs a little bit by
solution, but it's roughly right. So therefore, it would take roughly three years for somebody to get to the same
productivity of what you would think of in the license model. So that's probably the timeframe you should be thinking
of, and as Larry...
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. Maybe. Look, there are two things. There's the rate in which – this is Larry. The
rate at which we recognize revenue, which of course, statutorily, whenever we sell a Cloud subscription, whether it's
platform-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, you always recognize the revenue ratably by
month, versus selling a license, you recognize it up front. That's the accounting.
The sales force is motivated by their commissions, and we've made it commission-neutral. In other words, the sales
force doesn't really care if they sell a license or if they sell a subscription. They get paid the same amount in either case.
So the sales force has – there's no time at all required for the sales force to transition to this new model. They get paid
equally for a cloud subscription or a license, so there's no transition time, zero.
What is different, what Safra was explaining, is that as our Cloud business gets bigger, and I think everybody wants our
Cloud business to get bigger, I certainly do; we actually make more money when we sell a Cloud subscription. We
break even – where a subscription is probably after three years, as Mark pointed out, we get about the same amount of
money from a subscription after three years as we get from a license, but these subscriptions last three, four, five, 10,
15, 20 years. So we make a lot more money on a subscription, but we recognize the money over time.
So as we make the transition to selling more cloud software services as opposed to up-front licenses, we'll recognize
the cloud revenue over time. And that eventually, that cloud revenue eventually will grow to be even bigger than our
license revenue, at least that's our plan, and we'll make more money doing that over time. But during the transition to
selling those cloud subscriptions, what would've been a license is now recognized over time.
So we're going to recognize the revenue more slowly, and that will somewhat affect the top line during the transition.
That's okay. Because in the long term we make much, much more money and we can effectively compete against this
whole new array of competitors, like Salesforce and Workday, versus the previous generation of competitors like SAP
and IBM.
<Q - Brent Thill>: It's very clear. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay.
Operator
We'll move on to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Hi. Thanks. This question is for Safra. Safra, you were able to keep the operating margins
flat at about 47% despite, among other things, a big 10% growth in sales and marketing in fiscal 2014. I just wanted to
ask you, as you look forward to fiscal 2015, do you think that pace of sales investments is likely to moderate? And how
comfortable are you with Oracle returning to year-over-year margin improvement in this fiscal 2015? Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, I actually expect us to continue to improve over time, to be honest with you. The one
thing that could maybe impact our margins negatively is if we are, like, outrageously successful with Cloud in the next
year or so, such that a lot of revenue comes in as Cloud even though I don't recognize it up front, and so we have

expenses – some expenses related to that, that are not matched by our other improvements in productivity in the rest of
the business.
Generally, I think we've got it very, very well balanced, and I actually expect our operating margins to improve because
we've made the big investments in the field already. In most regions, the big, big investments have gone in over the
past three years, and I don't expect them to continue to increase at that rate. Mark, Larry, do you want to comment
on...?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: No, I think what Safra says is right. We have gone through a sizable build-up based on the
strategy that we've described to you previously. We are still adding. We're not adding at the pace that we were adding.
So I think you should expect us – Larry talked about a pretty exciting opportunity for us in PaaS, we'll add salespeople
in the area of PaaS, and there'll be some complementary areas to the sales force that we've got, but you won't see the
size of increases that you've seen over the past two or three years.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: And it should be outweighed by revenue growth – and it should be outweighed by revenue
growth as well as profitability improvements in the rest of the business.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It is a reasonable point to bring up, because it sort of relates to that first question that came up,
that as our sales force now becomes more productive, particularly when you see Cloud bookings, Larry gave you a very
important statement about some thoughts about Cloud bookings in 2015. As those numbers turn from bookings into
revenue, that turns into a very attractive model as it relates to your first question about our operating margins.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Got it. Very helpful.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
Walter Pritchard with Citi has the next question.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Safra, I wondered if you could talk about, you gave guidance for license in the – three
months ago and you reported to the low end of that. I'm wondering if you could help people understand what the source
of the deviation was there. You did talk about, you're seeing more demand show up in SaaS. Was the total sort of
volume of demand that you saw from a software perspective, SaaS and traditional on-prem license in line with what
you were expecting at the midpoint, or was it at the low end? Just trying to calibrate versus what you guided, given all
the moving pieces.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: I think we're doing better in Cloud than we expected. That has become extremely, extremely
popular. And as a result, we have less of a growth in new license. We have a lot more in Cloud, but obviously I'm not
recognizing all that Cloud up front. In fact some of it, especially stuff that's actually booked in Q4, is not recognized at
all, and so it shows up later as you'll see, where I'm projecting Cloud growth in the high 20s to 30s in my guidance,
which is obviously a reflection of what's been going on. Cloud is doing extremely, extremely well and sometimes to the
extent the customers' alternative of course would have been to buy a license. And so that's what's doing it. I'm actually
thrilled that we are where we are in new license, considering how much Cloud growth we've got.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Great. Thank you.

remarkable job growing your earnings through this Cloud transition and investing in the sales force, which is something
that many large cap tech and many large cap software companies are not able to do. That speaks to the power of the
model. But my observation was that, Safra, I think you mentioned applications up about 6% or so, which is
commendable especially given the Cloud transition. But, any commentary on the technology side of the equation?
Would – did that come in, and how did that fare relative to your expectations, and how should we think about the 12c
cycle? Is the best of the 12c cycle yet to come, especially with the multi-tenant option and the in-memory option? Just
trying to get a gauge of whether there was any transition issue involved in the quarter on the tech side? Thank you very
much.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: No, actually it's a good question. I'm going to let Mark and Larry talk about the new products
in the database. But actually what went down in this quarter was an incredibly difficult compare in technology over Q4
last year actually. So I'm actually very satisfied with where we came out on the tech side, happy with the app side and
overall extremely happy about what's going on in Cloud for us. Do you want to talk about the new products?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Remember the comparison we did a huge deal salesforce.com is entirely based on the
Oracle database. And Oracle technology in Q4 last year, of course, they decided to standardize for the next 10 years –
well actually, to be more precise, for the next nine years on the Oracle database and we had a very large deal with
salesforce.com which created a bit of a difficult compare for us this year in the tech portion of our business.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: But we've got our new products, Larry. Just did a launch last week. Last week?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yes. And Kash, in terms of 12c, clearly 12c is brand new. We think the multi-tenant
option and the in-memory option are very, very attractive, especially to Cloud companies. Most of the Cloud
companies are based on the Oracle database. For example, this last Q4 we did a huge deal with SAP where
SuccessFactors is based entirely on Oracle. So people are using the Oracle database in the Cloud. We had a nice deal
with them. We have a nice deal a year ago, nice deal with Salesforce.com. Obviously NetSuite is – virtually everybody,
with the exception of Workday, is based on the Oracle database and we think these two features, the in-memory feature
and the multi-tenant feature, really will allow us to deliver, by far, the best database experience in the Cloud and that
should drive our database sales for the next few years.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Kash, just a little bit of color for you on the database number first. Database, to Larry's point,
was a tough compare in the U.S. but in Europe we grew double digits. So we had very strong database growth in
Europe. And so it really was that one compare that Larry is describing. Middleware had growth in the quarter as well,
which was good to see.
And of course, as Safra mentioned, our apps business sort of enjoys the benefit the other way but 6% growth in apps.
And just to get context, Kash, I want to emphasize what you said. We had 6% growth in apps license on-premise at the
same time as we had the bookings growth that I referenced, which was 37% for the year in Cloud bookings. It's become
so, as Safra said, popular here. So we actually got both benefits in the quarter, so a strong apps quarter for us.

Moving on to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Good afternoon, guys. I actually have a couple questions on Cloud and applications overall.
Maybe first, Larry, which product areas are you seeing best traction, fastest growth?
And the second part maybe, Mark, can you may be breakdown adoption by region? Because U.S. looked like it was a
little slower compared to EMEA and I'm trying to figure out if that's a reflection of perhaps greater Cloud growth or
adoption in the U.S. relative to Europe and on-premise licensing. Thanks.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I think we're recognized clearly as the leader in marketing and our marketing suite.
Gartner recognizes us as the leader in marketing in the Cloud. We're the upper right-hand company and we had great

growth in marketing and we're getting traction both in B2C and B2B in marketing and doing very, very well. HCM
kind of across the board we're doing extremely well from core HCM to recruiting and talent. We've just been very, very
successful in HCM.
It's early days in ERP, However, Q4 was a great ERP Fusion ERP. And this is all, by the way, this is all stuff we built.
This is all Fusion. It took us eight, nine, ten years, whatever you want, it took a long time to build our next generation
of Cloud products: Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, Fusion CRM. It was a tough road but we're beginning to get real serious
traction especially in North America for ERP.
Our HCM products are doing extremely well in North America where we're head-to-head against Workday. And we're
running the table in EMEA in HCM. We really are the dominant supplier in the Cloud in EMEA.
In terms of the adoption rate, obviously Cloud is much slower to be adopted in Asia-Pac. But I'll turn it over to Mark.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, listen, I think, Jason, a couple of points. One, HCM, I think we're doing really well. I
mean, I know nobody loves it when I read off names, but to be very blunt, our wins in the quarter were significant. Just
a couple: Cox Enterprises, Eaton, Fair Isaac, National Instruments, Vivendi, Xerox, Fairmont Hotels. I mean, these are
just a few of the quality brands we took down in HCM alone. So we had a strong HCM quarter. We were actually
going up, actually against the strongest HCM compare last year that we'd seen, but it was very, very impressive. So I
think we have a position in HCM where we're battling it out with Workday. We think we're winning a lot more than
we're losing and we're doing really well internationally, particularly in Europe, as Larry described.
Marketing, we won Kaiser, Eaton, Lexmark, Panasonic, Thomson Reuters, Time Warner Cable, Tyco. I mean, these
are quality names that have adopted the Oracle Marketing Cloud, and I could go on across all these areas. So as I
described in my prepared comments that maybe you couldn't hear, when you look at these Gartner Waves – or Gartner
Quadrants, sorry, and Forrester Waves, we lead in more of these waves and quadrants than our three cloud competitors
combined. So I really feel very good about where we are.
Now to your question about regions, I think you're taking the wrong conclusion out of Europe versus the United States.
Our U.S. Cloud business has done very well. You don't see it reflected in the numbers quite as well because of the
conversation we had a couple of questions ago about the recognition of subscription revenue, but the bookings in the
United States are quite strong. Our relative position in Europe may be stronger, but the adoption is slower relative to
what we've seen in the U.S. Europe has done fantastic. Let me take nothing away from Europe. But what you've really
seen them do a great job of is winning what's available in the European market, and they've done a great job in our
traditional business at the same time.

We'll now hear from Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thank you, just wanted to follow up on the 12c. Larry, would you envision with the
capabilities of 12c that your SaaS partners that use Oracle will re-architect their product to support multi-tenancy at the
database level and take advantage of in-memory capabilities as well to advance the apps offered on top of 12c?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Well if you've already put multi-tenancy – let me talk about your re-architecture question.
What the 12c database does, the multi-tenant feature, it takes an existing application that doesn't have multi-tenancy
built into it at the application layer and makes those existing applications all multi-tenant.
So there are a lot of companies that want to get to the Cloud. I mean, I'm just going to pick one out of thin air, like
Cerner, who really don't have multi-tenant product, but would like to get to the Cloud. They'd be a perfect example of a
company who runs on top of Oracle that would like to get to the Cloud where the Oracle multi-tenant database gives
them a fast track to the Cloud and a fast track to very fast, Big Data analytics with our in-memory options. So those two
things I think are going to be instrumental to us moving our huge ISV community to the Cloud on top of our platform.

We think that's a gigantic opportunity. And let me emphasize. Our platform – Salesforce is really two businesses,
Salesforce.com, the leader in the Cloud has two businesses. They've got their Salesforce automation business, which is
most of their application business, and then they've got what they now call Salesforce One, which is their platform
business.
Our platform business is made up of the Oracle database with multi-tenant, in-memory and the world's most popular
programming language, Java. We have virtually every ISV runs on top of the Oracle database. Virtually all of these
companies would like to be able to move their offerings to the Cloud. We now enable that. Our platform is just coming
out this fall. This is a net new business for us going forward, moving all of these ISVs into the Cloud.
We think this might be the biggest single opportunity – in an opportunity-rich world as we're seeing our SaaS
applications accelerate – the growth is accelerating, by the way. We're growing much faster. So this year 50%
bookings, I mentioned it before. We're seeing the demand for our SaaS applications accelerate, absolutely. And having
a broad portfolio gives us a lot of room to grow. PaaS is this new opportunity where a bunch of companies are just
chomping at the bit to get their businesses to the Cloud. We can move that ISV community to the Cloud with 12c. We
think that's a gigantic opportunity and it's going to help us grow our SaaS, PaaS business and make us number one in
both categories.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: And is the in memory piece as important as the multi-tenancy?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Well, it's different pieces, right? I mean the multi-tenancy piece basically lets you get to
the Cloud period with multi-tenancy. And the in memory piece allows you to offer big data analytics. And what you're
asking me which is more important big data analytics or being multi-tenancy in the Cloud, I think they're both crucial
to modern computing. These are two of the biggest parts of modern computing. People spend a lot of time talking about
the Cloud and getting to the Cloud, getting your business to the Cloud and modernizing it and big data analytics. I
mean they're number one and number two in the conversation about technology these days in all the meetings I'm in.

Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs has the next question.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you so much. As Oracle continues with its success in the Cloud, over time, I
know you mentioned the revenue benefits over time, but I'm wondering how we think about the long-term operating
margin profile of the company as you guys continue down the path of your success?
And then also just a follow-up for Mark, knowing you had a tough comp in the U.S. with the salesforce.com deal in the
Americas, was there anything else impacting growth in the region in the quarter and on the flipside, you had one of the
best growth rates we've seen out of you guys in EMEA in quite some time, is there anything there you can highlight?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Why don't you take this question, first?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay. On the U.S., no, everything roughly behaved as we expected. That's the issue on the
comp. Europe, I've said this, I know, multiple times on these calls, they've just executed marvelously. They've taken
enormous amounts of market share. They have just done a great job. And it's across, Heather, really all aspects of our
business. It's across our Engineered Systems business, our database business, our middleware business, our SaaS
business. They were the first to add sales capacity. They added sales capacity really three-and-a-half years ago and
they've trained and assimilated that capacity, and that capacity has now gotten us in materially more deals.
Simultaneously, we have been able to take some very strategic transactions, as we did this quarter, that are just part of
that overall series of successes we've seen out of Europe and I think as you know Europe has not been the most robust
economy over the course of that timeframe, so I think our team there has just executed marvelously.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Heather, on your margin question, as you can see in the numbers and they basically speak for
themselves, we've been doing this build up and investment all within our profitability envelope. You can look at our
cash flow statement, you can see our capital investment, we are incredibly advantaged because we make virtually

absolutely everything in the Cloud that we need whether it's the hardware, Engineered Systems, the software, the
operating system, the database, we have it all. And, we have a business that it is at such scale that we have enormous
economies of scale. We can add customers at an extremely high profitability level because we have so many customers
generally and additionally, because we control literally so much of our own supply chain.
So we can deliver these services and we already have the sales force, we have everything in place, and we're not even at
scale in Cloud. So imagine at scale what's going to happen here and as these new bookings, which are in this heavy
growth period, actually start to rain back as revenue, we are extremely optimistic about our ability to grow Cloud and
over time, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the short-term, less revenue come in; in the long-term and medium-term,
more revenue come in and simultaneously our customers spend and save an enormous amount of money themselves.
So it's really a win-win as well for both of us.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me just add...
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me just add one little piece which is, the two parts of the Cloud business that we're
focused on are SaaS, the applications, and PaaS, the platform database and Java programming language. We think
inherently those businesses are 40%, 50% margin businesses. We think that's not the case in infrastructure-as-a-service
business, we think that's a lower margin business, but we think we can run it profitably in association with our SaaS
and PaaS businesses. But where we're really trying to grow the business, where we're determined to be number one, is
in SaaS and PaaS.
We're in infrastructure-as-a-service as a convenience to our customers who want to go – have one-stop shopping and
buy their applications, platform and infrastructure at the same place. But we think collectively, those three businesses,
as Safra said, we are our supply chain. So we buy electricity and buildings. Everything else we make. And we think we
can deliver these Cloud services without compromising our margins whatsoever.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Thank you.

And our last question will come from Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Hi. Mark, I might have missed this, but I just wanted to get some more color on the Integrated
Systems. It looked like the business was a little bit weaker than we would have expected and I would love to get some
color around that, I might have missed it on your opening comments.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: You mean Engineered Systems, correct Joel?
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Engineered Systems. Sorry, Mark.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, strong quarter, best quarter we've ever had. So just to be clear, I think I said this in Q3,
that Q3 was the best quarter we'd ever had except for this Q4 that we were going to have, that we had, and we beat it in
Q4. Now in Q4 was that same deal that Larry described earlier as a comparison and as Safra mentioned, I think she said
in her remarks but I'll say it if she didn't, we had double-digit growth in Engineered Systems in the quarter, so it was a
record for us and very strong. We – trust me, Joel, we couldn't grow hardware the way we did without Engineered
Systems having a strong quarter, so we're awful excited about that.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: All right. Thanks a lot.
