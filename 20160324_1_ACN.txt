MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings
conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. KC
McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Greg, and thanks to everyone for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings
announcement. As Greg just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. With me
today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial
Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short-time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the second
quarter. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market position before David provides our business outlook for
the third quarter and full fiscal year 2016. We will then take your questions before Pierre provides a wrap-up at the end
of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the materials we discuss in this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking, and as
such are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties, including but not limited to, risk factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and

this call.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in
our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no
obligation to update the information presented on this call.
And now, let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We delivered very strong financial results for the second quarter and I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we
have created in our business over the last eight quarters. This quarter our growth was again broad-based across different
dimensions of our business. Our strategy is clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and differentiating
Accenture in the marketplace and in regards to gaining significant market share. Here are a few highlights from the
quarter.
We delivered outstanding new bookings of $9.5 billion. We grew revenues 12% in local currency, a very strong
performance, including double-digit growth in four of our five operating groups and all three geographic regions.
Operating margin was 13.7%, an expansion of 10 basis points. We delivered outstanding earnings per share of $1.34 on
an adjusted basis, a 24% increase.
We generated free cash flow of $169 million and we continue to return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders
through share repurchases and dividends. Today, we announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.10 per share, which
will bring total dividend payments for the year to $2.20 per share, an 8% increase over last year.
Now, with the first half of the year behind us, I feel very good about our business and how we are positioned for the
year. Based on our strong performance, we are raising our business outlook for both revenues and earnings per share
for the year.
Now, let me hand over to David. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks all of you for joining us on today's call.
Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our outstanding financial results in the second quarter. Once
again, our results this quarter reflect continued strong momentum across almost every dimension of our business,
reflecting the strength of our leadership position in the market and the relevance of our offerings and capabilities to our
clients.
Before I get into the details, let me summarize some of the important highlights from this quarter. Strong local currency
growth of 12% represents the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which is even more impressive when
you consider that quarter two of last year grew 12% as well. The overriding theme of broad-based growth was evident
again this quarter with four of our operating groups in all three geographic areas posting strong double-digit growth.
Our growing leadership position in digital-related services continue to serve as well, and combined with cloud-related
services and security, we continued to be the partner-of-choice in helping our clients rotate to the new.
Operating margin of 13.7% reflects 10 basis points expansion within our annual guided range. Our profitability
continues to reflect the absorption of significant investments in our people and in our business as we further strengthen

our leadership position in the market.
The combination of strong revenue growth, expansion in our margin and tax rate efficiencies resulted in 24% EPS
growth for the quarter and 11% EPS growth year-to-date excluding the gain on the sale of Navitaire, which I'll describe
in more detail shortly.
Free cash flow of $169 million came in as expected and keeps us on a trajectory to deliver our annual guidance range,
which reflects free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. And importantly, we continue to invest at scale
in our business, closing five acquisitions in the quarter with year-to-date invested capital of approximately $750
million. So we're very pleased with our results, which continue to demonstrate our ability to successfully deliver on our
three imperatives for driving shareholders value: durable revenue growth, sustainable margin expansion, and strong
free cash flow with disciplined capital allocation.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details for the quarter. As expected, we delivered a higher level of new
bookings this quarter at $9.5 billion, including an all-time record high Consulting bookings. Consulting bookings were
$5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Outsourcing bookings were $4.5 billion also with a book-to-bill of 1.2 and
consistent with our target.
We're particularly pleased with a strong and balanced demand across all of our business dimensions, which is best
illustrated by our estimated book-to-bills. Consulting and Strategy had a combined book-to-bill of 1.1, Application
Services a book-to-bill of 1.2, and Operations a book-to-bill of 1.3. And across the board, digital-related services
continue to be a significant driver of our new bookings.
Finally, we're pleased that we had 10 clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, which again points to the
strength of our client relationships and their trust in our ability to drive their most important initiatives.
So turning now to revenue, net revenues for the quarter were $7.95 billion, a 6% increase in USD and 12% in local
currency reflecting a negative 6% foreign exchange impact. Our quarter two revenues were higher than our guided
range primarily due to consulting demand being even stronger than expected across many of our operating groups and
geographic markets. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 12% in USD and 18% in local currency.
Our Outsourcing revenues were $3.7 billion, flat in USD and an increase of 6% in local currency.
Looking broadly at drivers of revenue growth for the quarter, we had strong and balanced estimated growth across all
business dimensions. Digital-related services continue to be the dominant theme with growth above 25%, which once
again fueled double-digit growth in our Strategy and Consulting services combined. Operations return to double-digit
growth and we saw an uptick in Application Services to high single-digit growth.
Taking a closer look at our operating groups, H&PS grew 15% in the quarter with very strong double-digit growth in
both Health & Public Service and overall in North America and the growth markets. Products delivered broad-based
growth of 14% and continue to be led by our industrial and life sciences industries, which were very – with very strong
overall growth in Europe and the growth markets.
Communications, Media & Technology grew 13% in the quarter led by double-digit growth in North America and the
growth markets as well as electronics and high-tech and media and entertainment globally. Financial Services
momentum continued with 13% growth led by very strong double-digit growth in banking and capital markets as well
as strong growth across all three geographies.
And finally, Resources delivered 4% growth, led by continued strong double-digit growth in Utilities as well as strong
overall growth in North America and Europe. We continue to navigate cyclical headwinds in energy and in chemicals
and natural resources where growth is significantly challenged. At the same time, looking at resources overall, we feel
that we are more than holding our own in a very difficult environment.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.8% compared to 29.9% in the same period last
year. Our sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.7% for the same quarter last year,
down 20 basis points.

General and administrative expense was 5.7%, up 10 basis points from the second quarter last year. Operating income
was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with quarter
two last year.
In the second quarter, as part of launching an important partnership with Amadeus, we closed our Navitaire transaction,
which lowered our quarter two tax rate by 1.7%, increased net income by $495 million and increased diluted earnings
per share by $0.74. The following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 26% for the second
quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 benefited from a final determination of
prior year tax liabilities as well as changes in the geographic distribution of earnings.
Net income on an adjusted basis was $905 million for the second quarter compared with net income of $743 million for
the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.34 compared with EPS of $1.08 in the second
quarter last year. This reflects a 24% year-over-year increase of which $0.17 or 16% came from the lower tax rate.
Tuning to DSOs, our days services outstanding were 39 days compared to 41 days last quarter and 35 days in the
second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $169 million, resulting from cash generated by operating
activities of $317 million net of property and equipment additions of $148 million. Moving to our level of cash, our
cash balance at February 29 was $3 billion compared with $4.4 billion at August 31.
Turning to some other key operational metrics, we ended the quarter with a global head count of about 373,000 people,
which was roughly flat with quarter one and up 15% compared to quarter two of last year. We now have approximately
273,000 people in our global delivery network. Our utilization in quarter two was 90%, consistent with last quarter.
Attrition which excludes involuntary terminations was 13%, consistent with quarter one and down 1% compared to the
same period last year.
With regards to our ongoing objectives to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter we repurchased or
redeemed 8.1 million shares for $829 million at an average price of $102.14 per share. At February 29 we had
approximately $6.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
As Pierre just mentioned, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.10 per share, representing an 8% increase
over the dividend we paid in May last year. This dividend will be paid on May 13, 2016.
Finally, before I close, let me mention that our board has approved the decision to terminate our U.S. pension plan,
which will reduce future risk and administrative cost to Accenture. This is subject to regulatory approvals and is not
expected to be finalized for 12 to 18 months. Upon final settlement, we expect to record a principally non-cash
settlement charge of approximately $350 million.
So at the halfway point in the fiscal year, we've delivered very strong results and feel that we're well-positioned for the
remainder of the year. Our results continue to demonstrate the durability of our growth, profitability and cash flows,
and our ability to manage our business to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.
Now let me turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David.
So looking at the first half of the fiscal year 2016, our outstanding results demonstrate that we continue to execute very
well against our growth strategy and that we are taking a leadership position in every part of our business. Year to date,
we have delivered 11% revenue growth in local currency, which is well above the market growth rate. We continue to
accelerate our rotation to the new digital, cloud, and security-related services, which together accounted for nearly 40%
of our total revenues in the first half of the year and grew at a strong double-digit rate. At the same time, we continue to
see very strong performance across the rest of our business, which remains extremely competitive and is generating

very good growth.
Let me bring all of this to life with a few examples, beginning with how we are leveraging our innovative capabilities
to help clients drive digital transformation. Working with Boston Scientific, we have jointly developed a cloud-based
digital health solution for hospitals built on the Accenture Insights platform. The new solution is designed to leverage
our analytics capabilities to significantly improve patient care and reduce treatment cost.
Accenture Interactive continues to gain traction in the marketplace and has recently been named the digital agency
partner for Celebrity Cruises, where we are helping redesign the digital customer experience; and for L'Oréal in Brazil,
where we are responsible for search engine optimization and digital marketing analytics.
In Accenture Mobility, we are using the Accenture Connected Platform to drive digital transformation for Metro de
Madrid, one of the largest transportation systems in the world. We expect to increase operating efficiency, improve the
passenger experience, and enable new Internet of Things-based services.
We continue to operate at the heart of our clients' businesses with strong demand for our core capabilities. And given
our industry expertise and end-to-end capabilities, we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies.
In the U.S., Accenture Strategy is helping FirstEnergy improve competitiveness and operational agility with a cash
flow improvement program that is expected to deliver more than $450 million in savings over three years. We are
working with a leading food company to transform its global operating model. An integrated team from Accenture
Strategy, Accenture Consulting, and Accenture Operations is providing process redesign as well as finance and
accounting and HR business process services.
We continue to invest across our business to further enhance our capabilities and differentiation in the marketplace,
including making nine acquisitions in the first half of the year. In particular, we have made significant investments to
strengthen our industry expertise in several key sectors.
In Health, we acquired Sagacious Consultants, a leading provider in implementing electronic health record systems in
the U.S. In Financial Services, we acquired Beacon Consulting, based in Boston, to expand our capabilities in asset
management. And we acquired Formicary, a leading provider of systems integration and technology consulting for
trading platforms in the UK, the U.S., and Canada. Also in Financial Services, we created a specialized practice called
blockchain technology, which is expected to drive significant efficiency gains for financial institutions. To accelerate
our speed to market, we invested in Digital Asset Holdings, a leading developer of blockchain technologies.
And in Resources, we acquired Schlumberger Business Consulting, the international management consulting arm of
Schlumberger. And in North America, we acquired Cimation to expand our consulting, digital, and cyber security
services for industrial asset management.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, I'm very pleased with the strong and balanced growth we are
driving across all three of our geographic regions. And I am delighted that we delivered double-digit growth for the
quarter in many of our largest markets, including six which together comprise 70% of our total revenues.
In North America, we delivered 12% revenue growth, driven by another excellent quarter of strong double-digit growth
in the United States. In Europe, we delivered exceptional results with 14% growth in local currency. We delivered
double-digit growth in the UK, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and Germany, as well as high single-digit growth in France.
And in growth markets, we delivered 10% revenue growth in local currency, led once again by strong double-digit
growth in Japan. But we also generated double-digit growth in China and in India as well as solid growth in Brazil
despite a very challenging environment.
Before I turn it back to David, I want to share a few thoughts on what it means to run Accenture as a high-performance
business. It is imperative that we attract, develop, and inspire the very best talent in our industry. And I am proud that
for eight years in a row, Accenture has been named one of Fortune's [100] Best Companies to Work For in the U.S. I
am equally proud that in India Accenture was ranked the top company in our sector on Business Today's list of the best
companies to work for.

In our business, trust is everything. And I couldn't be more pleased that for the ninth year in a row, Accenture was
recognized on Ethisphere's list of the world's most ethical companies. This is strong recognition of our commitment to
ethical leadership and corporate social responsibility.
So as you can see, every day we are making Accenture an even better business partner for all of our stakeholders. We
have very strong momentum in our business and we continue to deliver value into the marketplace.
And with that, I will turn the call over to over to David to provide our updated business outlook. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre.
Let me now turn to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues to be in the range of
$8.1 billion to $8.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be a negative 2.5% compared to the third quarter of
fiscal 2015 and reflects an estimated 7% to 10% growth in local currency.
For the full fiscal year 2016, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to
assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be negative 5% compared to fiscal 2015. For the full fiscal
2016, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal 2015. For
operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2016 to be 14.6% to 14.7%, a 10 basis point to 20 basis point expansion
over adjusted fiscal 2015 results.
As I mentioned earlier, we closed our Navitaire transaction in the second quarter, which will lower the full year FY
2016 tax rate by approximately 1.5% and increase diluted earnings per share by $0.74. Our guidance for fiscal 2016
excludes the impact of this transaction.
We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For adjusted earnings per share,
we now expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $5.21 to $5.32, or 8% to 10% growth over
adjusted fiscal 2015 results.
Now turning to cash flow. For the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $4.1
billion to $4.4 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $500 million and free cash flow to be in
the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion.
Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4 billion through dividends and share repurchase and also continue to
expect to reduce the weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the range of 1.5% as we remain committed to
returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
With that, let's open it up to questions. KC?
KC McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask the question. Greg, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?

<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi. Good morning, Tien-tsin.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi. Good morning. Good morning, David.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning to you.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Good morning. Good morning. Obviously good quarter. I just want to dig in on the upside,
given the strong book-to-bill, looks like revenue $200 million above guidance on a usually pretty tricky quarter. It
doesn't sound like it's large deal oriented either. So, I'm curious, do you have resources to meet this demand especially
given the strength in consulting? I'm asking because I want to gauge your confidence in executing against this
momentum within your margin targets? So I'll start with that question.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thanks. And so if I just start and work through the points that you made is that we did have
an even stronger quarter than we had expected, no doubt. As you alluded to, in the mix is the fact that second quarter
can be a more difficult quarter to predict, which you know that well as you know our business well. And the reasons are
that you have the holiday period in there including the New Year period, which sometimes can be a little unpredictable
in terms of how that impacts our available workdays, if you will.
And then of course you have the turn to the new fiscal year, which can also create sometimes some temporary changes
in buying patterns during that first month or two of the new calendar year. In our case, neither of those things had an
impact on us. And to the contrary, the momentum that we've had now for many quarters continued and even built
further. And we saw that – the upside relative to what we had expected was in our Consulting and Strategy services
combined or our consulting type of work where we had expected double-digit growth, but it came in even stronger than
we had expected.
And Tien-tsin, we're very pleased that we were able to support that growth with essentially flat head count versus
quarter one, which we view as a very positive thing. And so, as it relates to capacity, we certainly have a supply plan
that supports the revenue growth that we projected for the third quarter and the full year. We feel very good about our
supply management and our ability to access talent in the marketplace is as good as it's ever been.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Okay, great. And just my quick follow-up, just like I asked last quarter, inorganic contribution
to revenue and may be margin if you can, David, give it to us across Consulting and Outsourcing? Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Right. So, the inorganic contribution continues to be in the range of about 2%. And as I
mentioned last quarter, if you look at it by type of work, it is bigger in Consulting than it is in Outsourcing. And
Consulting last quarter, I said that it was about 4%. And so, we continued in the second quarter where it was more
Consultant-oriented than Outsourcing-oriented. Your margin question, Tien-tsin, was what now?
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Just same question, related to impact to margin, operating margins from the acquisitions given
the cost side of it.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, I would tell you that maybe if I just answered it even in a broader way, I mean the
acquisitions are an important part of our investments, but they are not the only part of our investments. Our strategy is
to expand our underlying margin at a much higher level than the 10 basis points we reported. And then we use that
headroom to then fund what are higher levels of investments in our business, which includes the impact of acquisitions.
So let me just say that our underlying margin expansion was stronger than the 10 basis points because our investments
continue to grow at a rate faster than revenue. And that includes acquisitions among other things, so.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Got it.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Great. Tien-tsin, good luck to the Cavaliers the rest of the way.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Go Hoos.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could ask a little bit
more about Consulting versus Outsourcing mix. And I guess what I'm referring to is if you listen to vendors like
salesforce.com on their call, and they talk about system integrators becoming ISVs and then we hear Accenture talk
about shifting deals towards more outcome-based pricing. Is there a way to think about the changes in bookings and
revenue between Outsourcing and Consulting, particularly as we see the acceleration in Consulting going forward?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I'll make a couple of comments and Pierre may add as well. What I would say is that I mean
the basic answer to your question is no in the sense that what we viewed as Consulting is unchanged and obviously
likewise the same is true for Outsourcing. What we see in Consulting is probably a couple of things. One thing we see
is that – and in fact, I guess I would say it this way, at the foundation of what's driving our Consulting revenue growth
is the depth of our industry expertise and the fact that we really operate not only at the heart of our clients but at the
heart of our industries in terms of being on top of the most important trends and being able to help our clients respond
to those trends. And that draws in a lot of our consulting type services. So if you look at Accenture Strategy, Accenture
Consulting, if you look at Accenture Digital, that brings us right into the heart of the client's high-priority agenda
because it's all grounded fundamentally in industry expertise.
The second thing that is driving our Consulting growth is the fact that we are establishing ourselves as among the
leaders, if not the leader, in the rotation to the new. And when you look at Consulting, it reflects, it includes by the way
systems integration services, which are included in our Consulting type of work and our dimension reporting that are
reflected in app services. So we have a lot of systems integration work over recent quarters associated with clients that
are investing and deploying new technology. And so maybe I'll just stop there, but our Consulting growth is really
driven by the things that we've been highlighting, which are the priority areas that we're focused on in our growth
strategy.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. Maybe if I could follow up on the digital growth. It seems as though you're indicating a
nice reacceleration in growth there. Anything we can think about in terms of what's causing some of the variability in
year-over-year growth rates that we've seen, particularly after a slight deceleration last quarter and then obviously
reaccelerating this quarter? Is it still choppy growth off of lower numbers or is there something else maybe seasonal at
play there?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I wouldn't read anything into – I mean I guess what I would focus on is that in both quarters
the growth was north of 20% and then north of 25%. I wouldn't read too much into that. I mean I think our digital
growth is going to continue to be consistently strong double digit. And within the context of strong double digit, you
might have some fluctuation, but overall, the growth is outstanding. And we couldn't be more pleased with not only
digital but also the new when you look at the growth that we have in cloud-related services and security.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: This is absolutely right and this is the reason why in my past reporting to you around the
business update I covered Q1 and Q2. I mean all our business – our business is not driven by quarterly activities. We
are selling, operating over a cycle which is the case for this digital-related services, so there is no point you should
over-read the kind of quarterly results and much more putting these results in the context of a much longer term. This is
what we mentioned that we have for our seventh...
<A - David P. Rowland>: Sixth consecutive.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: ...six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. When you look at our digital rotation, now
it has been double-digit growth for several quarters as well. So what we are pleased with is the consistency and the
duration of our growth in digital and overall Accenture and not so much a quarterly situation.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Got it, very helpful and thank you and nice results.

Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Ashwin.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Good morning, David. Good morning, Pierre. So obviously, very strong demand metrics,
as expected, so congratulations on that. My question is that the highest level of revenues and EPS is not driving a
corresponding rise in cash flow. Why is that?
<A - David P. Rowland>: As we've said before, there are a lot of things that impact our cash flow in a particular year.
We have had a couple of day uptick in DSO. That impacts it. The timing of tax cash payments is an example from year
to year can impact the cash flow.
Ashwin, what I really focus on is that our cash flow in the range that we provided, our free cash flow continues to be at
a level that is greater than net income. And if you'll remember back to what I've started saying three years ago, what
I've really focused on is the durability of our business model and generating cash flow in excess of net income, and this
year continues that trend. And that's a very distinctive mark for a very successful cash flow generating business. And so
we're very pleased with our cash flow.
And also remember that the range that we give is $300 million, and so it's a fairly broad range when you think about
the fact that we changed revenue, we didn't change cash flow, it is a broad range, but it's in excess of net income, and
that's really what we're focused on driving.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Got it, got it. So the second question really is you had relative to the very strong
Consulting, a weaker level of outsourcing growth the last few quarters. You're not alone in this trend. Several other
companies are in the same boat. I wanted to ask how much of that weaker outsourcing trend in relative terms is volume
versus pricing versus productivity gains because of higher levels of automation and things like that.
<A - David P. Rowland>: We've not quantified it in those three buckets. It's a very smart question to ask. We just
haven't quantified it in those three buckets. And I don't think we're going to do it on the call even if I had the numbers
in front of me, which I don't. What I would tell you, and maybe – sorry to state the obvious, but all three of those things
are in the mix, no doubt about it. We are very pleased with progress that we're making on the automation front in both
App Services and BPO as well. There is no doubt that in the application maintenance piece of Application Services that
that is a highly competitive environment, which does impact the revenue yield per labor hour in that marketplace.
But yet it's also important to note, Ashwin, that if you look at pricing as we define it, which is the margin on the work
that we're selling, our margin in that AO business is – I'm talking about pricing – is holding up quite well. So we're
managing the trajectory and revenue per head. We're managing our cost to serve and alignment are actually better than
alignment with that trend.
And then we've also mentioned that in the market that we're in now, clients are somewhat universally trying to be more
efficient in the cost of ownership of their existing application footprint. And why, they want to do that so that they can
invest more in the new. And so we're seeing the benefit of that investment in our Systems Integration business, which is
part of our Consulting type of work growth. It's also part of the Application Services growth, which I mentioned was
high single digit. So all three of those things are in the mix, and we're navigating them all.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Yes, impressive quarter. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Good morning. Health and Banking and Capital Markets are sectors that some peers
have called out some weakness. It doesn't look like Accenture is seeing that same weakness. So I guess my question is
why is Accenture seeing strength in Banking and Capital Markets and Health, and what's the outlook there going
forward?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: When you look at our different industries, we have, just to set the scene, we have now what,
13 industry groupings we are reporting against. We started that at the IA Day. And I'm pleased to report that nine out of
the 13 have enjoyed double-digit growth. And so it's quite true across the board.
So what explaining and the rationale is the same for Health and for Banking and Capital Markets. The growth of our
business, the growth of our countries, and the growth of our industries is directly linked to the speed of the rotation to
the new. It is as simple as this. And the fact of the matter is that we invested in those digital-related services quite ahead
of the curve, certainly at the right time. We've been lucky enough to execute this strategy at the right time. And now all
our industries, including Banking and Capital Markets, they do benefit from this rotation to the new, again
digital-related services plus cloud-related services plus security-related services. And so when I look at Banking and
Capital Markets, a lot of what we do is around the new.
And I guess if some of our competitors have lower growth, for me this is certainly the signal that their business is still
too much associated to the kind of current core activities. Let's call them classic activities, which might be under
pressure, and their rotation to the new is certainly slower than what we are experiencing at Accenture.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, looking at the new guidance for fiscal year
2016, I saw the raise in constant currency revenue growth. But I think the operating margin was decreased about 10
basis points on the high end. Just curious on the reason for the change in operating margin guidance? Thanks, congrats
by the way.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you very much, Bryan. So, first of all, our kind of strategic objective is to land the
fiscal year within that 10 basis points to 30 basis points. So that is what we're focused on and we balance multiple
objectives in any given year, but within that target range. So this year, if you look at where we are on a year-to-date
basis.
And when we reflect not only on the investments that we've made year-to-date in our people and our business, and we
reflect on the investments that we want to continue to make in our people and our business during the second half of the
year, which are clearly in the best long-term interest of our shareholders and investors. The right balance between what
we deliver and reported margin expansion this fiscal year and what we need to do to invest in our business and people
is 10 to 20 basis points this year.
And so it's within kind of that target range that we have and it just reflects the balance that we're making between
delivering margin expansion, but at the same time continuing the very successful track record that we've had of
investing in our business and positioning those investments for future year returns. Okay, hello?

Your next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Barclays. Please go ahead
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Thanks, guys. Look, I just want to start off with the inorganic growth for a moment. I mean,
obviously, a number of deals have been coming on. And I think you said 2% was the contribution, which is similar to
what you said at your IA day. So that's consistent. I wonder if how much of these deals are really being dedicated
towards this digital initiative that you've really been able to expand so well. And I guess bigger question is going
forward how much more do we need to keep doing on that front to enable Accenture to stay ahead of the curve on
digital? Is inorganic can become 3% or 4% of your growth rate in the next couple of years in order to maintain
differentiation. Just if you could help with that?

<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. On this question if you look, and I think we reported that recently, that's on all if you
take fiscal year 2015 acquisitions, 70% of the 38 acquisitions were made was digital-related.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Sure.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And the ones which are not 100% digital-related been more around deep industry expertise
and I've been highlighting a few. And some we are making from an industry standpoint would cover both topics. But
let's say, it's a strong 70% digital and the other 30% will be more reinforcing our industry with niche acquisition with
extremely deep experts. So far, our planning is to continue with the trajectory we set and we communicated to in a way
which is very consistent in the range of deploying 20% to 30% of our free cash flow.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, $900 million to $1 billion this year, yeah.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Which is roughly $900 million to $1 billion-ish in term of cash flow being deployed in our
acquisitions. That would typically, in our model, account for this 2% contribution to our growth.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: This is still our mindset. Now, if we have the opportunity to flex because there are great
opportunities in front of us, we will remain flexible.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay, all right. I just wanted to figure out if these deals are part of the impact on the free cash
conversion we're seeing. I know you say it's still within the range, but I guess that's really what we're getting some
questions on is just as much as that's definitely enabled to drive you to differentiate yourself and grow well better than
most in the industry, there are just some people asking about financial implications on the rest of the model. Maybe,
David, if you could, I think Tien-tsin, it was a little bit of a follow-up to that question also.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Again, I would focus – by the way, it's not an inorganic – I don't even want to say issue
because it's not an issue. The inorganic is not driving a notable impact on our cash generation. And very simply, I
would point to two things. Number one is that although we continue to have exceptional DSOs, they have ticked up,
right? And so, a day or two of DSO has an impact on our cash flow. And the second thing is just the timing of large –
tax cash payments is an example, which can fluctuate.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay.
<A - David P. Rowland>: But if you look structurally at our cash flow model and what drives our cash, really
fundamentally nothing has changed.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay, all right. That's helpful. Just last follow-up, on the resources side. I mean it's been pretty
impressive to us that you've been able to maintain growth at all – in that area just given the macro backdrop across
resources. And so in terms of trajectory, I know it's 4%, it's slower than the rest of the business, but again, for us just
seeing growth at all was pretty impressive. Should we expect to see that vertical continue?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: When you talk about resources, there are really two stories in resources. We are covering
three industry segments. Of course, two of these industry segments are impacted with the overall natural resources and
commodity pricing downturn. And the other one, I'm thinking about energy and what we're calling C&R, oil natural
resources, and then you have utilities. And in utilities, it is one of our fastest growing industries, above 20% growth in
the quarter.
<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Just to set the scene publicly. Because it's explaining – other way I can speak your question if
you're positive with two industries, what's explaining that? What explaining that is our resources leadership, we do
engage at the same time in two rotations, if you will, to put it very simply. They are rotating to higher growth and
higher potential industries. And today, it is from energy to utilities and then rotating this industry to the new. And if
you look at utilities, it is at the same time, the 20%-plus growth is significantly fueled by the rotation to the new.

<Q - Darrin Peller>: Okay.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And I'm pleased to mention that because sometimes we believe the rotation to the new is
more for the business to consumer kind of industries, banking, the insurance to come, the retail, the consumer good and
so forth, but at Accenture, the rotation to the new is big even in the B2B business.
And what we've been doing in utilities especially providing superior services in terms of IoT, in terms of great
management and bringing the digital at the heart of the utilities operation. It's creating supernormal growth for utility
balancing the downside. And this is taking this opportunity to share with you that that's why we like so much our
diverse portfolio business and diverse portfolio of industry, which is for us absolutely critical in our ability to continue

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: Good morning. How are you?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Fine. I hope you are.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: I'm doing good, just a couple questions real quick. On the Consulting growth, clearly continues
to be impressive. I'm just wondering to what extent if there is any that you feel like you're benefiting from some of this
global M&A, not so much the M&A you've done but what companies are doing who represent your client. You
mentioned system integration work and investments in new technology, but I'm wondering if there's a lot of integration
that's going on as a result of some of this other global M&A.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: The answer is yes. I guess indeed, whether we have the opportunity to talk about it, but for
this last couple of years, we had two massive growth drivers in the marketplace at the high-level. One is the
digitalization of the industries, which is huge massive, pervasive, everywhere and coming together with what you're
calling the rationalization of the operations and the rationalization of the operation. This is what's driving good growth
in the rest of the business, the non-digital specific business in Application Outsourcing, in Application Services, in
Business Process Outsourcing and that kind of services.
You're right that this last six months, so six months, seven months we've seen a third engine kicking in which I would
call consolidation, what you're calling the M&A. So we have digitalization, a rationalization, and indeed we are adding
consolidations. And we are given a very good position with Accenture Consulting operating at behalf of our client's
businesses and quite connected to the C-Suite. We are a partner-of-choice in some of the major consolidation ongoing
on the planet. So we have the third engine kicking in, yes.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: That's fantastic. And my follow-up, in the past you've – I think size, you've given us a little bit
more details around – how big now at this point in the business, you have digital and you have cloud and you have
security, and I feel like you said somewhere around $7 billion or something to that effect relative to legacy ERP, which
is the constant question we get. And so I'm wondering if you're willing to update us on that. And if you are, are you just
at a point now in that cycle where that digital agenda is just so much bigger that it's worth payout that you would have
had roughly during the year? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think Pierre might have had in his script that if you look at the new digital cloud and
security that is approaching 40% of our revenue. So you can just do the math off of our revenue to get the dollars.

On the ERP, the ERP business continues to be under 20% of our total revenue. Now, I will say that we have seen some
growth in the ERP space. And so we have always expected that ERP is fundamentally the technology backbone for
how companies manage their business. We never felt like the ERP business was going to go away. We always have
anticipated a cycle where there would be investments in next-generation ERP and we're part of helping our clients
move to next-generation ERP. And so we are seeing some growth in ERP and we're very pleased with our ERP
business.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Maybe we are using or I'm using this language a lot that it's all about the rotation of the
business as we speak. And I believe that the main difference between the winners and the losers is coming from the one
who are able to rotate to the high growth areas and to rotate at speed. When you look at ERP, as David just said, all our
strategy as in the down cycle was to start building capabilities to rotate our ERP to new ERPs. And at the time we were
calling as an illustration building capabilities, strong capabilities with HANA, which is going to be the next-generation
and S/4, the next-generation of ERP with SAP. I'm taking that as an illustration.
And guess what? As we speak, given the investment we made ahead of this HANA S/4 wave, today, we are already the
number-one in implementing S/4 and HANA in the world. We see clearly, and you've seen probably with the results of
SAP, a pick-up on this new ERP development. And if you move beyond the strict definition of ERP to the broader
definition of application packages, then it's even more spectacular in terms of Accenture positioning. We are enjoying
good growth in all the application package and especially with the new SaaS packages. And I'm very pleased with the
growth we are enjoying with Salesforce. I'm very pleased with the growth we have with Workday with Microsoft
Dynamics and some other application packet services. So we benefit from rotating our ERP to the next generation of
ERP plus having taken a leadership position in this new application package. So all in all, this business is growing.
<Q - Daniel Perlin>: Excellent, thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hello, Lisa. Good morning.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Hi, good morning, guys. First, just David, one quick follow-up question on the operating margin
outlook for the year. You mentioned you've changed your investments I guess for the rest of the year and as a result
made a different trade-off there. Can you just give some examples of what some of those investment areas are that you
decided to accelerate for this year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I wouldn't characterize it as so much of a change. Remember, 10 basis points off the top is
$30 million. And so really we are executing very well, Lisa, against the investment plan that we really started the year
with.
On the inorganic front, we are certainly well-positioned to spend at probably the upper end of that range of $900
million to $1 billion, so we would be closer to $1 billion. We continue to invest in our assets and offerings and our
people, et cetera. And so I wouldn't say that we have set a new trajectory. It's just if you look at the aggregation of our
results, you look at where we are year to date, you look at our planned investment spending for the second half of the
year, which is not materially different from where we started, we just think that the more likely landing zone is in that
10 to 20 basis points.
But the point, Lisa, that I would reinforce is that it would be incorrect to interpret that as, let's say, a shift in the
underlying economics of our business because underneath that, we're driving much more headroom in our P&L. So our
ability to drive profit improvement in our underlying business is alive and well. It's just that this year the level of
investments and the other factors will put us more in that 10 to 20 basis points range.

<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Got it, okay, and then a follow-up on the macroeconomic side. Given the global and sector
diversity in your business, can you just give an idea of where now, three months into the year, where you're seeing
overall IT budgets settle out? And then also, how much of the digital and the new work is being funded out of IT versus
out of other parts of your clients' budgets, like outside the IT budget?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: When I look to the markets, to be honest, I do not see much changes as we speak. And just to
be more specific, I think as I already said, it was in October that the overall economic environment is sluggish, to say
the least, and it is still sluggish. So we can't expect much regarding the environment. It's unstable, risky, extraordinarily
complex. That was the case last year. It's still the case this year.
When I'm looking at the budgets from our clients, I'm not noticing any significant change. Again, it's this story around
these three drivers now. Digitalization, all industries are investing in digitalizing their operations because all the leaders
and all these industries are subject to disruption and to massive disruptions. So that's the new factor in town. It's not
about being better. It's not about getting more productivity. It's about not being disrupted and not being disrupted and
not disappearing in the marketplace. This is the race, so I see this cycle each year for quite a while and they have to
invest.
Now where the money is coming from is through rationalization of the operations, cost reengineering, IT efficiency, it's
all of this and it's across the board. In many organizations, it's coming from IT, but as well it's coming from all the
business lines looking at rationalization, which of course is driving good business for our Accenture Strategy or
Accenture Consulting practices to do business process reengineering and profit improvement. We have the rise of what
we call the ZBB and the work we've been doing – one is very public with Mondelnz, which now is representing
probably the benchmark of how you transform the cost of the organization.
And if you look at more efficiency, you have of course, the consolidation. And you see some ways of consolidation,
especially in resources, especially in chemical. Of course the Dow/DuPont is the perfect illustration of the kind of
consolidation that's happening. I could mention a few as well in the telecom given the need to get to a superior level of
productivity. So I would say the environment is for us more or less the same along these three drivers and in an
economic context, which is non-inspiring.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific. Thanks, guys

<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Hi.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning, Ed.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Good morning. Thanks, congrats on another great quarter here. My first question is around
Navitaire. What kind of contribution did that provide revenue margin and EPS before? And I assume this is cash flow
to the company over and above that $4 billion number. And are you planning on anything special for that?
<A - David P. Rowland>: We have not disclosed previously, and so I don't think we would do it now in terms of the
economics, the full economics of Navitaire as we owned it. I think from a revenue standpoint, we did give the size, or
we did not give the size. No, so, Ed, we've not commented on that so I'm not going to do that now.
In terms of the proceeds from Navitaire, we just put that in the mix, and it's in the mix of our capital allocation plan.
And we look at that in the mix and then execute our capital allocation strategy against our total cash, of which Navitaire
is now a piece of that. But we don't think about carving it out and saying now how are we going to use this piece

and then the follow-on question is your balance cash levels have gone steadily down over the last few years. Is there
some minimal level of cash that you're targeting?
<A - David P. Rowland>: So we are very comfortable against what we view our minimum level of cash to be, and so
we are not concerned at all about our cash balance and in any way don't think that we are touching or have any issues in
terms of the minimum cash that we need to run the business. Navitaire (sic) [A portion of the Navitaire transaction that
is related to our ongoing services agreement] is in our free cash guidance, so it is part of the mix. But we're very
pleased with our cash position. I mean we anticipated that it would – it's progressing exactly as we anticipated and we
think by the end of the year will be – our cash balance will be pretty close to where we started. So we're at a very strong
cash position. And of course we have a lot of opportunities for other sources of capital should we ever decide that we
need to do so.
<Q - Edward S. Caso>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.

All right. It's time to wrap up and thanks again for joining us on today's call. Just saying a few words in closing and
especially when I see the momentum we have created in our business, when I see our rotation to the new and our gains
in market share combined with our continued investment to build a more differentiated Accenture frontier, I feel very
confident in our ability to deliver against our revised business outlook for fiscal year 2016, and importantly, to continue
delivering value for clients for our people and for our shareholders. So we look forward to talking with you again next
quarter. In the meantime, if you have any questions, feel free to call KC. All the best to all of you.
