MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to the EMC Q4 2013 earnings conference call. All participants are in a listen-only mode
until the question-and-answer portion of today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have any
objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Tony Takazawa, VP of Global Investor Relations of EMC. Thank you, you
may begin.
Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you, good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and year 2013.
Today we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO Joe Tucci, and David Goulden, EMC's CFO and CEO of the EMC
Information Infrastructure [EMCii] business. Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the trends happening in IT,
EMC's vision and strategy, and how the EMC federation is managing the transition to the third platform. David will
then make a few comments on our results and provide a bit more color and detail around the factors contributing to our
results. He will also discuss our outlook for the year 2014. After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to
take your questions.
We are providing you with our projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out the key assumptions and
discrete financial expectations that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful
in understanding our assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your
models. This model is available as background in today's slides available for download in the Investor Relations section
of EMC.com.
Please note that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's presentation unless otherwise indicated. The
reconciliation of our non-GAAP comments to our GAAP results can be found in the disclosure in today's press release,

Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's call. Thank you all for joining us.
Overall, I am pleased with our Q4 results, as our year-over-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS both grew at 11%. This
acceleration of our top line growth was broad-based across majority of our businesses, a clear sign that our strategy,
products, and business model is resonating well with our customers, and their confidence in us is resulting in strong
market share gains against our large competitors.
Looking briefly at 2013 as a whole, we came in pretty much in line with what we told you at our last call in October:
revenue of $23.22 billion, up 7%; non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up 6%; and we produced slightly more than $5.5 billion in
free cash flow.
As I said last quarter, we are disappointed we didn't hit our original goals of $23.5 billion in revenue and $1.85 per
share. We are, however, proud that we did hit our $5.5 billion free cash flow goal, grew revenue considerably faster
than the markets we serve and substantially faster than the overall IT market. And we did this while investing heavily
in our future, a future that focuses on higher growth markets. I would like to thank the 63,000-plus people of EMC,
VMware and Pivotal, and our value-added partners all over the world for their hard work and dedication to the success
of our customers.
I would like to give you our view of what is happening in the IT market right now. To be clear, the IT market is going
through the biggest, most disruptive, and yet most opportunistic transition in its 60-plus year history. And at this
particular time, the pace of this transition is accelerating.
As we have said before, this IT transition is being driven by several key macro trends. The first is mobile. Smartphones,
tablets, and new PC form factors are only the beginning. This trend will accelerate as sensors and telemetry get built
into almost every imaginable product that will collectively spew out massive amounts of data. This massive amount of
data will be stored and processed in a new hyperscale data center paradigm, which will encompass both private and
public clouds.
This move to cloud computing is the second macro trend driving IT. There will be tens of thousands of private clouds
along with thousands of public clouds which will be powered by a new software-defined data center model featuring
new levels of virtualization, automation, efficiency, and agility.
The third macro trend is called big data, the ability to reason over multi-petabyte, even an exabyte scale of data that is
stored in these new clouds quickly and affordably, allowing businesses or any enterprise to make more and better
customer intimate decisions faster.
And building on these first three macro trends, mobile, cloud computing, and big data, is the coming of the Internet of
Things, where billions of devices will be connected to the Internet, dramatically increasing the amount of data that will
need to be digested and the speed at which it will need to be processed. But it is not enough just to ingest and analyze
this data. It needs to be acted upon, and this means building a new generation of applications quickly and agilely. The
ability to analyze massive amounts of information and act in real time will change every business model and process in
virtually every enterprise in almost every industry.
And the fourth important macro IT trend is social networking, which is changing the way humans communicate and
interact. Collectively, these four macro trends are shaping what is being called the third-platform IT. With that said,

there's a fifth important element that is a critical success factor for this third IT platform, and that fifth element is all
about the establishment of security, privacy, and trust.
So what is the EMC Squared family of companies doing to capitalize on this dramatic shift to the third IT platform and
to make sure we ride the opportunistic side of this huge wave of change? In mobile, VMware has entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire AirWatch, the leader in enterprise mobile management and mobile security. With this
acquisition, VMware is adding a fundamental element to its End User Computing portfolio that will accelerate their
strategy and enable us to deliver a complete and improved enterprise-class solution for empowering the mobile
workforce.
In cloud computing, we're driving the software defined data center into private and public clouds, and I emphasize the
word "and". VMware is leading this charge and leveraging their position of over 40 million virtual machines in more
than 500,000 enterprises with their industry-leading vSphere Hypervisor, their innovative NSX software-defined
networking, and their game-changing automation technologies. EMCii is cooperating closely with VMware and is
leading with their software-defined storage technology, ViPR. And EMCii is also partnering with VMware on its vSAN
software. If customers choice, vSphere, NSX, and ViPR will work in either a VMware or an open stack based cloud
environment. Collectively, no other company is in a better position to drive the software-defined data center than we
are.
As I alluded to, EMC and VMware must play in both the private and public side of this immense cloud computing
opportunity. We call this our Hybrid Cloud Initiative. Together, VMware and EMC will offer a host of solutions via
our own vCHS [vCloud Hybrid Service] cloud and, very importantly, also with and through our highly valued service
provider partners. These solutions include a broad range of production cloud services and a number of specialized
services, including disaster recovery and business continuity, test and development, backup and archive,
Desktop-as-a-Service, Cloud Foundry-as-a-Service, mobile management and security, Syncplicity file sync-and-share
services, Object and other storage related offerings, security and analytics services leveraging our RSA and Pivotal
offerings, and we will add more services in the future that leverage the technologies we have throughout our family.
And in big data, Pivotal, along with a host of leading and full partners, like IBM, SAP, Intel, GE, NTT, Accenture,
Verizon, and more will support and contribute Cloud Foundry, an open platform for developing and operating new
cloud applications that can be run on multiple leading private and public clouds in addition to our own and not lock a
customer into any one particular.
On top of this platform, Pivotal will offer its own suite of big and fast data capabilities, featuring game-changing
innovations that use HDFS [Hadoop Distributed File System] and scale-out processing technologies. Pivotal Labs, the
customer development arm of Pivotal, will help existing customers and digital era startups build industrial strength
applications with more agility, much faster, with better quality. EMCii with its ViPR, HDFS, and Nile storage products
and services will team with Pivotal and help our customers build out their new massive data lakes. These data lakes
will be the foundation for the big data analytics platform and technologies which I just mentioned.
Additionally, EMCii is investing heavily in other important third-platform technologies in areas like flash, hybrid disk
and flash arrays with unmatched functionality and services and next generation of disaster recovery and business
continuity technologies, and in converged infrastructures with VCE, VSPEX, and the coming VSPEX.next.
There's one additional implication that I would like to discuss, and that is the incredibly important and tough job that
CIOs have right now. CIOs not only have to help their companies form new, more software and services oriented
business models and revenue streams, they have to support the IT workloads that run their businesses or enterprises
today. And today's applications and workloads primarily run on Platform 2 client-server architectures. And ironically,
demand here is also growing. But to fund their new Platform 3 business transformation and future, CIOs have to find
efficiencies in their current IT environment. In other words, CIOs today need to play in two IT worlds as they plan a
journey to a new platform and execute flawlessly every step of the way; again, a tough job.
And here our technologies and people can help. The technologies we have in mobile, in the software-defined data
center, in storage, in converged infrastructure and analytics, in security, and in the hybrid cloud are technologies that

are applicable to both Platform 2 and Platform 3 needs and very much help CIOs to drive the OpEx and CapEx cost
efficiencies they need.
I would like to close with a few comments on our EMC Squared federation business model, a model built for this
rapidly changing IT world. I have outlined the rich opportunity before us along with the strong position we have with
our innovative and leading technology and product portfolios. I have also commented on the disruption that many IT
companies will feel. Make no mistake; there will be big winners and big losers.
So what is the power of the federation? Simply, it will help us win. This year, collectively, we will spend $3 billion on
a cash basis on R&D. This affords us approximately 15,000 innovative engineers to power a third platform and bridge
technologies. We have almost 20,000 talented people in sales and marketing that will help guide our customers on their
IT journey. We have another 20,000 very technical people in our services organization to help our customers get the
best experience possible. We have roughly $16 billion in cash, approximately $7.5 billion in the U.S. after repaying the
convertible debt. This along with our cash flow will allow us to return cash to our shareholders through our dividend
and buyback programs and gives us the ability to acquire technology that will help fuel our growth. We have more than
8,200 patents issued and pending to protect our intellectual property and rich technology suite.
Our model has yielded us terrific leaders like our CEOs, Paul Maritz, Pat Gelsinger and David Goulden, and a deep
bench under them, and has enhanced our ability to recruit and retain top talent. It gives us more focus on our missions.
And perhaps most importantly, it provides customers with a deep and rich technology stack while giving them choice
as each of our companies will continue to work with other players in the IT ecosystem, the best of both worlds.
For sure, our model is contributing in a major way to our growing strategic relevance in the minds of our customers and
prospective customers. It's a real differentiator.
With that, I would now like to thank you and hand it over to David for his comments. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, EMC achieved revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%. And in a year in which IT
spending was lighter than expected and several of our large tech peers declined, we achieved relatively strong top line
growth of 7%, non-GAAP EPS growth of 6%, and free cash flow growth of 10%. This increase in revenue for the full
year reflects growth across the federation, as Pivotal grew 15%, VMware grew 15%, and EMC Information
Infrastructure grew at 5%.
Together, this outperformance relative to the industry demonstrates the strength of our strategy. We're making the right
bets, investing in the best technology, and building the most complete portfolio to transition customers from the second
to the mobile social cloud and big data-driven third platform of IT. As a result, we feel very good about where we are
right now and where we go from here.
The second platform of IT continues to support the vast majority of enterprise workloads, and customers continue to
add to these environments. We are a market leader here and we'll continue to gain share in the second platform. At the
same time, we have more plays in the third platform of IT than anyone else, and establishing this beachhead helps
ensure our market leadership will extend far into the future.
And we are better equipped than anybody else to help customers bridge the gap as they transition from second to third
platform with technology like converged infrastructure where we're the market leader, ViPR where we're unique in our
ability to provide such far-reaching and sophisticated software-defined storage, and the software-defined data center
capabilities of the vCloud Suite.
While much of what we've been prepared for is playing out, no one can predict exactly how fast this transition to the
third platform will occur. In 2013 we saw faster than expected growth from the technologies aligned with the third
platform and slightly slower growth than we expected in offerings that are more associated with the second platform.

That said, we achieved growth in all the major lines of our EMCii business and VMware in Q4 and in every major
geography. And for the year, all our major lines of business performed right in line with the growth ranges we laid out
for you last March.
As we look at our results this morning, I will talk first about the progress made by each of the three businesses within
the EMC federation, with the business I head up, EMCii coming last. I'll then close my comments today by talking
about the financial results of the federation as a whole.
Turning first to Pivotal and its differentiated software and services portfolio, in the nine months since formation,
Pivotal met all the objectives we set out for the company in 2013. Pivotal met its financial goals, put a strong executive
leadership team in place, and launched an integrated technology platform in the form of Pivotal One. The basis of
Pivotal One, Cloud Foundry, is gaining momentum to become the standard for Platform-as-a-Service [PaaS], with
industry leaders such as GE, IBM, SAP, NTT, Intel, Symantec, Orange, Verizon, and Swisscom all having committed
to the Cloud Foundry platform. With customers' desires to build out their new applications on more open standards and
avoid vender lock-in, we expect to grow this list to several times this number over the course of 2014.
In addition to establishing Cloud Foundry as the industry standard path in 2014, we're also concentrating our efforts on
providing the software and value-added services supporting our Pivotal One platform and big data analytics solutions.
Pivotal has the modern data and application fabrics that enterprises are looking for to build their third-platform
applications, and we expect demand for Pivotal's offerings to grow over 30% in 2014.
We also expect for Pivotal to start building a strong subscription oriented license revenue stream in 2014, which will
lead to reporting revenue growth being less than its 30% bookings growth expectation while also developing a strong
deferred revenue balance by the end of the year. What is most important here is market adoption. As our storage,
security, and VMware customers build out third-platform technologies to drive competitive advantages for their
business, Pivotal is already proving to be an invaluable asset.
VMware also achieved its goals for 2013, as the virtualization foundation laid by VMware years ago is proving to be a
solid platform for continued growth. The management automation features that fully leverage the benefits of
virtualization are in high demand. Management automation was once again VMware's fastest growing product group,
with management license bookings up over 40% for the full year. With this progress, VMware is setting the stage for
the build-outs of the software-defined data centers that we believe will become standard in IT over the next few years.
VMware's advanced management capabilities and long history of rock-solid technology have established a level of trust
with customers that is hard for competitors or build your own solutions to match. This positions VMware well for
success on every level, from software-defined data centers [SDDC] to hybrid cloud to end-user computing.
VMware's success in each of these areas contributes to the success of the federation as a whole. ViPR, for example,
will provide the major software-defined storage component in the VMware SDDC environments. VNX, the most
prevalent storage array behind VMware environments, stands to benefit from the growth of vCHS. And XtremIO's
largest use case is VDI.
VMware just doubled down in end-user computing with the acquisition of AirWatch, the world's largest mobile
security and enterprise mobility management provider. With this acquisition, VMware is adding a foundational element
to their End User Computing portfolio that will accelerate their strategy and enable us to deliver a complete and proven
enterprise-class solution for empowering the mobile workforce.
Now turning to EMC's Information Infrastructure business, where I'll drill down into a little more detail, EMCii
continues to lead with our portfolio of best-of-breed storage for traditional workloads as well as for third-platform
applications. Advanced data-driven security and competent management solutions are increasingly mobile first and
cloud based.
Storage revenue growth accelerated as expected in Q4 to 10%, bringing full-year revenue growth in storage to 4%. Q4
growth was driven by our smaller but much faster growing emerging storage offerings and complemented by
accelerated growth and what we believe to be continued steady share gains by our VMAX, VNX, and backup solutions.

Our emerging storage products achieved revenues of $1.5 billion in 2013. Revenue growth for the products in this
group accelerated in Q4 to 73% year on year, propelled by the very successful launch of XtremIO as well as continued
strong growth of Isilon, Atmos, and VPLEX. After less than two months of general availability, XtremIO has
catapulted to a market leading position. By any measure, bookings or revenue, we believe XtremIO has comfortably
surpassed every other all-flash array because it offers incredible value, a powerful scalar architecture that outperforms
the competition, incredible capacity utilization and efficiency technology with data services that are always on, the
most consistent and predictable performance in the industry, and it's easy to use and manage. This momentum is
meaningful in a market that's expected by industry research firm IDC to reach $1.2 billion in 2015.
As scale-out solutions that often support third-platform applications gained traction in the industry, the strong demand
for our Isilon scale-out file and our Atmos distributed object storage solution continues. Service providers are
increasingly accommodating massive amounts of content for their customers. And object storage solutions like Atmos
offer an ideal scale-out platform to do this. In fact, Atmos revenue more than tripled in 2013, largely due to service
provider demand.
Isilon is also in demand for newer use cases. As we saw last quarter, the use of Isilon for big data analytics is by far the
most rapidly expanding use case. Much of this is on Hadoop and in partnership with Pivotal. Isilon has always done
well in TME and continues to drive exceptional growth here in Q4, with demand up almost 40% year on year. At the
same time, verticals more traditional to EMC like healthcare continue to rapidly adopt Isilon as well, with demand from
this vertical up over 40% in Q4.
Our Unified and Backup/Recovery portfolio revenue grew 11% in Q4, with the recent product refreshes in both VNX
and Data Domain clearly helping some here. Our Backup/Recovery business finished 2013 with record-setting
revenues for the quarter and the year. With Data Domain's commanding lead in the market for purpose-built backup
appliances and growth in backup software that continues to outpace the market, our Backup/Recovery solutions are
clearly meeting needs that competitors cannot. We believe our success is due to our ability to accommodate trends like
VM sprawl, the increasing mobility of users, and sheer data growth to levels that make backup and protection more
challenging.
We saw solid growth in our Unified offerings in the first full quarter of availability of the new VNX. VNX is benefiting
from industry trends towards flash and converged infrastructure. The M6 software on the new VNX enhances the value
of flash in the array, as evidenced by the fact that over 70% of next-gen VNXs shipped with flash in the quarter
compared with about 50% on the previous generation.
Converged infrastructures are increasingly popular [indiscernible] (23:20) for VNX. VSPEX referenced architectures
and technology stacks that our partners build around VNX technology have rapidly outpaced the competition. With
demand growth in Q4 more than doubling year on year, VSPEX has rapidly become the market leader in converged
infrastructure referenced architectures, accounting for 45% of the market for these reference architectures. This is
according to industry research firm Gartner, who also recently confirmed that our share of integrated converged
infrastructure systems is even higher. Built around VMAX or VNX with VMware and Cisco, Vblock's share of this
market is over 50%.
Demand growth for Vblocks from VCE exceeded 50% once again in Q4, and the most common storage system inside
Vblocks is VNX. With growth of these new converged infrastructure systems greatly outstripping that of the market for
the individual components, we are confident that our leadership in converged infrastructure will help VNX and VMAX
continue to gain share.
Our high-end storage revenue returned to growth in for Q4 and grew 2% for the full year. VMAX continued to add new
customers in the quarter, primarily with the VMAX 10K. When it comes to mission-critical transaction oriented
workloads with zero or extremely short recovery points and recovery time objectives, nothing else comes close. VMAX
is the gold standard for the highest level of data services and predictable performance for the most highly prized data.
The trust we have earned from customers encouraged them to look at us first as they seek to build out next-gen
infrastructures. Looking ahead to Q1, I'll remind you that VMAX faces a tough compare against the revenue growth it
achieved in Q1 a year ago.

EMC offers this broad range of storage platforms because it's important to have the right tool for the job. And our new
ViPR software-defined storage adds even more value to this portfolio. The ease with which the ViPR controller enables
customers to consistently merge heterogeneous storage environments is an incredibly important value proposition.
ViPR got off to a very strong start in Q4, having amassed almost three times the number of customers originally
targeted for the quarter.
No other storage solution on the market today can help customers bridge from the second to the third platform the way
ViPR can, with a simple, extensible, and open architecture that substantially lowers the cost associated with existing
environments while accommodating new ones. We are fostering adoption in collaboration on ViPR by making the
ViPR controller free to academia and for non-production use and easily available via a simple download.
The ViPR data plane provides you object, HDFS, and other software-defined storage data services that customers can
run on existing arrays or on dense commodity hardware. With the recent addition of ViPR's Hadoop Distributed File
System data service, we're driving even more value as ViPR HDFS used in conjunction with Pivotal will enable
customers to build next-generation data lakes, and we have a very exciting roadmap for ViPR and ViPR-related
products in 2014.
Before I move on from storage, I want to point out how strong our portfolio is going into 2014. We have our new VNX,
our new Data Domain systems, new XtremIO, and new SRM and ViPR suites. We also have a strong product roadmap
you'll hear more about as we go through the year. The breadth and strength of our portfolio helped drive share gains in
2013, and we're confident it will again in 2014.
IT decisions today cannot be made without paying close attention to information security. And RSA continues to
differentiate EMC solutions across the stack with advanced data-driven security. RSA's revenues accelerated once
again in Q4 to 17%, bringing full-year revenue growth to 11%. Over 70% of RSA's revenue now comes from offerings
other than SecurID, and these offerings grew over 25% in Q4.
Security analytics powered by big data is the next big thing in security, and our security analytics products benefited
from this trend in Q4, with revenue growth almost doubling from Q4 year ago. Going forward, we see opportunities
across the federation to leverage our infrastructure, virtualization, and big data analytics technology to further harden
customers IT environments.
Our Information Intelligence Group grew 3% in Q4, driving positive growth for the full year. Our new vertical content
solutions plus xCP and Syncplicity accounted for about 40% of IIG's license bookings in Q4, and these bookings grew
approximately 50% year on year. IIG continues to innovate to meet customers' demand for technologies that work
seamlessly in mobile cloud environments, and we feel good about this transition to these newer solutions sets.
To more effectively bring the full value of our offerings to customers, we're adding new capabilities to our EMCii
go-to-market team. By developing new solutions for areas including private/hybrid clouds, service providers and big
data storage, with product positioning guides tied to use cases and software-oriented selling skills around areas like
ViPR, we expect to continue to drive growth, particularly in new areas of the business.
EMCii's services organization, which provides expertise around the EMCii product set, is becoming increasingly
engaged across the federation. In fact, the three largest wins in Q4 for our consulting business leverage the investments
we've been making to build out the full EMC stack, including the migration of a customer's applications off premise to
one of our key service provider partners, the development of a PaaS and advanced analytics capability with Pivotal, and
VMware's cloud management capabilities over converged infrastructure to enable hybrid cloud and new application
frameworks. We are also supporting a major enterprise that's moving from a public cloud to a new EMC-powered
private cloud for cost and privacy reasons.
Revenue from our service provider partner program continues to grow at several times the rate of our other industry
verticals. This growth has been helped in part by VCE. Vblocks enable service providers to quickly introduce new
services and easily scale services up or down as needed. [ph] Value providers (29:45) are instrumental to service
provider success. In fact, four of VCE's five largest customers in 2013 are service providers buying Vblocks to run

cloud services for their customers.
Our focus on supporting service providers and their cloud initiatives has positioned us well going forward. A great
example of the potential here is with one of our telco service provider partners accommodating one of their customers,
a large company with explosive content growth. The environment for this one customer alone already consists of
thousands of VMs running on more than 4,000 physical servers, 10,000 OS instances, and more than 200,000 disk
drives delivering almost one exabyte of raw storage on dense commodity drives, and we expect this customer will
continue to grow from here.
Trends like software-defined capabilities, converged infrastructure, and hybrid and off-prem cloud will continue to
grow, and we're making significant investments in each of these areas across the EMC Information Infrastructure
business.
Before I conclude my remarks on EMCii, I'd like to take this chance to acknowledge my deep appreciation for the
support of our customers, the commitment of our partners, and most of all for the dedication shown by the entire EMCii
team.
Turning now to our consolidated financial results for the EMC federation, year-on-year revenue growth in the quarter
was 11% to $6.7 billion, supported by growth in all four of our major geographies, with North America up 11%,
EMEA growth continuing to accelerate to 15%, APJ up 1%, up 7% ex-Japan, and Latin America up 12% from last
year's fourth quarter. Our BRIC-plus-13 emerging markets continued to grow faster than our average at 17%.
Looking at the line items that drive our earnings growth, gross margins in Q4 improved from last quarter by 70 basis
points. Compared with Q4 of 2012, gross margins were down by 160 basis points. This was primarily due to Storage,
where gross margins were down by 200 basis points.
Looking at Storage, it's important to note that storage product booking margins were essentially flat year on year.
While the pricing environment is tough, a mix shift towards higher margin business in the quarter offset this pressure.
The margins on revenue we achieved this quarter were impacted by the fact that bookings we were able to ship were
lower margin than last year.
Storage Services gross margins were impacted by higher field service costs compared with Q4 of last year. While this
was a headwind for most of 2013, because we expect a similar level of activity this year, the year-on-year impact to
Storage Services margins should be neutral in 2014.
We continued to make major investments in new business areas, including NSX, vCHS, Pivotal, ViPR, ScaleIO,
XtremIO, and Project Nile. Even with these investments we are making to transition our business to the third platform,
we were able to control operating expenses, which were down 150 basis points for the quarter and 30 basis points for
the year. These good cost controls enabled us to keep non-GAAP operating margins essentially flat for the quarter
versus last year and down slightly for the full year.
Our tax rate for the quarter was consistent with last year's Q4 but came in lower than expected due to mix of
international versus domestic profits. Non-operating expense was up from last year, principally due to interest expense
on the new debt and was lower than expected due to more investment income and FX gains. Our buyback program
added $0.02 in the quarter versus last year. The net growth of the quarter's non-GAAP earnings per share was 11% over
last year to $0.60.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $5.5 billion, up 10%. We ended the year with
$17.6 billion in cash and investments, approximately $7.1 billion of which was U.S.-based ex-VMware. In early
January, we used $1.7 billion of this to retire our remaining convertible debt.
In 2013, we introduced a capital allocation framework that's returning value to our shareholders, with 50% of EMCii's
free cash flow going towards buybacks and dividends over time, with an accelerated buyback program for 2013
through 2015. As part of this program, in Q4 we purchased $1 billion of EMC stock. This brings our EMC buyback to
$3 billion for 2013, about halfway to our $6 billion target. We expect to spend $2 billion on EMC share buybacks in
2014.

We have also generated very attractive ROI on our acquisitions. Examples include VMware, Data Domain, and Isilon.
We have recently acquired key earlier-stage companies, including XtremIO, Nicira, and the companies that make up
Pivotal. And we've announced the pending acquisition of AirWatch, each of which we expect to produce great ROIs in
the future.
As we look ahead to 2014, we expect IT spend growth and storage growth to be broadly similar to what they were in
2013. So both 2013 and 2014 are expected to be slower spending environments than we anticipated at the start of last
year. However, the macro trends in IT that we discussed are playing out pretty much as we expected, and EMC is
extremely well positioned to help customers optimize and modernize their second platform environments, implement
leading-edge third platform solutions, and bridge from second to third.
The accelerating transition in IT means that our higher growth markets are poised to grow faster than we expected a
year ago, and the growth of our more mature markets will be lower than we expected a year ago. With this in mind, we
expect revenue of $24.5 billion, up 6% year on year, operating margins roughly flat with last year, non-GAAP EPS of
$1.95, up 8% year on year, and free cash flow well in excess of the $5.5 billion we generated in 2013. As is our custom,
the exact free cash flow target will be set at our upcoming board meeting. Note that these expectations do not include
AirWatch, which would add approximately $75 million in revenue and cost approximately $0.05 for non-GAAP EPS
for 2014.
As you are aware, last year we saw extremely high volumes of orders coming in on the last few days of the quarter.
Since this does seem to be the new normal in customer purchasing patterns, we are making permanent changes to our
business practices to mitigate the impact of this hockey stick and reduce our dependency on late orders. These changes
will reduce the extra inventory and factory costs incurred by trying to ship such a high volume of orders in such a short
amount of time and also improve our revenue predictability in the quarter. While this will not affect revenue growth for
the full year, this will change the normal flow of our revenues within this year, with Q1 being about a point lower than
normal at 22% and Q4 a point higher. This will also affect EPS, and we expect to earn about $0.35 per share in Q1
before AirWatch, which would cost us about $0.01 in Q1.
With IT spend off the 3% we were modeling and our revenue growth and expected growth in 2013 and 2014 lower than
we were expecting when we met with you last March, we'll be revising our 2016 revenue growth target, and we'll
update you on this at our next strategic forum. Having said that, the strategy we discussed at the 2013 forum hasn't
changed, and we continue to make significant investments across our business in new and high growth areas. We
continue to expect to grow faster than our IT peers and faster than IT spending.
In closing, we're excited about all we can accomplish in 2014 given our position of strength. We are working with our
very large installed base of loyal customers, with leading-edge technology for every layer of the IT stack; products and
services for the infrastructure layer that include best-of-breed storage arrays, software-defined storage, converged
infrastructure, and information security; solutions for the virtualization layer that enable the software defined data
center, hybrid cloud, and end-user computing, with over 40 million virtual machines powering the world's largest
organizations; and a cloud-agnostic Platform-as-a-Service offering that in less than a year has become the power
offering of choice for enterprises looking to build out next-gen apps that harness the power of big data. This
combination gives us a strong play in the second platform, which will continue to support the majority of enterprise
workloads for several years to come, leading technologies and products for the third platform, and a powerful
capability to bridge the gap between the two.
With that, I'll turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&A. Tony?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I had a question just around the March quarter guide. I
want to understand if it actually includes the $100 million to $120 million of restructuring initiatives that you guys have
talked about today. And if so, what sort of payback are you expecting out of that initiative and when do you expect
those savings? And is that really the driver for the permanent changes you talked about to prevent the back-end loaded
nature of the quarters you have experienced in 2013?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Amit, this is David, let me take that. Good morning. Think of the restructure as more of a
rebalancing activity, very similar to what we did last year within EMC Information Infrastructure. As we continue to
move more of our people into third platform oriented parts of the business, we have had to proactively reduce resources
in some areas, build the resources in other areas. Last year when we did this, we actually wound up with about 2,000
people more at the end of the year than we started off with. This year we expect to probably end the year flat or slightly
up in EMC Information Infrastructure. So think of it as a rebalancing rather than a restructuring. The impact of that is
factored into the Q1 guide.
That is not related to what I talked about in terms of the quarter-end business practices. The quarter-end business
practices, which have really impacted the Q1 revenue guide, is the fact that we are changing the way we want to run the
factories at quarter end, reduce our inventory levels, reduce the amount of overtime, expedite shipping costs, et cetera,
which will result as a byproduct in a higher volume of orders we cannot ship during the quarter, or said differently, a
higher backlog. And that higher backlog as a result of the new business practices are what is driving the Q1 revenue
guide. To tie those two back together, there's probably a little bit of the rebalancing charge that ties to that, but only a
minor, minor part.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Got it, thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Amit; next question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is Alex Kurtz of Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. David, just looking at the Q1 guide and thinking about the year
here, I'm trying to factor your new strategy on the month-three practices versus the broader concept of a product refresh
in VNX, XtremIO, and potentially a refresh of VMAX. Historically, those have been catalysts for product growth, and
I'm trying to understand. Why wouldn't those help the first half of the year, balancing that against your guidance here?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Alex, they absolutely will help. What we have is this effect, so the new products are
definitely going to help us from an order flow point of view going through the year. And as I mentioned, we enter the
year this year with a really strong portfolio. I'd say stronger than the same time last year, so that's going to help in the
absolute sense and also help with just taking share during the year. But again, the factors that we're talking about are
going to drive us with a higher percentage of those orders that we cannot ship during the year. Particularly in Q1, you'll
see the impact of that.
What I will point out, this will not impact the full year because the business practices that I'm talking about are actually
the way that we end our fourth quarter anyway. So said differently, we are applying some of the ways that we close our
fourth quarter where we do not try and ship everything that comes out in the last few days of the quarter, and we're
taking that practice and applying it to the other three quarters of the year. So that's why you see the seasonal impact
occur in Q1 but not impacting the revenue guide for the full year.

So back to Q1, the reason for the difference in the revenue level from an average to the actual guided number has really
to do with these changes in business practices. And you're right; we'll see some benefit from order flow during the
quarter that will be matched by the business practices change in the revenue.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Thanks.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Alex; next question please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is Keith Bachman of Bank of Montréal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, David. I wanted to see if you could revisit on the gross margins in Q4. I wasn't entirely
clear about why gross margins were down. And what we had heard was it was a bit more aggressive than normal this
quarter in terms of pricing. So if you could, address the storage products. And within the context of answering again
why gross margins are down, could you speak to, against the backdrop of your operating margin target for calendar
year 2014 of being 25%? How should we think about gross margins in calendar year 2014 both on a consolidated level
and at the storage products level? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Okay. Keith, obviously multiple parts there, but let me address the various aspects because
I'm sure they'll come out at some point in time during the conversation this morning, so let me recap. The reason why
gross margins were down in Q4 was related to the Storage business. There were two factors that impacted the Storage
business. The first is Storage product margins. It's very important to understand that the booking margin, so the margin
we got on the orders that we took in, was essentially flat year on year in the fourth quarter. So we did see some pricing
pressure, but we are able offset that with positive mix towards our software and higher-margin products, so our booking
margin was flat...
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - David I. Goulden>: ...is the most important point. The reason why the revenue margin was down is of those
bookings, the revenue that we took of those bookings that we took to revenue this quarter, the mix of those was lower
margin than the bookings we took to revenue last quarter, so you saw essentially flat bookings turn into a lower
revenue margin because of the mix. Ergo, we obviously had higher margins in backlog exiting this year than last year
we did exiting 2012. That's what the really major driver is.
Now the other driver of margins is what's been happening all year in the Services business. We've mentioned to you on
a few occasions in our maintenance business, we've had a higher level of field service activity due to some components
out there in our products, which have brought margins down on services. So that's the story this year.
Now fast-forward into next year. What we expect at the EMCii and therefore at the Storage level is approximately flat
gross margins for a couple of reasons. One is that year on year, those service activities are expected to normalize out.
And then if you think of the things that have been impacting us this year on the product side, it's been higher
quarter-end closing costs, and we're taking steps to impact those. And then of course we've got the issue that impacts us
in Q4 that doesn't really drive a huge amount of change for the full year in 2014. So we're expecting going forward in
2014 at the EMCii level relatively flat gross margins, relatively flat operating margins. And at the consolidated level,
due to the mix shift towards VMware, we're expecting both gross margins and OpEx to be up slightly and giving us a
slight boost in operating margins.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Thank you, David.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Keith; next question please.

Thank you. The next question is Shebly Seyrafi of FBN Securities.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Yes, thank you. So your guidance for the year of $24.5 billion, I think it's below the consensus
of $25 billion. You seem to indicate that you're going to be below your prior plan because of these inter-quarter
inventory rebalances in Q1 but make up for it in Q4. But it seems to me that if you look at – or if you take VMware's
guidance last night and make reasonable assumptions on EMCii and Pivotal and Security, it seems like the Storage
revenue growth, which was about 5% per year in 2012 and 2013, is going to decelerate to like 2%, and so it seems like
fiscal Q4 won't make up for the below expected results in fiscal Q1. I'm wondering if there are other factors explaining
this. Are you seeing the storage market slowing down because of the movement to the cloud and other factors? Are
you, in fact, saying or believe that your Storage segment will decelerate to roughly 1% to 2% from 5%?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Shebly, let me talk to you about that. So the historic numbers for the Storage segment are
correct. It's 5% in 2012. It's actually 4% in 2013. And the guidance is based upon a 3% number in 2014, not the 2%
number which you mentioned. You have to make some adjustments from VMware standalone to VMware inside EMC,
et cetera, to get the numbers to add together.
Relative to what's happening, we are, as I said, expecting IT spend growth and storage spend growth to be relatively
similar to what they were this year, so market conditions relatively are the same. The reason for the slight deceleration
in the Storage business growth in 2014 is really due to rebalancing of the revenue growth rates between products and
services. For the last couple years, as we've been really maximizing the potential of our installed base from a
maintenance point of view, you've seen services revenue grow a lot faster than product revenue. So for example, in
2012 you saw a wide disparance between those two. As we go forward into 2014, we've really captured that
opportunity. We expect those rates to normalize. So the product revenue growth across those three years is actually
relatively consistent. And that is really the biggest reason why you are seeing a slight deceleration in 2014 versus 2013
in the Storage business.
<Q - Shebly Seyrafi>: Thanks.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Shebly; next question please.
Operator
Thank you, next question is Brian Marshall of ISI Group.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. It seems like the last couple quarters we've had a little bit of difficulty
forecasting intra-quarter metrics. In September it was obviously mix related and some push-outs into the December
quarter. And then this quarter, obviously the margins with respect to what was shipped and actually what was booked
seemed to be off by a decent amount. Can you talk about any actions, if possible, with respect to quarter-end business
practices at the company that may alleviate some of these anomalies that we've seen over the past six months? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Brian, that really comes back to the first thing I talked about in terms of changing our
quarter-end practices, particularly relative to quarters one, two, and three, and basically having a more measured
quarter-end process where we're not carrying as much inventory, we are not having as much factory overtime, we're not
as dependent upon shipping as high a percentage of the orders that come in, in the last week as we used to be. That
should help with cost. It should help with predictability. That really is the change that we're making.
Now as I mentioned and you said, there has been a factor in Q4. We're not changing our Q4 end of quarter because we
carry a more meaningful backlog at Q4 end. But we do believe that as we implement these new processes, we're going
to actually take a lot of stress out of the system and make the results in the quarter much more predictable.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Thanks, David.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Let me just add a little color. This is Joe. If you looked at this time of the year and going back
to 2012, the analyst expectation for growth for macro IT was 3% to 4%, and it ended up doing a tick below 3%. If you
go back a year, the analyst expectation for 2013 was 3%. We did about 2%. Now this year, the analyst expectations are

3% to 4%, and we're still staying at 2%, and we're going to stay at 2% until we see the whites of the market's eyes.
Why, because it was a little bit off the last two years. That said, I personally see more upside to that 2% that we're
calling than downside, which I probably wouldn't have said the last two years.
And what David said is and exactly to the point you're making, we just have to get – it's going to be very good for the
business what David's leading to build bigger backlogs. So our bookings rate and our revenue rate will not be the same
as it's been pretty much the last few years. We're going to try to keep more bookings, which basically will let us have
more efficiencies and I think more predictability in the business. And I think you as investors and people that watch us
will be happier as we get into that trend. Obviously, you've got to take some medicine, and that's what we're telling you
we're taking. And then I gave you my view on the market growth and forecast and how we're viewing it and the fact
that I see more upside to that 2% then downside.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Thanks, Joe.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks for the question, Brian; next question please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I want to go back to that previous point. This is a question for Joe and David, I
guess. Going back to the issue of just the product revenue growth of being around 3% this year, David, I guess you said
at various points, you're very confident about your product portfolio. If I think about 2014, VNX2 was slightly delayed,
it sounded like, so that should have a full-year impact this year. You've got the impact of XtremIO, which seems to be
going quite well. On top of that, you're going to probably have a refresh I imagine in the middle of the year in several
of your product lines. So why can't you gain more share than that revenue growth implies, or are you being very
conservative? How have you thought about the capacity to gain share? And I'm thinking about that in the context of the
comments you made about the pricing environment. It sounds like it's a bit more challenging than it maybe has been for
a few quarters. Many thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, Kulbinder, we are taking a conservative view of what we think the market growth will
be, and we expect to gain share against that market. Obviously, there are a number of things in our favor. Our product
cycle is very strong. We also recognize that CIOs right now are being very cautious in their spend. Joe talks about the
real challenge that a CIO is facing in terms of trying to figure out how they're going to play in the third platform, which
is still in the early innings, how they really get cost out of their second platform or drive efficiency in their second
platform infrastructure. So what we're seeing is a little bit of a pause in the market as people work through how this
transition impacts what they're spending. More people are spending just enough and being a little bit cautious about
rolling out quite as many big projects as they used to. So we're really factoring what we're seeing in the market and the
dilemma that the CIOs are facing into our thoughts about how the year might in fact play out.
So we're taking a conservative view of IT spending. We're taking a conservative view of how rapidly people spend in
both existing areas and new areas. And of course, we've got a lot of things going for us. It's not by accident that we
gained a lot of share in 2013 in Storage. We gained share because we've got the strongest portfolio, the most complete
portfolio with a market leading converged infrastructure. And those are the reasons why we gained share, the best
go-to-market team out there, the best Services team. And those things are all factors for us in 2014. So we are
confident; we're just being a little bit cautious about the spending environment.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I think if you look at it, David used the word cautious, but prudent also. If you just look at Q4,
we just grew top line and EPS at 11%. And you look at our peers across the industry, there's just nobody doing that.
And then basically we told you in the revenue, we took a richer – there was a richer mix of margin that was taken into
Q1 in 2014.
If you look at our new businesses, stuff that we do sell totally in what we now term as Platform 3, that was a $2 billion
run rate that grew over – that had 70% growth. Look at the value that those kind of companies are getting in the

marketplace today. We're in a great position. Basically, we're just going to get a more rational operating model, which I
think we'll pick up revenue. We'll pick up profit and make us more predictable going forward, which I think the
investors are going to like. We just have to transition to that. But I'm very optimistic about 2014 and our opportunities.

Thank you. The next question is Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yes. Thanks. Joe, obviously you can't really talk about it before you do it. But in terms of what
you laid out in the beginning, what does that say about EMC's acquisition strategy and as you balance the cash return to
shareholders versus the gaps in your portfolio? Sometimes in the past you've actually been pretty forthright saying you
need some things in security or some other areas. And I was just wondering if you could give us some color on what
EMC's acquisition strategy might be as you attack those opportunities and try to revive growth, obviously outside of
AirWatch with VMware, which we already know about, and how you think about that. Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: We're in a market where the vast majority, probably 90% of the growth going forward, is
going to be in what we term Platform 3. And I went through all the assets; I won't do it again – I'll spare you – that we
have that's relevant to Platform 3 inside EMCii, inside our Security business, inside VMware, inside Pivotal, and the
way we're playing that together and the way we're giving customers choice. And that's where we're going to make
investments.
I'm not a big believer in defensive investments. We're also going to really make sure we return cash to shareholders and
continue those programs. And we've got a good balance. And that's where I'm spending a lot of my time. I'm spending a
lot of my time on strategy and strategic alignment across the businesses, on talent acquisition, on capital allocation, on
M&A. And obviously a lot of times I always deal with customers. I really can't, as you predicted, answer your question
directly, but I gave you a feel for the way I'm thinking a little bit, which is the way the company is thinking.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: We have time for one more question and then a few concluding comments from Joe.
Operator
All right, thank you. Our final question is from Scott Craig of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Thanks, good morning. David, Can you just talk about the restructuring and how you think
about dropping the savings to the bottom line and maybe quantify the savings as opposed to reinvesting in the business
for growth and how that plays out on a linearity basis as you look through the calendar year? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, Scott. Thank you. As I mentioned a little bit earlier, really think of it as a rebalancing
activity. We talked about this huge transition from the second platform to a third platform, and it's basically part of
helping to fund the investments we are making in the third platform. So it is rebalancing of activities. It's not a
restructuring just for the sake of getting costs out. We're going to reinvest those savings back in the business to support
many of the third-platform initiatives that we talked about. It's very similar to what we did last year.
To make it clear, for EMCii, what we're doing this year is almost a mirror image of what we did last year in terms of
the size of the rebalancing charge we're going to take in the first quarter, the amount of rebalancing we expect to do
during the year. So it really is a way to fund the reinvestments we're making in the business in the new areas. And as

we talked about before, the new areas are either growing exceptionally quickly or have great potential. So we think it's
a very prudent thing to do. Again, it's rebalancing as opposed to restructuring.
<Q - Scott D. Craig>: Okay, thanks for the clarification.
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you all, again, for joining us. I truly believe across our family of companies we had a really solid close to 2013.
As I said, our strategic relevance with customers is very high and never been higher. When customers take their
pilgrimage of what companies they want to look at, we are on those lists consistently now. We have technologies and
the people to help customers balance, to help our CIOs and customers balance to basically make sure they optimize
what they have today and build a bridge and a journey to the future in the third platform. We have that all-important
momentum and we have a great team to execute on it. So I really appreciate you being with us today and thank you for
your confidence in us. And we'll be talking to you, thank you.
