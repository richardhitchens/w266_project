I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf.
John G. Stumpf
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter as our
diversified business model continued to generate strong loan and deposit growth. Our financial strength and
competitive position have allowed us to capture opportunities for growth, both organically and through acquisitions. In
addition, our commitment to managing risk and a benefit of an improving housing market continued to improve our
credit results. Let me highlight our growth this quarter compared with one year ago.
We earned $1.03 in earnings per share, up 2% from a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 1% from a
year ago, with 4% growth in net interest income. We had broad-based loan growth with total loans reaching a record
$888.5 billion, and our core loan portfolio increased by $68.5 billion or 9%. Our growth benefited from the $11.5
billion GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction in the second quarter.
Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balance growth, with average deposits up $83.8 billion
or 8%, while we reduced deposit costs. We also grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%.
Our credit performance continued to improve and our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans,
the lowest level in 20 years. Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our
shareholders remains a priority. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 7% to $0.375 per common share, and we
repurchased 36 million shares of common stock. We've reduced our common shares outstanding for five consecutive
quarters with shares down 105 million from one year ago.
While recent developments in Europe and Asia have implications for the U.S. economy, the ongoing U.S. economic
expansion has remained on track and has entered its 7th year, a feat accomplished only four other times in U.S. history.
The labor market continued to recover with a record 57 consecutive months of payroll gains, and housing activity has
been especially encouraging with second quarter position to be the best quarter for home sales since 2007.
These factors, along with an increase in consumer confidence, makes me optimistic that the economic expansion will
sustain momentum into the second half of the year, and Wells Fargo should benefit from the increase in economic
activity as we remain focused on meeting our customers' financial needs.
John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our second quarter results. John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly
supplement starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions.
Our results this quarter are straightforward and demonstrate momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We
continued to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified businesses. We grew net interest income with
earning asset growth and our net interest margin improved. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong
fee growth. Credit quality improved, and we had lower net charge-offs and a higher reserve release. And we continued
to operate within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE and efficiency. Let me now highlight these key drivers in more
detail.
On page three, we highlight the year-over-year growth John emphasized in his remarks, including revenue, loans,
deposits and EPS, as well as improving credit. Turning to page four, we continued to benefit from the strength of our
balance sheet, which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities and to prudently deploy
liquidity. Short-term investments in Fed funds sold were down $59.1 billion from first quarter, reflecting loan growth,

security purchases and lower deposit balances, driven by seasonality in our consumer businesses and repricing in
certain Wholesale businesses. Our securities portfolio grew $16 billion from first quarter. We purchased approximately
$36 billion in securities, primarily agency MBS, U.S. treasuries and municipal securities, which were partially offset by
maturities, amortization and sales.
Turning to the income statement on page five, it's important to note that the linked quarter decline in earnings was
driven by the $359 million discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. Our pre-tax earnings increased $386
million or 5% from first quarter, demonstrating the underlying momentum we had across our businesses. Revenue
increased $40 million from first quarter with strong growth in net interest income, up $284 million, reflecting growth in
earning assets. We had linked quarter growth in fee income in most of our customer-facing businesses, including
deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, merchant processing, commercial real estate brokerage,
mortgage and insurance. However, noninterest income declined $244 million from first quarter due to lower market
sensitive revenue and lower other income, driven by the accounting impact related to our debt hedges. Expenses
declined despite an increase in operating losses related to litigation accruals, and we generated positive operating
leverage.
As shown on page six, we continued to have strong loan growth in the second quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter of
year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $68.5 billion, or 9% from a year ago, and was up $29.5 billion
from first quarter. Our growth was broad-based, which I'll highlight on the next slide, and included $11.5 billion from
the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction. This transaction is an excellent example of how the
combination of our balance sheet strength, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to
capture opportunities for growth. 67% of this portfolio is U.S.-based with the remainder of the portfolio predominantly
in the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us. The loans we purchased were to over 145
different customers.
While we had existing relationships with many of these customers, the transaction has provided us with a meaningful
number of new relationships, which we believe will lead to additional opportunities for new business. It's also
important to note that we didn't acquire these loans until late in the quarter, so while it increased ending loan balances,
most of the benefit to average loans and to net interest income will be reflected in the third quarter.
On page seven, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $36.6 billion or 15% from a year ago.
The GE Capital transaction drove $4.2 billion of this growth primarily from the financing to Blackstone Mortgage
Trust. The rest of the growth was diversified across our Wholesale businesses with double-digit year-over-year growth
in asset-backed finance, equipment finance, corporate banking, and government and institutional banking. Commercial
real estate loans grew $10.2 billion or 8% from a year ago and included $7.3 billion from the GE Capital transaction.
Core 1-to-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in
high-quality nonconforming mortgages. Credit card balances were up $3.9 billion or 14% from a year ago, benefiting
from strong new account growth and the Dillard's portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year. Auto loans
were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. New originations reflected the strong auto market and were up 5% from a
year ago, and up 15% from first quarter, benefiting from seasonality.
As highlighted on page eight, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $83.8 billion from a
year ago, and up $10.5 billion from first quarter. Our average deposit costs declined to 8 basis points, down 2 basis
points from a year ago. The decline in ending balances reflected the seasonal impact to consumer balances due to
income tax payments and repricing in certain Wholesale businesses, primarily Global Financial Institutions.
We continue to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers, which were up 5.6% from a year ago,
and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.3%. Our primary customers have
more products with us and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary customers.
Page nine highlights our revenue diversification, and the balance between spread and fee income, which has shifted
slightly to more net interest income as we benefited from strong earning asset growth. Our earning asset mixed results
in diversified – results from diversified sources of interest income, the drivers of our fee generation are also diverse and
vary based on interest rate and economic conditions. For example, market sensitive revenue, which includes trading

gains from our – trading and gains from our debt and equity investments declined 21% from first quarter. Market
sensitive revenue was 8% of our fee income in the second quarter, down from 11% in the first quarter. However, many
of our other customer facing businesses generated higher fee income.
We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by $524 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth
in average earning assets, up 11% from a year ago. The $312 million increase in net interest income from first quarter
reflected growth in earning assets and one extra day in the quarter. Net interest income also benefited from increased
income from variable sources, lower deposit costs and higher income from interest rate swaps used to convert a portion
of our floating rate commercial loans to fixed rate as we continued to add duration to our balance sheet.
The net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the first quarter. This is the first linked quarter increase in the
NIM since the first quarter of 2012. The increase this quarter was driven by balance sheet repricing and growth,
including growth in investments in loans and lower deposit costs, which benefited the margin by 4 basis points. Higher
variable income from increased loan fees, semi-annual preferred dividends and PCI recoveries contributed one basis
point to the margin. Customer driven deposit growth reduced the margin by 3 basis points, but had minimal impact to
net interest income.
Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates. However, we believe we
can grow net interest income in 2015 compared with 2014 even if rates remain low.
Total noninterest income declined $244 million from first quarter driven by lower market sensitive revenue and lower
other noninterest income. The other noninterest income category was down $426 million in the second quarter driven
by the accounting impact of interest rate and currency hedges associated with our long-term debt. We are required to
measure the hedge effectiveness quarterly, and while the net impact is expected to be zero over their term, quarterly
interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter to quarter.
It's important to note that while total noninterest income declined, if you exclude market sensitive revenue and other
income, we had strong diversified fee growth across our other fee categories, demonstrating growth from doing more
business with our customers. In fact, second quarter was the strongest quarter over the past five quarters for brokerage,
trust and investment management, card, merchant processing, insurance and mortgage origination.
Mortgage banking revenue increased, up $158 million from the first quarter on higher origination volume, up $13
billion or 27%. Second quarter had the highest level of mortgage production since the third quarter of 2013. 54% of
originations were for purchases, up from 45% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a $38 billion application
pipeline, up $8 billion from a year ago and down $6 billion from first quarter. Based on the current rate environment,
the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, we currently expect originations in the
third quarter to be lower than second quarter. Our gain on sale ratio was 188 basis points in the second quarter, and we
currently expect the third quarter ratio to remain within the range of the past five quarters, between 140 basis points and
210 basis points.
As shown on page 12, expenses were down $38 million from the first quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower
employee benefits expense, which was seasonally elevated in the first quarter. Operating losses were $521 million in
the second quarter, up $226 million from the first quarter, reflecting higher litigation accruals for various legal matters.
While we continue to invest in our businesses, reflected in higher professional services and advertising expenses in the
second quarter, we remained focused on operating efficiently, as indicated by our efficiency ratio improving to 58.5%.
We expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55% to 59%.
Turning to our business segment starting on page 13, Community Banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter,
down 8% from first quarter, which included the discrete tax benefit. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our
ability to grow retail bank households. Year-to-date through May, we've had the strongest household growth in four
years. This strong growth reflects our success in attracting new customers to Wells Fargo, as well as the benefit of
better retention of our existing households as we remain focused on meeting their financial needs.

This focus has also resulted in an increase in total products held by our customers. For example, we've been
successfully growing the penetration rate of credit cards to our retail bank households, which has grown to 42.6% in the
second quarter, up from 39% a year ago and 34.9% two years ago.
Credit card purchase volume was up 15% from a year ago, reflecting an increase in new accounts. Debit card purchase
volume was up 8% from a year ago, benefiting from the strong growth in primary checking account customers and
increased usage among existing customers.
Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, up 3% from a year ago and 12% from the first quarter.
Wholesale Banking continued to have strong loan and deposit growth. Average loans grew 12% from a year ago with
broad-based growth across most Wholesale businesses. This growth in average loans did not fully reflect the benefit of
the GE Capital transaction recorded late in the quarter.
Average core deposits grew 14% from a year ago and were flat linked quarter, reflecting pricing actions we took in the
second quarter to reduce deposit costs. The strong loan and deposit growth helps grow revenue by 2% from a year ago.
Treasury Management revenue grew 10%, reflecting new product sales and repricing. Second quarter revenue also
benefited from higher equity gains from the sale of certain equity fund investments driven by the Volcker Rule.
Wealth, Brokerage, and Retirement had another record quarter, earning $602 million in the second quarter, up 11%
from a year ago and up 7% from first quarter. WBR's pre-tax margin was 26% in the second quarter, exceeding its
long-term target of 25%.
Revenue grew 5% from a year ago driven by higher recurring sources of revenue. Net interest income increased 12%
and asset-based fees were up 7%. Brokerage advisory assets grew to $434 billion, up $25 billion or 6% from a year
ago, primarily driven by net flows.
WBR's strong loan growth continued with eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Loan growth
accelerated this quarter, up 16% from a year ago, the strongest growth rate in over six years. Growth was broad-based
with strong client demand across a number of product offerings.
Turning to page 16, credit quality in the second quarter improved. Our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of
average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 11 consecutive quarters and were down $438 million from first
quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $67 million from first quarter as higher energy non-accrual loans were offset by
improvement in residential real estate, as well as other categories.
The reserve release was $350 million in the second quarter. The increase from first quarter was driven by continued
credit quality improvement, most notably significant improvement in residential real estate. Our credit losses in our
residential real estate portfolios declined 22%, and non-accrual loans declined $388 million or 4% from first quarter.
It's important to note that even small changes in the performance of our residential real estate portfolios tend to
outweigh changes in other portfolios given the size of our residential real estate portfolio, which is 36% of total loans.
We had an increase in non-performing loans in our energy portfolio. Oil and gas loans are only 2% of our total loan
portfolio and balances in this portfolio declined by approximately $700 million from first quarter, reflecting pay downs.
Our energy team completed their spring redetermination process during the second quarter, and as expected, the drop in
energy prices did impact the cash flow and collateral values of a number of our borrowers, leading to downward
portfolio migrations. The deterioration in this portfolio is reflected in our allowance for credit losses and we will
continue to monitor the energy portfolio.
Finally, when considering our allowance, it's important to note that the loans we acquired from GE Capital were
accounted for under purchase accounting, under GAAP, and reflected a lifetime credit loss adjustment, and therefore,
do not require additional loan loss reserves typically associated with commercial loan growth.
Turning to page 17, our capital levels remain strong with our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III
fully phased in at 10.5% in the second quarter. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through

dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 17.7 million shares in the second
quarter, reflecting 36.3 million shares repurchased and 18.6 million shares issued.
We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year.
Our dividend payout ratio increased to 36% in the second quarter as we increased the quarterly dividend rate on our
common stock by 7%.
Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 54%. The decline in our net payout ratio reflected our strong asset and
RWA growth as our first call for capital is for providing credit to our customers. However, we remain committed to
returning capital to our shareholders and we expect our net payout ratio to be within our targeted range of 55% to 75%
for the full year.
In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong loan and
deposit growth and momentum in noninterest income across many of our customer-facing businesses. Our strong
liquidity position and capital levels position us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base
organically and through acquisition.
The improvement in credit quality demonstrated our continued focus on risk management. While the current interest
rate environment remains uncertain, we are actively managing our expenses while focusing on meeting our customers'
financial needs to generate growth.
We will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Good morning there, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: John, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more on your confidence
about the economic environment versus the commentary about the tough competition out there. So, we know you guys
are going to get a great benefit looking ahead from the averaging of the GE. So on, one, could you just kind of flesh out
the pockets of loan growth that you continue to expect? And then also, do you anticipate being able to at least be in the
pole position to get some more of those GE assets? Thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So there are a variety of loan categories that deserve to be mentioned individually, but
you know we're aggressively growing the card business with our existing deposit customers and percentage gains there
will probably continue to be very strong. Autos, in spite of the heat in that market and our public posture of wanting to
maintain our credit discipline, still are providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. So, that's a
continued opportunity. Still a lot going on in commercial real estate. And as you mentioned, the GE Capital loans
helped us late in the third quarter there.
Jumbo loans on the residential side have been growing in the balance sheet at the same strong pace for a long time, and
we continue to – we expect to see that there. Across the C&I range, we mentioned several of the businesses that have
slightly independent but all attractive growth prospects. The utilization of lines across the variety of corporate and
commercial loan categories is still in the, call it, mid- to low-30%s. So, there's room for that improvement. And we
keep gathering new customers in those businesses as well. So, it's really – it's coming from everywhere at attractive
paces.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yes, Ken, there's a fair amount of capacity to carry more debt by medium-sized companies,
small companies and consumers. Rates are very favorable, and most Americans, businesses and consumers, have

de-risked and deleveraged their balance sheets. So, there are opportunities. And we're very active on Main Street and
[indiscernible] (25:18) working with customers. So we love this opportunity to do the GE thing, but organic growth is
still the main part of the way we grow.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And with respect to what there still might be to do with GE, there have been some
portfolio sales that have been announced there since the one that we worked on. We're working as closely as we can
with them. They're a great relationship of ours. There are businesses that they're trying to dispose of that fit neatly with
our expertise, some things we're going be very competitive with and some, because we're not expert in them, we'll be
less so. But we're working hard. We hope that it turns up incremental opportunity to do more of what we've done on the
commercial real estate side, and we'll be hearing about that in the coming months as their processes unfold.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay, great. Then, just follow-up on the energy portfolio shrinkage. You spoke about
the $700 million decline. I'm sure there'll be other questions about the NPA growth, but can you talk about just what
you're seeing in the energy side? Is that active, like, push-outs by you guys? Is it the equitization coming in and taking
out credits? Can you just talk about like how that portfolio behavior is acting and how that influences your provisioning
decisions?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So, I would describe the reduction in the principal balance as borrowers taking
their balances down just to conform with their borrowing base reductions. And as I mentioned, that was about $700
million of reduction in the second quarter.
There was a lot of capital being raised in the first quarter. Capital markets activity was very brisk in the first quarter. It's
a little bit slower in the second quarter and a lot of that was equity coming in to stabilize balance sheets. It feels like
that's slowed down just a little bit as people process what happened in the first quarter. So, we don't anticipate loan
balances or new loan activity to be terribly brisk in terms of leading the higher outstandings at Wells Fargo in the
second half of the year. But the market is acting very rationally. The market is acting very quickly. The opportunists are
arriving at the door and trying to work things out, create business combinations and take advantage of the situation to
resolve it. So things are happening, frankly, a little bit faster than we might have anticipated sitting here six or eight
months ago.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Thanks, John.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Hello, Joe.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: I guess just a follow-up on the credit trends within the energy portfolio. With the borrowing
base redeterminations finalized, I mean you touched on this but how has the performance tracked relative to initial
expectations? And how much of the increase in the related nonperforming loans stem from that as opposed to the
Shared National Credit exams?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's a combination of both, and it's tough to call out specifically what the regulators
might have independently wanted that we wouldn't have agreed to or gotten to on our own. I mean the outcome is what
it is. I think we had about a $400 million increase in nonperforming assets in energy for the quarter, which feels like it
makes sense.

And to the extent that some of those were very conservative estimations of NPA status, then that will get recaptured in
the back end of the process when those loans get worked out, which is fine. We had nominal losses in the quarter. And
we'll go in to a fall redetermination for E&P companies as well and we'll measure the performance of the midstream
and services companies at the same time.
We feel great about where our allowance is right now. As you may recall, it had impact on our first quarter number,
even though that was pre-redetermination and has an impact again on the second quarter number. And who knows? As
the third and fourth quarter roll through, I'm sure that there'll be more loans that are at issue.
The whole portfolio amounts to 2% of our loan portfolio. We feel very well reserved for where we are. We've got the
best team in energy banking and our credit folks' working through the portfolio. So, the impact here is relatively
immaterial to Wells Fargo. And as we called out in our comments, especially in a quarter like Q2, minor changes in our
residential real estate portfolio have a tendency to dwarf whatever is going on in energy because 36% of the loan
portfolio is in single-family real estate and 2% is in energy.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Joe, I would offer this. Since I've been around a long time, I think this is my third or fourth
cycle, I remember doing workouts in this business in the early 1980s. This one is different in that the energy
participants, whether they'd be on the E&P side or midstream, whatever it is, are more conservative. They tend to be
better capitalized. They reacted more quickly through reducing their CapEx budgets, some case reducing dividends.
And some other real stretchy stuff was done outside of our industry, if you will. So, it doesn't mean at all situations are
going to work out, but they winced this one and reacted much more quickly than I've seen in the past cycles.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: That's very helpful. Good color. I guess, have you quantified what you have in terms of
dedicated reserves against the energy portfolio? And as you pointed out, given that things like single family are such a
bigger part of the overall loan portfolio, kind of what's your broader outlook for the provision and the possibility of any
future reserve releases?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So we're bumping along here at 30 basis points of annualized net losses on the total loan
portfolio. And as we called out in the past, we shouldn't expect releases in any given quarter because the calculation
each quarter of the allowance is going include the observed performance of the portfolio. It's going to include general
economic conditions. It's going to include where the growth is coming from in the mix in the portfolio. So, I would not
model in releases of this magnitude going forward. And of course, as we've said, if we keep building our loan portfolio,
you'd expect to see builds, all things being equal.
Separately, we also called out, in the case of GE, if we're growing our loan portfolio by acquiring loans and we invoke
purchase accounting, then that's a complicating factor whether the allowance is growing or not because the mark on the
loans reflects the lifetime credit adjustments. So, that's a little complicated.
So for our own internal purposes, of course there's an allocable component of the allowance that reflects what we think
the inherent loss content is in the energy portfolio, and that will grow or shrink depending on how the portfolio
performs. And as I said, I would assume that the next couple quarters aren't much better than the last quarter in terms of
we're still resolving new issues, some of them are just coming to light for certain borrowers, but it's a very contained
portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material to Wells Fargo.
<Q - Joseph Morford>: Understand. Thanks so much.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: You bet. Thank you.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Just wanted to take a step back. As we enter potentially a rising rate environment in the
second half of the year, fingers crossed, one of your peers today mentioned anticipating a significantly more
competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said there are good deposits and bad
deposits this time around. And secondarily, they also mentioned entering new markets for the first time and de
novo-ing.
I guess the first question is, how should we expect Wells Fargo's repricing to progress if rates actually rise on the short
end? Secondarily, given the impressive footprint that you've built, how would you defend that market sharing footprint
against those that are aggressively trying to grow retail deposits, particularly for regulatory purposes?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Erika, let me start with that. It's a great question, and not all retail deposits are created equal.
Our focus here has been on relationships and we think relationships on the consumer side start with a consumer
checking account. In fact, I don't have the exact number, I think it's 86% of our retail customers have a checking
account with us. It's their primary account. They live out of that. And if you look at certificates of deposit, it's less than
$35 billion here. So, it's a couple percent of our – so that's a very different deposit makeup.
And like other companies in our industry, we had a lot of experience in rates backing up. And the speed of the backup
matters; where it starts from. A move from 3% to 4% is different from a move from nothing to 1%. And also, where
you employ those more expensive deposits; will you find offsetting earning assets to employ those.
And I recall the last time we went through this, we had very aggressive deposit competitors who are using those
deposits to fund businesses, acquire it as sell models in the real estate business, for example. So, we've been through a
lot of different things. We've modeled this. If I were a betting person, I would bet that we'll probably be favorable to
what our model suggests early in the backup. But I think one of the great undervalued parts of our business today is the
quality of our deposit franchise, and you'll see that in the backup.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And to the point of entering new markets, while we adjust our store footprint
meaningfully every year by opening and closing stores where we see fit, I think as Carrie Tolstedt has described in our
last Investor Day, we believe that we need a certain amount of scale in any urban market before we can really make a
difference. And we're in most of the markets that we'd like to be in. And of course, we're not going to get there through
acquisition. So it would seem unusual for us to commit to building, for example, hundreds and hundreds of stores in a
new major urban center that we're not already a part of. So, I wouldn't think about that as part of our next-stage plan.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just a follow-up on some of the comments. John, thank you for telling us how
you accounted for the GE purchase. How should we think about your capital progress relative to further or incremental
loan purchases? As I think about the past three quarters, your CET1 ratio has been fairly stable at about 10.5%. If
you're using purchase accounting for larger loan purchases, of course that would impact CET1. And I guess I'm
wondering sort of what your thoughts on the – whether you may account for purchases differently going forward as you
consider the CET1 progress, particularly in light – in terms of some commentary we've heard from regulators recently
about including CET1 surcharges in the CCAR test.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So, the first call on our capital is for our customers. Including prospective
customers, if we were going to add either originate or acquire portfolios of loans. I don't think there's any accounting
theory out there that would allow us to add loans without impacting Common Equity Tier 1. I mean it's a really –
risk-weighted assets are what it's for. So if we had a bigger opportunity to grow RWA faster in a way that we thought
was very attractive for shareholders, then we would probably do that. And if we needed to, for example, curtail
distributions for some period of time in order to retain the capital to create that outcome, then we would probably do
that.
As we've told people in our capital planning process in describing it, we want to keep as much capital as is appropriate
and necessary to grow the business, and it's primarily by growing RWA, and we want to distribute everything beyond
that, which is about where we've been operating. So if there were a bigger RWA opportunity, we would measure where
we were starting from. We would understand what sort of organic capital generation was going on at that time. And it's
possible that we would end up retaining a little bit more in order to maintain satisfactory levels while growing assets.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Just so I'm clear on the take-away, any portfolio purchases from here has to be a life
of loan accounting in terms of the losses?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up to the GE portfolio you did add this quarter, you
mentioned that we need to consider the average balance impact. Are there any considerations on the average yield
impact as you think about the third quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: For average yield of the loan portfolio?

Your next question come will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on margins. Part of the new compression
that we've been seeing for so long has obviously been, in part, due to the excess liquidity that's been getting parked at
the Fed as deposit growth has significantly outpaced loan growth really at a system-wide level. But today, we saw one
of your competitors reported decrease in deposits both sequentially and year-over-year while still putting up pretty solid
loan growth, and you guys also saw your loan growth outpace your deposit growth this quarter.
So I guess the question is, do you think we're at an inflection point where we'll no longer see deposit growth continue to
exceed loan growth? And if so, does that suggest that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs
going forward?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Let me take the deposit side first and then John can – one quarter does not make a summers or
one sparrow, if you will. If you look at the last year, we grew average deposits by almost $84 billion. And our core loan
portfolio grew $60-some billion. If you take our overall loan portfolio, it was in the $40 billions to $50 billions. So, we
actually outgrew deposits by some $20 billion or $30 billion on an annual basis.
The first quarter is always kind of a funny quarter when you compare it to the second quarter – or second quarter to the
first quarter because of the tax impact, because we have such a large retail deposit base. So, we've looked back I think
to 1945, I think all but one year we grew deposits. So whether we can outgrow or not outgrow, we sure like our
opportunities continue on the deposit side. Because after all, we're growing net new consumer checking accounts,
primary, by 5.6% and then small business we're growing by 5.3% or 5.4%. These are the strongest numbers I've seen in
the last couple years in my history of the company. So these are very, very strong acquisition numbers.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So one thing I'd mention about the industry, and I'm sure you're thinking about this, but
we're in a slightly different position. But there are some other larger banks that are discouraging deposits because of the
adverse impact on leverage ratio, the adverse impact on the GSIB buffer calculations, et cetera. And people have been
vocal about getting out there and trying to move those deposits out of their banks to take their numbers down, and those
are in the same deposit numbers that you're referring to. So it's a little bit complicated, I think, bank by bank as you're
looking at it. Ours is as John described.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And we're also not shrinking our store count. And we have found that in our omnichannel
distribution where you have stores or locations, ATMs, phones, online and mobile, it's the magic of all those working

together. And that's a very strong compelling value proposition for customers.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Both – so attracting, retaining deposits. And then back to Erika's question about what
happens in a backup, people who want to move away from Wells Fargo are moving away from that value proposition.
It's provided to them basically for free in exchange for having their relationship at Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. If I may, as a follow-up, the amount of liquidity that you're holding at the Fed you
mentioned fell this quarter from an all-time high of $291 billion, I believe, last quarter. Is it reasonable to expect that to
continue to fall from here as you redeploy more of that into higher-yielding loans and securities? And taking LCR into
consideration and the constraints there, can you give us a sense for where we could see those balances go?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it depends on what's happening on other fronts, including ongoing deposit growth.
But I wouldn't forecast it as coming down, but as we've described before, there's probably tens of billions of dollars of
room from where we are today to where that balance might go before we started having any difficult discussions about
LCR. So, there's plenty of room from where we are today.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. Talking a little bit about the mortgage side, I mean we saw rates go
up, but I think a lot of – but the volumes have held in very strong. Some of that I think is the refi pipeline coming out of
first quarter. But can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the purchase market world? Is it really starting to
make a comeback?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So, yes, it was a strong quarter and, I mean, the strongest in a while. It doesn't reflect the
pre-crisis types of activity at this point. It's strong in a handful of individual markets: California, New York, Southern
Florida, Denver, our particular markets where we've seen a lot of strength. First time home buyers are a little bit
stronger at about 30% of home purchases. You saw that our purchases as a percentage of originations were 54% this
quarter versus 45% the prior quarter. As you mentioned, the second quarter had a lot of refis closing in it that were
locked in the first quarter when rates were very were low. So when you think about new application volume in the
second quarter, my guess is as that flows through in Q3 that number will be even higher, all things being equal, because
rates did back up meaningfully in the quarter.
So, the business is good. There's plenty of credit available. We're obviously as enthusiastic and committed to it as we've
ever been. Margins have been holding in there nicely and the pipeline looks quite good actually.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then you...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And then...
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: ...go ahead.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: ...one last thing I'd add is that all of that is a reflection of continued affordability. While
home prices have moved, they're still affordable. While rates have moved, they're still affordable. So, that's helping a
lot. And we've had an improving jobs market, which brings more people into eligibility for a purchase or refinancing.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then, you saw the – I mean everybody saw the [indiscernible] (47:02) has been pushed back
another three months. Do you see any impact on the mortgage market or on how you view the mortgage market with
the new regulations with [indiscernible] (47:12)?

Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi. Thank you. Just a question, John, on the efficiency ratio. You're at the high end of your
range the last couple of quarters. Do you see opportunities to drive down the efficiency ratio prior to rates going up, or
is it more likely to stay still at the upper end of the range until we see interest rates move higher?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think it's going to stay in the upper part of the range until revenue moves higher, which
will probably happen as a result of – or at least most meaningfully over a short period of time because of rates moving
higher.
We're spending the money that we think we need to spend to run a great business today and manage risk, as well as
invest in the future around things that customers want and things that we need to be a well-run, resilient compliant,
risk-managed, technologically savvy firm, and that gets us to 58-plus-or-minus-percent, which I would remind you is a
very good number for a bank of our size.
But, yeah, there's no near-term path or project to try and drive ourselves down in the range. We're trying to operate
where we have been, accomplish all the things that we need to accomplish, and deal with the reality that we're in a
below 3% GDP growth environment, in a zero rate environment, neither of which is as hospitable as some other
environments might be for revenue growth in banking.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, John, the – but we're always, as you know as you know us well, we continue to look for
opportunities to simplify the business, streamline the work we do so we can repurpose those dollars into things that are
important to customers, important to risk management and other things here. So the development that we're doing in
image capture, in our branches or our stores, the different things that we invest in payments, cyber, and all the other
things that we do, we are self-funding through being very thoughtful about where we spend our money.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Thank you. And one other question, guys. Could you comment on the market and what it's
like for additional portfolio purchases? I assume it's very competitive. Obviously, GE's got some other assets out for
sale. And just in general, nothing specific but more general, what are the pros and cons when you look at portfolios to
purchase and kind of how do you feel like the markets flagged for that?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So, it's very competitive. And I think that this current set of assets that's being offered for
sale is being viewed by some people as the biggest opportunity in a long time. Some of the assets or platforms are
suitable for non-depository institutions. And I would say that non-banks interested in creating a lending platform would
appear to be willing to pay a bigger premium than people who have an existing platform and are looking to add
customers and assets to it. All of these do require financing in one form or another, so that can be either a limiting
factor, or for the easier-to-finance assets, I guess, that can be a benefit for people who don't have deposit bases in order
to bid. But very competitive is how I'd describe it.

<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Questions, one on other income and one on the Wealth business. You called out on
other income that you had a $426 million impact from the debt hedges. I just wanted to make sure I understood what
that was driven by. I know you indicated rate moves. Just wanted to make sure I understand is that the long end of the
curve. And does it have any relation to the fair value hedges that you put in the 10-Q, the $173 million? So, wanted to
make sure I understand how that works.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So for some of the debt that we issue, we swap it back to dollars and swap it back
to LIBOR. And so, we've got perfect cash flow hedges on where we choose to do that.
The accounting for that requires the liability on the one hand and the hedge on the other to be discounted using
different discount rates. And so, over the life of both instruments, there can be some noise in the P&L. We've had a
benefit in the past, and this time we had a negative. And it was driven by a few things, but mostly by the major
movements in longer-term swap rates in dollar, sterling and LIBOR during the quarter. And the net impact from the
quarter is as it was described in the materials.
So I'd just point out, this is sort of a, call this, a timing difference, an accounting difference. It nets back to zero over the
life of the liability, so we don't think of it as a real economic issue but it creates noise in the other noninterest income
line item. And...
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. So the net was $426 million, not the $426 million plus the $173 million from
the fair value hedges in the 10-Q?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Correct.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay. Okay, separately on Wealth, I've been just reading some articles recently that
have talked about how – and you can tell me if this is correct or not – but how the focus is not really on increasing the
number of FAs – and obviously, we see flat FAs in the release you put out today – but more on the technology and the
investment spend there. Is that accurate, number one? And number two, could you explain how you're looking to
advance the technology platforms that you've got in this business?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So I wouldn't say that it's an express strategy to not increase the number of FAs. I
don't think that that's necessarily the primary driver of value creation in the long term for David Caroll's business. You
may see that differently, John.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: But the point on technology is a good one. There are a number of initiatives underway in
that business to modernize and to create service capability to attract new investors and to better serve the investors that
we have. And that turns up in the sort of the primary systems that our financial advisors use to interact with their
customers. It will turn up in our mobile and online offerings that allow people to do more for themselves. And at some
point, it could even include service or capability that competes with some of the global advisory people out there today
who rely primarily on technology to construct portfolios and make offerings to customers. All of those things are
opportunities for us to make the business even stronger and more relevant going forward, on top of what we feel is very
good performance over the last few years.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, Betsy, we see this really as one of the most attractive growth opportunities in the
company. If you think of how we're positioned as a broadly diversified company serving customers, one in three
Americans, one way or another – Americans are living longer. They'll probably convince you to be more reliant on
their own resources for their retirement. And we have 10% to 11% of the deposits in the country and yet only a fraction
of that as far as where we managed Wealth.
So, this is a big opportunity, and investments in people and systems and capabilities, but that should in no way – the
growth – we've already done great work. David Caroll and his team have done incredible. I mean think how many
companies out there would love to have – the way we monetize and the way that everybody else does – $602 million of
after-tax earnings for a quarter at 26% margins. These are very, very good numbers.

Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. A factual question: what was the amount of your debt hedge loss in the second quarter? You
mentioned that other income is down $426 million. Was that the amount of the debt hedge loss or is it different?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We had $127 million gain in the first quarter and $193 million loss in the second quarter.
And again, I just want to describe that as the accounting treatment for the hedging program that we have there. So think
of this, that the delta between Q1 and Q2 is what creates the more outsized number.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So, a normal would just be zero?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: No, normal would be around zero. You'd expect it to be zero over its life. Sometimes it's
a little positive, sometimes it's a little negative, and it's driven by swap rates and currency movements in the currencies
where we issue.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. The more important question for me, you mentioned repricing in Wholesale
businesses, and that – what are you doing there as it relates to your market sensitive revenues?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: What we reprice in wholesale is deposits. And for a variety of customers, the ones who
seem to have acted most strongly in the deposit area were FIs, which for all the reasons you could imagine have
relatively low-value liquidity deposits. And so, we've been paying less for those deposits, or in some cases and in some
jurisdictions have been charging a little bit for those deposits. And that's what we were referring to.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: What are you seeing in pricing in your market sensitive businesses more generally? And is that
one reason why – this is the lowest trading quarter you've had since the third quarter of 2011 and we'll certainly take
the other revenues in lieu of trading, but are you pricing some of those activities away? Is it simply the market's
weaker? What's going on there, but especially as it relates to potential repricing or the competitive environment?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's not as a result of Wells Fargo specific pricing strategy; it's just the chips falling
where they did in terms of flows, volumes and other activity in the business. And as you know, in our trading business
we have what you're thinking of, which is market-making and customer accommodation activity, but we also have the
impact of our own deferred comp program, et cetera, which makes that line a little bit noisy. But it's not as a result of
any conscious business decision to price things differently, to do any more of this or less of that. It's just where the
quarter fell.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, so is pricing getting better or worse? And if so, what areas within the market
sensitive areas?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I wouldn't say that pricing is getting any better. You would think that pricing might be
getting better in areas where other banks are pulling back from providing financing or liquidity to customers, which is
part of the discussion around how some of the bigger trading-oriented banks have been providing repo, providing
securities, finance, et cetera, and have limited their appetites. But prices haven't gone up that much. I think capacity has
come out and people have had to figure out how to deal with that. So at the moment, it's just competitive as it ever was
and the pricing reflects that, but not because of conscious strategies.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. I just had one question to clarify, the loan growth expectations. If I look
at the core loan growth, it's growing about – excluding the GE transaction and runoff – it's growing at about almost four
times the nominal GDP, which would be at the higher end of the historical norm. So I just want to make sure I
understand, John, your comments about expectations of maybe some incremental leverage across both commercial and
consumer, but I wonder to what extent it may, in fact, that may already be occurring and the GDP number will move to
reflect that rather than an acceleration in loan growth?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: That's a good question. We don't model loan growth necessarily as a reflection of
prior-quarter GDP, but it's an interesting relationship. I think our point is that the areas where we've been experiencing
organic loan growth, all are still very active. We're still very competitive. We're getting more than our fair share in most
of those categories. We've got further to run in card, I'd say, than other people because we're starting from a smaller
base.
And then in some of our material businesses, we've got customers who have been holding back on their borrowing
capacity. So in the corporate but in the commercial space in particular, where we are a very big player, our customers
are still very cash heavy which is reflected in our deposits and have maintained very low leverage profile so that if they
got a little bit more enthusiasm around M&A, around organic growth, building a new plant, et cetera, expanding their
businesses, they have lots of debt capacity to do that, and we'd expect to see some of that in line utilization or demand
for funded assets.
But the real take-away is that we're very well positioned in all of our key lending markets and competing well today.
And in those areas where there might be incremental drivers of demand, we hope to benefit from that when it happens.
And then, of course, we're working on a few strategic or inorganic activities as well.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Sure. Thank you for that. And then, just one clarification question. Did you indicate how
much your legal accrual was for the period?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: We didn't. We've indicated the size of operating losses in total, the amount of the
change. And the amount of the change reflects increased litigation accruals, but we don't split that out from our other
operating losses.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And are those legal accruals for issues disclosed in the 10-K or for new ones?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It's for a variety of matters, most of which you'd already be familiar with.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay, All right. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Hey, Matt.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I know there's some talk about working on becoming more efficient, just kind of
continuous improvement, but do you have some formal initiative underway? I guess there was an article in a regional
paper a couple of months ago and it had mentioned something called E&E or something along the lines of that.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, so as John was mentioning earlier, we're trying to repurpose our expense dollars to
their highest value area. And so, there's a collection of programs, of ways of doing business, of thinking about how we
spend our resources that are designed to do just that.

So it's an internal – it's a relatively formal program. It's around some operational improvements. It's around some of our
staff functional alignments, some of our technology spend, et cetera. And it really is designed to make sure that where
we're spending money – and of course, we spend a lot of it – that we're putting it in the most impactful places.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And is it a kind of program where if we don't get rates increasing and a stronger
economy, then you can kind of redirect some of the savings more to the bottom line versus investing in other areas?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, dollars are fungible. But the way we're thinking about it is we're redirecting those
dollars toward places that are going to make a difference for customers, which would drive revenue, and you could see
bottom line improvement as a result of that. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question, it's not really designed to
drive us down in the efficiency ratio or to drive total dollars of expense down; all things being equal, it's designed to
make sure that we're spending the money that we're spending in the most impactful place.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then, just separately on the noninterest margin. As we think about the
trajectory from here, assuming rates don't increase, what should the path of the NIM be?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, it's going to depend on what happens with deposits versus loan and other earning
asset growth primarily. So if we continue along the path that we're on right now, then you'd think that it would probably
stay in or about this range. There's not much else here. Deposit pricing is quite efficient here at 8 basis points. So as we
get more invested, as we add more loans and we – if we convert cash to higher yielding assets, then that should be an
improvement. Yeah, over the course, if you fast forward it a few years, we'll probably be layering in more senior
unsecured in connection with TLAC. That will probably have a negative impact, although relatively modest in the
overall scheme of things. We still expect net interest income in 2015 to be higher than 2014, which is frankly the most
important thing, all things being equal, and that's what we're driving toward.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, let me just go back to the expense thing because – one more time so we're all on the
same page. There is – there was talk on this call and, of course, we listen to what the Trillium and the Fed has to say
about rates. But when we plan internally here, we don't consider rate increases as part of the ongoing justification for an
investment in anything. So in other words, we don't – you would not hear language like, I want to make this investment
because when rates turn around and go back up, then this justifies – this investment would be justified. We don't know
what's going to happen to rates. And if rates do increase either long-term or the short-end or both, that's a benefit to us.
But for the last five years, six years, you could have said the same thing and it didn't happen. So that's why there's a
continual consideration here and pushing ourselves and our thinking to eliminate work that's no longer beneficial,
taking out processes that don't add value, and investing in places in things that do add value, and make us more
competitive, more nimble, more relative to the constituents that we serve.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - John Pancari>: Just a couple quick areas I wanted to ask about. On the commercial loan yields, looks like they
were up pretty solidly, 7% to 8% – or 7 bps to 8 bps or so for the quarter. Just want to see if we could get a little bit of
color on what drove that.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So, there's a handful of things. I mean it's the mix of the assets that we're adding to
that portfolio from one period to the next, which reflects customer activity, customer demand, both in terms of what's
rolling on and what's rolling off. Also, you're seeing in that calculation, the impact of having swapped portions of that
portfolio from floating to fixed, because that impacts the yield. And we've done that partially as the recognition that we
think we're going to be in a lower long-term rate environment for a longer period of time than we might have

previously thought. So that impact is – runs through there as well. Still asset-sensitive, but not waiting forever for rates
to begin to move in that portfolio.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then on the credit front, back to the energy thing, just real
quick. Any clarity on how much of that increase in the energy-related non-accruals were E&P versus oil service? And
then separately, it sounds like some of this movement may have been related to the Shared National Credit exam. Was
there anything non-energy that may have been – any takeaways out of the Shared National Credit exam that may have
impacted your non-energy portfolio?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So, on the first question – like remind me the first question again?
<Q - John Pancari>: Yes. Just...
<A - John G. Stumpf>: E&P.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: It was predominantly all E&P. The services credits have – first of all, they don't go
through the exact same – there's no borrowing base redetermination to occur in services companies. It's more like any
other corporate in terms of how they're reviewed. But the impact has not been felt there in quite the same way as it has
with E&P companies. And then back to the Shared National Credit review, it really – in terms of the negative outcomes
or the suggested downgrades, it really was primarily an energy set of conclusions this time around.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. And then lastly, the home equity portfolio. Just wondered if you can give us an
update there as we're seeing some of the lines exit their draw periods. Wanted to see how the – those credits have been
performing and if you're seeing any migration there.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, we've been, as we've talked about, ahead of this end-of-draw expectation for some
time now, because it was pretty easy to schedule, and we're going into a couple of years when these 10-year draw
periods will be coming to a close from the heaviest periods of issuance right at the – prior to the turn of the cycle. And
frankly, I'd say we're experiencing a better outcome than we originally imagined, in part because of our – the focus that
we've had, the team that we've had facing the proactive work that we're emphasizing and trying to get people refi-ed
into something that is suitable or more tolerable for them to repay. So things are going well.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And losses in that portfolio this quarter are in the 56 kind of basis point range so...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes. Very tolerable.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: ...very tolerable.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. And on that front, I mean, do you know how much – what percentage of your 2005
originations may have been refi-ed already or worked out?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I don't – right. I don't at the – on this call. Our real estate group certainly knows because
that's how that – that's been managed, so they'll know what they have left and what is gone already. So what – but what
I'm focusing on when I say that there's a plan underway that's being executed that's working, of course, are the ones that
are still there and that haven't refi-ed out.
<Q - John Pancari>: Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure.

Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks. Had a question on – you talked about the duration of the balance sheet. And
you're doing that through swaps and through investment portfolio purchases. Can you give us a feel for half a year, six
months, is it nine months? And how far do you want to go in the duration of the portfolio or the overall balance sheet?

Page 18 of 21
So how far are we along that process?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So when we use the term duration, we're using it in that context but not to define a
duration of the balance sheet, but really, to think about using those tools, the investment portfolio and loan portfolios,
to impact our overall asset or liability sensitivity.
And so the net conclusion of that is that not terribly unlike where we were at our last Investor Day, we find ourselves
still asset-sensitive. We mentioned a year ago, May, that we thought that we were – we had probably 10 basis points to
30 basis points' worth of net sensitivity, net benefit from a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel movement in rates, a
very stylized example. And we're less asset-sensitive.
If we were at the mean then, we're at the lower end of that range today, we believe. It's probably a conservative
estimate. We – that's how we generally calculate things. But by adding securities, by swapping floating rates to fixed
and other actions that have occurred in the growth of the business, we've made ourselves a little bit less asset-sensitive
because of the belief that we could be in a lower rate environment for a longer period of time. And we're earning today
rather than maintaining all of that sensitivity for the future. We still have plenty of it and we'll develop more of it as
time passes, but that's how I would answer that question.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And would you see any more lengthening in the near term, given the steepness of the
yield curve now, gives you an opportunity to kind of productively use that to your advantage?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I would expect that we'd continue to be adding securities to our securities portfolio, for
sure.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then lastly, the mortgage banking pipeline was very strong going into the second
quarter. It looks like the pull through was about as low as we've seen in the last year. I was just curious if there was any
operational issues or anything that happened during the quarter. Was it just refis that never got closed? What was the
kind of the difference in the pull through for this particular quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: There's nothing that I would point to. We – the production occurred the way we would
have expected it to. We ended with a relatively long – relatively large pipeline as well. So nothing different there.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Just a quick follow-up on some of the mortgage banking results. We saw margins remain
pretty strong compared to what you've had over a historical basis, and they were strong in the first quarter despite the
decline in the primary, secondary spread. Now, the front half of the quarter looked a lot stronger than the second half of
the quarter. Could you just give us some detail between the differences, what you saw in maybe April and early May
versus what you saw in the back half of the quarter?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, it's tough to be that precise about it, although I'm sure there are people in Wells
Fargo home mortgage who are thinking about it as granularly as the question that you're asking. Certainly, in the first
quarter, as rates rallied hard and that pipeline really, really grew, applications came in at an increased pace, the capacity
constraints to deal with that, both at Wells Fargo and in the industry, are supportive of higher margins as people used
their scarce capacity as beneficially as they can. So you'd expect, if that's a high point, for things to slip a little bit from
there.
In terms of where they've gotten to and where they are now, we expect them to continue to be in that range. The full
range, frankly, is a pretty attractive place to be operating. And as long as we can stay higher in the range like we have,
we'll be thrilled for that to happen.

It's also, from one quarter to the next, the mix between what's happening retail versus what's happening through others
is going to influence our gain on sale, and that might look different from one originator to another. I think that's an
important consideration but, I mean, frankly, I would look at it quarter to quarter and then seasonally adjust it to think
about what the steady state is. But, the last thing I'd say is that we're, again, we're pretty happy with where things have
remained given how competitive that market is, given how much capacity there is, and we're happy to be operating
here.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Yeah, I think just to support John's comment, I mean, I remember when gain on sales years
ago, we're 40 basis points, 50 basis points, 60 basis points, so the pricing discipline even with the capacity and the size
of the market is, I think, a good thing for Americans, good thing for borrowers, good thing for the originators, because
we're getting paid for the work that we're doing, the value add.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. And then just to mention, a follow-up on some of the comments on the extension
of the duration of the balance sheet this quarter with the use of interest rate swaps. Could you provide some more
details on why you're increasing your duration at this point in the cycle? Is it a change in your view on whether you
want to be patient for higher rates or is there some other reason why you want to extend duration now?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So what's been happening for a while, we're talking about it a little bit more now, and
maybe it was a little bit starker in this quarter because deposit growth slowed also, so you saw cash balances go down
while both securities and loans went up. But as you suggest, it's – there's – regardless of what's happening with
short-term rates and over what period of time that normalization of policy occurs, it's our expectation that the longer
end of the curve, that we're going to be lower for longer than we would have thought six months ago, a year ago or a
couple of years ago. And how we're managing the balance sheet is a reflection of that.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Is there anything specific that you're seeing that would change your view that's – that has
changed your view in the last six months?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Well, in the last 6 months to 12 months, I would say what's happened with rates around
the world has been a big reminder that a 2.5% U.S. tenure is a really attractive asset and could be for a really long time.
So that's why I say regardless of what's happening with Fed funds, we're preparing ourselves for a long march on – at
the longer end of the curve.
And if we're wrong, then we have to be prepared for that in terms of what it means to capital, et cetera, and we certainly
are. And we sensitized that drastically to make sure that we've protected our balance sheet. But in the meantime, we're
getting our assets more productively deployed.
I'd point out there's still $250 billion worth of cash in the bank, so there's plenty of short-term liquidity and dry powder
for what happens if we're wrong, and there are more attractive entry points on the way back up if that were to occur, but
it's a good question.
<Q - Kevin James Barker>: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah.

percentage or rough percentage of your production are jumbos?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: About 25% of our production are jumbos. And that includes, of course, many of our
most valuable customers in terms of the breadth of the total relationship. We carry them on our balance sheet, as you
know.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And I think the total category right now for jumbos on our books is about $120 billion,
$125 billion of the, call it, $1.7 trillion overall.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And just a question on the mortgage business as a whole. I mean, do you consider, at
this point, given all the gyrations we've had in the mortgage business in the past 10 years, are we at what you consider
to be "a normal mortgage market" right now, and are you staffed appropriately for that market? Or where does sort of
the mechanics of the mortgage business stand for you right now?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So in terms of staffing, I'm sure it's true that we're probably a little bit heavy in some
areas around loss mitigation and working NPAs and foreclosed assets through the system versus where we might be in
a completely normalized point in the cycle, just because they're still elevated, so there's probably opportunity there over
some period of time. From a policy normalcy point of view, there's still other things happening, whether it's agency
reform, the relationship between the FHA and the industry is still not completely settled, and that has to happen for
people to feel good about things. There's still no meaningful secondary market for nonconforming loans.
And there was a good one for prime jumbo loans that existed pre-crisis, and so at some point, that probably has to
reemerge and that hasn't happened yet. But we're just as committed to the business. It's a very important part of the
relationship between us and our customers because buying and financing a home is one of the most significant things
our customers will ever do. We enjoy our status as the largest mortgage servicer in the land and our status as the largest
mortgage originator as well. So we're working hard to try and shape good outcomes in those areas that are still
unsettled, and we're making the most of it during the period that we're in.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: And, Nancy, that's an insightful question because I think part of the distinguishing features of
big scale players in this business whether you're successful or not is how quickly you can scale up when business
opportunities present themselves and how quickly you can scale down. And we think we're pretty good at that, among
other things. And some are surprised the mortgage market has not come back stronger, but we went through a pretty
deep downturn. This was the asset class that had the problem in 2008 and 2009, and it's steadily – and it's improving
and healing, but it's going to take time. And so like John said, we really like this business for a whole host of reasons.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: I would just ask as an add-on question, Bank of America talks about their legacy asset
servicing, et cetera, which is mostly mortgages that were still on the books that they're working out. Where are you
guys in working out any problems you got through the Wachovia deal, et cetera? I mean are you pretty much through
the workout period now with most of that stuff?
<A - John G. Stumpf>: Well, the Pick-a-Pay was probably the most problematic of that portfolio, and that came over,
let's say, in the $120 billion range, $120 billion or so; it's $54 billion, give or take, now. And the average loan-to-value
in that is in the $60s billion.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right.
<A - John G. Stumpf>: So – and if you look at the overall servicing portfolio we have, it's 94%, 95% current, and so
we've – still issues going through this. There are some [ph] judicial portfolio states s (84:08) that we're still having to
work through. But for the most part, it's performed above our expectations, especially with respect to the Wachovia
part. And we're – I think we're in the later innings of working on this. And as John mentioned, there are some
opportunity to take some cross-sell. The cost of servicing a current loan versus one that's delinquent is such a big
difference. So when people look at these portfolios, you really have to look at the past dues because it really – and the
ones in foreclosure because that really skews the costs on those.
