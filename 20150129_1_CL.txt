Just a reminder, there may be a slight delay before the question and answer session begins due to the web simulcast.
Now for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Delia
Thompson. Please go ahead, Delia.
Delia H. Thompson
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release conference call. With
me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate
Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're pleased to exit 2014 with organic sales up 6% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, which was the strongest
quarter of last year. Our market shares are strong around the world, as you will hear in a moment.
As always, innovation has been critical to our success, and we're excited about our pipeline looking forward to 2015
and beyond. In many markets, macroeconomic challenges persist and of course foreign exchange has been and will
continue to be a considerable headwind as translation alone is projected to impact EPS in 2015 over 10% at current
foreign-exchange rates. That makes us even more pleased to be able to deliver continued organic sales growth and
positive results on the bottom line.
While our gross margin was down in the quarter due to very significant transaction costs, we believe that we'll see an
improving trend as we move through 2015 with a more benign raw material cost environment and pricing taken to
offset the impact of rising transaction costs related to foreign-exchange. Our funding-the-growth program is as robust
as ever, and our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track. Savings generated in 2014 related to the Global
Growth and Efficiency Program were over $100 million after-tax and above the top-end of our projected range.
Overhead expenses are down in the quarter due to tight controls in all divisions and savings from our Global Growth
and Efficiency Program. Our total commercial spending also increased in support of both existing and new products.
We think we're well-poised to meet the challenges we face as we enter 2015. We believe our strong balance sheet and
solid cash generation should keep us in good stead.
So turning to North America: we're very pleased with our progress here. Innovation is contributing to organic sales
growth, and we have more planned for this year. In the fourth quarter, in the U.S., our market share increased
year-to-date in toothpaste and manual toothbrushes and was even with the prior year in mouthwash. Results were
strong across our portfolio in toothpaste. Our Colgate total toothpaste share remains over 10% supported by a graphics
refresh, a relaunch of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening and the boost provided by our companion, Colgate Total
Lasting White mouthwash.
The Colgate Optic White franchise is also doing well as the super premium line is driving incrementality with its
year-to-date toothpaste share up from 5.3% to 5.6%. And as you know, we also launched Colgate Enamel Health
toothpaste and toothbrushes in the second half of 2014. It's off to a strong start and our overall toothpaste share is up
1.4% in the three months after its launch as compared to the three months prior. In the mouthwash category, our
year-to-date share is up more than a full point, while our two major competitors' full-year shares declined with
excellent results from Colgate Total Lasting White mouthwash.
Our Fabric Conditioner business continues to perform well. Both for the full year and the quarter, our market share is
up over a full point to a new record, close to 20% of the overall market, and as you know, these products are primarily
sold in Hispanic markets. Now, as you would expect, we have more innovation slated for 2015 with a full grid planned
for the first quarter.
In toothpaste, we're launching Colgate Optic White Express White toothpaste. This innovation provides wither tooth in
just three days simply by brushing, with best results after four weeks of brushing, as directed. It's Colgate's fastest
whitening toothpaste and is enamel-safe for daily use. In the mouthwash category, we're launching Colgate Total Gum
Health mouthwash. It provides advanced gum protection for 45% stronger, healthier gums versus the non-antibacterial

mouthwash. It fights plaque between teeth and along the gum line and kills 99% of germs on contact with 12 hour
protection against bacteria that cause gingivitis.
In the toothbrush category, we're launching Colgate Sensitive Toothbrush Plus Sensitivity Relief Pen, using the same
innovative pen application technology that has been so successful in the Whitening segment. The pen utilizes our
patented Pro-Argin technology to deliver sensitivity relief 24/7 with continued use and goes right to the source of the
pain.
To rekindle momentum in the dish liquid category, we're launching the premium-priced Palmolive Multi Surface,
which is specially formulated to kill bacteria on dishes and hard nonporous kitchen surfaces. And on the value side,
we're launching Ajax All-in-One dish liquid which has a new formula with 10% more cleaning ingredients than before.
And to further our success in the Fabric Conditioner category, we're launching Suavitel Fragrant Pearls with a
proprietary scent system which provides 5 times longer-lasting fragrance compared with using detergent alone as well
as Suavitel Fast Dry dryer sheets which help clothes dry 30% faster than using detergent alone.
Turning then to Europe/South Pacific: we enjoyed another quarter of organic sales growth in this region with a slight
acceleration in volume in the third quarter. Our commercial hubbing activities, part of our Global Growth and
Efficiency program, are now complete, and were implemented with very little disruptions. In fact, in the quarter,
virtually all new hubs delivered positive organic sales growth.
Innovation is critical in this part of the world and it continues to contribute to market share growth in a number of our
categories. Our market shares across Europe are up year-to-date in toothpaste, manual toothbrush, battery toothbrush,
mouthwash, liquid hand soap, and dish liquid. Of note, all categories of our Sanex business have grown market share
year-to-date: shower gel, liquid hand soap, and under-arm protection. Our launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity
Protection Plus Sugar Acid Neutralizer is now complete across the region with excellent share results in a number of
markets.
One of our first launched markets, Denmark, posted a 4.1% share in the most recent period and two larger, more recent
launched markets, the U.K. and France, have already achieved 1.5% and 2% shares, respectively in the most recent
period. Building on this success in 2015, we will continue full marketing support for the toothpaste along with a further
rollout of a companion toothbrush and mouthwash.
As I just mentioned, our Sanex business is performing well with some exciting new product activity to support further
growth. Launching in the first quarter is Sanex Advance, Sanex's first body care regimen developed with leading
dermatologists. Available in three different formulations, the regimen will include a body lotion and hand cream to
complement the body wash and deodorant. This is Sanex's first entry into the hand and body lotion category. With
Sanex Advanced dermo Repair bundle for dry skin with minor damage contains Activ Restore Complex and allantoin
to restore pH balance and miniaturization. The Sanex Advanced AtopiDerm bundle for extra dry atopic skin contains
skin identical lipids and emollients to help restore the skin's protective barriers, sooth itchiness and control
hypersensitivity, helping the skin to keep functioning normally.
The Sanex Advanced Hydrate 24H bundle for very dry, dehydrated skin uses CeraGly Activ Technology in the shower
gel and lotions which has a pseudo ceramide and glycerin to maintain the skin's protective barrier by locking in the
moisture. And in addition, we'll be launching Sanex in Poland, a new geography which will provide incremental new
business for us.
Turning then to Latin America: business across this region is solid. Organic sales growth accelerated from the prior two
quarters in 2014 and while volume increased a modest 1% versus the year-ago period, this was on top of a very strong
increase of 10% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Toothpaste shares are strong across the region. In Mexico, our most
region share is 80.8%, up 80 basis points from the year-ago period. Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection has achieved a
2% share in the most recent period.
In Brazil, in December, our toothpaste share reached 72.1% for the month, the highest share in the past 18 years. This is
in spite of a lot of competitive activity. Our manual toothbrush business is performing well. In Mexico we achieved a
record share of 45% in the latest reading while for the first our major competitor dropped below 40% share. Growth

was across all retail environments: self-service stores, pharmacies and the indirect trade.
We reached a record year-to-date share in Brazil as well with good growth in the Super Premium segment with a 32.4%
share of the market, the number one position. In Bar Soaps, we strengthened our leadership position across the region,
up 0.5 point on a year-to-date basis to 29.7% with the most recent read at 29.9%. Innovation in both the Palmolive and
Protex Equity has contributed to this success.
And in the Home Care category, our year-to-date regional market shares have increased in Fabric Conditioners up 50
basis points to 51.6% and in Liquid Cleaners, up 70 basis points to 36.3% and we have more exciting new products
planned for 2015 across all our categories. In the first quarter specifically, we're excited about a new subcategory in the
Protex body cleansing category: feminine intimate wash. Protex is a brand that's recognized as an expert is skin
protection and this positioning should transfer readily into the intimate care/soap sub category. It will be launched with
a fully integrated marketing campaign including a product website and endorsements from a well-known journalist.
Primary placement in store will be on the intimate shelf with secondary placement on the soap shelf to attract attention
from loyal Protex users.
Turning then to Asia: we're pleased with the acceleration of organic sales growth in this region as we indicated would
happen last quarter. As referenced in the press release, we saw good toothpaste market share gains in a number of
countries. In India, our market share has increased to 54.4%, up 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Colgate Active
Salt toothpaste, developed especially for this market where salt connotes the antibacterial efficacy, increased 70 basis
points to over a 5% share.
In Malaysia, our year-to-date share is up 30 basis points to just over 73%. The Anti-Cavity segment now comprises
almost 27% of the market and Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste, launched last February, has a 3.2%
share year-to-date with the most recent read of 4%. In Manual Toothbrushes, our regional share increased 20 basis
points year-to-date to 30.2% with 8 out of 10 countries reporting stable to positive growth.
In India, our share reached a record 43.2%, up 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis. Innovation under the Colgate
Slim Soft Equity has been particularly successful and our regional mouthwash share increased 120 basis points
year-to-date to 23.1% with the most recent period at 24.6%.
Looking forward, in toothpaste, we will be relaunching both our base sensitivity line as well as the Colgate Sensitive
Pro-Relief line. In addition, we will be adding Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Repair and Prevent. This new product has
the unique calcium and amino acid complex which repairs the root cause of sensitivity, preventing the pain from
returning. In India, we will be launching Colgate Active Salt with neem. The neem tree in India is known for its
antibacterial properties. In certain markets, we will also introduce a line of kid's toothpaste for children aged 2 to 5, a
segment currently somewhat underdeveloped, which presents a great incremental opportunity. New in the mouthwash
category will be Colgate Plax Bamboo Charcoal and, as you know, charcoal is also widely viewed as an ingredient to
fight bacteria.
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia: this region continues to deliver strong organic sales growth despite some
macroeconomic challenges in countries such as Russia. Our regional toothpaste share is up 10 basis points to 32.4%
year-to-date, and despite difficulties in Russia and the Ukraine, our year-to-date share is up 10 basis points to 32.9% in
Russia and up 170 basis points in the Ukraine to 28.2%. We've also seen good share increases across sub-Saharan
Africa and North Africa. In manual toothbrushes, Colgate 360 and Colgate Slim Soft have helped increase our share in
Turkey, up 30 basis points year-to-date to 28.7%.
In South Africa, we were up 380 basis points year-to-date to over 38% of the market. And across the region, our
mouthwash share is up 30 basis points year-to-date, approaching 20%. Colgate is the number two mouthwash brand in
Africa/Eurasia. You may recall we told you about a new product in Russia, Colgate Altai Herbs mouthwash. That has
contributed to a 210 basis point increase in our Russian mouthwash share to 27.5% year-to-date.
We also have a good market-leading shower gel business in this region. Our year-to-date share is up 120 basis points to
almost 22%. Russia, Turkey, and South Africa have all reached record shares. We've told you on previous calls about
our Palmolive Gourmet Spa line with enticing coffee, chocolate, vanilla and peach fragrances. That innovation has

been one of the drivers of the excellent share performance. And innovation this quarter continues.
To support our relaunch of our Colgate Total toothpaste portfolio we have initiated a new, integrated marketing
campaign around the idea of the incredible mouth. The idea is that Colgate knows that your mouth is incredible,
unique; which is why Colgate developed Colgate Total to protect 100% of your mouth, not only your teeth.
To continue the momentum in our shower gel business, we're launching Palmolive Taiga Freshness for Men. You may
recall we've had great success with Colgate Altai Herbs products: toothpaste, mouthwash and body cleansing. Altai is a
region in Russia known for its herbs which are believed to have curative properties. Similarly, Taiga is a northern forest
characterized by pines, spruces, and larches covering much of northern Eurasia. This new product offers the freshness
and cleanliness of the legendary Taiga in your shower.
Finally, Hill's: we're pleased with Hill's continued good organic sales growth of 4% in the quarter, particularly when
compared to a strong 7% growth in the year-ago quarter. Innovation has driven good results across our Science Diet,
Prescription Diet and Ideal Balance portfolio. For the Science Diet portfolio, nutritional consultant and shopper
engagement at superstores and sampling of our new soft savory treats here in the U.S. has helped drive sales.
In Europe, Hill's Science Plan Perfect Weight has been supported with secondary displays in-store and in-store
weighing area and on shelf dynamic screens to explain the product benefits. Here in the U.S., Hill's Ideal Balance has
gained share in both the wellness and natural segments and consumption of the product in superstores was up strongly
versus the year-ago period. In Europe, the product has gained excellent trade acceptance in the U.K. and Germany, two
large pet food markets, and received support with promotional activities and secondary placements.
And our Prescription Diet Metabolic line continues to meet with success. To build on that, this quarter, we're launching
Prescription Diet Metabolic Plus. 32 million pets have obesity related concurrent conditions. This is the first and only
dual efficacy therapeutic pet nutrition food. It will be available for weight loss plus mobility for dogs and weight loss
plus urinary stress for cats. This product will be available in both dry and stew format. And we're also very excited
about the new global packaging redesign across the Prescription Diet range. With more consumer friendly packaging
and new better tasting formulas, the bundle is designed to create a stronger emotional connection, strengthen our
leadership and innovation credentials and improve taste perception. That's rolling out across the US, Canada, and some
of the high-growth markets in the first quarter of 2015 and Europe in the second quarter.
So in summary, we believe our solid results for the quarter are a good indication that we have an effective strategy, and
we believe that this consistent strategy has stood us well for many years. You know it well, staying close to the
customer and consumer, innovating everywhere, becoming more effective and efficient, and ongoing leadership
development. We believe our executives on the ground have the tools to make the right decisions, balancing price and
volume, supporting innovation, in-store and out, increasing market share. All this is winning on the ground. We and our
competition alike are faced with choppy times, volatile swings in currency, macroeconomic challenges in many parts of
the world. So we believe it's the simple consistent focus well understood by every Colgate person that makes the
difference.
And now I would like to turn it over to Q&A. Kathy?

<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Maybe just a few little things to kick things off if we could. First could you just start off by
providing the gross margin bridge for Q4 and maybe talk a little bit about how those drivers are expected to trend into
2015? Any changes in margin improvement or organic growth expectations for the year versus last quarter's outlook
would be great. And then, maybe, drilling in, could you provide a little update on volume and sales trends in China and
Brazil, specifically? It looks like things improved as expected in China, but you're still battling through some inventory
issues in Brazil. I'm just curious if that's a fair read and just expectations on how you expect momentum to trend from
here? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, Steve, I think as Bina said at the end of her prepared remarks, I guess we live in a world
these days where focus is really important, but so is agility. And I think you saw in the fourth quarter the agility and the
balance, I guess, between volume and price as our 6% was composed of volume growth in all divisions and pricing
increases largely in the developing world. So if we take that to the gross profit roll-forward and you go back to the prior
year, gross profit, 59.1%, we benefited from 1.4 points of pricing, as you can see, a step up from the prior three
quarters.
Between our funding the growth and restructuring, we had something like 280 basis points of benefit, and then faced a
headwind in terms of material prices of some 4.3 points, of which two points for the quarter was transaction. And then
there were 20 basis points negative of some other minor changes, which gets you to the 58.8% gross margin.
Interestingly, although we are where we are, if you were to go back to the October conversation we had and our
expectation for the fourth quarter for the gross margin to be even with prior year, if you just stripped out the exchange
deterioration since our October call, in fact, for this quarter, our gross margin would've been at prior-year level.
What we managed to do by moving quickly on pricing was to offset the dollar impact of the foreign exchange, but not
yet the ratio impact. So that's 2014. When you go forward into 2015, I guess you've got a few things in terms of our
view on gross margin. Our view on gross margin for 2015 is that we will expand it between 50 basis points and 100
basis points on the year. Now that is going to progress through the year from the first to the fourth quarter.
We get a benefit in 2015, of course, from the current oil prices, which we expect to work through towards the end of
the first half next year and of course commodity materials, which our forecast would say are more or less flat
year-on-year. And these are benefits we haven't seen in prior years. We will continue and indeed we already have –
take pricing, particularly in those emerging markets where we have to meet the transaction impact of foreign exchange
because that's what translates into the operating earnings, we will of course be focused on our funding-the-growth
programs which, again, should benefit in 2015 from a more benign cost environment and, of course, we have our
restructuring program.
So as we begin 2015, we feel good with the expansion target of plus 50 basis points to 100 basis points on gross margin
stepping its way up through the year. Now when you come back to the top line of the company, I think the fourth
quarter played out organically pretty much the way we expected it. We see the de-stocking in China behind us, and
that's why we see the 6% organic there and, indeed, organic growth in the country itself. In terms of Brazil, we said that
we would still be working through the de-stocking in the fourth quarter, but that would be completed in the fourth
quarter and then we would move into 2015 and, indeed, that has been the case.
But if you step back and kind of take a look at where is the consumer, we continued to see for our categories that in
North America category growth, and again I'm talking our categories, is between 1% and 2%. As we said on the last
call, it is edging wildly up to the upper end of that 1% to 2% range. Europe continues to be moribund between zero and
1% and across the emerging markets; we continue to feel comfortable with the mid-single digit local currency value
growth rates for our category. So that's the environment we see in 2015 with China and Brazil now behind us.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Ian, pricing accelerated pretty significantly, sequentially in Q4 and was a big driver of the
organic sales growth acceleration in both emerging markets and globally. So, I just wanted to get an update on your
view of the competitive environment here and your ability to sustain that level of pricing going forward with lower oil
costs and flat commodities overall. Or even get more pricing with some of the incremental FX pressures you're seeing.
And then also in Q4 on a related note, how much of the Latin American price increase was related to Venezuelan and
Argentina? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. I think we have demonstrated fairly consistently an ability to deliver pricing to offset the
transaction impact of foreign exchange. I think we demonstrated that in the fourth quarter, and we expect to continue to
price as we have already done in some parts of the world. So pricing will be a factor in growth and in our gross margin
expansion plans for 2015, and we believe as we indeed already have, that we will be able to realize that, and I go back
to the fourth quarter and say there was a fairly meaningful step-up in pricing in those emerging markets, and yet we still
had a balance between volume growth and pricing growth.
Now when you turn to Latin America, the need for pricing again is driven by foreign exchange. And if you look at
Latin America overall, we took pricing in the fourth quarter, and you see pricing up literally across the geography, from
Mexico through Central America, our Andean group, Venezuela, Brazil, and the southern coast. So we took pricing
across the board. In Venezuela, as we told you on the last call, we, along with our two principal multinational
competitors and the large local player down there, on price controlled categories, got approval to increase pricing. And
so we, along with everyone else, increased pricing in Venezuela. And that will roll forward into 2015. But again, you
look at Asia, you look at Africa, Eurasia; we're taking pricing in all parts of the world that are affected by foreign
exchange.

And next we'll move to Chris Ferrera of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Ian, just a follow up on that, look, I can appreciate that you don't want to break out exactly what
Venezuela pricing is, but I think the question on a lot of people's mind is just with the LatAm segment pricing and the
resilience of volume even on a tough comp was very impressive, right it was very impressive. But I think what we're all
trying to figure out is as it relates to the sustainability of it, was Venezuela and Argentina a disproportionate driver of
that? In other words, can we feel comfortable with the assumption that you guys were able to hold volume very well
across the segment broadly, and the numbers aren't necessarily skewed by Venezuela and Argentina?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Clearly, we got more pricing in Venezuela because we had had no pricing for an extended period
of years, so the answer there is clearly yes. As it was for everybody else that we compete with in that country. I think
the more pertinent question is our ability to maintain that pricing and continue to increase that pricing going forward,
and our view is that, yes, we can. And, again, I come back to the fourth quarter, having taken pricing: we did see
volume growth in all of our divisions.
Now, of course, that step-up in Venezuelan pricing will ease off as we work our way through 2015, because Venezuela
is much more episodic than many of the other markets.
So the answer is yes, and again, back to the consumer behavior, we continue to see our categories hold in, in the
emerging markets at mid single-digits. And remember, as you will see when we file our K, for us, 2014, Venezuela
continues to represent about 3% of the company's worldwide sales and only about 1% of the operating margin.

And next we'll go to Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask you about consumer consumption levels. Do you think
that the current growth rate that you're posting are in line with where consumer consumption is right now? And on top
of that, how do you think about your inventory levels at retail? And then I also want to touch a little bit on the elasticity
of demand in your categories because in the past, you said that consumers understand pricing due to FX, but at what
point does that equation start to potentially break down because this quarter you obviously saw a big acceleration in
price, and volume really didn't accelerate all that much? But can you help us understand the analytics to make sure you
don't potentially go overboard on pricing, and what you considered too much? Like, if volume actually decelerates to
the point where you're seeing negatives, would you consider that to go too far, and clearly, I am thinking specifically
about Latin America. Thanks so much.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, clearly, Olivia, as I'm sure all other companies do, we do considerable work to
balance even the short-term volume impact of the pricing we take. I come back and say we saw volume growth in all of
our emerging markets, even with the stepped-up pricing we took in the fourth quarter, so we think we have a handle on
it and we think, again, remember the types of products we're selling that we can take the pricing necessary to offset the
foreign-exchange impacts and continue to maintain that balance between volume and price. And indeed, volume slows
a little bit when you take the pricing, but then that balance comes back.
Look, on retail inventory you may remember we were the first to talk about the de-stocking in China. And I think we've
tried to be very transparent about what we saw unfolding in the marketplaces. The China destocking is behind us, and I
said on the last call that we expected Brazil to work through in the fourth quarter, and it has done. We track not only
retail inventory, we track inventory with all of our distributors country-by-country, and we have parameters that
actually relate back to the return on invested capital that the distributor gets in terms of the inventory levels that they
would hold. So we have a very clear view on that inventory, and we have a very sharp focus on making sure that it is
not, at least by our actions, out of balance.
What we saw in Brazil and China was a marketplace de-stocking because of the slowdown in the category. So I think
you can feel confident that we have very much control on that inventory. And remember, as we talked about when we
went through those sub-prime years, in difficult times, products in our categories, if you will, become the simple
luxuries that consumers can afford. So the behavior of using these products does not go away when times get slightly
tougher.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good, good. Thanks.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Excellent. So just wanted to follow up on some the guidance commentary in terms of I think
you said that, or Bina said rather, that the 10% is the translation number. So can you talk a little bit about the – the
transaction piece is a little bit different now given what we've seen in terms of the move in the euro and some of the
other more developed market currencies which obviously are negative. So can you talk about sort of how much of the
transaction piece maybe you're not going to cover? And can you get pricing in developed markets to cover some of this
transactional piece? Is that a possibility even? Or is that something where you basically say, you know what, we're
going to have to eat that impact given where the market is right now. Thanks.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Thanks, John. Let me just complete, though, what Bina said. So when you think about
foreign-exchange as a headwind, yes, the translation impact is 10% on the bottom line. On the top line, we see it going
to be about 7% to 7.5% on the year. So that just gives you the breadth of that. In terms of the transaction impact, that is
bedded into our guidance on gross margin being up 50 basis points to 100 basis points. The transaction impact, whether
it's the balance sheet aspect of payables in the short-term or the more substantive foreign-exchange impact on raw
materials or imported, finished goods, in the medium-term that hits the gross margin squarely; and if you don't recover
that, you can't deliver an operating return.
So all of our guidance is assuming our ability to offset that transaction impact. Now remember, offsetting that
transaction impact is not just a function of list price increases in any given marketplace. It could be benefited from mix.
It could be benefited from different types of promotional activity that elevate the ASP. We have the benefit of our
funding-the-growth program. We have the benefit of the Global Growth and Restructuring Program that we have
underway. And as I said at the beginning, the benefit of a more benign commodity environment, especially in the area
of oil.
Now, if you look at Europe and North America, list price increases are difficult to accomplish. But you saw in Europe
terrific margin expansion this year. So there, it's going to be some of the other techniques that I think are going to
continue to drive gross margin, most especially our funding-the-growth efforts, the Global Growth and Efficiency
Program and what we can do with our promotional efficiencies as we go forward rather than list price increases, but
that's the way we planned the year, John.

And next we have Joe Altobello with Raymond James.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: Just wanted to shift gears a bit to SG&A, and wanted to put the 50 basis points of overhead
savings in some context because it seems like it's a bit of an outlier compared to the last few quarters. First, what was
the FX impact on SG&A in the quarter and how sustainable is the 50 basis points you saw in the fourth quarter and
how should we think about advertising next year? It came down about 60 basis points in 2014. It was down both
absolutely and as a percentage of sales. I'm curious how you're thinking about that as you're shifting dollars from
advertising to promotion in 2015? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, let me start with the advertising, Joe. So as we have said for quite a considerable
time, the advertising is a combination of what we all grew up with, which is the traditional media and promotion, and
we have always balanced that in terms of the traditional with the in-store activity that we undertake during the year. So
if you look at the balance, in fact, in the quarter our total commercial investment was up, as it was for the year.
Interestingly, many of our competitors in many large markets around the world eased back on their traditional
advertising spend. So in many of those markets, actually, our competitive pressure was actually strengthened.
Now, as we think about 2015, in terms of that traditional bucket of advertising and promotion, we're planning for that
to increase absolutely and as a percentage to sales. And as we have always done, we will continue to balance that as the
year unfolds. So we feel very much that the advertising is where we need it to be, and I think candidly, Joe, when you
look at the results in the fourth quarter, we got a 6% organic growth rate and delivered a pretty robust bottom line, and
of course it's that kind of sustainable top and bottom line growth that we are focused on. Relative to the overhead, forex
isn't much of an impact. We continue to expect to make progress in terms of overheads because the Global Growth and
Efficiency Program is largely focused in that area rather than gross margin this time around. And, again, as Bina said,
we were ahead of delivery of that program in 2014, and we will continue to make progress in 2015.

And we'll now move on to Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey. Good morning, Ian.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey. So I'm just trying the figure out the organic top-line guide. You gave market growth rates,
is that going to be your growth rate as well? Because if I weight sort of 45% developed, 55% emerging, and assume
that that developed piece is 1% to 2% and emerging is 5% to 6%, it kind of gives you a 3% to 5% range. Is that the
right way to think about it, or do you think you're going to continue to get market share and grow faster than the
markets?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: We've been quite pleased with our market share progress, Joe, and of course – Joe. Bill. Everyone
is Joe – and obviously we have some new businesses that we're entering, whether it's the intimate product, whether it's
new markets with Sanex, and indeed, some of the new geographies we have around the world, like Nigeria, like Iran,
like stepping up our position in Bangladesh, but we continue to be comfortable with that 4% to 7% range that we've
talked about, which we think adequately reflects the volatility that is in our world. If you take 2013 as a year, a full
year, we came in at about 6%. If you look at 2014 now as a full year, we came in organic growth about 5%, so we think
that 4% to 7% range remains reasonable, and indeed that is what we're planning against. And I'm sorry about the name
slipup.

And next we have Michael Steib of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning, Ian.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Michael Steib>: My question relates to the U.S. environment, really. You said that the U.S. category growth is
edging towards the upper end of the 1% to 2% range, yet pricing in your categories continues to be down due to the
promotional activities. Given the commodity cost tailwind, even if it's marginal that you're going to experience next
year, do you see that promotional environment remain at broadly similar levels going forward? Or should it get
intensified from here?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, I think, Michael, that our assumption is that it will continue pretty much as it has been.
When you look at 2014, you might say that some of the, shall we say, naked pricing pressure has come off, but we
definitely saw in the North American environment couponing both in terms of the number of coupons dropped – and
you know that's a large part of U.S. promotional activity and works its way through the income statement and price, the
couponing volume and couponing values both stepped up substantially in 2014, and we expect that will continue in
2015. Now in part, coupons create trial for new products, so that's quite healthy, so you'll see some bumps, I guess,
quarter-by-quarter because of that. So we're assuming that competitive environment in our categories, at least, will
continue as we've seen it perhaps with more emphasis towards couponing.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay. I think the new areas, really – we're back up. We have had hubbing operations in parts of
our world for a long period of time, and I think we talked about that relative to Latin America when I talked about the
groups we had there and the activity we took there. The next big tranche, if you will, of hubbing has been Europe, and
in that environment, we have both accomplished and delivered the savings and the efficiency that we were looking for.
And now the market level activity begins, and the next leg of that journey now will be to get the accrued benefits of
having hubs now work with shared service centers.
And I guess, frankly, most importantly of all, with that focus and the ability to sharpen our investment behind the
businesses as you saw in the release and in Bina's commentary, market shares in our principal categories are up, and
that in a slow-growth European environment is ultimately what underpins I think our ability to continue to deliver
organic growth in that part of the world, which when you think about why we prioritize Europe first from the Global
Growth and Efficiency point of view was the objective of the exercise.

<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning, thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning. Ian, can you just kind of help us walk through as we look at oil kind of
dropping to where it did in the fourth quarter, how that works through your P&L over the next 12 months, I mean, in
terms of be it diesel or just straight oil or resin, and maybe percentages, if you can, just will we see 50% of the benefit
by the first half? Or do we really not see it until the second half? Just trying to get a gauge of how it really influences
the business and how long it takes to influence the business.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, as you've heard from many, there is a lead lag, things in life have a way of going up
quicker than they come down. If you take oil, the most immediate benefit you get tends to be in freight because that
prices quite quickly, and so we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter, very modest, and we expect that to benefit
us starting in this quarter in 2015. When you talk about the flow-through benefits of the resin impact and the other
material impacts, that will start to benefit us towards the end of the first half, partly related to it working through the
system, partly related to our own inventory levels. You have to work those through before you get the benefit, which is
why we make the point that as we build to that 50 basis points to 100 basis points gross margin improvement, it is
going to build across the year because the commodity benefits will really start flowing in in the second quarter.

question. Just where are you budgeting oil for 2015? And then just shifting gears, could you talk a bit about your
thoughts on the share gains that you've seen from some of your euro-based competitors over the last three years to five
years? And your views on fending off some sort of incremental spend that they're going to have given current exchange
rates, as well as potentially reversing some of those share gains that you've had, or, Ian, just broadly, how do you think
about a more able-bodied competitive landscape from some of those companies?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. In terms of the oil, we actually budgeted oil at about $60, so obviously if it stays at the
current level, we will pick up a little bit more. We'll have to see how all of that works through across the year. In terms
of European-based competitors, if you mean from a foreign exchange point of view, we're all managing in a world, and
we all have different parts of the world, and we all have growth ambitions in those different parts of the world. We

making sure that our commercial investments, including traditional advertising and promotion, are appropriate for both
the European category growth rates and the competitors we meet in Europe. If we see things change and we think we

And next we will go to Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. How are you? So just a couple quick follow-ups. One is – and I'm sorry, you might have
said this, but I had to jump off for a second, if you could quantify actually, Ian, the Venezuela impact on your growth
rate? Because even if it's 3% of sales as you said price mix as best as we can tell, you put that together, it might be a
point-and-a-half to two points of your 6-point growth. So if you have quantified that, I apologize, but if you could say
that again?
And I do wanted to go back to this ad spend being down 8%, below 10% for you, which is something I haven't seen
since 2009, and to your point, I don't think it's unique to you guys. A lot of the companies in the sector are trying to, to
your point, balance above the line versus the below the line ad spend, and the risk to the brand. And so I'm trying to get
a sense from you – because that doesn't show up in one quarter, right? So the risk to the brand as you go forward, and
how do you think about that gross to net versus pure ad spend and what the right balance is?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes. Well, no, even if you did drop off, Ali, we didn't provide that information on Venezuela, and
we won't now. The point I did make relative to Venezuela, indeed, Latin America is that we took pricing across Latin
America in the fourth quarter. In the case of Venezuela, yes, it was episodic, as we said, in the third quarter, it would
be, because we hadn't had pricing for several years. That same episodic benefit also benefited our principal
multinational competitors who got the same government approvals on key categories for them at exactly the same time
we got ours and, indeed, the local competitor was granted pricing as well.
So everybody benefited from pricing in Venezuela, but the point to make is we took pricing across the board and in an
environment where everybody was getting pricing our global growth rate was indeed 6%. In terms of the advertising,
yes, you're right, one has to be conscious about the brand health, as we call it. I will say that the kind of model that
perhaps many of us grew up with where what was accounted for in trade spending was inherently bad and only those so
called below-the-line spending was good.
I think those days are gone. I think one's ability to take Hispanic consumers in the U.S. that you can reach with in-store
activity that may have a component of price, but might be much more driven by a coupon that is regionally dropped to
high population areas, these kind of techniques are now available and they weren't available before. And you can
measure them, you can execute them, retailers can handle different configurations to put them at work with the
consumer. But coming back to the brands, we do do tracking work, and our tracking work around the world shows that
if you take our oral care business around the world, the health is very, very good of those brands.
So by all means, we track it sometimes from a short-term point of view. If couponing or other activity steps up, you
have no option, at least in part, to participate, but I think we've been one of the loudest voices, at least I hope so, in
saying that we much prefer to compete in an environment of innovation with marketing support than price promotion.
But we don't see weakness in brand health. That is something, of course, we have and will continue to track.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good morning, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Just two things; one was to follow up on this conversation about in-store spend versus
traditional advertising. Is it fair then to summarize kind of the environment you're seeing right now to say that in the
regions where you've had more in-store spend, more promotion, it's not necessarily because of negative flare-ups in the
competitive environment? It's a little bit more choice-full on how to best reach the consumer for a given activity that
you guys have slated? Or is there, in fact, a kind of step-up in the negative promotional environment currently?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I would say it is more the former, Lauren. And these are techniques that with our Colgate business
planning and so on that we have learned to be efficient with, so it's choice-full. But I also have to say take an
environment like the United States, there's no question that that couponing environment has become more competitive
and we have correspondingly become more competitive in that environment. But if I took an overall stance, I would
say as we have been saying for a time, that it is choice-full with techniques that we think not only reach the consumer
but actually strengthen the equity of our brands over time.

<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hi, good morning everyone.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Javier.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: My question has to do with the 2012 Restructuring Program that was expanded to the savings
target to up to $390 million. It seems to me that only a third of the savings has been accrued up to now? So I would like
to understand how much of savings will accelerate in the next couple of years in order to hit the $390 million target. If
you could help us understand what kind of activities are going to happen, is this more hubbing like the one that you did
in Europe, or is it manufacturing facilities being up in Asia? Help us understand physically what activities are going to
take place that are going to help the savings to ramp up in the next two years, okay? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, the first thing to say, Javier, the program is very much on track. Indeed, as Bina said,
our performance in 2014 was up. If you look at our, so far, savings against the total, we're running about half accrued,
so it's not a third. And if you look at the activity going forward, yes, it is in the same areas that we had very much
spoken to in the beginning. So it is the hubbing, it is what we are doing with our facilities, and it is the expanded use of
the Colgate business service centers. And we're very excited by it because we think, as we have now seen in Europe,
not only does it bring you the immediate term savings, but it makes you operate smarter and faster and in a more
efficient manner. So we like it not just as a global growth and efficiency program, but because we think it ultimately
gets us organizationally to a better place from an operating point of view.

you were able to take in the fourth quarter and how much you think you still need to take, and whether you think
demand will drop off quite meaningfully. And secondly on Mexico, both Kimberly and Procter have had very difficult

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Mexico hasn't changed for us. We certainly didn't see a 20% decline there, nor did we see a 20%
decline in China. So no, that environment hasn't really changed for us. Russia, for us, is still a relatively modest part of
our business, between 1% and 2%. Chaotic may be overstating it, but it is indeed difficult, and it is likely to become
more difficult. We have lived this before at the end of the 1980s, and indeed the senior executive that lived it then is
living it again now. And so that we know the actions to take from a structural cost point of view and we're taking those
actions, and, of course, we are taking pricing and we are transferring funds and we are watching closely distributors and
wholesalers. So we're very much managing Russia from a containment point of view, but we're very close to our
businesses, so we believe we have a good handle on it. And interestingly, shares are up. So maybe cold, but they're up.

<Q - Jason M. English>: All right. Thank you, guys, for squeezing me in.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Even got the name right. I've got a couple of follow-up questions -
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Good question, Joe.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Yeah. There we go. There we go. All right. Now, it seems right. One on the promotional
dynamics. On P&G's conference call, they referenced expectation of getting 400 basis points of margin gains, constant
currency – or no, even currency loaded out of Brazil and India. Hard to see how they get that without pulling some of
the money they've put in the market back out. So are you seeing the promotional intensity ease in those markets? And
then secondly, gross margins, I just wanted to walk through a little bit more deeply on the answer to the question
earlier. You're signaling sort of neutral commodities, maybe even a little bit of favorability with oil. So to steady hold
the line on price, continued productivity, you do the math on that. Even if you assume that transactional headwinds
become more substantial than they were this quarter, it's still hard not to see a path to at least 150 basis points of gross
margin expansion. So what am I missing there?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: About 50 basis points, I think. If you take India and the promotional intensity, actually, India,
from Procter's point of view, was never particularly intense in our categories. Now, if you look at India, Bina talked
about the market share, we're approaching 55%, and the competitor in question has about 0.7% share. And our business
there continues to be quite strong.
In terms of Brazil, I would say yes, the promotional intensity has dropped off a little bit in Brazil, which is a good
thing. On gross margin, Jason, and I'm sorry with the glib response, but the gross margin is really one of phasing.
Because as I tried to explain earlier, we think that gross margin expansion is very much going to build across the year
because although we see the headline lowering of commodity costs and certainly oil, the work through of that from our
inventory point of view to its effect on resins, bottles, et cetera, will take some time to be seen.
And on the flip side, the transaction impact when forex goes against you, that hits you straight away, whether it's the
stuff you have to pay in your payables, whether it's the dollar denominated raw materials that replace that which you
are now having to pay for. So that's immediate, and the win back on the gross margin takes a little bit more time. So I
do think we'll end next year in a strengthened position gross margin wise, but it really is all to do with phasing.
So I believe these were all the questions we had.
