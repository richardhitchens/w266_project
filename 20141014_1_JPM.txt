MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please standby, we are about to begin. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the JPMorgan Chase's Third
Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will
now go live to the presentation. Please standby. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's
Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is
available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the
presentation.
Starting on page one, the firm delivered strong underlying performance this quarter, with net income of $5.6 billion on
strong revenue of over $25 billion, up 5% year-on-year, reflecting growth across most of our businesses; an EPS of
$1.36 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% for the quarter. Included in our results was firmwide legal
expense of approximately $1 billion after tax, which relates to a number of matters, in large part, an estimated amount
for FX, which was treated as non-deductible for tax purposes. There were also a number of smaller items, most notably,
a benefit of approximately $400 million of tax discrete items in Corporate, as well as Consumer reserve releases of
$200 million pre-tax. Excluding these and other non-core items, net income was approximately $5.8 billion, reflecting
strong core performance.
The quarter was characterized by continued strength in our leadership positions as well as market share gains across the
Consumer businesses. Higher levels of market volatility and client volumes than anticipated in CIB, and record

performance in Asset Management. Core loan growth for the quarter was strong, up 7% year-on-year while maintaining
strong discipline across the board and with encouraging trends in Consumer. We've also continued to make progress
against our capital targets, with a CET1 ratio of 10.1% and firm supplementary leverage ratio of 5.5%, all while
returning approximately $3 billion of capital to shareholders the quarter, with gross share repurchases of $1.5 billion.
Turning to page two, adjusted expense, that's excluding legal, was $14.7 billion in the third quarter, down
approximately $30 million quarter-on-quarter, with an adjusted overhead ratio of 59%. We continue to be focused and
diligent on managing expenses. Although our third quarter adjusted expense may appear elevated in comparison to our
full year target of $58 billion, it was substantially driven by higher Markets performance versus our earlier
expectations. If the positive momentum continues in the fourth quarter, it's likely that our total adjusted expense will be
above $58 billion but obviously on higher revenues.
On credit, despite lower reserve releases, Firmwide credit costs remain very low, driven by reduced net charge-offs.
We expect total net charge-offs for 2014 to be less than $5 billion, which is below our previous guidance. Also
included on this page are the returns generated by each of our businesses this quarter. Of note, the Commercial Bank
and Asset Management achieved 18% and 25% ROEs respectively, in line with their through-the-cycle target. CCB
was at 19% and if you back out the impact of legal expense in CIB, its ROE would've been around 14%.
Moving on to capital on page three. The firm reported a fully phased-in advanced CET1 ratio of 10.1%, up from 9.8%
last quarter, reaching our year-end target of 10% plus. Not on the page but for your information, the fully phased-in
standardized ratio was 10.5%. As you know, the final U.S. rules on SLR and LCR were published in September. On
SLR, there were no notable changes and as I just mentioned, the firm's SLR was 5.5%, reaching our target level; and
we're at 5.7% for the bank this quarter. The LCR final U.S. rule had some changes versus the NPR. Remember, we
have been disclosing our LCR compliance relative to the Basel rule. The U.S. final rule is in some ways more punitive
but we remain compliant with a more modest buffer.
Moving on to business performance starting with CCB on page four. The combined Consumer businesses generated
$2.5 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue, and an ROE of 19%. I'd like to draw your
attention to the right-hand side of the page. It shows that the long-term investments we've been making in the business
are paying off; illustrated by the many leadership positions we hold. We're particularly proud of our customer
satisfaction ranking. We're seeing continued strong growth in the underlying business drivers, average deposits were up
$35 billion year-on-year, an increase of 8%. Our active mobile customer base is up 22%, and credit card sales volume
of $120 billion was up 12% on strong new account originations. Across CCB, we've reduced head count by over
10,000 this year against our year end target of 8,000 outlined at Investor Day. And we expect a total reduction of
11,000 or so by year end.
Finally, before I move on, as you are aware, JPMorgan and certain others in the financial services industry, experienced
cyber attacks this quarter. We are taking every step to protect our customers and our Firm, but these attacks highlight
the need for continued and increased cooperation among businesses and the government to systematically reduce and
resolve cyber threats. We are committed to doing our part. To date, we have not observed elevated levels of fraud
related to this matter.
Turning to page five, Consumer & Business Banking. CBB generated net income of $914 million, up 20%
year-on-year. The business continues to improve its operating leverage with an ROE of 33%, up 6 percentage points
versus a year ago, with revenue up 5% and expense relatively flat. Underlying business drivers remain strong, average
deposits of $476 billion were up 9% year-on-year and client investment assets were up 16% to a record $208 billion.
We continue to see strong deposit growth across regions and markets. In fact, for the third consecutive year, we led the
FDIC survey with the highest deposit growth among the largest 50 U.S. banks. Overall, we grew our deposit share in
46 of our 50 largest markets nationwide, and we remain number one in three of the largest deposit markets.
Moving on to revenue. Net interest income was up 4% year-on-year, driven by strong deposit growth offset by
continued pressure on margins. And non-interest revenue was up 6%, with investment revenue growth driven by Chase
Private Client and with the addition of over 700,000 households driving stronger fee income. Expense is relatively flat
with efficiency improvements in the business being offset by increased cost of control.

Finally, on Business Banking originations. The momentum that we've seen in recent quarters continued and we believe
we've outperformed the industry with loan originations for the quarter of $1.6 billion, up 27% year-on-year, down
quarter-on-quarter seasonally. This reflects a combination of industry trends improving, driven by business optimism
generally continuing to remain strong and improving banking performance, especially in expansion markets as our
targeted strategies mature. We do expect the strong growth to continue through the remainder of the year.
Mortgage Banking on page six. Overall, Mortgage Banking net income was $439 million for the quarter, with an ROE
of 10%. As expected, the production environment remains challenging. Mortgage production pre-tax income, ex
repurchase, was slightly positive for the quarter, a little better than guidance on better than expected expense
performance. Originations of approximately $21 billion, were up 26% quarter-on-quarter against the market that we
estimate to be up approximately 10%. Therefore, we believe we've gained share and that share gain has been in high
quality jumbo and conventional eligible loans, which, as you know, are the segments we're focusing on.
As a reminder, with purchase mix up, the business has become much more seasonal, with volume and profitability
peaks in the second and third quarters, and low in the first and the fourth quarter. Given this, we still expect the fourth
quarter results to be a small negative as previously guided. Finally, on production we had a $62 million benefit in the
quarter, driven by refinements to our repurchase reserve.
On to servicing. Net servicing-related revenue of $639 million was down $54 million quarter-on-quarter, again, on the
better side of our guidance due to gains on the sale of Ginnie Mae loans.
Looking forward into the fourth quarter, core servicing revenue will continue to decline and we expect less benefit
from other revenue sources, such as those from Ginnie Mae sales, given lower delinquencies and lower loan
modification volumes. As a result, we do expect fourth quarter servicing revenues to be $600 million or slightly lower.
Servicing expense increased approximately $25 million quarter-on-quarter due to investments in control and
operational improvements. You will note that this represents a delay in achieving our target of $500 million for the
fourth quarter. However, we are doing what's necessary to improve our controls and operational processes, and we
expect servicing expense to continue to decline through 2015 at a slower pace. MSR risk management was a modest
gain of $76 million, reflecting regular model updates.
On real estate portfolios, we added approximately $6.8 billion of high quality loans to our portfolio this quarter, up
from $5 billion in the second quarter. Loan quality remains very strong. We've recorded net charge-offs of $81 million
and reserve releases of $100 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio, reflecting improvements in home prices as
well as delinquencies. Lastly, on Mortgage, head count was down approximately 6,000 year-to-date, meeting our target
for the year outlined at Investor Day, and we are on track to reduce it by an incremental 1,000 or so by year-end.
Turning to page seven, Card, Merchant Services & Auto. Net income of $1.1 billion, down 10% year-on-year, but up
4%, excluding reserve releases, with an ROE of 23%, reflecting very strong spend as well as balanced growth of $3
billion year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter as growth in our core business is now outpacing
the runoff portfolio. Overall, we saw strong and stable revenues of $4.6 billion, flat year-on-year. Loan growth, as well
as strong sales volume, was offset by spread compression and higher amortization of customer acquisition costs.
Expense is up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher fraud expense related to Home Depot and higher Auto
lease depreciation. In Card, sales growth of 12% led the industry for the 26th consecutive quarter. This industry
outperformance is being driven by the value proposition of our core Chase branded and partner products and the
investments we're making in customer acquisition, Ultimate Rewards, marketing and customer service. These
investments are driving strong new account originations, up 29%. And the performance of these new accounts, 2013
and 2014 vintages, is exceeding our expectations.
In Merchant Services, volume was up 15% year-on-year driven by continued strong sales performance. Our transaction
growth was up 6% year-on-year, lagging sales growth, driven by merchant mix and aggregation trends.
In Auto, new vehicle sales continue to grow year-over-year, with the third quarter up 8%. We've seen the 12th
consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth despite a very competitive market, and credit losses continue to be stable

and low, with the Auto pipeline remaining healthy, consistent with the recovery in the auto market.
Moving on to credit – The environment remains benign. We continue to see improvements in Card early delinquencies
and the Card net charge-off rate was 252 basis points, an all-time low. This quarter, we released $100 million of Auto
and student lending reserves with no releases in Card.
During September, a new step forward in the evolution of payments was announced, Apple Pay. We are excited to be a
key player in a solution that offers improved security and a streamlined customer experience. At the same time, we are
continuing to develop other innovative payment solutions.
Moving on to page eight and the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $1.5 billion on revenue of
$8.8 billion and an ROE of 10%, or 14% if you adjust for legal expense. In Banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion,
down 6% year-over-year. IB fees were $1.5 billion, up 2%, with revenue growth in advisory and equity underwriting
fees on strong market activity being offset by lower debt underwriting fees.
We maintained our number one ranking in Global IB fees per Dealogic, with particular strength in ECM in Europe and
IPOs globally. And we remain a go-to bank for large deals and related financing. The IB pipeline is strong, with an
environment supportive of M&A and a strong equity underwriting market.
Treasury services revenue was $1 billion, in line with our guidance, and lending revenue was down approximately
$200 million year-on-year, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses of over $100 million in this quarter versus
modest gains in the prior year on securities received from restructuring.
Let's spend a moment on Markets revenues. The green shoots and the potential upside to our performance that we've
been seeing in early September did in fact materialize, and our reported Markets revenues were up 1% year-on-year,
despite a strong third quarter last year, a quarter in which we significantly outperformed.
In Fixed Income, in currencies and emerging markets, a strong quarter and a particularly strong September, with pickup
in both volumes and volatility, as currency markets benefited from divergence across global monetary policies, an
average quarter for commodities and credit, and an improving quarter for rates.
In equities, we saw quite strong performance for third quarter in line with last year's, cash was very strong in EMEA on
the back of a strong primary market, and equity derivatives results were lower versus a record last year, offset by an
uptick in prime services revenue on higher balances and continued growth.
Of note, customers are taking notice of the progress we've been making in building out our electronic trading platform,
and we're seeing strong growth in electronic trading volumes, up 50% year-on-year in Europe and nearly 20% in the
U.S.
Moving on to the outlook for the fourth quarter, we are pleased to have completed the sales of our physical
commodities business and GSOG portfolio, which were major parts of our business simplification agenda and with
limited impacts on ROE over time. However, these sales will present revenue headwinds in the fourth quarter. And
based upon their contribution to last year's results, these will drive an approximately 8% revenue decline
year-over-year, or approximately $300 million.
So outside of the year-over-year decline driven by business exits, we are cautiously optimistic that momentum may
carry over. However, October so far has been mixed, likely on the back of a changing market sentiment around the
prospects of global growth and inflation.
Securities services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 8% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits,
down quarter-on-quarter 5% on seasonality. Assets under custody were $21.2 trillion, up 8% year-on-year. Credit
adjustments and other, a positive $240 million, is driven primarily by DVA and FVA as a result of credit spread
widening and refinements to certain assumptions.
Moving on to expense. Total expense was up 21% year-on-year, with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the quarter
and year-to-date. Noncomp expense was up 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by legal expense, but down 2%

quarter-on-quarter, as increased legal expenses were more than offset by lower cost of business simplification and other
expenses. Just quickly on CIB loans, the headline 5% decline for loans is driven by lower client overdrafts and trade.
Underlying that, traditional credit portfolio and other HFI loans were up by over 10%.
Moving on to page nine and Commercial Banking. The quarter saw a net income of $649 million on revenue of $1.7
billion, with a strong ROE of 18%. Revenue was down 3% from the prior year and 2% sequentially, reflecting yield
compression in our lending book as well as business simplification, partially offset by higher loan and deposit balances.
Expense of $668 million was in line with guidance and relatively flat year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, despite
ongoing investments in control. Loan balances increased $1.6 billion in the quarter, driven by continued strong
performance in our Commercial Real Estate businesses.
CRE loans increased 13% year-on-year, and 3% quarter-on-quarter, both in excess of the industry. And our CRE book
has now grown for 14 consecutive quarters. C&I loans were relatively flat from the prior quarter, broadly in line with
the industry trends. Of note, deposits increased $5 billion in the quarter, mostly in middle market and corporate client
banking. This is reflective of our clients still managing with very high levels of liquidity.
Having said that, utilization rates were up slightly for the quarter and pipelines continue to move incrementally higher
across the board. Outside of lending, we continue to make good progress in building our core franchise. This quarter,
gross Investment Banking revenue was approximately $500 million, up 12% from last year and on a year-to-date basis,
the Commercial Bank has generated $1.4 billion of Investment Banking revenues for the firm, up 22%.
Card & Merchant Services revenue increased 7% from the prior year. And finally, since this time last year, we've added
approximately 500 new clients in targeted industries. Overall credit performance remains strong with net charge-offs of
only 1 basis point, marking the seventh consecutive quarter, with net charge-offs in the single digit or very low or
recoveries.
As you think about the coming quarter, we do expect current trends to continue. We would like to remind you of the
one-time proceeds of approximately $100 million that we received in the fourth quarter of last year from a
lending-related workout.
Moving on to page 10, Asset Management. An excellent quarter in Asset Management, with record net income of $572
million, up 20% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter, with a 25% ROE and a 31% pre-tax margin, in line with our
through-the-cycle targets. For the full year, we expect these ratios to be below our through-the-cycle targets.
You'll see that we've changed from reporting our revenue by client segment to reporting revenue by line of business to
be consistent with how we manage the business. So, we're introducing sub line of business results for revenues in
Global Investment Management and Global Wealth Management.
Overall, revenue of $3 billion was up 9% year-on-year reflecting an increase in management fees, driven by long-term
net inflows, including $16 billion this quarter. This marks the 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, driving
AUM of $1.7 trillion up 11% year-on-year. While we continue to see strengths in our multi-asset and fixed income
flows, equity flows were flat this quarter. Asset management expense of $2.1 billion was up 4% from a year ago and up
modestly 1% versus last quarter.
In Banking, we reported strong performance in both lending and deposits. Record loan balances, up 16% year-on-year
and 3% quarter-on-quarter, with growth coming from both our U.S. and our international markets, and a solid pipeline
for demand for the remainder of the year. Deposits were also a record, up 9% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter.
Lastly, as reported, client assets of $2.3 trillion were up 4% year-on-year and down 5% quarter-on-quarter. However, as
part of business simplification, we closed the sale of the RPS business during this quarter, recognizing a small gain
reflected in GIM. Excluding the impact of the RPS sale, client assets would have been up 10% year-on-year and flat
quarter-on-quarter.
Moving on to page 11 in Corporate and Private Equity. Private Equity reported $71 million of net income, driven by
net valuation gains, including a small net gain related to the portfolio sale in OEP, which we announced in the quarter,
predominantly offset by related expenses. Year-to-date, the portfolio balance is down by approximately $2.5 billion,

and with this sale, we expect it to be down by about $4 billion by year end.
Treasury and CIO reported a small net loss, $30 million, with NII slightly positive in the quarter. And Other Corporate
net income at $357 million. Included in this result, a tax-related benefit of approximately $400 million as I previously
mentioned, as well as approximately $500 million pre-tax of legal expense. With the remainder of the Firmwide legal
expense principally in the IB.
At the Firm level, our tax rate for the quarter was 28%, broadly in line with a normalized tax rate of 30%, plus or
minus. Non deductible legal expenses in CIB were offset by tax benefit here in Other Corporate. Before moving on to
our outlook page, firm NII was up approximately $320 million quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower interest expense in
CIB. And Core NII was up approximately $110 million.
Moving on to page 12. You can see on the page our current outlook, which I've already addressed throughout the
presentation. So wrapping up, a strong result for a third quarter, despite legal expense of $1 billion after tax. This
reflects the strength of each of our franchises and the benefit of a diversified business model. We have made substantial
progress against our control and regulatory agenda as well as business simplification, albeit with more work to do and
we have successfully executed against our 2014 targets for capital, leverage and liquidity.
As I've shown you today, the investments we are making in our businesses are fueling growth and underpinning strong
earnings now and in the future. And we remain focused on serving our customers and safeguarding their assets and our
company. With that, operator, please open up the lines for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Matt.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Can you just give us a sense of what's left in terms of simplifying the model,
maybe split it between the CIB and Consumer if that's a good way of approaching it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, I mean – so, Matt, I would say we – I think in – I can't remember which quarter it was,
but several quarters ago, we put a slide out in the presentation that showed what the – it was last year, showed what the
business simplification agenda looked like. I think if you go back and now look at what we've done, including what we
were able to either complete or sign this quarter, OEP, the RPS business, GSOG, commodities, we've certainly broken
the back of most of the business simplification agenda.
Having said that, it is an ongoing process and we continue to derisk clients and industries and continue to simplify our
products in Mortgage and the like. So I would characterize that the actions that we've taken by the end of this year are
substantially all of them, but at the margin, we continue to look at client by client, product by product to simplify
things.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, and as a follow up, somewhat related but as we think about having more
clarity on the capital rules and specifically the supplemental leverage ratio as well as the LCR, is there some
opportunity for optimization of the balance sheet now that you have more clarity on those rules?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, we've talked before about the fact that when you take into the consideration a combination
of the leverage and liquidity rules together with our own point of view on positioning the company for rising rates, so
therefore our own point of view of being underinvested in the duration perspective that we have, we believe, a
relatively optimized balance sheet. Although it looks like we have a significant amount of cash, that is in part non

operating deposits that at some point will either flow out or be adequately paid for by the client return, and in other
parts is part of our overall liquidity.
I mentioned that subsequent to the U.S. LCR rules being made final that although we have been reporting previously
against Basel, a compliance in the 20-plus percent range, so a buffer of 20-plus percent, the U.S. rules are more
punitive in a number of ways. Most notably, they look at peak outflows in 30 days rather than cumulative and also on
higher outflow assumptions across certain categories. Given that, we are now compliant with a more modest buffer. So
we would say that we are largely optimized.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly, the $300 million of revenue going away in the fourth
quarter, what would be the expenses and capital against that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So the capital is relatively minimal in comparison to the overall Firm. So while it obviously is
positive for us, it's not a noteworthy number. And the expenses, just to note that I said the ROE is limited over time.
This was a business that was still being built and therefore hadn't yet reached the maturity stage or a stage where it was
returning its hurdle. It will take a little bit more time to take the expenses out, so there will be a slight lag in removing
expenses. So in the fourth quarter, it will be more modest, but over time, it would be a large chunk of that $300 million.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Thanks for taking all my questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, John.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning. Marianne, I was wondering if you could give us some broader context
on the core expenses. Is the principle driver of the updated outlook around the $58 billion, is that just comp? And can
you remind us where you are on the compliance control expenses in terms of leveling off there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so, we had a better third quarter than we had been expecting earlier in the quarter. We'll
see how the fourth quarter pans out. So yes, it is the case that if we have a better fourth quarter and therefore a stronger
second half of the year, then our expectations for comp will be higher. They'll still be well within our comp to revenue
ratio range of 30% to 35%. And you saw for the quarter 32% year-to-date the same. So in large part, it is going to be
based on higher revenues in Markets. This quarter, we also had higher revenues in Mortgage and also in Corporate. So,
that is the principle driver.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And as we look out to...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, sorry.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: As we look out further to 2015 and 2016, could you give us a reminder of where
you're looking to reduce the core expense base and get some savings on a one or two year basis?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, before I do that, you had a second part to your question on the cost of controls, let me
just deal with that very quickly. We talked about the fact that we would expect our control costs to reach a peak this
year. That's still the case. So I would say that they are substantially in our run rate by the end of the year. They will,
over time, be able to come down. They'll still remain elevated relative to historical because that's the new business
world we're in, but we're going to be able to become more efficient, automate things, finish remediations, look back. So
over time, that will provide leverage.
In terms of looking out to 2015 and 2016, while we haven't given specific guidance, I'll just point you to a few things.
The first is we do expect to continue to see mortgage servicing expense decline on the back of delinquency and credit
trends. We would also expect to see improvements in the production space, albeit we are – there is a reasonable fixed

cost base. Nevertheless, as you saw this quarter, we continued to make great progress in resizing that expense base.
In the non-mortgage base in the Consumer Bank, Gordon has committed to $1 billion in 2016 over 2014 principally but
not exclusively driven by automation and efficiencies in branch staffing leverage and also the branch footprint
optimization. And then while we didn't quantify it, Daniel is very much looking at the expense equation for positive
leverage that is reasonably significant over the next two years in the CIB. So, I would say across the board, obviously,
we're growing in Asset Management and we're investing in our businesses notwithstanding.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, that's helpful. And on the legal expense, did you give any color in the
beginning on what was that for this quarter? And in terms of the FX and LIBOR investigations, are those at the stage at
where reserves can be built or can you offer anything on that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, at the beginning, what I did say is that there are a number of matters in our legal expenses
for the quarter, but in large part, it does relate to FX. And consequently, you can read into that, that things are further
progressed this quarter than last quarter, but obviously, we can't comment any further.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just in terms of share buybacks and capital levels, was wondering
about your thoughts on the prospects for higher G-SIB buffers in the U.S. and how are you going to balance in the near
term, kind of you're growing your risk-based capitals against executing the remaining buyback authorization that you
have.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So just to talk about – so we did $1.5 billion of buybacks this quarter, same, last quarter.
Obviously, we have another two to go in terms of our approval. We don't know what the rule is going to be, it'll come
out before the end of the year, we'll have to see what that says. There will be a transition timeline. It will transition on
the same timeline – phase in timeline that the rest of the buffers transition in on through to the first of January 2019.
So there's no need for us to overreact and race to compliance. So we would do much as we have done over the course
of the last two years, which is balance, continuing to make good progress, getting to wherever it is that we need to be,
which we're not going to guess at at this moment, against the desire to want to continue to deliver capital to
shareholders in the form of increased dividends and repurchases.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Remember, you all have forecast where CET1 goes up to 10.5% or 10.8% or something like that.
When the new CCAR rules come out, we'll probably be able to fine tune what it might look like at the end of 2015.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. And the reality of the situation is sitting at 10.1%, we're in good company with the rest
of the industry in the context that just given how CCAR operates, it's highly likely that there will be overall accretion to
capital in the industry over the course of 2015, and we'll be no exception. So we will continue to accrete capital up
towards and potentially above our 10.5%, but we're not going to recalibrate a target until we understand the rules.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: One thing on the target. Just when you see the rules yourself, know that in our 50 to 100 basis
point buffer, the reason why we had a range was to allow in part for some of uncertainty and things evolving, and so we
would obviously want to fine tune and put a finer point on our buffer, so it's possible that our buffer may not be as high
as 100% too. So we'll deal with all of that when the rules come out.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And we've also been – remember, very careful, the purpose here is to protect and grow the client
franchise, meet the regulatory agenda, and then we'll adjust to all these changes as they take place. And the big ones,
we're going know by the end of the year, TLAC, G-SIB and new CCAR.
<A - Marianne Lake>: CCAR.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And Marianne, just on that point, you had some RWA inflation in the first half
as you awaited some model approvals – you were waiting for, I believe. Where are you on those model approvals and
your expectations for kind of the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets as we move forward?

Page 9 of 22
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you would have seen our RWA came down slightly in the quarter from the second quarter,
on the back of model improvements and later on portfolio runoff. So we're starting to see that bend now. It is the case
that as we project forward to the end of 2015, that the number that we showed you at Investor Day is still relatively
good. It's probably a little higher than that. We said $1.5 trillion, it will be somewhere between $1.5 trillion and $1.55
trillion by the end of next year.
We're not in complete control around the timing of model approvals. We obviously are doing everything we can to be
timely and then the regulators need adequate time to approve them. So we've kind of been a little bit more conservative,
potentially, about the duration it takes to get models approved but we're still on that same basic trajectory.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. So first question on – deposit growth has been great and I guess would love to see
higher rates in loan growth, but you're positively positioned for the parallel shift up. I guess my first question is how
does that change in a more of a flattening environment that we're experiencing right now? Do you capture most of the
benefit anyway, just getting off zero on the short end?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. I mean yes, there's a significant benefit. If you look at our disclosure, you can kind of
see the short-end versus long-end impact. Basically, there is a significant benefit coming up off the short end. So we
would expect to capture a significant portion of that in the first 12 months but we obviously are looking for a more
normal curve overall over time.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Just – I know we're not supposed to read too, too much into it, but in everyone's
mid-cycle DFAST results, I think everyone was calling for – or the big banks were calling for higher losses and lower
PPNR, in general, relative to your own self-test from the previous year. Is that conservatism? Because it's a little
different relative to the commentary about an improving economy, a little bit better loan growth, good expense control,
things like that. I'm just curious what we're supposed to take away from that mid-cycle.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Obviously, not to comment on everybody else's results, but our results were, in terms of the
size of the economic downturn, they were relatively in line and our results were relatively in line with a few minor sort
of enhancements to our process. So we weren't actually looking for materially changed results in our midyear DFAST.
So obviously, we haven't had instructions yet. We're expecting them absolutely imminently, possibly as early as this
week in terms of guidance from the regulators on how to think about the bank holding companies scenario for 2015
CCAR. To the degree that there are more and more stressful idiosyncratic losses, or stresses on leverage or other things,
it could have an impact, but we have to wait and see.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Last one. There are a couple articles on rewriting of banker's agreements between
major dealers to resolve some of the early termination rights issues, which obviously is going towards the Fed's issues
on living wills. A, did that actually happen or is that just being talked about? And B, does it resolve the issue in the Fed
– I know you can't speak for the Fed, but does it resolve the issue or do you still have the client side to deal with over
time?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, Mark Carney of the FSB and the Bank of England Chairman said that two major things
remain to finish kind of the too big to fail issues. One is how you deal with derivatives and the second is TLAC, and
that both of those would be done this year. This is the thing, it's been done. It's a great example. I think it was 18 firms
who got together and came up in a very complex way, globally, how to deal with this in a way that the regulators, and
the Fed put out a press release and Mark Carney's been very positive about it, and it was industry-led. So We do think it

does solve that issue. So all the buy side will do it.
It'll be eventually all the sell side – I mean the other way around – all the buy side will eventually want to do it because
it's actually better for the business as a whole, maybe not better for one trading desk, but it's better for business as a
whole, and it's a little coercive. So that the regulators are basically saying that to do further derivatives, you're going to
have adopt these new rules and we think, over time, a lot of people will do it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And just one thing that G- 18 does sort of break back of the problem, but we are still awaiting
actual regulatory guidance. So there's still the strong possibility that the guidance will be broader, and we would
encourage it to be broader, if nothing else, for simplicity purposes, not necessarily because G-18 alone don't really
achieve the result.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're also in a position where even if the buy side doesn't, for some reason, that we would be
able to manage that risk over time and it would diminish over time, because in the short duration of the derivatives.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Right. And as long as the Fed counts that as "material progress" by July of 2015, I'm cool
with it too. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey, a couple of questions. One is on just RWAs in general. There were some articles around
potentially shifting some of the repo activity to more of an agent role than principal role. I don't know if that's one of
the ways that you could potentially have a light impact maybe on RWAs, but on total footings, to help with the ratios,
is that something that's being considered?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so I mean the – our repo businesses, as you know, is essentially client-driven. And our
clients are very interested in ensuring that they are giving us sufficient wallet to allow us to dedicate sufficient balance
sheet to their business. So in that sense, we continue to see repo as a strategic product for our clients and a scarce
resource, quite frankly. It is obviously the case that as we understand new rules – but meanwhile, leverage rules have
been out for a while, and we've seen leverage reduce in the industry overall, but we continue to have a strong and
healthy repo business.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Would you be supportive of an industry move towards shifting repo to more of a CCP
environment or no?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're okay with the higher margin and standardized margin rules, and if they go to kind of a
tri-party CCP then that would be fine too. And it would alleviate other issues at that point in time.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. I mean between the CCP, and then I think the FSB then put out a framework last night
that talked about cross-industry, including non-financials, standardized higher levels of haircut that we're supportive of.
So I think the combination of those two things achieve a great deal.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, no, that's great. I asked the question in part because as people are concerned about
things like the SIFI buffer increasing and other regulatory capital requirements, I'm just trying to tease out what other
options you have to do your client-facing business, but yet maybe shrink the footings in a way that deal with these
ratios without having to "break up the bank".
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So, I think, Betsy, we will do exactly with this what we've done with everything else to
date, which is, overall, we're only going to put our balance sheet to work and allow our clients to use it if the overall
relationship over time pays us a sufficient return for that.

We have the ability to do that somewhat methodically, and so we're being very surgical and very strategic about how
we use our balance sheet. But it is a core strategic product for many of our clients and they want to continue to be able
to do that.
So, yes, we could. I mean, if you look at the numbers, however, you want to cut them, there is, within our repo
business, we do have a match book. We have inventory financing as well. We have client sweeps in our short-term
wholesale funding. So there are things we could do. We just don't want to overreact.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, thanks. And then just separately on the payments discussion. In your prepared
remarks, Marianne, you highlighted that you're delighted to work with Apple Pay, but that you're also working on some
other things yourselves. Could you speak to what other things you're doing independently?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so I mean we talked before and you'll see more over the coming few months about our
own wallet and payments capability, so Chase Pay and Quick Checkout, where we would provide the capability for our
customers to be able to have a much more seamless experience, also for merchants to have a lower abandonment rate
and continuing with the safety and security of tokenization and other methods. So we're continuing to work on our own
proprietary wallet and payment capabilities that will be piloted and then subsequently launched over the course of the
next coming months.
And then there's obviously the case that we are out of pilot and in production on our end-to-end capability, including
ChaseNet. So we're signing up merchants at a faster rate than we expected and, again, you'll hear more about that later.
But our ability to now negotiate, bilaterally, economics with merchants and provide customers with compelling reasons
to continue to bring share to us is also something we're working on.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, yeah, a basic philosophy has been that you, the customer, who want to be able to use your
debit cards, your credit cards in a way that you want, and that we want to make it available to you, whether it's Apple
Pay, in-store apps, other people's wallets, Visa Wallet, our own wallet – all which will have benefits, et cetera.
And as Marianne said, we think that we can also be friendly to merchants with data, with pricing, with simplified
contracts. So we're trying to make this an ecosystem that works better for everybody and is far more secure. Higher
customers on both sides, I'm far more secure.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And I think is it accurate, Jamie, that you mentioned at a recent conference that you were
looking to double the spend in cyber security. Is that right?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, I was just estimating, if I was taking a guess, that it will double in the next four years, or
five years.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I think it's fair to say, Betsey, that what we're seeing in cyber space, not surprisingly, is
this relentless, constant and evolving set of attacks and we need to be constantly evolving and constantly vigilant in
response. So it's entirely reasonable to assume that we'll continue to increase our investments over the course of the
next several years, and we'll – so it'll be larger and we'll let you know.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, I should clarify that...
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: I mean, tokenization...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I should clarify that was quoted in the press not accurately, because this is one area where the
government and businesses have been collaborating really well. And for a long time, as of course, all these government
agencies, and I think we need that, because the government sees all kind of attacks, they are a fount of information.
And then also the industry self-collaborates, which is we share information with other banks immediately when we see
something happening.
So maybe even if something happens to you, you can help one of your brethren avoid a problem like that. And then
cyber goes beyond just yourself, it's making sure that all your vendors you deal with have proper cyber control, that all
the exchanges have proper cyber control. So this is – we've identified this as a huge effort. We've been very good at it,

until this recent breach, which we're not going to make excuses for, we'll invest any and all things we need to do to get
it right. Our customers are protected, which is critical. But we don't want these things to be happening. But it's going to
be a battle.
You've already seen a lot of very, very serious – far more serious than personal data being taken, where social security
numbers, security codes, account numbers, et cetera. And we do think that, unfortunately, there are going to be some
wins and losses in this. This is not going to be one of those things where it's going to be absolute. And we don't want to
be sitting here saying, you can absolutely be protected, because we think that'll put you into a false sense of security.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Those are all great points. I mean, you could imagine tokenization moving beyond just
payments to any interface with clients at some point?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah. Tokenization can be more broadly used and that's avoiding a certain type of fraud, but not
other type of fraud. So you have to look at each one of these things and say, what does it accomplish?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, and that certainly helps across the payment space, but there are other areas of
vulnerability, obviously.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: All right. Appreciate...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And we have invested in EARL Security about who came to what systems, when they use private
computers with private lines as opposed to public computers from home. There are all these things we are all doing,
and we've had some great people come in, audit us. And this is one area I suggest to most companies, get someone to
come in who is an expert at this. And we have our own attacker system where we have our own people trying to get

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up, first of all, on the question that Glenn asked about
the change in the derivatives contracts. From your perspective, doesn't this fundamentally render the contracts less
attractive for users because of the loss of the automatic bankruptcy preference? And if so, would you expect that this is
one more potential pressure on the derivatives revenues that you've talked about in the past, potentially depressing your
revenues by as much as $1billion?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I don't think it makes it less attractive. For the one reason, if you look at one contract, that
someone may have in one fund or something like that, yeah, it may make it slightly less attractive. But if you looked at
the improved safety of the system, I think it makes it more attractive. If people believe that doing this makes the whole
system safer. Every institution will say, while, on the one contract side, I would prefer to have the optionality, but for
the total, I'd like the fact the system is protected and we have time to work all this out.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair point.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: If the resolution works, that is really, really good for everybody.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: I mean, everybody would have preferred that there was a resolution process in place for Lehman.
The pain and suffering would've been far less across derivatives, even though they didn't have the same – they had
more protection in derivatives at the time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And while we're on that topic, then, another thing that happened during the quarter,
obviously, was the Fed and FDIC rejecting the living wills. And I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what
changes that might have provoked from your point of view in terms of accelerating some of the simplifications that you
were talking about earlier?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I think just an important point of clarification, for what it's worth, is that the FDIC found
the industry's 2013 plans not credible. The Fed did not. So it wasn't a joint agency conclusion at that point. And so we
haven't had comment on the 2014 plan yet.
Having said that, we, talking for JPMorgan, we made substantial progress even between the 2013 and 2014
submissions. We're in dialog with our regulators to understand even more detail of what they found as being the
limitations or the vulnerabilities in our credibility of the plan. We're committed to remediating them by 2015. It has had
little bearing on our business simplification agenda because it was already a very broad and appropriate agenda, but we
continue to work on all number of things around the place, critical operations, legal entity simplification and we'll
continue to do so.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Remember, the FSB led by Mark Carney has made it – he has said publicly that the two big
remaining pieces are TLAC, which should be done this year, and the derivatives stay, that would be common
harmonization around the globe, and those two pieces are going to be in place and make resolution much more
achievable.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. And we should add that, obviously, the ISDA protocol was specifically pointed out in
that feedback and the industry voluntarily resolved that issue, I think, very well.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, fair enough. I mean, I think a lot of times the press reports forget to pull together all
the pieces like that. I hate to beat the regulatory horse too hard here, but one of the things that we were hearing towards
the end of the quarter was that our clients were telling us that they were seeing a significant falloff in liquidity in some
aspect of the credit markets in particular. And I was wondering, is there any link between that and some of the new
filings that you've had to start doing on a daily basis for – not just you, but , obviously, all the dealers, on liquidity and I
think some of the Volcker data gathering has started as well, and I was wondering if there's any linkage there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, so I mean – look, my point of view on this is that while we have started doing the filing
more recently, we've been well aware of the requirements for a reasonably long, if not very long period of time, and
have reoriented our business to be compliant in substance with the requirements. So the fact that we're producing
metrics at this point isn't having a meaningful impact on our business. It is the case that, over the course of the next
year, between now and the compliance date next July, we do expect, as an industry, receive feedback on that data and
we'll have to see how that progresses. But it's our point of view that our business is compliant.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me is – sorry, go ahead.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But industrywide as people pushed LCR and capital and some of these rules down to the trading
desk, that you did see a reduction in inventories, et cetera. But our view is that market making is a critical role in
society, and it has to take place. We have 16,000 clients and so we really do focus on serving those clients. And we've
electronified more of it. Some of it will go to clearing houses, some of it will be – but we want to be there for the
clients, and you will see how the industry sorts out. Some people in the industry making much more drastic decisions
than others. And our decision has been to be there, to make markets and just try to adjust to the new rules which may
make it a little more costly to trade.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: But what I think I hear you saying is that the recent imposition of some of these reporting
requirements did not, in itself, have those liquidity impact.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think it wasn't the reporting requirements, I think it was pushing down of LCR, the cost of
capital, the cost of debt, and the traders reduced their balance sheets a little bit, and are a little more cautious how they
use balance sheet. And that's industry wide. And then some people say, we simply can't stay in these areas. I've seen
people exit certain trading areas.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, I mean repo is a good example of that, where the level of, not concern, but the level of
dialogue with clients around our willingness to continue to commit our balance sheet to that business has increased
because others are less willing. And so we are seeing some of that for sure.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it and then the last one for me, Marianne, you gave some clarification around loan
growth in the CIB, but I'm not sure I quite understood it. Basically, you said the minus 5% headline number was
affected by a couple of, it sounded like, one-time-ish kind of things in what the underlying was. But as I said, I'm not
sure I really caught your drift.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, let me give you the down piece of it. One of them is not timing, it's just the continuation
of a trend where trade finance loans are down substantially year-over-year. And so when you look at the overall, loan
balance is being impacted by trade, markedly. And then on the client overdraft side, that is something that is a little bit
lumpier obviously. So those two things are driving it down. But the point of the comment was a little bit – not to
trivialize reported loan growth, which was still positive, but with those masking underlying performance in our credit
portfolio and HFI loans, so our more traditional credit lending continues to grow and grow at 10% plus pace.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Can you share with us – obviously, the Federal Reserve is asking for more capital for all the
large, global SIFI-type banks. What's the minimum cushion would you guys be comfortable running against? You
mentioned your 50 basis points to 100 basis points might be a little less. How low would you go in your cushion for
meeting those new capital guidelines when they come out down the road?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, I think – look, a reasonable point of view on that would be at the lower end of the range,
at the 50 basis points. So remember, when we – obviously, we'll refine it and we'll update you, but when we have
thought about having a buffer, it is there in order to protect us from a range of issues, including capital volatility driven
by AOCI. We regularly and routinely stress our portfolio to understand how much stress we could see in AOCI in a
short period of time, and that's going to be one of the principal drivers.
So I would say that's a reasonable sort of benchmark for the level that we would go to. That doesn't mean we have to
have that buffer in totality, as I said, buffers phase in between now and January of 2019. So whatever we decide it is,
however we communicate that to you, that, as well as all of the other buffers, capital conservation buffer, and G-SIB,
we'll phase in.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And CCAR may still be a limiting factor, so...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. As Jamie said, the reality is that the way CCAR is operating, while there has been good
progress in the communication and dialogue with the regulator, the reality remains that it is still not clear, either
quantitatively or qualitatively, exactly how everything is working and therefore it's unlikely to be the case that in this
cycle that you're going to see 100% or greater than 100% distribution. That's my view.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Yeah. Now regarding the return on equity, at Investor Day, you guys gave us the
through-the-cycle target of 15% to 16%. Clearly, I would assume that in this year's Investor Day when it comes up, if
these capital levels are even higher now than what you originally thought when you gave that guidance, it probably will
be a bit lower. What lines of business do you think will see the lower ROE targets if you decide that you need to lower
it through the cycle from the 15% to 16% that you gave us last year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, I mean, just before we sort of get on to the business by business lens on it, the reality,
mathematically, is obviously true that if we have higher capital, we would prima facie de facto have lower returns. But
the reality hasn't been that way over time. So you know acutely that we've added significant capital over the last
however many years and have been able to, over time, continue to reorient the business and optimize against it to
deliver strong returns.
So could there be a decline in returns? Well, we'll obviously will have to see what the rules look like. Clearly at the
moment, the most clear and present danger relates to higher G-SIB surcharges on short-term wholesale funding. So in
the first order impact of it, would obviously have an impact on, directly, those businesses and products in the CIB. But
obviously, if the company's holding more capital we'll look more broadly.
I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that you're going to see a pro rata decline in our returns. And obviously, we are
continuing to focus on our expenses and making sure that the overall business is as efficient as possible.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Is it fair to say that today's ROE in today's quarter of about 10%, which obviously is below
your through-the-cycle number, is it primarily an interest rate issue that's holding it back or is there some other issue,
the high elevated expenses that you're running due to all the new regulations and stuff?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so I mean, 10% on ROEs, 13% ROTCE, remember the target is an ROTCE target. It's
obviously right now in 2014, we're in a bit of a cyclical low in a number of ways and elevated expenses. So it's cyclical
lows in mortgage at least for the first half of the year, cyclical lows and some secular headwinds in the markets space.
Yes, we are reaching a peak in terms of control expenses, so that is in part contributing. Reserve releases are lower,
albeit the credit remains benign, but as a relative matter, they're lower, but we are staring efficiencies in the face across
our businesses over the course of the next two years.
So control costs will decline. CCB will deliver improvements in expense, CIB will also. Rates will be a meaningful
piece. Clearly, you've seen our sensitivity to rising rates is relatively significant but it's not the only piece. When the
economy generally recovers, when loan growth recovers, when volatility recovers, all those good things happen.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Shifting gears, if we look at leverage lending, the Federal Reserve has come out recently
concerned about some of the underwriting that's going on there, and I think they even pointed out that leveraged
lending now will be used in CCAR, possibly, from a qualitative standpoint. Can you guys give us any color on what
your understanding is of what's going on with leveraged lending today, and will it be included in CCAR?
<A - Marianne Lake>: To talk about what would be included in CCAR, the truth is we don't know. So what you have
seen, we have also read, but that doesn't constitute any kind of guidance. We haven't received guidance yet. So we're
going to have to wait to see that. It wouldn't be entirely surprising if there was some sort of leverage stress in that,
quantitatively; I can't speak to qualitatively.
And then yes, there have been more stringent guidance on leveraged lending from the regulators over the course of the
last year, and we've taken a fairly strict line on applying that. So it has in part been one of the reasons why we believe
we have seen lower loan growth in some of our business than we would otherwise have seen.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You guys mentioned...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And it's going to get a little stricter on the refi part of the leveraged loans. And obviously,
whatever the terms are, we will meet the terms. And some of that business will go to non-banks or some banks who are
not regulated by the OCC and the Fed.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You guys gave some very good numbers on the mobile app – usage by your customers.
What's the penetration rate of your customer base that uses that mobile app?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's still relative to 20-something million customers in households in – 23-something-like-that
million households in the retail sales space is still relatively low. From recollection, and we'll check the numbers for
you, I think it's in that 2 million to 3 million range. But nevertheless – no?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Mobile is much higher than that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Mobile is higher? Okay. We'll get back to you.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah, customers.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sorry.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You guys mentioned Apple Pay and the opportunities there. What are some of the business
– where can you see the growth, but at the same time, where can Apple Pay cannibalize some of your businesses, or are
there any that will be cannibalized?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Look, again, our view is to, if you're a client and you want to use your Apple phone to pay with
NFC at a merchant, that's fine. We don't want to say you can't use your JPMorgan Chase credit card or debit card. And
like we said, we're going to be in other people's wallets, too. And we're going to have our own, which we think will
have some competitive advantage.
Will it cannibalize? Sure. But we're not against cannibalizing our own business or disrupting ourselves if we're building
a better business and are gaining share. But our goal is to gain share. We do believe a little bit, and Jeff Bezos says,
your margin's my opportunity. We want to be the people that are coming up with the new ideas and stuff that are
getting more of our customers, using our stuff and happier. And if it reduces certain margins somewhere, so be it.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning. A follow-up on the loan question from before. You mentioned a little bit more
caution with leveraged loans. In the past, you said you didn't want to compete too much in the commercial space, it's
getting too competitive, there's been some concerns about auto lending with regulators. So my question is slide one
highlights that your core loans are up 1% quarter-over-quarter and the same slide in the second quarter said that core
loans were up 4% quarter-over-quarter. So my question is are you simply getting more cautious in the loans that you
provide or is there a little bit less demand in the market? Really trying to get to, is loan growth decelerating?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, Mike, look, if you look at year-over-year trends, they continue to be in the – I mean I
think the first quarter year-over-year was 4%, 8% in the second quarter, 7% in the third quarter. I think we're not
expecting those year-over-year trends to decelerate. Obviously, quarter-over-quarter, things can a be impacted just by

the timing of closing loans. But fundamentally, I would say, no, we aren't seeing significant deceleration
quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing continued relative momentum, solid across the board, with obviously more
challenges in the C&I space.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Separately, your expense guidance is now for over $58 billion, you said some of that's due to
comp. Is any of that increase in guidance due not to comp?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Relative to the $58 billion, plus or minus, that we previously said, no it's principally in high
revenues or higher market performance.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We always say that might be the case.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So we're meeting our overhead numbers and the comp itself would bounce around a little bit.
Remember in the old days, we used to break out IB comp and total for that reason, but...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay, separately, which capital ratio is your binding constraint? And using that ratio, what
should we use in our model three years out? And I know that's a tough question with all the moving parts, but what's
your best guess?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so in terms of what is our binding constraint at the moment, it is CET1, so Basel III
advanced capital – risk based capital at the margin. So it's not to say that the other ratios, leverage, liquidity and the like
aren't comfortably around it, and even stress capital, but that is currently our binding constraint.
It's very hard for us to give you a point of view of where you should do this in your model three years out when where
we're staring potentially new rules in the face in the next two months. As I said earlier, we are expecting, over the
course of the next 12 months, that we'll continue to accrete capital at to or above our 10.5%, which is basically in line
with what you guys all have in your models.
Beyond that, it's our expectation that hopefully, anyway, putting new rules aside, that by the time we're in our fourth or
fifth cycle of CCAR, we've made substantial industrywide progress in the sort of non-quantitative aspects of CCAR,
where we have more credible resolution plans and the like that we'll be able to be more aggressive in our ability to seek
capital distribution capability. So outside of any changes in rules, we would hope at the end of 2015 into 2016, CCAR
to be able to have payout ratios that are much higher. But we'll have to see.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then last question on the supplement, page six. This is a smaller item, but it just kind
of stands out. Your rate on trading liability has declined from 48 basis points down to 12 basis points in just three
months. Is there anything unusual there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, there is. So about half of that I would call – approximately half of that I would call
relatively normal. But included in that result, there is actually a one-time item associated with accounting for previous
interest accruals that we released in the quarter, which is one-time. You should expect that interest expense to go back
up next quarter to something more normal.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And how much – what was the dollar amount of that impact?
<A - Marianne Lake>: A little less than $100 million.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. All right, thank you.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning, just wanted to follow up with two quick questions. The first is, Marianne, as
we put together everything that you've said on expenses so far on this call, is it fair to assume that without rates, the
efficiency – adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% can continue to improve in 2015 and 2016?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so I think – yes, it is our belief that we should be able to manage the ratio to be stable to
improving over time, ultimately getting down to something much more in the mid 50%s, but that is dependent on
revenue growth associated with rates but not limited to rates. So in the absence of rates – but by the way, just to point
out, that it is still our case that based upon continued improvement in the domestic real economy that rates will start to
rise in the middle of next year. But having said that, even without rates, we would hope to be able to continue to
maintain the discipline to have that ratio be broadly flat to down.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great. And the second follow-up question is, given your expectations for rates to rise in the
middle of next year, are you still – and the continued progress you make on deposit share, are you still expecting $100
billion in deposit outflows in that case?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Well, so since we talked about the $100 billion estimated deposit outflows associated with
liquidity draining out of the system. Remember, that was predicated on believing that it was possible that the Fed
would use the Reverse Repo Program in much more size than is likely to be the case today for two reasons.
One is that, obviously, they've made changes to the term deposit facility that allows them to now be LCR-eligible,
which helpful in terms of providing another tool in their tool kit. And the second is that in September, as you know, the
RRP was capped in total at $300 billion. That cap may or may not be permanent. I'm sure it will be recalibrated over
time, but it looks like it will be unlikely to be reach the billion dollars that would have driven the $100 billion – sorry,
the trillion dollars that would have driven $100 billion.
So You can make your decision about whether it's $300 billion or $500 billion in the fullness of time and scale our
operating deposit outflows back relative to that, knowing of course that it's already in operation at $300 billion right
now.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thanks, Erika.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: Morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Morning, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So, appreciate that the repo book is substantially client-driven. Was maybe hoping that you
guys could give us some sense for how much of your repo book is firm financing versus facilitation.

say.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: ...to be more compliant with LCR, et cetera.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, that's fair. And I just wanted to try to square something here and maybe I'm reading
just a little too much into it. You had said that October on the capital markets side has been a bit mixed, but you've also
at the same time brought up your expense guidance and it seems like it's driven by expected or potentially, a component
of comp in capital markets. So are those two at odds? Are you just more optimistic that maybe what we're seeing here
in October is not necessarily some sort of dramatic shift but a temporary bout in bad volatility or how can we square
those two?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, I would square in two ways. The first is we already did have a better performance in the
third quarter than would have been anticipated in our previous guidance, given that that guidance was given during the
sort of harder times of the second quarter. So that's already in our run rate, so to speak, in terms of the comp that would
accrue to that.
And then if you sort of go back and, in the fullness of time, look at the transcripts, I did say if the performance
continues into the fourth quarter. So, it will depend. We've always said and evidently, maybe we should strip out comp
from our adjusted expenses, but we've always said that the adjusted expense absolute number in any period is obviously
going to be calibrated to the performance of the market-related businesses. And clearly, you would wave in good
revenues every day at 32% comp to revenue ratios. So, that's really all we were saying, nothing more subtle than that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, okay, thanks for that. And then, appreciate that there's not much color potentially to
be added on this charge tied to FX, but is it possible to let us know if it's tied to a particular geography?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No. No, it's not possible to talk about it in any more detail I'm afraid.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Suffice to say that we are working with a number of regulators across a number of
jurisdictions.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: All right, that's fair. And then last one from me. So in looking at the NIM simulation that
you guys have provided, and then taking a look at that in light of the interest rate shock disclosures you've got in your
Qs.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: It looks like 200 basis point rate shock adds about half of what you're looking for in a
normalized rate environment. So I guess, does that mean that the subsequent years sort of the benefit of rolling the
portfolio into higher rates is going to exceed the higher deposit costs by about $4 billion to $5 billion? And then is there
a particular time period that we should think about that, or is it going to be too heavily influenced by competitive
dynamics?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you are right that when you roll forward beyond the first 12 months, you do get the benefit
of being able to continue to reinvest deposits as they mature up the curve in terms of their underlying investment. So
that is the compounding effect of what you're seeing in our earnings at risk shock. But what we showed I think in – I'm
going to cease to recall it – but maybe it was in the Barclays Conference in 2013, is that you would expect once rates
start to rise, if they rise in a somewhat expected fashion, so obviously, it depends on what rate cost you want to put on
that, that you could expect the cumulative NII to be in our impact in three years to four years.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Remember, the benefit is more for the first 100 basis points, a little bit less the second hundred, a
little bit less the third hundred, a little bit less the fourth hundred, because there's increasing re-pricing of deposits at
that level. And we don't know exactly what the yield curve will be four years out but...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: And also, we do embed in that our own estimates of competition and repricing, but...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. And that's a very good point actually, Brennan. Our scenario does contemplate not only
a more normal loan to deposit ratio, a more normal interest bearing versus non-interest bearing deposit, and also a
higher feature on retail deposits, just given the LCR, competitive dynamics, the technology advancements and the like.
So, to the best of our ability, we've tried to bake that in and that's included in our number.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure, sure. Okay. Thanks. That's fair.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a tactical follow-up just on the balance sheet. With the
non-interest bearing deposits basically being the fastest growing category of the balance sheet, and the resulting asset,
the deposits with banks also being the fastest growing asset on the balance sheet. Just within that context of what you
just walked through with Brennan, I'm just wondering what changes structurally with the way you think about
reinvesting in the securities portfolio with rates as low as they are now, loan growth is okay but, to your point, you're
being somewhat selective on – and want to be careful with pricing and credit.
So just from a, more so taking the next year or so out, how are your thoughts changing at all with respect to what you
do with these deposits, given that they might actually not flow out as much given that change to the RRP function.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. So the deposits that – in part, not totality, in part, the deposits that were likely to
outflow through the RRP were non-operating deposits. And non-operating deposits, we do not count for significant
liquidity value in the firm. We fundamentally have them on deposit at central banks, at the Fed. And so if they stay,
we'll come back to whether we will be willing to let them stay. But if they stay, they will continue to basically be
treated in that way and they're not included in terms of our assumption around asset sensitivity and forward-looking
NII.
Obviously, over time, we are in the same way, we talked about repo, we're looking at non-operating deposits for our
clients in the context of their overall relationship. And so that is another valuable use of our balance sheet with
leveraged capital and the like against it. And in the fullness of time, we'll expect the overall relationship to pay for that,
but we're going to wait and see some of those dynamics play out.
So other than that, I'll just go back to the earlier comment I made that we do have a high level of HQLA, not in cash,
not in securities, but it is in order to make sure that we have adequate liquidity both under our own stresses most
importantly, but also under LCR and NSFR. And we feel good and at modest buffers relative to them.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: At the typical quarter end, a lot of large clients leave a lot of deposits here which obviously are
not necessarily good for us in terms of LCR or capital, et cetera, and we will be looking at how we manage those client
relations over time too.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Understood. Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The other thing you remember is securities portfolio is, as rates go up, the duration of that
extends on its own.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Yeah.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And so, we will be managing that and yes, we might invest longer than one point, but we are in a
very conservative position right now.

<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Yeah, okay. Got it. And then secondly, just two quick ones on mortgage. Default servicing
costs have pretty much stabilized the last couple of quarters at a good level. You had talked about getting down to $500
million total by the fourth quarter. And I'm just wondering how much more room is there given that improvement in
underlying trends that you're continuing to see for that to be a benefit to that cost side of the equation going forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So, we are continuing to see credit trends improve, delinquencies come down,
modification pipelines, all the metrics are coming down. Obviously, they're coming down from a much smaller place
this year than they were last year and the year before. So the pace of improvement or the relative pace is slower, but we
are expecting that to continue down through $500 million and into the $400 million in 2015. And then just more longer
term, you know that we're focused on ensuring that through the next cycle, we have a smaller delinquency portfolio,
and so a more normal level would be substantially less than this.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And I noticed that your...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Sorry, that's a longer term view.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Yes. I noticed also that underneath the origination improvement this quarter, there was a
decent jump in correspondent, I just wanted to ask if you're doing anything differently in terms of market share
opportunities on the mortgage side now that things have shaken out a little bit, or any change in your underlying
philosophy on where you're looking at originations?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so, I mean we talked last quarter about the fact that we had lost share, a combination of
things, primarily our strategy around the government mortgage space but also a little bit of share in what I would call in
our target segments, so we've made that back. So in some part, it's just continuing to leverage our balance sheet
properly, do very granular marginal pricing to really focus on changing and improving our customer operating
processes. Across the board, we just continue to get very granular and try and be as competitive as we can.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning. Marianne, I appreciated the color you'd given on the RWA guidance. I
suppose one thing that we've been hearing from a lot of clients or at least concern from clients is this notion of
regulatory gold-plating; essentially, the U.S. regulators adopting tougher standards than those are being enforced in
other areas around the globe. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how that's informing your thinking about RWA
mitigation plans. You reaffirmed the guidance at Investor Day, but what should we expect in the event that a tougher
capital as well as TLAC requirement is in fact enforced against U.S. G-SIBs?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So to be very clear, maybe it's actually slightly higher than Investor Day in terms of our
guidance. So look, obviously, any guidance that we give you – and no good deed goes unpunished – but any guidance
we give you is always predicated on based upon what we know today. And so if something changes that would change
that point of view, we'll obviously have to recalibrate it.
But just prima facie, having the requirement to have extra long-term debt or loss absorbing capital and/or capital
wouldn't necessarily prima facie change the overall RWA we have. I mean you have to be careful to ensure that by
having higher levels of capital that's not an incentive to want to stretch in the credit box, but we have very tight credit
discipline. I wouldn't see that being a material change in the outlook but, obviously, if there is a change in rules that
directly affect RWA that would do.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just switching gears to the Investment
Banking outlook that you had given. I appreciated the color which sounded quite constructive on the backlogs for
M&A and ECM. And I guess not just you but the industry in general hasn't given much commentary on the outlook for
debt capital markets activity. It has been challenged this year. I think that was something which many us had expected

just given the strength that we experienced over the last couple of years, but didn't know if you can just provide some
updated thoughts on that revenue stream in particular.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. I mean look, it is the case that a lot of refinancing has already happened so the debt
maturity wall is smaller, although rates are lower than we may have expected at this point and time. So therefore, yes,
it's reasonable to assume that there's going to be some continued headwinds. But having said that, I think there's going
to be windows of opportunity. So we're going to – M&A and ECM are more constructive and likely be more buoyant,
but I think debt capital markets still has windows of opportunity.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, great, that's it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.
