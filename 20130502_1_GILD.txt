We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the first quarter, which is available on our
website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am
joined by Chairman and CEO, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John Milligan; our Executive
Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice President of Commercial
Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.
Before begin with our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements,
including plans and expectations with respect to our product candidates, financial projections, all of which involve
certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ
materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and
recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements
made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Washington.
Robin L. Washington
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us. Earlier today we reported solid first quarter 2013 financial results.
Product sales were $2.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share.
In the U.S., underlying demand was healthy across all products. The launches of our two newest single tablet regimens,
Complera and Stribild, continue to go well with combined sales of almost $200 million. ADAP [AIDS Drug Assistance
Programs] purchasing in the first quarter was strong, consistent with expectations of the last quarter of an ADAP fiscal
year.
During our fourth quarter call, we highlighted that approximately $80 million to $100 million of our Q4 revenue was
related to strategic purchases ahead of demand. In the first quarter, wholesalers' and sub-wholesalers' inventory levels
were drawn down, reversing the inventory build taken in anticipation of January 1, 2013, price increases. We also saw
minimal VA orders during the first quarter. The inventory draw-down and purchasing activity from the VA resulted in
a sequential decline in U.S. net product revenue.
In Europe, we continued to execute strongly with year-on-year growth of 7%. Eviplera is now reimbursed in 20
countries outside the U.S. and performing particularly well in the key HIV market of France. We have just recently
launched Eviplera in Spain and Italy and early adoption signals are encouraging.
Turning to expenses, R&D expenses were up approximately $50 million sequentially as we continue to invest in our
pipeline, where we have experienced rapid progression of many Phase III studies in liver disease and oncology. While
SG&A expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter, we expect expenses to increase during the remainder of the year as we
prepare for the launch of sofosbuvir.
Finally, we are reiterating full year guidance for 2013, as we remain confident in our core business and ability to
continue to execute. I will now turn the call over to John Martin.
John C. Martin
Thank you, Robin. I will summarize a few top line items.
For HIV, data from the Phase II study evaluating TAF, Gilead's next-generation nucleotide reverse transcriptase
inhibitor, were presented at CROI. The data indicate that a TAF-containing regimen had comparable efficacy to a TDF,
or Viread-containing, regimen but showed less decrease in bone mineral density and less creatinine increases.

Based on these data, we have initiated two identically designed Phase III studies evaluating Stribild compared to a
single-tablet regimen where 300 milligrams of TDF is replaced by 10 milligrams of TAF. Both of these studies are
currently enrolling. At the same time, we are also evaluating TAF in a Phase II dose-ranging study for the potential
treatment of hepatitis B infection.
The development of our novel hepatitis C therapies continues at a rapid pace. In February, we announced top line
results from the fourth Phase III study of sofosbuvir. The NDA for sofosbuvir was submitted to the FDA on April 8,
followed shortly thereafter by submission to the European MAA on April 17. Further regulatory submissions are
planned. We thank our investigators and medical collaborators for supporting this timeline with rapid enrollment in the
Phase III studies.
All four Phase III sofosbuvir studies were presented last week at EASL and concurrently published online in New
England Journal of Medicine. These studies show that sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, when dosed for either 12 or 16 weeks,
resulted in high cure rates in genotype 2- and 3-infected treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients.
Additionally, sofosbuvir, used in combination with PEG interferon and ribavirin for 12 weeks, resulted in overall cure
rates of 90% in genotype 1-, 4-, 5- and 6-infected patients. In these pivotal studies, there was no evidence of resistance
development, and sofosbuvir was safe and well-tolerated.
Hepatitis C represents a sizable opportunity in Asia, particularly Japan. Our decision to establish a Gilead presence in
Japan has resulted in a hiring process for a General Manager and other staff. I am pleased to report that we now have
agreement with the Japanese regulatory agency, PMDA, to begin a sofosbuvir-plus-ribavirin Phase III study in
genotype 2-infected patients, which represents an unmet medical need of over 200,000 individuals. This single-arm
study will begin in this quarter and will evaluate a12-week treatment duration. Discussions about study designs for
genotype 1 patients are still ongoing with PMDA.
Norbert will now provide you an update on some of our other development programs, including the
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed-dose combination for hepatitis C virus. Norbert?
Norbert W. Bischofberger
Thank you, John. Before I elaborate on some of our development programs, I would like to provide a few comments on
the complete response letters on elvitegravir and cobi [cobicistat] that we received from FDA last week. These
complete response letters arose out of an FDA pre-approval inspection for cobi and elvitegravir of our Foster City site.
In Foster City, we perform analytical method development and validation, stability testing and management of the
contract manufacturers for all our products. This inspection focused on the work that supported the NDAs for
elvitegravir and cobi, and on general GMP. The 483 that was issued noted deficiencies in test methods, specification of
instruments used, laboratory records, control and test procedures, stability testing and laboratory controls. The 483
observations are specifically related to elvitegravir, cobi and Stribild, Complera, Atripla and Truvada. We will assess
the potential impact of any of these observations, and if we find a potential impact, we're confident that we can address
the issue successfully.
Multiple R&D programs are advancing across all our therapeutic areas. Ranolazine is being studied for type II diabetes
and as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention in four Phase III studies. Idelalisib is being evaluated in five
Phase III studies in CLL and indolent NHL. A number of presentations on Idelalisib have been accepted to the
upcoming ASCO meeting in Chicago later this month, including data on upfront therapy in CLL.
In addition, we have now completed the initial analysis of Study 101-09, which is a single arm study of Idelalisib in
125 indolent NHL patients, refractory to both CD-20 antibody and alkylator therapy, and this analysis includes a
central review of the CT scans to assess efficacy. The safety data, response rates and duration of response from this
study will be presented as a late breaker at the upcoming 11th Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano,
Switzerland, in June.

Simtuzumab, the first biologics product candidate, is being evaluated for its potential utility in liver fibrosis, pulmonary
fibrosis, myelofibrosis and two solid tumors.
We did have a disappointing result in our respiratory area. Cayston was evaluated in two separate Phase III studies as a
treatment for gram-negative infections in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. The primary endpoint was a patient
reported outcome measure. One study, unfortunately, missed its primary endpoint and the other study showed a
statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, effect. Consequently, we will discontinue further development of
Cayston for bronchiectasis.
As John indicated, sofosbuvir proceeded rapidly in development, resulting in regulatory submission in the U.S. and
European Union in April. At the same time, rapid progress was also made with the fixed dose combination of
sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, our NS5A inhibitor. We now have two Phase III studies ongoing in genotype one infected
patients, ION-1 and ION-2.
ION-1 evaluates the fixed dose combination with and without ribavirin for 12 and 24 weeks in 800 treatment-naïve
patients 20% of whom have cirrhosis. In this study, enrollment was initially limited to 200 of the 800 planned patients
in order to conduct an interim analysis.
In March, the Data and Safety Monitoring reviewed SVR4 data on the 100 patients from the 12-week treatment arms
and safety data from all 200 patients. Based on the observation that the SVR4 rate exceeded the predefined threshold of
60% and there was no safety issues of concern, the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended continuation of
enrollment. Screening for ION-1 finished last week, and enrollment of all 800 patients will be complete by the end of
this month.
In ION-2, treatment-experienced patients are randomized to one of four arms to receive the fixed dose combination
with and without ribavirin for 24 weeks and with ribavirin for 12 weeks. Two of the arms are identical. That is, 24
weeks of treatment without ribavirin. The protocol specified, however, that one of these 24-week arms could be
converted to a 12-week arm if supported by Phase II data from a cohort in the LONESTAR study.
That LONESTAR cohort included 40 genotype one HCV-infected patients who had previously failed a
protease-containing PEG/riba regimen, and importantly, 22 of these 40 patients have cirrhosis. 19 of the 40 patients
were treated with the fixed dose combination without ribavirin and 21 patients were treated with fixed dose
combination with ribavirin, both for 12 weeks.
As outlined in a press release issued this morning, 38 of the 40 treatment-experienced patients or 95% achieved an
SVR4. One cirrhotic patients in the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir arm relapsed, and one patient in the
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/ribavirin arm was lost to follow-up. This result allowed for modification of one of the 24 weeks
fixed-dose arms of ION-2, and ION-2 is now, like ION-1, a four-arm study of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed-dose
combination with and without ribavirin for 12 and 24 weeks, and ION-2 is now fully enrolled.
Finally, as we also announced in today's press release, the initiation of a Phase III study, ION-3. The rationale for this
study is based on data from another three cohorts in the LONESTAR study, which compared sofosbuvir and ledipasvir
fixed-dose combination dosed for 12 weeks with a fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin dose for only
eight weeks. In this study, 40 of 41 patients in the eight-week arms achieved an SVR8, with one patient relapsing in the
non-ribavirin-containing arm. ION-3 will be an open-label, randomized three-arm non-inferiority study comparing the
fixed-dose combination dosed for 12 weeks to the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin dosed for eight
weeks in genotype 1 infected treatment-naive non-cirrhotic patients.
If these LONESTAR data are confirmed in this larger study, this would significantly advance patient care by providing
high SVR rates with the use of a single-tablet regimen or the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed-dose combination with
ribavirin, with only eight weeks of therapy. The Phase III program evaluating sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is ongoing, and
we're on track to submit regulatory filings within one year of the sofosbuvir submissions.
In summary, we're making rapid progress in the development of simple, short and all-oral therapies, and we're excited
to bring these new treatments to the patients.

I will now open the call for Q&A. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the
LONESTAR data. I have one question, two parts. One for Kevin. Since Complera and Stribild are becoming more
meaningful, is there anything you can speak to in terms of the mix of purchases by ADAPs and other bulks?
And then the second part of the single question is LONESTAR for Norbert. Anything notable on the safety side or on
the one relapse in the eight-week arm? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Good afternoon, Geoff. It's Kevin here. As described by Robin and as we said up front in our
fourth quarter results, we did have significant purchase ahead of demand at year-end. That's reflected in our
performance in the first quarter. Now of course, these purchases, that's sub-wholesale level, sometimes smaller
wholesalers, ADAP, VA, tend to favor the very high-volume antiviral products, so primarily Truvada, followed by
Atripla and some Viread.
So you can see there was less effect and extremely good growth in our new single-tablet regimens, as you point out,
Complera and Stribild. But when people typically buy in, whether that be commercial buyers or whether that be federal
buyers, they typically go for the large-volume items that move very quickly. And hence, that's first and foremost
Truvada and secondly Atripla.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So, Geoff, with regards to the other question, there was nothing really remarkable
about safety. I think you know in the placebo-controlled study of sofosbuvir there was really, the safety was very
similar to placebo and adding 5885 to that doesn't change it in any way.
The other thing you asked, was there anything remarkable, the answer is no, we just had one relapser. But I have to tell
you, I again have to emphasize this is in my mind the first time that an oral regimen is tested in a severely difficult to
treat population. We had both previous PI failures and cirrhotic patients, 22 of them, and if you just look at that cohort,
12 weeks of treatment either with or without ribavirin, cured 20 of them. One was a relapser and one was lost to
follow-up. So it's 21 out of 22, or 20 out of 22, depending on how you count, it's pretty remarkable.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI group. Please proceed.
<Q - Wesley Nurss>: Hey, everyone. This is Wes sitting in for Mark. I had two commercial questions. The first one is
how many patients do you estimate both in the U.S., as well as developed Europe, that are diagnosed and under the
active care of an HCV-treating physician today?
And my second question is, when you initially launched sofosbuvir, you'll have indications in the G1 population for
7977+ PEG/riba. What's your view on the uptake, and do you expect patients to wait for the all-orals? Or do you
suspect that the uptake for this regimen will be fast? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Wes, it's Kevin here. Thanks for the questions. We're still honing the number of patients
currently under care from active HCV treaters, and I think that's something that as we get towards launch that we can
talk a little bit more about. It's obviously a very, very key figure. I think we're going to be able to get there with some
more data that we are collecting. There isn't a really high-quality database in HCV like we've had for a number of years

with Synovate or Ipsos, as it's called in HIV, and we're working quite hard to try and develop that. So we want to make
sure the quality of the data is good before we really firm up that number.
In terms of launching, the nice thing is that we are going to be able to launch sofosbuvir with either riba or PEG/riba in
three genotypes. I think there may be some opinion leaders who are really on the cusp and particularly involved in the
clinical studies who might wait for the all oral, but our sense is that 12 weeks with interferon is a great step change to
what they have today. And I think we expect that physicians will get on and treat their patients, particularly when the
need is high, when they have more advanced disease. So we certainly think that 12 weeks with PEG/riba is very
attractive, and we're going be fully promoting that as well. So it's not as though Gilead is going to be holding back at
all.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Mark, I would like to add something. We talked obviously to a lot of KOLs, people
that treat a lot of hepatitis C patients, and they told us when you ask the patients, they will tell you that 12 weeks is very
acceptable to them, whereas if you tell them it's 24 or possibly depending on response to therapy, even 48 weeks, it
that's a lot less emotion than the acceptance.
<Q - Wesley Nurss>: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Matt Roden with UBS Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on LONESTAR. So first, just a
question on duration of therapy. In addition to these eight-week duration data from LONESTAR, you also have a
six-week arm of ELECTRON, but you're talking about moving into Phase III with this eight-week duration. Have you
seen the data from ELECTRON? Is that considered as part of the plan?
And then related, for John, should we expect to see any compassionate use programs for sofosbuvir in Europe? If so,
what would be a reasonable timeframe?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes, so, Matt, I'll answer the first question. Those data are still emerging, but the
reason why we feel comfortable that eight weeks is probably the lower limit for, in particular, this combination,
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, comes number one from modeling studies that we ourselves have done in the QUANTUM study.
You may remember that was a study that was interrupted kind of in the middle, and some people had reached six
weeks, others had reached nine weeks. And clearly if you modeled that on the viral dynamics, it's easily measurable
that eight weeks is the limit.
And the other thing, this was independently confirmed; there was a paper end of last year by [ph] Paulsen (23:59), very
interesting. He came to the same conclusion that eight weeks is probably the limit. You may have also seen there was
another presentation by Abbott at CROI. They modeled their own regimen. They came to the conclusion that 12 weeks
is probably the limit.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Matt, it's John Milligan. You asked about compassionate use, I think particularly for Europe.
So now that the FDA filing is in and that the MAA filing is in, we are going to open up some compassionate use. For
example, we will be opening up an ATU program in France, and this will be restricted to patients with very high unmet
medical need, those that are in pre- or post-transplantation situations. And there's limited compassionate access for
people who have that similar need in other countries as well. So it will be limited, but it will be available for patients
who really severely need the drug.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Thanks. And congrats on all the progress.

Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the eight-week theme as well. I mean, I think most
physicians would argue that ribavirin, if it needs to be in there, is not an attractive drug to throw on top of this, and that
a 12-week regimen would be preferred rather than shortening therapy with riba. Do you have any plans to throw in a
third DAA and, I guess, what would that be? Are we looking at 5816 or a 9669?
And then just a quick financial, could you quantify the VA lack of purchasing and how we should think about that, and
is that coming in 2Q, for example? Thank you.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, so, Rachel, I'll answer the first question. That's exactly what we're doing. So
we have one cohort ongoing in ELECTRON, looking at sofosbuvir and the difference between ribavirin six weeks, and
we plan on doing additional cohorts in LONESTAR to look at that. So it's essentially six weeks of replacing ribavirin in
this triple combination that's...
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: What are you replacing ribavirin with?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: With 9669.
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: I see.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes, 9669. 5885 is – 5816 is a little bit behind. That's going into Phase II in the
second half of this year.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Rachel, Kevin Young. On your question about the VA, just to take one step back, VA
purchased through our major wholesalers. Obviously the major wholesalers, we have inventory management
agreements and in both the fourth quarter and first quarter, we stayed within those inventory management agreements,
but of course we don't control anything below the major wholesalers, hence the variability in the VA purchase.
In terms of the fourth quarter, it was very sizable, well on the way to being almost a double quarter. I don't know
whether they were buying because they were worried about 2013 and all of the budget worries, but certainly it was a
very sizable purchase. There has been some purchase, but absolutely it's a minimal level in the first quarter. And I think
we'd expect to go back second, third quarter, although we don't know, but I think we expect to go back to normality
now fourth and first quarter would kind of almost even out. Typically, we get every quarter central purchase, and then
we also get regional purchase from the mail-order centers, divisions from VA. So I think a general sense is that
normality would come back as we move through the year.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from line of Yaron Werber with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Honestly, congrats on the fantastic LONESTAR data.
So, Norbert, I have a question for you, and I'm going to sneak in if you don't mind another kind of broader-picture
question. But just to understand ION-3, what's the non-inferiority margin that you're looking for in the powering
between the eight-week and the 12-week? And then I have a kind of a broader Hep C question, Hep C commercial
question.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So, Yaron, just to be clear, it's actually a three-step comparison, this is a statistical,
a gated analysis. The first comparison is you compare the 12-week arm to a historical control of 60% and the
assumption is we're going to be superior. If that's the case you do the second comparison, 12 week, versus the 2

eight-weeks. The margin is 8% and the third comparison is the two eight-week arms. And I don't remember what the
margin there is. So it's called a gated step-wise statistical analysis approach, and again, the assumption is we're going to
beat the 60% historical control.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Okay. And then kind of a bigger question is, if you look there's about 85,000 patients who
were treated in 2012, by our estimates, with Incivek and Victrelis globally in genotype-1 alone. So one would imagine,
based on all the doc checks that you guys are going to replace that pretty quickly and then grow into genotype 2-3
which is another about 30% expansion to the market. So do you think there's enough capacity, and can you really get
sort of over 100,000 patients that quickly?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Yaron, it's Kevin. So let me go back a little bit historically. So in the heyday of PegIntron
and PEGASYS, there was something close to about 150,000 patients treated per year in the U.S. That's our Gilead
estimation. Pre the introduction of the new proteases, that dropped down into about the 60,000 level, as you say, it's
kicked back up. We think in totality it is about 100,000, when you think about all genotypes and all treatment
approaches in 2012. And we think it can head back to that circa 150,000 level once we've had the new agents, not just
Gilead's, but all the new agents, on to the market. We certainly think because historically you're up at the 150 that there
is the capacity there. We're going to be taking 7977, not only to current HCV prescribers, but we are going to be trying
to broaden that into the more general gastro, and of course into some of the positions in the infectious disease setting.
So I think it's reasonable to presume that we can certainly go back to the levels of treating patients that were there at the
top of the pegylated interferon treatment days.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey. Thanks. A question on some of the details around the 483, maybe you could just give us
some comfort about why you're so confident there'll be no issue there, and more importantly, whether or not you can
still get approval for drugs such as sofosbuvir even with that outstanding? Are they manufactured at the same sites, et
cetera? Just a little more comfort there.
And then on the ION-3, you said you had these non-inferiority margins. Presumably if they're replicative of
LONESTAR which was about 5% margin, I mean do you file all of that and they approve both eight and 12 week
regimens? And how would that impact your thinking about utilization?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes. So, Michael, our comfort around the 483 really comes from the fact that we
look at the details of the 483s. These are all things we can take care of. It's going to be some work and some effort, of
course, but people have been working actually 24/7 since the FDA inspection started. So I have great comfort that we
will overcome this little setback and be on our way.
Regarding the eight versus 12, so what exactly the package that we're going to file to FDA is going to look like depends
really on how fast we can enroll this study. At this point I can tell you what the rate limiting study is, it could be ION-1,
because remember, that has a 24 week treatment arm in it, or it could be ION-3, depending on how fast it enrolls. So if
the, but our overall goal would be to file ION-1, ION-2 and ION-3 at the same time in the NDA. I think it would be
great advantage of having eight week data in the label so we can promote them and price them accordingly.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay. Can you just confirm that you can get drugs approved, even with the 483 outstanding, or
are you just...?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes. I can confirm that.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Perfect. Thanks.

Your next question comes from line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question, and also congratulations. So look, I'll
venture into dangerous territory here and ask how you're thinking about the economic value of sofosbuvir. You now
have a lot of evidence that your adverse event profile is much lower than the existing therapy. Your treatment duration
is shorter and your efficacy is higher. How much should we be thinking about pricing being referential to the existing
products, and how much should we be thinking about it being based on the overall value that encompasses the savings
in cost from reduced management of AEs and the savings in cost in terms of the cost of cures? Where on that spectrum
should we be thinking about it?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Geoff, it's Kevin. As you can imagine, I can't get too specific on your direction of the
question.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Are you sure about that?
<A - Kevin Young>: We've got a lot of considerations, I think actually a lot of good considerations, to go through in
our pricing discussions here, being ready for launch. Obviously, there is the spread from where telaprevir is today just
on its own at $60,000, and then obviously up to circa $90,000 when you add in PEG/riba solely for the genotype 1. So
we've got to consider that. We're going to consider Europe versus the U.S. And then with our latest news, and of course
it's just Phase II data, we want it reproduced in Phase III, we've got the additional very exciting possibility of an
eight-week treatment course. So we're going to take all of those into consideration. I can't really be any more specific
than that, but pretty exciting alternatives that we've got there.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thank you. We'll try and parse those comments carefully.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian Corey Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and my congrats on the LONESTAR data as well.
Obviously LONESTAR was done at a single center. I was just wondering how well you think the patients here
represent the broader population? Any differences to what you might see from the multi-center U.S. study?
And then just real quickly, do you think 7977 will be discussed at an FDA Panel? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes. So, Brian, I think that the LONESTAR population is very representative of the
U.S. Actually if we look at things like BMI, race, CC, each genotype, it's actually a little bit tougher. I think we'll get
somewhat of an easier population, actually, in a larger Phase III study. Also again, I have to say that the population that
was in the cirrhotics, that's just a really difficult to treat, previous BI failures. Mostly probably, I don't know the
genotype, but I'm sure it's mostly TTs or CTs. And in cirrhosis, it can't get any more difficult than that. And the other –
what was the other question?
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: FDA Panel for 7977.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So we might have an FDA Panel. It's not, of course, we haven't been informed
about anything. You might have seen – it's public information, there's one scheduled, an antiviral advisory committee
meeting end of October in the Federal Register. And typically, I wouldn't be surprised if we have one, because it's a
first in class compound. But again, we don't know at this point whether we will or not.
<Q - Brian Corey Abrahams>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and again congrats on all the positive Hep C
news. I guess I wanted ask about HIV, so a couple of things. Like just, how do we think about modeling HIV, given
that Stribild and Complera are doing so well? And specifically, you have some slides that talk about the switching from
your current products. How much of the Truvada decline this quarter was due to switching? How do we think about the
steady run rate? And then, how do we think about Stribild and Complera? How much uptake are those drugs having
amongst ADAP and the VA, given those areas are more price-sensitive? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Well, good question, Robin. I'll try and break it down a little bit. We are pleased with the
progress of Complera and Stribild. Nearly $200 million in the quarter was really great progress.
One thing that wasn't in the script, Complera is now the number two regimen of all regimens. So number one is Atripla,
number two is now Complera, which is pretty impressive. Actually, Eviplera is the number three regimen in new
patients in our early launch markets of the U.K., France and Germany. So we're very pleased with how these new STRs
are coming through. And as you say, they have an effect on the mix of our HIV products specifically Truvada and
Atripla.
We are seeing, as you can see from the pie charts, some switch from Atripla, particularly with Complera because that's
an NNRTI to NNRTI switch. The nice thing about Stribild is I think really for the first time, we're starting to see
conversion of the protease inhibitor market, and I would say probably that's the older protease inhibitors but I think
you're now starting to see a trend away from the protease inhibitor products.
I should add that we don't have a switch label. We promote Complera and Stribild for new patients but you can see that
about two thirds of patients are coming from switch. So I think there will be a gradual takedown of Atripla but probably
a little bit more of a steeper conversion of the Truvada patients, because Truvada is used a lot with the protease
inhibitor and the integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, patients. So you can see that conversion going on as well.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. And the ADAPs and the VAs as far as their interest in these more expensive drugs?
<A - Kevin Young>: Yeah, I mean we've got complete coverage of both Complera and Stribild. Stribild was very
quick after launch in ADAP when we've now got freedom to use in the VA. I actually was recently out on a field visit
in a VA center. What's nice about Stribild in the VA is the protease inhibitors are often being used quite extensively
because of the psychosocial complications of the veteran patients. So we'd like to think that Stribild would do quite
well in that setting.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Marshall Urist>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first, just for Norbert, just would love to get your
thoughts, a few more thoughts on the LONESTAR cirrhotic subset that you mentioned. You know, get your thoughts
on whether or not the data suggest that you're going need riba in that patient population and kind of what – how the
cirrhotics fell out, I guess, the 20 something 22 cirrhotic you said fell out between the two arms?
And then just related to that on oncology, when could we hear about whether or not your thoughts on the kind of
regulatory quality of the data and whether or not this might offer an accelerated approval path? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So, Marshall, it's really what – I have to say we're very excited about the data. On
the other hand, I also have to say it's small numbers. And you know, that's the reason why we're repeating the 8 versus
12 study the study in a bigger, larger 600 patient study, and clearly, we would have to do a larger study in cirrhotic
patients to really answer the question do we need ribavirin or not. As I said, we had one single relapse or, no
breakthrough, one relapser and that was on the non-ribavirin-containing arm. But you can't really make any conclusion

And secondly, so the data that we're seeing on Idelalisib is encouraging, but as you might expect, it's still emerging,
particularly the duration of response data is a Kaplan-Meier approach, and of course the longer you follow patients, the
more clear it becomes what the duration of response is. But we will initiate a process, if the data continues to look
good, to talk to regulatory authorities about the acceptability of the file. We will do that, again, if the data holds up.

Your next question comes from line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us an
update on the dispute with Roche over sofosbuvir and in particular in the commercialization agreement or the
development agreement that was signed between Pharmasset and Roche, it provided for arbitration as the means for
settling the dispute. Could you give us some sense when arbitration could start in this matter? Thank you.
<A - John F. Milligan>: Hi, Phil, it's John Milligan. Yeah, so you're right, there was an arbitration clause in that
agreement, which is why this dispute is being held under arbitration. It's a little bit difficult to predict when it's going to
start, because the arbitrators themselves will have to set the final schedule for arbitration depending on their personal
schedules and various other things. We do think it's unlikely that a decision in this arbitration would be reached in
2013. But beyond that, I can't give you any further guidance on the process.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: John, have you gone to arbitration? I don't know that that's ever been officially confirmed.
Have the two parties now agreed to identify some arbitrators?
<A - John F. Milligan>: Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Jim Birchenough>: Yeah, hi, guys. So two questions. One, just on the HCV market dynamics, can you talk about
whether you've got any initiatives currently to try and broaden the treatable population, either in terms of identifying
patients who are not diagnosed, or providing access to patients who are indigent or do not have good access to care?
Second question, just on the oncology side of it, any comments on the combination of PI3 kinase inhibitor with a SYK
inhibitor? Some enthusiasm in the clinical community, and just wondering when we might see some data from that
program and whether you may be excited about that more than the single-agent PI3 kinase inhibitor. Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hi, Jim, it's Kevin here. No, we're not doing anything active, if you like, in the external market at
the moment. We're concentrating on all our planning around building our field force and then activities, educational
activities, in and around the launch. So that's really where our focus is.
There may be options for us immediately pre-launch, but I think we're a great believer at Gilead that if you have very
high quality data and you have a good package insert, then you're in good shape to educate at the time of launch, in
other words when you get your approval. So all our work right now is internal to the company.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: And, Jim, regarding the SYK PI3K combinations, you're right, there is a lot of
excitement in the scientific and medical community. It comes from an in vitro study where it was really spectacular. If
you add one and the other and two together, that the two together are highly synergistic.

So what we're doing right now in a Phase II study, we're establishing the activity of the SYK inhibitor in various B-cell
malignancies. And once we have seen that the SYK inhibitor itself works, and remember this has been shown by other
companies, that SYK inhibition does work against B-cells, then we will test a combination of Idelalisib with a SYK
inhibitor. And the timeframe is sometime, I don't think we're going to learn much this year, but sometime next year.

Your next question comes from line of Jason Kolbert with Maxim Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason H. Kolbert>: Hi, guys. Thank you so much, and congratulations on the data. Can you expand a little bit on
what the plan is exactly for Japan now that Gilead is making the decision to do it themselves? And help me understand
how you go through the clinical trial processes at MOHW [Ministry of Health and Welfare]. Do you use a
harmonization approach utilizing US and EU data? Thank you.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah, hi, Jason. So as you know or may know, about 25% roughly of the hepatitis
C-infected patients in Japan are genotype 2, and we have now agreement based on the very high response rates we have
seen in genotype 2 in our three studies, cirrhotics and non-cirrhotics, to do a simple single-arm study in Japan of 12
weeks duration, sofosbuvir and ribavirin. We have done the PK bridging study already, and so we have agreement and
that study should initiate in this quarter, so it's a very simple approach. We're still talking to the regulatory authorities
about approaches in genotype 1, but this is what we're going to do in genotype 2.
I would like to point out one other thing, that we really don't have any competition in genotype 2. There is no other
interferon-free regimen either available or in advanced clinical development for Japan.
<A - Kevin Young>: And just to update you, Jason, in terms of building out our operating affiliate, the good thing here
is that it will be a very targeted operation. We don't intend taking our HIV products back. We have a very good
partnership right now with Japan Tobacco, and we're going to continue that long into in the future, so this is going be a
very specific build-out, first and foremost for hepatitis C launch and then of course, we'll have a wonderful opportunity
to add our oncology products onto that, because they, all of those will be available to launch as Gilead, in the Japanese
market.

Your next question comes from line of Ravi Mehrotra from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. And, this one's for you Kevin, and goes back to the
comments that you were making about the 150,000 patients you've historically seen max out the HCV market, which I
guess was 1999 to 2003. Was that because of the treatment infrastructure and the requirements of an interferon-based
regime or was that 150,000 because there was just demand for 150,000 and there was capacity for more, if needed?
<A - Kevin Young>: It's a good question, Ravi. I think it's a bit of both. But certainly, it was, I think, the treater
capacity there, in other words, the physician willingness, the physician number and the ability, in terms of time in their
practice to do it. If you look at the slope that eventually gets to the nadir, which is 2010 before the two new protease
came out, it's fairly steep. I think that demonstrates the challenges around delivering 24 to 48 weeks of interferon. I do
think the practices got kind of used to it, but as we know, many patients couldn't either start or indeed just couldn't do
it, even very motivated patients. So, I think, I do believe the capacity is there. I think the current standard at the time
just became too much of a burden.

Your next question comes from line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First, I was wondering, there were some discussion at
EASL about mixing and matching the various DAAs starting in 2014 in the G1 population, was just wondering how
you guys think about that, and as we think about 2014 numbers for sofo?
And then the second question, just any update on the second Phase II trial of TAF with PREZISTA, when we might see
data there? Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Terrance, it's Kevin. I think it is beyond us to predict what physicians will do when there
are a number of alternatives. Obviously, we'll be promoting according to our label with pegylated interferon and
ribavirin in one and then in twos and threes, just with ribavirin.
The one sort of experience comment I would give you is that I do think it tends to be the opinion leaders who might
experiment, obviously, again, as I said earlier, they are on the cutting edge, and they've often worked with several of
the compounds in development. So I think if there is any mix or matching of agents, I think it will be primarily in the
tertiary referral centers, less in the general gastro office.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: And Terrance regarding the second Phase II study, that's six months behind the first
study, and the reason is, as you may know, if you use integrase inhibitors, the time to undetectability is extremely fast,
whereas if use protease inhibitor it takes much longer. You can't use a 24 week end-point, because people would not
have reached undetectability yet. You really have to go out to 48 weeks. Why that is, I don't know, but that's the
observation.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. I just have a specific question about a study that was referenced in some of
the EASL presentation, I think it's called the VALENCE study for genotype-3 24 weeks of sofosbuvir-ribavirin or 12
weeks of sofosbuvir-ribavirin and peginterferon. Can you confirm that this study is ongoing and when we will get data?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes. So we have a cohort, I'm not sure what the name of it is. What did you say the
name is?
<Q - Howard Liang>: VALENCE.
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: VALENCE.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: VALENCE, absolutely. No. So I'm sorry. Now VALENCE is actually a different
study. VALENCE is a study in genotype two, three that uses sofosbuvir/ribavirin either for 12 weeks in genotype two
or 24 weeks in genotype three. But we have another study ongoing with Eric Lawitz. I think it's called LONESTAR 2 if
I'm not mistaken, and that study will actually look at peg/riba/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in genotype two and three. And I
have to look up what the – so the VALENCE data should become available sometime later this year and the
LONESTAR 2 data I have to honestly look up, I don't know what the exact timelines are.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Josh E. Schimmer>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you're taking the question. If there's an FDA panel on
sofosbuvir, what are your expectations for the topics that would likely be discussed there? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Well, so, Josh, obviously we have asked this ourselves and after thinking about it,
we always come to the conclusion there is no need for a panel. But since you asked me the question, I think the real
only open question that one can debate is what's the optimal treatment duration in genotype three? Is it – it's not 12
weeks. It's probably more. Is it 16 weeks? And is it even more than that? Unfortunately, the data that we'll have to
support anything other than 12 or 16 will be limited to none. So that's the only thing I can really think of. And maybe
there would be some other discussions about specific labeling, what recommendation you make in the label for
somebody who is genotype 3 and cirrhotic, things like that.
<A - Kevin Young>: Yeah, I'd also as a non-scientist I might add to Norbert that there could be well be some
discussion as well around specific populations like the co-infected like the liver transplant patients as well. I imagine
that would be of great interest to an advisory panel.

Mr. O'Brien, we have time for one more question. It comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies and Company.
Please proceed.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a question on capacity and a question on price. On
capacity with the 150,000 I guess we're all on the line thinking why couldn't it be way over 150,000? Why could it not
be multiple-folds when the treatment duration is going from what was 48 weeks at the time with a difficult to manage
regimen to eight weeks, a simple oral send your patient away type regimen?
And then on pricing, I wanted to find out when you've looked at the average all-in cost of treatment with the current PI
regimens and include things like number of physician visits and EPO use and management of the rash and et cetera, et
cetera, what does the $90,000 cost go to?
<A - Kevin Young>: Well, I'm going to probably disappoint you, Thomas, I'm afraid, on both counts. I mean you
asked the question why and I think it's a question we ask ourselves as well, and it's very, very difficult to pin that down.
I think a good rule of thumb to start is that 150,000 patients. Just where it might go north of that I think is quite difficult
to estimate.
In terms of do you go beyond into levels of pricing beyond $90,000, again, we'll have to we're going to think very
carefully about this.
I think there was some interesting work in EASL, one from the [ph] Ganassi Group (57:55), and then you had some
work from Dr. Dieterich in New York, who even went as far as up to I think $195,000 all-in when you think about all
the supportive care that's currently used. I think that's an incredible extreme and I wouldn't at all guide you to that level.
We just want to find a place that warrants the breakthrough nature of 7977 whilst balances the views of the payer.
We've got to take those into account that we treat as many patients as possible. And it's finding that happy medium.
<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Thanks. That's very helpful.

situation. So I think it's going to take a while for them to become common practice, as we've seen with testing for HIV.
I do think one thing that will be helpful when we launch and a number of other companies are bringing new products to
market, is I think the general news about the opportunity to cure HCV will get out there and I think that's going to raise
the awareness, and I think that's probably going to have a mobilizing effect on certain patient categories, to be asking
around having their HCV treated. So I think there's some opportunities, but generally we find that it's a gradual effect to
transfer a Federal guidance into real-life office mechanics.
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: And Norbert, the second part on pan-genotypic.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Well, the 5816, yes. So you may know we have presented two posters at EASL,
one on human PK, and one on the virologies. It's a very nice compound. It's currently in Phase IIb, single-dose,
single-agent viral dynamics study, in various genotypes. And we're going to initiate a larger Phase II study in the fall or
the second half, focusing of course on genotype 3, because that right now seems to be the only sub-optimally addressed
genotype really within our efforts.
<Q - Alan Carr>: Okay. Thanks very much.

And at this time we do have one final question in queue, and it comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel,
Nicholas. Please proceed.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks. I wanted to follow up on what you just said, Norbert. I mean, do you have any plans in
place to do another genotype 3 study to test different combinations, just to get the SVR rate up to where it is with the
other genotypes?
And then just quickly on the SG&A spend for the year, you said it's going to go up. Will that go up gradually during
the year, or should we back-end load it? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes, so just to be clear, we're doing a number of things in genotype 3. So I
mentioned already we're going to extend treatment durations with sofosbuvir/riba up to 24 weeks. We're also doing a
PEG/riba/sofosbuvir for a 12-week regimen, and all in various cohorts. And we're also testing right now in
ELECTRON in a total of 50 patients, the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed-dose combination. Again, based on purely
virological considerations, I would expect that that should be sub-optimal, but you know you shouldn't be too smart in
this business. You never know. But if that fails, then we would of course do 5816, a sofosbuvir fixed-dose combination,
in genotype 3. I'm sure that would take care of it, and we will get response rates that are comparably high to what we're
getting right now in genotype 1 with sofosbuvir-ledipasvir. And, Robin?
<A - Robin L. Washington>: So, Joel, to your second question on SG&A, the biggest component of increase we
anticipate is going to be related to the launch preparation, and that would probably be more back-end loaded. There are
other components: the geographic expansion in Asia, just general infrastructure, just given our growth as well as legal,
and some bad debt that would be pretty consistent across the remaining three quarters.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Okay. Thank you.
