Robert L. Williams II, Director, Investor Relations
Thank you. With me today are Michael Dell, Brian Gladden, and Steve Schuckenbrock, head of our Large Enterprise
business. Brian and Steve will review our second quarter results. Then Michael will follow with some brief comments.
We posted our web deck on dell.com, and we released a VLog on DellShares. I encourage you to review these
materials for additional perspective.
Some of our upcoming investor relations activities include the Citi Technology Conference on September 8 and the
Deutsche Bank conference on September 15.
Next, I'd like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are
forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ materially
from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are
discussed in our annual and quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on
our website. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements.
Please note that on today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross
margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, and earnings per share. Historical non-GAAP financial
measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the slide presentation posted on the
Investor Relations portion of our website at dell.com and our 8-K filed today, which we encourage you to review.
Please note that unless otherwise mentioned, all growth percentages refer to year-over-year progress.
Now I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Thanks, Rob. We had another solid quarter when you look at our revenue growth, operating income growth, and our
strong cash flow generation. The key to our results continues to be strong global commercial demand, especially in
servers and networking, storage, and services. These revenues were up 43% to $4.3 billion, with strength across the
board, and also aided by the integration of Perot.
We had another strong quarter in emerging countries as well, with 52% growth in our BRIC countries. While we had
solid performance at the operating income line, we continue to see challenging dynamics in our supply chain costs,
which pressured our gross margins and consumer profitability. We continue to have confidence that we'll improve
gross margins in the second half as we see a better cost component environment and we execute operational
improvements in our consumer business.
Given our enterprise focus, today we've asked Steve Schuckenbrock to share his view on the progress in our Large
Enterprise business as well as the overall trends in Enterprise Solutions.
But first, let's look at the second quarter P&L and key performance metrics, which are provided on pages five and six
of the web deck. Revenue in the second quarter was $15.5 billion, up 22% year over year and 4% sequentially. This is
slightly above our typical historical seasonality, as we saw better demand in all the commercial businesses than the
typical second quarter. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $745 million or 4.8% to revenue. And EPS was $0.28,
which is up 17% year over year. On the rest of this call, I'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating income grew 9% to $872 million or 5.6% of revenue. Consistent with our views from the first quarter call
and the analyst meeting, we saw improved client product demand from commercial customers and sequential
commodity component inflation. These dynamics resulted in a sequential gross margin decline of about 40 basis points.
Given this margin pressure, we managed OpEx to 11.6% of revenue while still making key investments in Enterprise
Solutions, R&D, and sales related resources. Our financing and other expenses were $49 million, which is down
modestly versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect F&O to trend in the $50 million plus range.

Our tax rate was 23.6%, and reflects some discrete items along with increased profits in lower tax jurisdictions. For the
year, we expect our tax rate to be in 25 to 26% range, which is slightly lower than our previous outlook.
Net income was up 9% to 629 million, while EPS increased 10% year over year to $0.32 per share.
We generated $1.3 billion in cash flow from operations. In addition, we delivered $1.4 billion in free cash flow in the
quarter and $4.4 billion of free cash flow for the last four quarters.
Our working capital performance continues to be solid. Days receivable were up three days along with a one day
increase in inventory, offset by a four day improvement in days payable, with our overall cash conversion cycle flat at
negative 36 days. We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain in the negative mid-30s throughout the year.
We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion in cash and investments. During the quarter, we again repurchased shares
worth $200 million and expect to maintain a modest buyback program for the rest of the year. As part of our ongoing
efforts to optimize our capital structure and manage our U.S. liquidity, we're also monitoring the credit markets for
potentially favorable entry points.
Turning to our global business unit performance, our combined commercial businesses grew revenue 28% to $12.7
billion, with OpInc up 22%. Strong demand trends continue within commercial. Steve will talk more to the Large
Enterprise business along with our overall enterprise results in a moment.
Our public business revenue was up 21% to $4.6 billion, benefiting from the Perot integration year over year. We saw
strength in the healthcare space with initiatives like our medical archiving solution, while state and local government
revenue was relatively flat. Operating income was down 4% to $369 million but remains a healthy 8% of revenue.
Server and networking revenue was up 12% in the quarter.
Our small and medium business had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 25% to $3.5 billion, and operating income
grew 32% to $323 million or 9.1% of revenue. Our server, storage, and client businesses all delivered double-digit
growth in the quarter as a result of improving demand and solid execution across the business.
Our consumer business revenue was flat at $2.9 billion and generated a $21 million operating income loss. As we
discussed at our recent Analyst Day meetings, we're confident we can improve our consumer business operating
margins to the 2% level in the near term. We have been repositioning the business, which involves targeting our efforts
to the right geographies, products, and customer sub-segments. We have a solid product portfolio lining up for the
holidays, and we're making progress in simplifying our product portfolio, on increasing our ocean shipments, and in
growing our fast-track capabilities. And we do have line of sight to additional G&A savings that will help the business.
Regionally, we saw revenue growth across all regions. APJ delivered 38% growth, while the Americas and EMEA
were up 17% and 24% respectively.
I wanted to briefly cover some other key product highlights before I turn it over to Steve to talk about enterprise. The
corporate refresh cycle is continuing, and we've seen commercial client revenue growth of 14% and 25% over the past
two quarters. In our second quarter, total revenue in mobility and desktops grew 21% and 17% respectively. Mobility
units were up 21%, while desktop units were up 12%.
We saw particular strength in Large Enterprise and small and medium business here. Software and peripherals remains
an important business for us, growing revenues at 6%, driven by strong performance from displays and electronics and
peripherals. Servers and networking, storage, and services accounted for 34% of commercial revenue in the second
quarter, up from 30% a year ago.
Now let me turn it over to Steve Schuckenbrock to discuss some of the successes we're seeing in Enterprise Solutions
and the Large Enterprise segment.

Thanks, Brian. At our June analyst meeting, we mentioned a number of initiatives to drive growth in our Enterprise
Solutions business, including investments in sales and solutions resources. We're investing in training and the
acquisition of key assets to fill gaps and address customer needs. I'll talk more about all of these in just a moment.
However, I'd like to start with Large Enterprise. We had a good quarter as we saw broad based demand across verticals
and double-digit growth in all geographies. Large Enterprise grew revenue 38% to $4.5 billion, which represents the
fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and brings us closer to the pre-recession demand levels in fiscal 2009.
Operating income dollars were up 68% to $288 million or 6.3% of revenue. Operating income was driven by increased
scale and strong Enterprise Solutions growth. While we encountered some pressure from the commodity cost and an
increase in client revenues, overall the performance was good.
From a business line perspective, we saw a number of positive trends. Server growth led all categories except services
with a revenue increase of 54%, driven by customers taking advantage of positive ROI projects along with another
strong quarter in our data center solutions business. Storage was up 14%, and we had significantly improved
profitability as customers continue to adopt our EqualLogic solutions.
As Brian mentioned, we are seeing continued evidence of a corporate refresh cycle as notebooks and desktop revenue
were up 51 and 35% respectively. With a significantly aged installed base and a relatively low Windows 7 migration,
we expect these general trends to continue well into the next few quarters.
Now let me turn to a few highlights on Dell's overall Enterprise Solutions. Let me state that Dell has not been this
integrated and aligned around how to drive solutions ever in its history. It is exciting to see this comprehensive
approach and the thousands of employees in the company that support and execute on solutions every day. And it is
also important that our customers recognize us as one team, and that's happening.
We had another strong Enterprise Solutions quarter. Our combined commercial server, networking, storage, and
services revenue grew 43% to $4.3 billion. In services, we continue to make solid progress with respect to the
integration. Commercial Dell services grew 68% to $1.8 billion, driven by the integration of Perot. We are on track
with our cost synergies and sales targets, and industry demand conditions are improving as customers gain greater
visibility into their businesses.
The outsourcing pipeline is expanding, which should position us well for the second half of the year. In addition, we
benefited from a stronger discretionary environment during the first half, as project revenue grew double digits during
the quarter.
In servers, revenue grew 35%, fueled by the strength in blades with a growth of 35%, as well as our data center
solutions business. Dell now powers 21 of the top 25 most heavily trafficked websites in the world. As a whole, our
storage revenue was up 13% to 624 million.
More importantly, our storage product mix continues to drive improved operating margins. EqualLogic and
PowerVault led revenue growth, up 63% and 14% respectively. We continue to see adoption of EqualLogic across a
wide array of customers, small, medium, and large. And EqualLogic scales very well to all of those needs.
Let me turn to acquisitions and alliances. During the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Scalent and Ocarina.
Scalent is a company that provides technology used in the Dell Advanced Infrastructure Manager, a key building block
for Dell's virtual integrated solutions. Ocarina is a leader in online storage optimization solutions, including
compression and deduplication, and brings significant value as network utilization and storage utilization are
dramatically increased. With the addition of key IP and technology from companies like Ocarina and Exanet, we will
continue to enhance our product offerings as we seek to provide customers greater choice and value in storage and data
management solutions.
In addition, we continue to be pleased with the progress of our KACE integration, and have seen strong growth in its
early stages. We are really excited about this growing set of assets and capabilities, and will continue to make targeted
additions in areas such as storage, software, and services.

We are also very pleased about our plans to acquire 3PAR, which we announced earlier this week. This acquisition
brings together 3PAR's architecturally advantaged technology for the cloud with Dell's ability to deploy, scale, and
grow it. And 3PAR fits perfectly with Dell's commitment to open, capable, and affordable solutions that deliver value
and lower total cost of ownership. You might say that 3PAR represents in the Fibre Channel space what EqualLogic is
in the iSCSI space.
Now let me turn this back over to Brian.
Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Thanks, Steve. Let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, we're pleased with our year-to-date
revenue and operating income results along with the very strong cash flow generation. Our priorities remain to increase
operating income through the back half of the year through aggressive Enterprise Solutions growth as we continue to
make targeted investments and prudently manage our costs. As we've said for the past three quarters, we're seeing a
broad corporate client refresh, and we believe this solid demand will extend through the next several quarters. We're
well positioned to benefit from this growth as our commercial businesses make up 81% of our revenue.
For our third quarter, we expect the typical seasonal improvements from our federal, government, and commercial
businesses. Overall, we expect to see a pickup in the low single digits in the third quarter.
Component pricing is improving, and we expect to see a return to modest cost reductions in the third and fourth
quarters.
Currency volatility is also a concern, though our hedge programs do provide stability for us.
As you see in our second quarter results, we continue to manage OpEx in a disciplined way, with lower spending in
G&A and in our client business. We also are seeing some of the impacts from the consolidation of our consumer and
SMB businesses. Despite the impressive OpEx performance for the quarter, we do expect OpEx to trend upward and
expect gross margins to increase, as we'll manage operating income and those dynamics while we make the right
enterprise and sales investments for the company.
Finally, with the solid commercial demand and improving commodity price environment we're seeing, we expect
revenue growth for the year to be in the 14 to 19% range. We also are confident that our operating income growth will
be in the 18 to 23% growth range.
With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.
Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brian. Our progress in the first half shows that we're executing to a clear and consistent strategy. Demand
trends continue to be favorable, but are stronger weighting towards commercial. In the client business, we're seeing the
corporate refresh cycle continue as both notebooks and desktops demonstrated strong revenue and unit growth.
According to IDC, approximately 65% of enterprises have already begun or will begin their migration to Windows 7
within the next six months, and 89% of companies have definitive plans to begin their migration to Windows 7 within a
24-month period.
I'm also very encouraged by the progress in our enterprise business. Customers are increasingly choosing Dell servers,
which grew 35% in Q2. Today, two out of every five in the United States and one out of every three servers sold
worldwide are Dell. We feel great about the progress we're making also with blades and cloud revenues.
In storage, EqualLogic continues to gain momentum and experience wider adoption, delivering over $1 billion in
revenue since the acquisition and about $800 million this year. And we're continuing to build our enterprise portfolio
with our planned addition of 3PAR.

our IP portfolio in the data center.
Now I'll turn it back over to Rob.
Robert L. Williams II, Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Michael; just a quick reminder to please limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Casey, can we have
the first question?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
<Q - Brian Alexander>: Okay, thanks. Can you guys comment how much of the sequential decline in gross margin
was related to the consumer business? And related to that, I think your consumer business lost more money this quarter
than any quarter since you began reporting it separately. So could you explain in more detail the profit performance
there in consumer and what surprised you in the quarter?
Brian, I think you mentioned supply chain cost pressures. So what specifically gives you confidence that this business
will generate 1 to 2% operating margins in the near term? Is it component costs becoming more favorable? Is it specific
initiatives to drive profitability? Which ones are important and which ones are you accelerating? Thanks.
<A - Brain Gladden>: Brian, component costs clearly were the biggest pressure on gross margins during the quarter.
That affected the entire business, commercial as well as consumer. Consumer margins within the consumer business I
would say weren't necessarily down. And frankly, as we laid out at the analyst meeting, we've got some pretty dramatic
and significant actions underway to improve profitability in the business, especially in the retail business. I would tell
you that we've seen some progress there, though as you mentioned and the P&L shows, it's not quite evident yet.
I would say for consumer, we did see some demand weakening during the quarter, during the latter parts of the quarter.
But I would also remind you that the consumer business, the consumer industry has been very strong for more than two
years, and we've grown faster than the market during that period of time. I'll also remind you that the consumer is 19%
of the business. So we'll continue to watch that demand, but we would say we're still committed to driving to a 2%
operating income target as we look out over the next couple quarters.
<Q - Brian Alexander>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Our next question will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith Bachman>: Hi, thank you. Steve, I wanted to ask you about Large Enterprise. The dollars were up. The
operating margin performance slipped a little bit, and I just wanted to see if you could bifurcate. You mentioned
component cost as well as mix. Could you just give us a little more color, and how you think that trend unfolds as we
look out over the next quarter? Thank you.
<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: Thanks for the question. Clearly, we're quite happy with the year-on-year progress on
OpInc and the improvement of 110 basis points. If you look on a Q-on-Q basis, I think we saw an accelerated client
refresh underway with our customers, and Michael referenced that in his comments as well.

When you combine that and the margin rate associated with the client business relative to the rest of our business, it
certainly put some pressure on the gross margin line. We have very specific plans in place, especially now that we have
the E-1 to E-2 transition in the laptops under our belts, for how we can get the client margins back up. And we feel very
confident in our ability to execute that in the coming quarters.
Operator
Our next question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
<Q - Richard Gardner>: Thanks. I was just hoping to flesh out the component pricing and availability environment as
we go into the third quarter. I think, Brian, you mentioned modest component price declines, but it seems like the
declines here lately have been pretty dramatic. So I just wanted to clarify your thoughts on that. And also talk about
whether you did strategic buys during the July quarter, and whether there's an issue where we might be – you might
have some components that were bought at higher prices. Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yes, Richard, we saw as we were
together in June, that was the very early end – the very start of seeing some of these declines. We did do some strategic
buys. As you see in our inventory balance in the quarter, we put some more strategic inventory on the books. I think we
are starting to see more dramatic declines. I do have some concern in some cases that there will be some capacity that
comes out. Those prices will stabilize in the short term or in the medium term.
So we continue to watch it. I think we did not see a lot of benefit in the P&L in the second quarter of declines at all in
the second half of the quarter. We do expect to see some of that as we move into the third. And we'll watch it. I think
it's – as you know, it's across the board: memory, LCDs, hard disks. We're seeing prices come down, but I think it
remains to be seen how that plays out beyond the September timeframe.
Operator
Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Toni Sacconaghi>: I have one question and one follow-up. First, in terms of your looking forward beyond this
quarter, your fiscal Q4 hasn't really exhibited any normal seasonality over the last five or six years. Can you help us
understand how you're thinking about that? If we assume even flat for Q4, you're going to be close to the high end of
your revenue guidance range, probably somewhere around 18%. So A), how do we think of seasonality for Q4? What
is normal and we can calibrate against that? And then secondly, why shouldn't we be looking at the high end of your
revenue guidance at this point? Is there anything you're anxious about? And then I have a follow-up, please.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yes, Toni, I think it's a very good
question. And I think there is, as I called out in my comments and in the answer to the first question, I think there is
some – we're watching the consumer demand. As you look at our historical fourth quarter performance, it would
typically be driven by a pretty dramatic increase in the consumer business around the holidays. I think that's the biggest
question we have right now as we look at the second half of the year, how that might play out, so I would hesitate to
call that. I would suggest that if we saw typical seasonality, we would see a sequential pickup driven by consumer, and
your conclusion is probably right. But again, a little bit of hesitancy given what we've just recently seen with consumer
demand, so we'll continue to watch that.
Operator
Our next question will come from Steven Fox with CLSA.
<Q - Steven Fox>: Hi, good afternoon. Can you just expand a little bit on what you're seeing from a public sector
standpoint? There are obviously still concerns about state and local and national government spending. Have you seen

anything to discourage or encourage spending heading into the new budget season?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: We just experienced the year end of
the state, the state and local budgets. Generally on a year-over-year basis, they were relatively flat, but that was about
what we expected. We continue to see going into the third quarter, which obviously is the big federal budget period for
us, we expect to see a relatively good federal business. As we look at the pipeline today and the order rates that we've
seen, so far we haven't seen anything that isn't consistent with that at this point.
<Q - Steven Fox>: Okay.
Operator
Our next question will come from Maynard Um with UBS.
<Q - Maynard Um>: Hi, thank you. Can you just – given the concern over the consumer, can you just talk about
back-to-school? It seems like we're off to a little bit of a slow start. I'm wondering if that's in line with your
expectations. How should we think about back-to-school maybe over the next few weeks? And then are inventory
levels at levels where it could impact sell-in for the holiday season, meaning inventory levels at the retail channel?
Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I think what we're seeing is consistent
with what you're hearing from others in terms of back-to-school being a little bit weaker than we would have expected.
And I think as we're heading towards the end of that period, it's mostly done. I think as we think about inventory in the
system, as you know, our business model generally is pretty light on that in terms of our model serving the customers.
So I mean it's not necessarily an issue for us.
You can have – as you know, our inventory balance is up and there are investments we've made in strategic inventory.
As we've moved to ODM and as we've talked about, we are putting more material into the system, into the supply
chain, and some of that's on the water in terms of a transportation model that allows us to get some cost out and be
competitive. There would be more inventory in the system for us than there otherwise typically historically would. But
I don't see it having any impact in terms of our market behavior or how we price in the marketplace. It's not that
significant.
Operator
Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Brian, just to tie together some of the prior questions, how much of a stretch is it to expect that
you could get back towards an 18% gross margin in the back half of the year, just given the direction of component
costs and the cyclical and seasonal strength you're seeing in the higher margin segments right now?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yes, I think there's a bunch of
competing elements that drive the margin rate. As you think about it, there is very strong demand in the enterprise side
of the business. That helps obviously. If component prices stabilize at lower levels, which we're seeing now, we should
make progress in terms of gross margin improvements. I think what we showed in the quarter is that even with pressure
on the gross margin, managing the cost level, the OpEx in the business, we're trying to drive operating income and
operating income dollar commitments. And that's where we're thinking about it, Katy. I'd hate to size the gross margin
improvement given the uncertainty around component prices right now.

<Q - Scott Craig>: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Michael, maybe you can just help us out a little bit in the
storage area. You've obviously made a couple big moves there with EqualLogic and now with 3PAR, but you also have
a big EMC business reselling. So how do you foresee the relationship there playing out? And are you interested in
adding some more, let's call it continuing lines with EMC over the longer term? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. If you look at the changes in the storage
business, I think one of the most remarkable ones is the increase in gross margin dollars in this business. Certainly that
comes from having more and more of our own IP. We've had great success with EqualLogic. The EMC relationship
continues. And as we pointed out earlier this week, about 80% of the Dell-EMC relationship fits into the lower end
CLARiiON CX-120 product, the AX product, the NAS product, and Data Domain, which are really products that we
today do not have similar offerings for. And so there's a strong relationship there that I think will continue for some
time.
Certainly, there will be places where we choose to partner and places where we choose to compete, but we also see
with this proposed 3PAR acquisition a great opportunity to grow the high end of our storage portfolio and continue to
make this a rapidly growing part of Dell's overall business.

Our next question will come from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason Maynard>: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the back-to-school comment of maybe a little hesitancy
around the Q4 consumer, and just to get your take on the impact that you think either the iPad is having on that outlook
and then the potential for a lot of Android-based tablets coming into the market. It looks like the tablet category in
general is going be taking a bigger share. So how does that weigh into your positioning and your thoughts on end of the
year?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Michael, do you want to take that one
on the tablet?
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, I think it's a question of how many tablets do
you think will be sold if the PC market is 380 million units and the tablet market is – take a guess. I'm not sure that it's
a huge percentage this year. Certainly there's a lot of excitement around Android, and we're participating in that, lots of
folks working on tablet and touch-type solutions. I think next year you'll see a lot more of them.

Our next question will come from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird.
<Q - Jayson Noland>: Great, thank you; Steve, a question for you regarding integration within M&A. Is there a risk of
marginalizing some of these unique assets or maybe a risk of overwhelming your sales force?
<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: I think the best thing we can do is point to our past and look a little bit at EqualLogic,
which has become a significant multiple of what it was when we bought it. Brian, I'll defer to you in terms of the
numbers.
The thing that we're doing relative to this with Dave Johnson's leadership is really putting a world-class team up against
every one of these acquisitions and assuring that every aspect of integration that needs to be contemplated is getting
done, and it gets the highest possible priority in the business.
From a sales force standpoint, I can tell you that the fact that our intention to acquire 3PAR actually resonates
exceptionally well with our sales force. One is, as you've seen with our server numbers, more and more we're right in
the heart of the data center. And number two is that the value proposition from 3PAR adds an awful lot of analog to the
value proposition with our EqualLogic in manageability, in thin provisioning, in terms of all of those type

characteristics. The ease of installation and management of that platform is phenomenal. And so the value proposition
will resonate well.
Our challenge is to scale, and so we will clearly be scaling our specialist capability in the storage space to represent not
only our intended acquisition of 3PAR, but the continued growth of our EMC business and the midrange that Michael
referenced, and continuing the significant growth we've seen around PowerVault and EqualLogic. So I'm quite
confident. When you look at the software acquisitions we've made with Ocarina, with Scalent, and with Exanet, those
fit beautifully inside that strategy. And so we happen to have a couple thousands of our sales folks in town this week
for training, and I can tell you that the energy and enthusiasm couldn't be any better.

Our next question will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Reitzes>: Yes, thanks a lot; Michael, a question for you. Can you talk about what you thought of the
Intel/McAfee deal? Does it impact who you may buy in the future and your strategy? Are you excited about that deal?
Does that add value to you? And what do you think it means about consolidation in this space? Thanks.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Ben. I think it might be a little too early to try to
speculate on those questions. Certainly, McAfee is a company we work with closely, and I don't really have any
thoughts for you at this stage. I'd like to understand it a little more, and we'll get back to you at the appropriate time.

Our next question will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to get your views around the competitive environment. How do
you expect competitors to respond to weaker consumer demand and dropping commodity prices? Do you expect
pricing to get more aggressive as we move forward to try and stimulate units? What's your view there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Chris, I think it will vary by market,
and I think as you look at what we've seen over the last six or eight months, we've seen firmer pricing and more – as
you look at the individual products in the client world, prices have been generally pretty stable as compared to last year.
As we look at component prices moving, clearly that could be a catalyst in terms of overall market pricing. But I think
we'll have to see. We'll have to see how it plays out in terms of how these component prices move. That will be the
bigger driver I think.
Operator
Our next question will come from Lou Miscioscia from Collins Stewart.
<Q - Louis Miscioscia>: Just to tailgate a little bit off of that question, Brian, at the analyst meeting you talked about I
guess three headwinds, if I got it right, components, FX, and mix. Obviously we saw some of them play out. Is the
main one now still components and where that's going to go? And you did mention on the call that you thought that
you'd recover some on the gross margin line. I guess most of us were modeling 17.7 or 17.8% gross margin. Do you
think we're going to get there next quarter?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I think components, it depends on
what you're looking at, Lou. If you look year over-year, components still continue to be a pretty dramatic headwind. If
you look sequentially, we'll probably see some relief and as we said, some modest improvement in terms of component
pricing. There's still pressure from an FX standpoint on the business as you look at where the euro is versus hedges that
we've had over the last couple quarters. And that's something that the teams are very, very focused on in the

marketplace to try and recover.
I think look, with component prices moving down and to the extent that they can continue to moderate or soften a bit,
that should be a catalyst that allows margin rates to move back up. We'll manage that throughout the year. As we
showed in this quarter, I think we'll look at the cost line as well in terms of trying to manage the operating income
commitments.

Our next question will come from Abhey Lamba from ISI Group.
<Q - Abhey Lamba>: Yes, thanks. Brian, on the consumer segment, do you need consumer spending to get better in
Q4 to be much better than you're currently baking into your guidance, as to alluded to on one of the other questions, to
get to your 1 to 2% goal, or do you have enough levers on the cost side to get you there even if the demand doesn't
come through? Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I think we're working multiple plans
and obviously have efforts going across the business, most of it focused on our mix of business, where we play in the
consumer business. We have some new products launching in the second half of the year for the holiday season, which
we think we feel very, very good about. We have continued activities that help us improve supply chain costs.
Component costs should also help. So most of those would be really demand independent and would help us improve
the profitability in that business, and we'll continue to manage OpEx as well. So I think we're trying to build a plan that
gets us there in any environment, and we'll continue to watch that demand environment.

Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Aaron Rakers>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit about the server side of the
business. It looks like you guys had a pretty healthy revenue growth number. I think you also disclosed that you grew
units by about roughly 15% year over year in the quarter. The question is, is that if I compare that to what the
third-party research firm had estimated at a mid-30% growth rate, it seems like there's a little bit of a disconnect with
those estimates relative to what you reported. Can you talk about that? Is that reflective of any slowing that you saw
maybe in July? And then maybe on the heels of that, where do you think we stand currently in the server refresh cycle
in total?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Aaron, just to clarify, the server
business for us was up 35% year over year in the quarter. So that was – we think that was pretty strong performance.
And I think the IDC data would say that we actually gained share in servers in the second quarter. And I'll let Steve
make a couple comments.
<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: Yes, I would say that while the granular IDC data is not out yet, all indications are
that we outgrew the market pretty well. And we're pretty happy with what we've done, up 35%. That strength was seen
across all of our commercial businesses. All three businesses were up double digits in the server space, and that's with a
healthy DCS or our Data Center Solutions business, but actually Data Center Solutions business was not as strong as it
was in the first quarter. So you're seeing this on the back of our general purpose servers and on the strength of our
overall product lineup.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think there's another trend that's going on also. You
talked about where we are in the cycle. I think certainly the virtualization wave is still well in bloom and there's a lot of
that activity. But we're also seeing a continued migration of what I would call networking related activities moving into
the server domain. You see this in a couple of forms. One is the specialized networking companies moving onto an x86
platform. That's relevant because of Dell's OEM business with those companies. But at the same time, you see those

Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah from Brean Murray.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Thanks, guys, for taking the question. I just wanted to get a clarification on the comments you
made earlier about expectations for improvement in the IT outsourcing business. I just wanted to get your thoughts on
how you see that business unfolding second half of the year, maybe into next year, and maybe a little texture on what
you've actually seen change as you moved through the first half of the year.
<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: I think the integration with Perot could not be going better. The teams are very, very
well aligned in the field. I think the customers have received this as a component of Dell's business very, very well.
We've closed a number of good deals. We've got a very healthy pipeline as we look to the second half of the year.
We've already – we are not trying to hurry these signings into the current quarter. We're taking the signings as they
come. In fact, as we start the third quarter, we're already off to a very healthy start.
And so when I look at the outsourcing business overall, I think demand is pretty strong. I think Dell has the opportunity
to capitalize maybe a little better than some of the others because there is a fair amount of white space for us in certain
geographies, EMEA and APJ specifically, and across our entire commercial business. For Large Enterprise, I'm
certainly seeing that with a pipeline that is now $1 billion between now and the end of the year.

Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks. Steve and Mike, I've got a question I guess. Assuming component costs continue to
ease up in the back half, would your perspective in that environment be to actually use those savings and pick up
market share, or would you flow that to the bottom line? I'm just trying to understand what you are more focused on in
the back half. Is it market share or is it more leverage on the bottom line?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: We shared a view at the analyst
meeting of our priorities and how we think about the company. I would say that hasn't changed. The incentives and the
comp plans of the company are all aligned around growing the operating income, and so it's not about market share. It's
about profit share. And that's what you'd see that we're doing right now. And in the second half of the year, that would
be true too.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We still see our operating income grow faster than
revenues for the entire year.

Our next question will come from Mark Moskowitz from J.P. Morgan
<Q - Mark Moskowitz>: Thank you, good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on that, if I could. I'm just trying to
understand the flex within the model now versus maybe five years ago. Are there certain components now in terms of
ocean freight, more channel protection, marketing dollars being thrown to the channel partners that maybe limit the
upside potential, just given the switch from the build-to-order to the build-to-forecast model going forward?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I think if you were to look at the
business versus five years ago, clearly there's less margin to work with on the client side of the business, that's for sure.

I do think in terms of opportunity, as you think about the volume leverage in the business, we continue to look for
strong commercial demand driving the overall business. As you look at the second half of the year, that's the dynamic
we would expect to see, and you will see leverage of the P&L as a result of that, and I think that's the overriding
dynamic in the company.

Our next question will come from Bill Fearnley from Janney Montgomery.
<Q - Bill Fearnley>: Thanks, a question for Brian, if I could, on the upsell. How is it working and how is it affecting
your gross margin? And have you changed the sales incentive plan to reinforce or incent that behavior? And then any
additional color on products or services that you're having specific success with on the upsell would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I take it you mean services upsell. I'll
comment and then let Steve talk about it. I think we've seen continued improvement in attach rates on services in the
business. If you go back and look at it on a year-over-year basis, our attach rate in the quarter is 35%. A year ago, it
was 30%. So we continue to have success in attaching services and upselling across the business. That's an important
driver in the P&L, obviously, for us.
<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: I would just comment that the attach rate of ProSupport is quite strong, and Brian just
referenced the numbers on that. The other thing that I would focus you on is CFI [Custom Factory Integration] or our
ability to customize the software load that goes onto the hardware in our factories. That business has been terrific. I just
as an example reviewed that piece of the business in APJ, where it's well over 50% on a year-on-year basis. That drives
terrific short-term margin, and it really is a very sticky set of services for our customers.
Operator
Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi from Technology Insights.
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Thanks, guys. Actually following up on that comment that you expect operating income to
growth faster than revenue on a year-over-year basis, it probably would be a more comforting if you could say that's on
a sequential basis; any color that you can provide there?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I can tell you, if you look at second
quarter results, we did see 4% sequential revenue growth and 6% sequential operating income growth. I think without
getting into specifics on the second half of the year, our call for the total year stands. And I think you would see nice
leverage as well in the second half of the year as we've seen in the first half.
I think if you look at the first half of the year, we did see leverage in the business, especially when you look, in the
second quarter for instance, if you adjust results from prior year for last year, as you recall, we called out a one-time
vendor transaction which represented about a $69 million benefit for us. If you adjust for that from last year, we see in
the first half of the year operating income growing at 24% while revenue is growing at 21% year to date. So you are
seeing leverage. And the overall outlook we've called for the entire year is pretty consist went that.

<Q - Andy Hargreaves>: I just wanted to go back to storage, and I apologize if I'm missing something obvious. But
EqualLogic is doing really well, but the total storage business, at least on a trailing 12-month basis, is down over the
last couple years. So can you just talk about the dynamic there, and are we expecting any cannibalization with the
3PAR acquisition?

<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: No, let me explain that. About a year ago, we really changed the focus in our storage
business from being a pure reseller to being a real storage business. It brings not only our own IP but IP from our
partner EMC through an OEM lens as opposed to just as a pure reseller. And so that has impacted the revenue line. But
what you're seeing is a significant increase in the overall margin execution in our business. And so what you're seeing
on a year-over-year basis from a growth standpoint is SIM [Service Impact Manager] is now getting out of the number
entirely, but it's still overlapping with the SIM business last year.
<A - Michael S. Dell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes, just to put it in a little context, the gross margin
dollars in storage are up on a year-over-year basis almost as much as the EqualLogic revenues are up.

Our next question will come from Rob Cihra from Caris & Company.
<Q - Rob Cihra>: Hi, thank you very much. I wonder if you can just say from a macro standpoint, you've got four
quarters now in a row of sequential growth in Large Enterprise. I guess I'm just curious, well two things. One is how
much of that do you think is Windows 7 refresh versus just macro GDP corporate profitability improvement? And then
I guess taking that further, is that something that you think is peaking soon or are we early in that? If you could
ballpark, I mean you said now in the release, it's well underway, but I don't know. I'm sure you won't say, but if you
had to pick an inning, which inning would you pick? Thanks.
<A - Stephen Schuckenbrock>: I'm not sure I'd know how to pick the inning. But I can tell you that when we look at
this business, we are in the early stages of the Windows 7 deployments in the commercial space. And in Large
Enterprise, I think what we've seen is that came a little bit faster than we might have expected, but it's terrific. It's
terrific demand and we are capitalizing on that demand I think quite well.
When you consider more broadly where are we in this overall demand environment and what are the key drivers of it,
in the client space, it's certainly Win 7 and it's the age of the assets, and the fact that replacing the assets with new
technology saves companies money as it reduces maintenance cost, reduces power and cooling costs, et cetera. And as
they're deploying Win 7 anyway, it gives them a great window to deploy the new technology.
In the server space and in the storage space, we continue to see customers driving down the total cost of ownership in
the infrastructure arena, and they're continuing to standardize on x86 servers. They're continuing to virtualize all of
their infrastructure. And they're consolidating their storage footprints too, better carrying of that storage and better
utilization of that storage, and all of that is behind what's driving the demand. I won't predict an inning, but I can tell
you that there's plenty of headroom for savings in companies in their IT infrastructure and I think that's what's fueling
this.

We'll now take our final question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Thank you very much. I had a question and then a follow-up. The first question is just if you
can talk geographically, you mentioned linearity during the quarter for consumer things weaken. Can you talk about
China and some of the emerging markets as well as Europe? Just linearity, what did you see as the quarter progressed?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yes, Shannon. I think Europe, as we
said, I think was up 24% for the quarter. There was some pretty broad based strength in Europe. Germany was up 31%.
France was up 22. UK was probably the weak spot at up 6%. And I think we would say Europe, there's the normal
slowing that you would see in the back half of the second quarter, but I wouldn't call it unusual. We didn't see dramatic
slowdowns in Europe, and I would call that relatively steady.

If you look at Asia, it was driven by China. China was up for us over 50%. India was up over 75%. Japan was probably
the slowest growing country at 5% growth. And then ANZ was up for us over 30%. And I would say the same thing,
we did not see dramatic slowdown in APJ towards the end of the quarter. It was pretty steady throughout the quarter.
We're expecting continued relatively strong demand there.
<Q - Shannon Cross>: Okay, great. My last question is on the component side. I'm just curious if you think the
declines in pricing for components are coming more from the lower demand, so basically the vendors are just ordering
fewer components. Or is it more that the manufacturers have actually increased capacity, so that if we do see it bounce
back in terms of demand for PCs, will people be able to meet it or we're going to be in another shortage situation?
<A - Brian T. Gladden, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: I think as we talked about the first half
of the year, there is expected capacity in many of these commodity markets that is planned to come on in the second
half of the year. I would tell you that what we're seeing now is more driven by short-term demand. And that's what's
driving the current commodity environment that we see. That capacity is still out there. I'm not sure they're going to – it
depends on what happens obviously with demand as to whether or not they'll need that in the second half of the year,
but I think it is there. So I wouldn't be as concerned about that.
