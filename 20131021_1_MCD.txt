And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.
Don Thompson
Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Kathy. In July, we talked about three lenses through which we're framing our
performance. We talked about the past, the present, and the future. Today, I want to talk about the present and the
future. We're focused on the actions that we are taking to drive current performance in an environment that is
pressuring growth. And we'll discuss how those actions will position us to deliver results in the near and the
longer-terms.
Today, our business continues to grow, as demonstrated by our third quarter performance. While global comparable
sales of 0.9% were not as high as we'd like, operating income grew 6% in constant currencies and earnings per share
was $1.52, a 7% increase in constant currencies. Even though our comp sales lap eases in the fourth quarter, macro
economic and competitive conditions are not expected to change dramatically. As a result, we expect October sales to
be relatively flat.
Around the world, we are accelerating those initiatives that we believe will have the greatest impact on our customers
within our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden
consumers' access to our brand. We're also thoughtfully adapting local market plans to remain relevant and appealing at
a time when consumers are uncertain and the industry is stagnant.
We continue to intensify our focus on the most critical tenets of the customer experience to strengthen our
performance: menu quality and choice; customer service; affordability and consumer engagement. I'd like to briefly
discuss each one of these. Regarding menu quality and choice, we must ensure that the true quality of our ingredients
and food recipes are better known to all consumers and that customers have choices across our menu to meet their taste
desires and/or nutritional expectations. This includes featuring relevant and appealing new food and beverage news.
Next, customer service, simply stated, we must exceed our customers' expectations for fast, accurate and friendly
service at each and every one of our nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world. And furthermore, those restaurants
must be clean, well maintained and contemporary.
The third point is affordability. We need to offer compelling value options across all price tiers of our menu. And
lastly, deepening consumer engagement with the McDonald's brand, this means creating stronger awareness and
excitement around our menu and around our restaurants, while further revealing the ways in which we're a good
neighbor in communities around the world. We know that meeting customers' expectations in all of these areas is
critically important to a great experience at McDonald's. We'll talk more about these tenets, including specific
examples of actions we're taking around the world to elevate the McDonald's experience at next month's investor
meeting on November 14.
So let's take a look at the business across the globe, starting with the U.S. U.S. comparable sales were up 0.7% for the
quarter and operating income increased 5%. Our current sales performance was driven by a focus on bringing new and
familiar tastes to customers, exciting promotions and an ongoing emphasis on affordability across our menu. We
accelerated the timing of our Monopoly promotion in an effort to further increase awareness and encourage trial of
recent new product introductions, like Quarter Pounder line sandwiches and the new McWraps. Monopoly also reminds
customers about our core menu classics. It drives traffic and builds average check, while also engaging customers in a
fun and familiar game experience that's only available at McDonald's.
We also introduced Mighty Wings in the third quarter as a limited-time offer. This bold new flavor addition to our U.S.
menu originated in China and Hong Kong and has encouraged trade-up to increase average check. While overall
performance of Monopoly and Mighty Wings met our internal targets, it was not strong enough to offset current guest
count trends. Our promotions and new products are complemented by our consistent value approach to offer affordable
variety and choice across the menu.

The Dollar Menu remains core to our high-low strategy, with products like the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger and the
popular McChicken continuing to generate strong demand at the $1 price point. As we celebrate the 10-year
anniversary of the Dollar Menu, we're leveraging the equity we've built to ensure we continue to satisfy our customers'
expectations for affordability. The new Dollar Menu & More platform is designed to provide everyday predictable
value beyond the $1 price point and will be supported with the weight of our national advertising. The sandwich
line-up, which ranges from $1 to $2, adds new flavors and tastes to complement our existing menu favorites and
provides additional pricing flexibility for the McDouble.
In addition to the launch of Dollar Menu & More, we're balancing proven favorites with new tastes that add further
excitement and variety to our menu. The return of the popular McRib sandwich and the Southwest Premium McWrap
are examples of this flavorful balance that will be seen in restaurants within the United States.
Now, let's turn to Europe, where comparable sales were up 20 basis points for the quarter and operating income grew
8% in constant currencies. These results reflect strong performance in the U.K. and Russia and solid performance in
France. Negative trends in Germany continue amidst the highly competitive environment. The U.K.'s business
momentum remains strong and we continue to grow market share. This growth has been supported by our expanded
beverage line-up and an ongoing breakfast focus. This month, we're launching Mocha in the U.K. and using this
opportunity to introduce the McCafé brand across our entire range of espresso-based coffees. Following the successful
launch of McCafé Iced Smoothies and Frappés over the summer, this represents a significant step in our journey to
become a beverage destination in the U.K.
Russia delivered positive performance in the third quarter, despite the lower inflationary environment that continues to
limit our ability to take price. Successful food offers such as Taste of the Season and the Ciabbata Beef Burger helped
boost results for the quarter.
France also delivered positive results for the quarter, marking its first positive quarter of comparable sales since the
third quarter of 2012. The market continues to grow share in a contracting informal eating out industry. A core menu
focus, supported by strong marketing execution and an ongoing emphasis on affordability, helped to drive our
performance. The Big Tasty re-hit in September generated strong demand and the Classic Return campaign, which
launched in August, proved to be successful drivers of France's performance during the quarter. Additionally, Petit
Plaisirs and Casse-Croûte continue to do well by providing attractive offers at affordable price points. While we're
pleased with these results, we're cautious about recent performance, especially given the volatility in France's economy.
Germany's performance remains weak, as negative comparable sales and traffic trends continued through the third
quarter. Competitive activity remains aggressive and the decline in the IEO category persists, as the industry grapples
with price-sensitive consumers. Today, affordability and, specifically, price value is key in Germany. We continue to
evolve the balance between our base value and premium offers across the menu to address the near-term needs of the
marketplace.
Now, let's move over to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or APMEA. Comparable sales were down 1.4% for the
quarter and operating income decreased 4% in constant currencies. Performance across our big three markets remains
challenging. This reflects tough macroeconomic conditions, along with the performance of recent new products and
promotions that were unable to overcome our current negative guest count momentum.
Across APMEA, we remain focused on driving performance through consistent price value offers, accelerating growth
at key day parts, particularly breakfast and overnight, and by leveraging brand extensions to enhance the service and
convenience of the McDonald's experience.
Australia continues to balance new product news and strong promotional activity to appeal to customers in a highly
competitive environment. Looking ahead, Australia is targeting opportunities in chicken and the family business to
broaden customer appeal.
Japan's negative comparable sales and traffic trends persist. We're committed to making improvements to our Value
platform in the near-term in an effort to appeal to consumers, who remain extremely price-sensitive in this deflationary
environment. At the same time, we're introducing new products and promotions to create excitement and attract

customers into our restaurants.
In China, comparable sales were down 3.2% for the quarter. As a key emerging market, China has significant long-term
opportunities across all three of our growth priorities. We're also evolving our Value platform to give it greater reach
across day parts and meal occasions. At the same time, we're using limited-time offers and promotions to create energy
around new menu news. And we're leveraging brand extensions, like kiosks and McCafé's, to reach our customers
when, where, and how they want the McDonald's experience the most.
Around the world, we remain focused on our customers. It's our top priority to deliver an experience that meets their
evolving taste and lifestyles. We recognize the opportunities that exist to profitably grow our business for the
immediate and the longer-term.
We remain committed to making disciplined investments to fuel future growth and further differentiate Brand
McDonald's. Our efforts to broaden accessibility through new restaurants and to modernize the customer experience by
reinvesting in existing restaurants, including reimaging, technology and convenience initiatives, remains a top priority.
Consistent with our long-standing priorities regarding the use of cash, after investing in our business, we are committed
to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term, first through dividends and then share repurchases.
In fact, we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.81 per share, bringing the annual
dividend to $3.24. Combined with our share repurchases, we expect our total cash return to shareholders for 2013 to be
between $4.5 billion and $5 billion.
In times like these, our ability to stay focused on those factors within our control is absolutely critical. As important is
our ability to look within, to understand what's working, what needs to change and why and we must execute.
Our decentralized local markets have the ability to test their plans and quickly course correct based on customer
reactions. This is even more important in this environment, because it allows us to identify the right tactics that
resonate with consumers and that will drive our performance in the near and longer-terms.
Our culture is built on the premise of always putting the customer first, making them feel good about visiting
McDonald's today and into the future. Our ability to deliver on that promise, through our actions, will enable us to
deliver long-term value for our system and for our shareholders.
Thanks again, everyone. I'll now turn it over to Pete.
Peter J. Bensen
Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Our performance in third quarter speaks to the resiliency of our business model and
our ongoing commitment to invest strategically to grow our business over the long-term through a balanced approach
of adding new units and increasing sales at existing restaurants.
Despite modest comparable sales growth, McDonald's was able to achieve solid growth in revenues and income. While
the growth has not been as high as recent years, we are confident in our ability to deliver significant shareholder value
over time.
Through the first nine months, revenues increased 2% and our combined operating margin increased 10 basis points to
31.2%, primarily due to higher franchise margin dollars and lower G&A expenses. With 81% of our nearly 35,000
restaurants franchised, our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In third quarter, franchise margins
reached about $2 billion, an increase of 4%, or nearly $70 million in constant currencies, with each area of the world
contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter declined 40 basis points to 83%, as positive
comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy costs.
Global Company-operated margins totaled $919 million for the quarter and were relatively flat in constant currencies.
The margin percent decreased 40 basis points to 18.7%, as weaker performance in the U.S. and APMEA offset gains in

Europe. In the U.S., third quarter Company-operated margins declined 140 basis points to 18.4%, due to higher
operating and commodity costs. Commodity costs increased about 2.5% in third quarter, with similar pressure expected
in the fourth quarter. We have tightened our full-year estimates and now project 2013 commodity costs in the U.S. to
be up 1.5% to 2%.
We have taken three price increases year-to-date, with the most recent increase in September totaling about 1%. This
brings our total increase to about 2.6%, which is relatively consistent with a year ago. We are at the mid-point of the
projected 2% to 3% full-year increase for food-away-from-home inflation. Food-at-home inflation has been running
about a point lower. And we are keeping a close eye on this measure as well as we consider future price moves.
In Europe, third quarter Company-operated margins increased 70 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to the strength of
our two largest McOpCo markets, Russia and the U.K. These two markets contribute nearly half of Europe's
Company-operated margin dollars. In addition, France, the third largest market in terms of McOpCo margin dollars,
contributed through positive comparable sales and certain labor efficiencies, most of which we don't expect to realize in
fourth quarter.
Commodities increased about 1% for the quarter. Europe has also lowered its full-year projected increased to 1.5% to
2%. Our price increases varied across the 39 European markets. Excluding Russia, most European markets are
averaging year-over-year price increases around 1.5%. As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the
economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment, increased taxation, and lower disposable income. Our global
strategy and approach to pricing remains unchanged. We continue to balance our goal of driving traffic and market
share gains, while effectively managing the impact of rising costs and evolving consumer trends.
Turning to Asia/Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, Company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 160 basis points
to 15.3%, primarily due to higher labor costs across the segment, as well as new restaurant openings, mainly in China.
For a perspective, China represents approximately 30% of APMEA's Company-operated margin dollars.
Our G&A expense in the quarter declined 11%, or more than $66 million versus a year ago. This was primarily due to
lower incentive-based compensation and lapping the sponsorship of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games last
summer. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be down 2% to 3% in constant currencies.
Solid, consistent financial performance from our unique business model generates meaningful amounts of cash flow.
We strategically reinvest a significant amount of this cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns.
Our Restaurant Development teams are making good progress against their plans for building new restaurants and
reimaging existing locations, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities. We have trimmed our 2013 capital
expenditure estimate to $3 billion. This is a conscious decision to delay a limited number of new openings into 2014,
based on current conditions. We feel this is prudent, given the short-term pressures and our desire to maximize the
quality of our new openings.
We continue to generate strong returns on new restaurants in mature markets, with emerging markets, like China,
historically achieving our benchmarks within three to four years. In 2013, we expect to open about 1,500 new
restaurants, ending the year at over 35,000. New openings by area of the world include over 225 in the U.S., about 300
in Europe and more than 750 in APMEA. Approximately one-third of our global openings are in developmental
licensed or affiliated markets, where we do not invest our capital. We also continue to modernize our existing
restaurant base through reimaging more than 1,600 restaurants this year. Globally, about two-thirds of our interiors and
over half of our exteriors reflect the current contemporary look.
Let's now turn to foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted third quarter results by $0.01. At current
exchange rates, including the euro at the 1.35, 1.36 level, we expect full-year EPS to be negatively impacted by about
$0.05 to $0.06, which implies a fourth quarter negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02. Please take this as directional only,
given the volatility in exchange rates.
Lastly, I'd like to comment on our expectations for the remainder of this year. On the first quarter call in April, I said
that we expected Company-operated margins to be pressured throughout 2013, though the margin decline should be
less pronounced than in the first quarter, as sales comparisons ease in upcoming quarters. Let me give you an update.

Though sales comparisons have eased and will continue to do so, our current sales trends are a stronger predictor of
future performance than prior year comparisons. As a result, based on what we know today, we expect fourth quarter
global comparable sales performance to be: in line with recent quarterly trends; and restaurant margin percentage
declines, both McOpCo and franchised, to be at a level relatively similar to first quarter declines. We are wrapping up
our planning cycle over the next few weeks, and we look forward to sharing some of our 2014 outlook with you at our
November investor meeting next month.
The McDonald's system remains focused on building our business to generate enduring profitable growth for our
shareholders, franchisees and suppliers. Our third quarter results speak to the benefits of our geographic diversification
and the many levers we have to generate top and bottom-line growth. We are confident in our ability to successfully
navigate this environment, while preserving our competitive advantages and positioning the brand to participate fully
when consumer spending improves.
Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin the Q&A.
Q&A
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions]
So our first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. I'm going ask a very – thank you. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Yes.
<A - Don Thompson>: Yes.
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: All right. I'm going to ask just a very near-term question. Looking at the year ago October
performance, this comparison looks pretty easy and, obviously, you're guiding to a relatively flat number. So I'm
curious if things have worsened yet? If perhaps the government shutdown and debt ceiling discussions may have
impacted the U.S. business, or sort of what drove that. And then kind of a related question, the margins held up fairly
well, very, very well. They were actually up in Europe this quarter. So why the greater margin deterioration in the
fourth quarter? Is there something unusual going on?
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, Joe. This is Don. I'll take the first part and then I'll ask Pete to speak to your question
relative to margins. Regarding October, Joe, we still expect and it's really October and the fourth quarter, we expect the
fourth quarter to remain challenged, based on some of the existing top-line pressures that we're seeing.
We're seeing flat or declining IEO markets and heightened competitive activity across all the geographies. And even
though the comp sales laps do ease in the fourth quarter, heightened macroeconomic and competitive pressures are not
expected to change dramatically, as we've said.
In Europe, we've got less pricing power than we had a year ago and consumer psyche is affected by both the economies
and also some of the upcoming austerity measures, VAT pressures, et cetera. In the U.S., we continue to experience a
bifurcation of the consumer base. McDonald's core customers skew toward those customers whose disposable income
is not rising as much and are spending a little bit less in QSR. And so we look at those things, as we look at the
macroeconomic conditions that persist in APMEA and across APMEA, we believe that this fourth quarter is still going
to be relatively challenged, as we've mentioned.
Regarding the government and the shutdown, you asked a question about that. Actually, for us at McDonald's, the
impact is limited to a few different areas. One would be communities with large Federal employees and those
populations where a lot of the consumers there, their purchasing power may be limited based upon the government
shutdown, if they're government employees are impacted by it.
Another is from a supply chain perspective, if port authorities – when things like that happen from an impact
perspective, the port authorities are operating at reduced levels, so that changes the importation processing times for
some of the products that we may have.

And lastly, it's things like the E-Verify program, Federal E-Verify program, when it's closed down and the impact that
it has relative to hiring processes. So you can see that these are – outside of that first one, which really gets into
population impact, it's fairly minimal at this point relative to what's taking place from a government perspective.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: And, Joe, regarding margins, you pointed out exactly the difference between the third quarter
and our outlook for the fourth quarter and that was Europe. The two markets that really had the biggest impact on that
improvement in the third quarter in Europe were Russia and France. Combined, they basically contributed the 70 basis
points of growth. While the U.K. had growth, it was pretty much offset by the other markets.
And France, we had some exceptional labor efficiencies, due to their higher sales levels in the quarter, that we don't
expect in the fourth quarter. And in Russia, we had a true-up of some of their distribution costs that resulted in a credit
that added some improvement to the margins there. Last year, that true-up happened in the fourth quarter, so their
margins in the fourth quarter were a little higher last year based on that.
So on a comparative basis, we don't get that benefit. So at the end of the day, based on the current sales trends and the
lack of a couple of these unusual items, we don't expect there to be that growth in Europe margins in the fourth quarter,
leading the consolidated margins to be more in line with the declines we saw first quarter.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. My question is on the U.S. It sounds like you're saying that the promotions you've run
the last couple of months have been sort of in line with what you expected, but the underlying business is just so weak
and I just wanted to challenge that. How do you – can you just sort of back up why you think these promotions have
been effective, because they seem like they're not driving incremental traffic to the business? Are you focusing too
much on the short-term, for example, whereas maybe in prior periods we were winning from a position of strength?
And can you also just talk about the Dollar & More Menu? It didn't seem to work a couple of years ago, because the
consumers still thought dollar meant dollar, not more. So why does that work this time, do you think?
<A - Don Thompson>: Hi, John. This is Don. I'll talk a little about both of the areas. Relative to promotions, actually,
the promotions themselves have been within the range of our expectations. As an example, if I look at Mighty Wings,
Mighty Wings resonated with consumers, but performed at the lower end of our expectations. And your comment about
overall base and base trend lines was very accurate. When you see the overall industry being a bit softer, it does impact
our ability for us to drive sales to a higher level. But when it speaks specifically to the wings, there was a couple of
things that, although it performed within our targeted expectation range, again at the lower end, there's a couple of
things we can improve on.
One is still affordability. A dollar per wing was still not considered to be the most competitive in the current
environment. The other thing we saw and it's a very slight modification, but the flavor profile was slightly spicy for
some consumers. But having said that, what's interesting is we sold, or expect to sell, probably about 35 million pounds
of wings. We can address the challenges with spice, or as we look forward, with price. You will see wings again in the
U.S. business. It has been successful for us. But it is at a time when the overall environment is a bit softer. It did create
trade-up, as most of the products that we've introduced have done. Remember that as we went into this year, one of the
things we wanted to do was to make sure that we had an innovative food pipeline, but we did not want to forget core
classics, and we tried to do that. Monopoly helped us again with that.
The other thing we wanted to do is make sure we remained affordable and we've been working on this around the
globe. And that part, I feel, we still are operating from a position of strength in most of our markets. In markets where
we have challenges, we're addressing those challenges in those markets. And so all-in-all, we're doing the things that I
think we should do to position ourselves to grow this business. As the economy does come back a bit, we know that
we'll benefit from that, but we're also not going to sit back and just wait. We are doing many things tactically to try to
address the current environment, but we're not missing out on the long-term environment as well.
The other piece I want to mention real quick is the notion of Dollar Menu & More. And we have not tried Dollar Menu
& More. One of the things that was attempted a while ago was something that was called an Extra Value Menu. This is

very, very different. Dollar Menu & More means that you keep the Dollar Menu price points and it's consistent with
how we've continued to evolve the Dollar Menu since its inception back in the early 2000s. Over time, we have
changed some of the products on the Dollar Menu, as we needed to. We changed from a Big N' Tasty initially to a
Double Cheeseburger, from Double Cheeseburger to McDouble, so we've always evolved the Dollar Menu. That's what
we're doing now, that continued evolution.
But what we've also found, John, is the need to have a $2 price point for some products that are a slight trade-up from
just the $1 based price points that also supports additional margin growth in the restaurants. And it gives customers a
value ladder of sorts, so that based upon their discretionary spending, they have multiple offers at McDonald's. We also
have a $5 price point, which really speaks to things like 20-piece nuggets. And so there's varying levels of affordability
and we still continue to have our Extra Value Meals and premium-based products that we'll talk to.
So we've definitely not forgotten our core and the core classics of Big Mac and Quarter Pounders and Fish Filet and
those things you'll continue to see. We haven't forgotten the innovative food pipeline, McWraps, Mighty Wings, et
cetera. And for us, we most definitely haven't forgotten our affordability platform with the Dollar Menu. So all of those
things will play well together as we continue to come up with the most compelling menu offerings and compelling
calendar for customers moving forward.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Bernstein>: Just a question on kind of the longer-term business model. I'll preface it by saying it
beyond 2014, because I know you do have an analyst day coming up where we'll get some color on that, but can you
just maybe offer some insight. Longer-term, you mentioned the franchise business, 81% worldwide. I'm just wondering
whether there's still an opportunity to push that. Obviously, you still have huge skin in the game, but with I think you
mentioned 35,000 units, I'm wondering whether over time the idea might not be to push that to 85% or 90%?
And as a related question, the CapEx, I know you – Pete, you mentioned you tweaked it down in terms of dollars and
modestly in terms of the unit openings. I'm wondering whether that's at all a sign of future – I know in the past you
talked about maybe accelerating the pace of openings, and whether this tweak might not be to signal that maybe things
are slowing a little bit or maybe you want to shift to more remodels and less new units, so how do you think about that.
Thanks.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Jeff, I'll talk about the CapEx and then Don will probably have a perspective on the franchising
percentages. But really the change in our CapEx this year has really been a short-term thing. It speaks nothing about
our view of the future. As we look at the environments, especially most of the unit cuts have come from China and
some of the emerging markets and APMEA. So virtually all of the dollar variance from our original budget to our
revised outlook is coming from APMEA. Europe will be on their opening budget. U.S. and the other areas of the world
will hit, so it's really in China and some of these emerging markets where we were looking at where the projects were.
In a lot of these countries, we rely on other retail development and housing development and some of the other
development activity in the marketplace to create the traffic generators. And if they're delayed or behind schedule,
there's been years when we would go ahead and open the restaurants anyway knowing that, that demand would be
coming. And this year, we're just taking a little more prudent look at those kind of projects in light of the sales
environment to say, you know what, we'll hold off and wait for those traffic generators to open or those projects to
continue before we'll open the restaurant.
So it's really just some fine tuning and not an indication that going forward, we're looking to change our CapEx mix
more toward reimaging and backing off of openings. We still think there's plenty of opportunity to grow to the market
potential in several of these countries by opening new units.
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, Jeff. And relative to franchising, as we move forward, your point is appropriate. We
continue to look at opportunities. So today, we're 81% franchised globally, 19% Company-operated. We continue,
particularly across areas we're growing in, such as APMEA, we'll be continuing to leverage our DLs, to look for new
DLs as we're doing across China. We're continuing to move forward conventional franchisees and conventional
licensing. And so we continue to do that. APMEA will continue to see more franchising across the market.

In addition to that, we're also looking at the mature markets and existing markets where there are opportunities for us to
effectively franchise, as we continue to grow the business. And so, yes, we will continue to definitely look at
franchising and franchise opportunities. And you'll see more of it, particularly across APMEA.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question's from Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ivan P. Holman>: Good morning. It's Ivan Holman sitting in for Michael. Thank you for taking my call. I was
just wondering, the Dollar Menu itself has represented historically 13% to 14% of sales. Can you please give us a little
bit of guidance on how you see that evolving in the near-term, as well as from the longer-term perspective, in terms of
how you see the business model over the next couple of years? And within that context, how do you think franchisees
might be receptive to a change of that percentage, either up or down? Thank you.
<A - Don Thompson>: Hi, Ivan. Just relative to the Dollar Menu, I think that we will continue to look first at
customers and customer behaviors and affordability. And what we've always done is leverage that data and then, as we
have discussions with the franchisee body, to look at what's going to be the most compelling offering for McDonald's.
And again, the Dollar Menu is only a part of that. We continue to see and believe that it will continue to represent
somewhere in that same percentile, 13% to 15%. As we stretch out the Dollar Menu a little bit more with Dollar Menu
& More and provide some additional offers that will be even more appealing to some of the customers, we believe that
it will continue to be a compelling offer and still best-in-class when we look at the overall marketplace. And so that part
will remain the same. Franchisees have been a part of the discussions. They always are as we look at making decisions
like this one.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. Don, I think you mentioned in your initial remarks that you're
focusing, or have been focusing, on what's working well around the globe and what needs to change. So I was
particularly interested in maybe the last part of that, what you think needs to change going forward. And perhaps if you
could give us some examples of some maybe bigger picture or more meaningful changes as you look out to next year
or even the following year as you're planning your business.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, David. I'll start at the back end of that and then go into what needs to change. I think
as we look at next year, clearly the areas of, we call it the three global growth opportunities that we have, those things
will remain the same. And so we're still focused on making sure that we have the best menu across the board for
customers. We'll continue to balance that between the core classics and favorites with new products and we'll continue
to enhance that relative to the nutritional offerings that we have. So that's been a focal point and that has been working
around the world.
The modernizing customer experience is something we've been focused on and that really deals with our reimaging and
making sure the restaurants are contemporary. That part has been received well by customers. We continue to do that.
The strong portion of that, and Pete mentioned it, is that when you look across Europe, Europe is much further ahead
there. So we won't have to do as many globally, but we'll leverage what we do need to do to make sure we are a
compelling offer to customers around the world.
Technology is going to be a big part of our future, particularly digital engagement with consumers. And so you'll hear
us and see us talk about much more digital engagement with consumers. The thing that you'll see changed a bit is we
are being much stronger relative to communicating about our brand, communicating about our food. Customers want to
hear more about transparency. They want to hear about provenance and where the food is from. So those things we're
very proud of at McDonald's and we'll continue. At the November 14 [ph] NIM (38:53) meeting, we'll discuss more
about some of these opportunities.
When it comes to changes, we'll chat a little bit about that in November as well, but, frankly, we've got a few markets
where we have opportunities and we've been, again, very transparent about those in Japan. We've got to get consistent
value and it's a deflationary environment and a tough market. So we're focused on that. We've had some leadership
changes in Japan and we continue to look at the opportunities we have in that marketplace. Germany is a marketplace

that we are also focused on solidifying the balance between premium and the value-based offerings. We fluctuated a bit
there, possibly too much, and we need to shore that up.
Australia, we're focused in a very competitive environment on making sure we have that same balance. And in the
U.S., we've got a great food pipeline now. We're focused well on the operational base of what's taking place in the
marketplace. And those things, again, you'll get to hear a little bit more about at the [ph] NIM (39:52) meeting in
November, but those are some of the areas and some the markets that we're focused more intently on.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.
<Q - Will E. Slabaugh>: Yeah, thanks, guys. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Value Menu domestically.
Do you feel like you're winning that value game here in the U.S.? And then, is that a segment that can actually drive
sales and profits higher? Or do you think more or less that the Dollar Menu, as it is, may be something that helps you
hold those guest counts in place in a tough environment and it takes more of the success on the higher end of those
more premium items to really return to more stronger same-store sales and profit growth?
<A - Don Thompson>: Great question, Will. And the answer is yes. The Dollar Menu definitely, particularly in times
like these, where you see consumers stressed a little more from a discretionary spending perspective and you see a bit
of bifurcation relative to the economic strata in the U.S., it's very important to have that affordability platform in the
Value, the Dollar Menu that we have. So it does keep a base of customers. Keep this in mind. While it only represents
13% to 15% of sales historically, you've got about a third of the customers that will leverage that Dollar Menu in some
form or fashion. And so it is a strong part of the base.
Having said that, we also have to have core news, and the core has to be affordable at a Value Menu price point and
premium-based news, whether that be McWraps are Mighty Wings. Those are promotional. Those are limited-time
offers, but those things help, not only with margin, but they help with the excitement for customers, so there's
something new and exciting at McDonald's. And so we have to be able to balance both of those two ends of the barbell,
if you will. And also I would say we also have to fill in what's in between. That's the reason for Dollar Menu & More,
when we talk about $2 price points with sandwiches that have a few additional things to offer than our base value
Dollar Menu offerings do.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Matt Difrisco from Lazard.
<Q - Matthew Difrisco>: Thank you. Just looking at the franchise margins and the guidance, I appreciate the guidance
you give, given the volatility we're seeing in the comps and everything for the current quarter that we're in now. Can
you sort of give us some sort of what you expect in trends for 2014, especially with the franchise side of the margins?
Is there anything structural that you're doing, as far as relief plans or anything that my continue into 2014 that you can
give us an outlook on now or is it just simply comps coming back and the franchise margins getting – improving in step
with the comps? Thank you.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Hey, Matt. It's Pete. We will get in 2014 in a little more detail in November, but, essentially,
there's nothing structural that's changing. As you point out and that we continue to mention, it is really a top-line game
and our franchise margins are even more sensitive to comp, because a great proportion of the costs in that line are
fixed. So when we generate higher comps, we get the significant leverage.
The only thing structural that's been going on the last couple of years has been our contribution toward reimaging with
franchisees. So as we co-invest with them, we continue to get greater amounts of depreciation. But again, with comp
sales increases, that should not be a barrier to the margin growth. But as you point out, in this current environment,
we're not getting that top-line, so we don't expect the franchise margin to grow in the fourth quarter.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.
<Q - Michael A. Tamas>: Great, thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Is there anything in G&A that can be cut if
sales trends continue to under perform? And then if there's any quick comments can you give on the China business of
why that continues to struggle. Thank you.

<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Hey, Mike. I'll talk about G&A and Don maybe can give a perspective on China. When we
look at our total G&A mix, it's – what we're doing in this current environment is really looking at what are the
discretionary items that we can kind of pull as levers to moderate short-term performance. So travel, meetings, open
head count, things like that are things that we look at in environments like this. But at the end of the day, we're about
growing this business for the long-term. And so we're going continue to make investments in things like technology,
especially digital, that Don mentioned. We're going continue to make investments in our Restaurant Development
Teams and in the tools and processes to continue to grow restaurants. So as we look forward, there's no dramatic
restructuring or anything like that that's going to happen. And we're going continue to invest our G&A in the areas that
we think are good for the long-term growth of the business.
<A - Don Thompson>: Yeah, Mike, relative to China, the – I'll give a bit of an overall perspective as to what we're
seeing, at least, and then just a little insight as to McDonald's business as well. There is and has been, as you all know,
a slowing of the economy. The GDP is at its slowest growth level in 23 years and that's causing a bit of a credit crunch
across China, slight decline in consumer confidence that goes along with that as consumer sentiment is very cautious is
the way I would describe it.
GDP is projected to be in the mid-7%s for the rest of the year. Typically anything below an 8% is a bit concerning. But
nonetheless, we do see across China some bright spots and for the long-term, definitely, we see a bright opportunity in
China. Today, IEO is flat to declining. That makes it a little bit more difficult for growth. And the Chinese typically in
tougher economic times, they typically revert to what we would call see CQSR, Chinese QSR, noodle shops, et cetera,
than they do Western QSR-based companies.
And so these are things and phases we've seen before. We're solidifying our affordability and opportunities to reach the
customers with some of the products that we have. Breakfast has performed positively for us in the marketplace. We've
got a broader strategy around how we engage Millennials and own the night, as we call it, because that's a big
opportunity for us. And again, we continue look at our menu mix across the board.
One last point and that is Pete mentioned G&A and we get asked about it quite a bit. One other thing I would add is, I
would keep in mind that our compensation, so when we talk about a savings in G&A based upon performance-based
incentives or performance-based compensation, if we are not hitting the expectations we have in sales and operating
income, then that compensation's at risk. And that is a good balance. It's a good hedge within our overall formulas and
the way we operate as McDonald's. And so we constantly look at our G&A to make sure we're making prudent
investments for the future and those investments yielding appropriate returns for our shareholders.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
<Q - Amod Gautam>: Thanks. It's Amod Gautam filling in. Can you address some specifics or concerns on how your
speed of service and operations scores in the U.S. have trended over the past year, given some of the changes to the
menu? You've had the new POS in place for I think almost a couple of years now and other aspects like scaling up dual
drive-thrus. But are there any specific opportunities that you've identified for further improvement in 2014?
<A - Don Thompson>: There are quite a few things that we continue to look at. Clearly, service for us as I mentioned
in my opening comments, is a critical performance factor and an experience factor for customers. When we add
something like a dual-lane drive-thru, on a per car basis, if you looked at flow-through speed, we typically will see a
couple second increase in a flow-through kind of a measure, because you now have two lanes and they split off. For an
individual customer, they get attended to quicker and the absolute times that we see tend to be overall shorter for the
experience. And so the dual-lane drive-thru has helped and it has helped us with capacity.
When we implement new products, there is always a softer period upon the launch of the new products and then there's
a recovery. The more ingredients in a product, yes, that will impact service times, but our operating platform of Made
for You basically enables us to be able to implement those type products. So I would tell you at this point, the
operational focus is strong. There are different measures that come through each and every year relative to customer
satisfaction. What we're focused on is our internal measures of whether or not we're satisfying the needs of customers
from a fast perspective, an accuracy perspective, and then I will tell you, the quality of that service and the friendliness

of that interaction.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much. I wanted to step back if I could and just ask you about the demand
environment and your results. And I guess if I think back to the recession, 2008, 2009, your comps were better absolute
and certainly a lot better than your competitors' vis-à-vis where they are today. And I think it would be hard for us to
say that the demand environment was a whole lot better back then than is the case now. So I was hoping you could help
me just diagnose, is the issue your competitors are a lot better? Is the issue that you don't have quite as much of a sort
of a sales layer opportunity, just maybe if you can help me compare and contrast? And then a related question is how
are your franchisees doing in this environment? Obviously, there's always some talk in the media about McDonald's
relationships and I just wanted to get your take on that.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, Sara. Just having been the President of the U.S. when we went through this back in
2008 and 2009, I will tell you the things that were similar and some that were different. Clearly, there was a, from
consumer discretionary spending perspective, it was a very timid, if not restricted, environment. Having said that,
though, there was not – the competition at that point was not as strong from a pure price perspective. We had just
evolved our Dollar Menu, just as we're talking about doing now with Dollar Menu & More. We had just completed that
evolution.
As you all may recall, we went from a Double Cheeseburger to a McDouble and we talked about Snack Wraps a little
more strongly, so we were talking about affordability in the same way that we're doing now and plan to do even more
so in the U.S. business. We had just begun really focusing on the coffee opportunity. I think you'll hear more about the
coffee opportunity, as it still does exist, and you'll hear more about that at the [ph] NIM (50:52) meeting. And so those
things are fairly consistent in terms of how we approach it. Again, more, definitely more, competition in the
marketplace, we're getting back to that focus on the value, the coffee and those interim pieces. I would tell you we had
a pretty decent product innovation at that point and I think that what you've seen this past year is getting us back on
track with that in the U.S. as well.
Relative to the franchisees, I was just recently at a, our National Leadership Council Meeting as they meet with the
U.S. leadership team, and I've not seen as strong an alignment in quite a few years. I think everyone understands the
environment that we're facing. They also understand the legislative environment that we're facing. Those things cause
us at McDonald's to really consolidate our different needs and desires and really focus on the customer. And so that's
what they were doing. And I left there feeling pretty good about what I was seeing and sensing from the operator
leadership group and from our U.S. leadership team and them all being on the same page. So notwithstanding different
reports that will come out, it's wonderful to live in this world and get a chance to see and visit the franchisees, not only
in the U.S., but around the world.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from the Nicole Miller, Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Nicole M. Miller Regan>: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could help us close the gap or get more
color around your pricing. So I understand the comment about limiting pricing power, but you do have a very
sophisticated process, so maybe compare and contrast what that process has told you to do historically versus what it's
telling you to do today. And maybe if it makes sense, could you tell us how it impacted taking the Dollar Menu to a
dollar more. And then sorry for this part, but if you have it, can we get the gap in September of U.S. comp versus the
QSR? Thank you very much.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Hey, Nicole. I'll talk a little bit about the pricing. So traditionally, we strive to keep our price
increases in line with food-away-from-home. And for the year, food-away-from-home is projected to be up 2% to 3%.
And where we sit today, we're at about a 2.6% increase. So we're kind of in line with that measure as we look at it. The
other dynamic that we have to keep in mind is what's going on with food prices at the grocery store. And so the
food-at-home price increases are actually growing about 100 basis points less. So through August, I think was the last
data I saw. Food-at-home was only up 1%. So that does create a value perception with the consumer that we do have to
keep an eye on.

So those are the two biggest factors that we look at as we're looking at our pricing, as well as using our models that
actually go back in time and look at a history of all of the price increases by individual item, by restaurant, and look at
what happened to demand at those various price changes to make sure we're optimizing the menu price changes that we
do choose to make. So that's how we continue to look at that and through – for the month of September, which is really
the four weeks ended the 29th, our gap was actually positive 10 basis points to the QSR sandwich. On a year-to-date
basis, that gap is 0.7%.
<A - Don Thompson>: Nicole, relative to Dollar Menu products, I want to make sure everyone understands. The
Dollar Menu – there will still be a Dollar Menu. What we've changed is and more, which means we're adding products
at a $2 level and there will be some $5 level products and there may be some other fill-ins. So I want to make sure no
one thinks that we're abandoning the Dollar Menu. That is not something that will be part of our affordability strategy,
particularly not at a time like this. And so this is one of the ways that we can maintain the Dollar Menu in the face of
rising commodities and labor pressures, but also get a little bit more margin basis on some of the products at $2 and
some of the products at higher price points from there and the franchisees support this.
I think when you listen to Pete and he talked about the comp sales gaps in the QSR sandwich industry, clearly we, as
McDonald's, are still in a very viable and strong position. The challenge for us is still there is softness in the QSR
industry and we have the right things in place, I believe, for the long-term to continue to drive shareholder value.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: All right. We have four more folks that we're going to try to get to because we're running out
of time, Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo?
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Great, thanks. Just did some quick math there on Nicole's question and it looks like 70 basis
points of sequential improvement in share September versus August, so I guess the question is what do you attribute
that improved share for month-to-month to?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Jeff, just to clarify, our gap between us and the QSR sandwich competition year-to-date
September is 70 basis points. For the month of September, it was only 10 basis points.
<A - Don Thompson>: And, Jeff, those are our sales gaps and what we attribute it to is the fact that we did have
successful promotions relative to what we've done with Mighty Wings. We've had some good products with Wraps.
Those things we have. The challenge, again, that we have is in an industry – in an IEO industry that's been contracting
a bit and also as spending has kind of split, we call it a bifurcation of spending, what we've seen is we've seen those
customers to the moderate – middle to moderate ends, middle to low-ends, rather, are a little bit more stressed from a
discretionary spending perspective. And so that part is a bit of a wait. At the same time, as you can see from those
comp sales gaps, we still have offers that are appealing to consumers.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next Question is R. J. Hottovy from Morningstar.
<Q - R. J. Hottovy>: Yes. Thanks. Appreciate the color on the fourth quarter margins and your expectations that
restaurant margin pressures will be similar to the first quarter. But I suspect that the magnitude of the different wide
ends will be different. Could you elaborate where the difference variations from the first quarter might be in the
different food, labor and occupancy line items? Any color here would be appreciated.
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: R. J., it's Pete. At this point, we're not going to get into kind of that level of detail on our
outlook. We really were just trying in this environment where the general expectation was that we would improve as
these comparisons ease, we wanted to give some directional perspective on where we thought the numbers would settle
out. Obviously, in January, we'll get into a lot of the details on what drove the actual.
The one item I will mention, though, as we've moved throughout the year, the commodity cost pressure actually is a
little bit greater in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter and that's just really more a factor of, specifically, some
of the proteins that were a little more benign early in the year and us having hedges in place which actually protect our
grain costs throughout the year and really don't allow us to participate in sharp declines when they do happen, yet over
time provide us that predictability and stability.

<Q - Andy M. Barish>: Hey, guys. Thanks. It looks like, even with maybe some pushback on the new unit opening
front, it's still going to be a heavy fourth quarter opening schedule versus last year. I know oftentimes it's back-end
weighted, but is that factoring into some of the margin discussion as well here?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: No, Andy, it actually isn't. I haven't looked market-by-market, but the fourth quarter new
restaurant openings aren't dramatically different than we see traditionally year-after-year. And in fact, the new store
drag, if you will, the new store impact on margins in China and APMEA has actually sequentially gotten a little bit
better. So there's nothing in those opening numbers that is adding to the pressure in the fourth quarter.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: And we're going to take our last question from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.
And for those of you that we didn't get to, please feel free to call IR.
<Q - Mitch J. Speiser>: Great, thanks very much. And just one final question on the margin outlook, and I know, Pete,
it's a global margin outlook. In particular, just in the U.S., you did take some incremental pricing. You did give us some
pieces of the cost outlook, but I was just wondering if the weaker margin outlook is due to maybe the chicken wing
costs or just a little bit of increased discounting versus prior quarters, if those are issues in the overall margin outlook,
but as it relates to the U.S.?
<A - Peter J. Bensen>: Mitch, they're not really. As I say, in the U.S., the commodities, the chicken, the beef, and
actually our new bacon are the three biggest impacts on commodity cost vis-à-vis the first quarter, partly offset by some
of the lower grain costs. So it's really, as I mentioned in one of the earlier answers, the biggest change from where we
are in the third quarter is really being driven by Europe in terms of the global margin, and that was due to some of the
more unusual or one-time kind of items that led to the increase in their third quarter margin.

Okay. We're out of time. So I'm going to turn it over to Don with the final closing thoughts.
Don Thompson
Everyone, once again, thanks for joining us this morning. As we wrap up the call today, I just want to reiterate our
commitment to balancing thoughtful and strategic decisions for the long-term with informed and decisive actions that
we must take within our markets to continue to actively adjust the plans to strengthen our connection with customers
and also to position ourselves to grow the business profitably. We balance both of those things together. I'm confident
in our ability to deliver long-term growth for the system and for our shareholders as we continue to optimize our menu,
as we look for additional ways to strengthen and modernize the customer experience, and as we broaden accessibility
around the world within the framework of our Plan to Win.
Thanks again and have a great day.
