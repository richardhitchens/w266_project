MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon and welcome to the Alcoa Corporation Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Presentation and Conference
Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an
opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to James Dwyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
James Dwyer
Thank you, Amy. First, I'd like to apologize if you're having trouble logging on to the webcast, please try again. We're
having significant interest in the webcast and so, the access is little bit slower than normal. But you can also try it using
Google Chrome that seems to be working little bit better. So, I apologize if you had any difficulty getting in.
I'm joined today by Roy Harvey, Alcoa Corporation Chief Executive Officer, and William Oplinger, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by Roy and Bill, we will take your questions.
As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations
that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ
materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings.
In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. Reconciliations to the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. Any reference in
our discussion today to historical EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA for which we have provided reconciliations and
calculations in the appendix.

Finally, a note on financial statements methodology. Because Alcoa Corporation commenced operation as a standalone
public company on November 1, 2016, the financial statements are combination of financials carved out from Alcoa
Inc. prior to November 1 and actual results of Alcoa Corporation thereafter.
Therefore, the fourth quarter results include October on a carve-out basis and November and December actual results.
Similarly, the full year 2016 results include January to October on a carve-out basis and November and December
actual results.
With that, here is Roy.
Roy C. Harvey
Thank you, Jim. I'd like to welcome everybody to our call to review Alcoa's fourth quarter results. Our first reporting
period as a new publicly traded company and as our results show, we're off to a good solid start.
Let me get started with a quick overview of what we like to cover this afternoon. First, over the last months, we've
continued to aggressively streamline our portfolio, while these actions will strengthen our competitive position, the
restructuring costs produced a net loss in the fourth quarter. Excluding those special items, we generated net income of
$26 million or $0.14 per share.
Second, I'm also very pleased with the strength of our underlying adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, this
metric rose 18% sequentially, reaching $335 million. Third, since launching as a standalone company, we've increased
our cash and we've closed the quarter with the cash balance of $853 million. Fourth, looking at our markets, we expect
growing demand in bauxite which bodes well for our third-party bauxite business and strong demand growth for
alumina and aluminum, particularly in China. The fundamental outlook is stable across all three markets in 2017.
And finally, as we look beyond the quarter and focus on the future, we will continue to manage Alcoa Corporation with
name to reduce complexity, generate cash, and invest for strong returns. As you can see from these highlights, we've
had a strong start, but we still have much to do to secure a stronger and brighter future.
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Bill, so we can have a closer look at fourth quarter financials.
William F. Oplinger
Thanks, Roy. I'm happy to present the financials for Alcoa Corporation's first quarterly earnings. As Jim noted earlier,
the fourth quarter financials represent one month of carve-out and two months of actual Alcoa Corp results. Prior to
November, all financials are presented on a carve-out basis.
Let's look first at our GAAP quarterly income statement, which includes all special items, revenue increased to $2.5
billion due to higher alumina and aluminum prices, and the impact of tolling metal for our rolling business. On a GAAP
basis, earnings were a loss of $125 million or $0.68 per share with restructuring and other charges of $209 million
pre-tax.
Let's take a look at the restructuring charges. As you know, earlier in the quarter, we announced the permanent closure
of Suralco and the impairment of Warro, the after tax amount of 4Q 2016 special items is $151 million, of which the
largest component is $123 million of restructuring-related charges. The Suralco closure of $90 million and the
write-down of our Warro natural gas investment in Western Australia accounted for $31 million.
Other after tax special items include separation cost of $27 million, which is SG&A and interest expense and energy
contracts mark-to-market, partially offset by a favorable discrete tax item, still last quarter, we will be reporting
separation related costs. On a pre-tax basis restructuring is $209 million of which 35% is non-cash.
Now let's look at adjusted EBITDA after special items, adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was $335 million in
the fourth quarter of 2016, up $51 million sequentially and $83 million year-on-year. Net income attributable to Alcoa,

excluding special items was $26 million or $0.14 per share.
Some key points are that margins improved as cost of goods sold grew slower than revenues, which are up both
sequentially and year-on-year on higher alumina and aluminum prices. SG&A and R&D held steady sequentially at
3.2% of sale. Interest expense is down to $38 million, and it also reflects $19 million of allocated interest in October
due to carve-out accounting. Clearly interest expense will be lower in 2017, when there is no impact of carve-out
interest. Our effective tax rate depends heavily on market prices and in which jurisdictions we have gains and losses,
but in 4Q 2016 settled at 34%.
Let's take a deeper look at the factors driving our earnings. Higher metal and alumina prices drove bottom-line
improvement with some offsets from unfavorable costs and lower volumes. Volume in the quarter was lower, largely in
the alumina segment, as weather delays pushed shipments out of 2016 and into 2017.
Energy, as we had foreshadowed in the third quarter, at $37 million, was the largest negative impact due to the higher
seasonal power prices at our Spanish smelters, our Portland smelters recent power price increase, and to a lesser extent
lower power sales and higher natural gas prices.
Net productivity was $13 million lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, primarily due to timing of
maintenance. As a point of reference, net productivity versus the fourth quarter of last year was $92 million.
Now, let's take a look at the segments. On this page, we've provided production and shipment information for 4Q 2016
for the segments as well as revenues and ATOI for each segment. I do want to point out however that our segment
profitability measure will be changing to EBITDA in 2017. So, this will be the last quarter you see ATOI numbers.
Let's take a closer look at adjusted EBITDA in the segments. Fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA in the segments
totaled $406 million, up $56 million sequentially with strong results from the bauxite and alumina segments. Bauxite
was up $5 million on better pricing and overall cost improvement moving up its adjusted EBITDA margin to 35%.
Alumina was up $94 million on favorable API, currency and LME with partial offset from volume delayed into 2017
and the mix of contract shipped. Alumina margin doubled to 17%.
Our other segments posted lower sequential earnings. Largest declines were in aluminum, down $19 million, where the
aforementioned energy prices and higher maintenance spending overshadowed higher metal prices, and rolled products
down $15 million, where we had a mill outage, seasonal products mix changes and some towing costs depressed
earnings. Energy's margin remains high at 34%, but is down 4% sequentially on lower volume at Yadkin and Warrick
and the Warrick maintenance outage.
More detailed segment bridges with all the key drivers are available in the appendix. Let's take a quick look at items
outside of EBITDA. This representation of the earnings is one that many of you saw on our previous presentations. All
non-segment earnings were favorable sequentially except for LIFO and metal price lag. Transformation costs, which
are the costs of closed in curtailed locations in our long-term Rockdale energy contract improved $4 million to $20
million.
Corporate pension and OPEB costs also improved sequentially, down $3 million to $5 million. Total pension and
OPEB costs combining segments and corporate was $35 million. LIFO and metal price lag was unfavorable at $24
million due to higher sequential quarter at alumina and aluminum prices. All other costs totaled $22 million, improving
$14 million sequentially.
Finally, let's close out our look at the quarter with a review of the balance sheet metrics. Cash has been a focal point of
the quarter. Our cash balance upon separation was $654 million. And two months later, at the close of the fourth
quarter 2016, our cash balance had risen to $853 million.
Working capital management has been exceptional, ending the quarter at 13 days. Typically, our working capital is
lowest in the fourth quarter and highest in the first quarter. A key lever to maintain assets and grow returns, 2016
capital spending came in almost exactly at our $400 million target or $404 million.

As we've emphasized repeatedly, we're very focused on return on capital. Our 2016 return on capital is 5.3%. You can
find the calculation of this return metric in the appendix. Leverage remains low with net debt of $600 million and net
debt to adjusted EBITDA of 0.6%, although the underfunded pension and OPEB liability grew to $3.1 billion as the
pension assets had a negative return due to higher interest rates.
Now, let me give you a view on 2017. This page provides information on 2017 shipments by segment, as well as
detailing key financial estimates both income statement and cash. As we get better insight into certain costs for 2017,
we've updated our outlook and have provided more information on items you've asked about. We now estimate pension
and OPEB expense to be approximately $175 million for 2017, down from $200 million and total cash contributions
for pension and OPEB to be less than $250 million. Note that these two numbers are not additive.
Interest expense will reflect our low debt level at approximately $110 million, roughly half of the fiscal year 2016
amount due to carve-out accounting. Transformation costs are estimated to be approximately $150 million, plus an
additional $150 million to $170 million cash from R&D expense remediation and ARO reserves.
Warrick smelter, Suriname refinery and Anglesea power station will now be included in the transformation reporting.
All other corporate costs are estimated to be approximately $175 million, favorable to the prior outlook of $200
million. Our effective tax rate and cash taxes will vary with profitability. Our taxable income and tax rates vary by
region and are heavily influenced by market prices. There are few other cash items. We continue to expect sustaining
capital expenditures to be less than $300 million.
However, we should note that we've increased our return-seeking capital expenditures to be approximately $150
million to execute on the growth projects that we had shown in many of our recent presentations. Recall that we have
18 projects that total $385 million in gross spend. In 2017 we will start 11 of those 18 projects.
So, with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Roy.
Roy C. Harvey
Thank you, Bill. I'd like to take a few minutes to review the progress we made in 2016, both enabling separation and
positioning us well for 2017.
Starting with productivity, during the critical period leading up to the separation, which, at this point, feels long ago, we
were faced with a significant downturn in alumina and aluminum pricing. Faced with these conditions, Alcoans across
the globe generated significant savings through productivity improvements, which we drove to the bottom-line.
In 2016, we delivered gross productivity savings of $760 million, significantly beating our published goal, and even
more importantly, we delivered $290 million in net performance improvement. We have locked-in those savings, and
we'll build upon them in 2017.
One important note on how we plan to report productivity and performance going forward. As we simplify our internal
and external reporting, we will focus on net performance figures. This metric reflects the net improvement of our
business outside of our three main market factors: alumina, and alumina pricing, and currencies. We feel that this is the
clearest and simplest indicator of the progress as a company.
In bauxite, we are among the world's largest bauxite miners, and last year, we increased our third-party exports as we
had planned. We shipped 6 million bone dry metric tons to third-party customers in 2016. In the fourth quarter, we
secured our first major bauxite export contract out of Western Australia with a third-party agreement to supply
approximately 400,000 bone dry metric tons of bauxite from our Huntly mine to China.
The Western Australian government also granted approval for Alcoa to export up to 2.5 million metric tons per year of
bauxite for five years to third-party customers. We continue to see great opportunities in the merchant bauxite market.
And with modest capital expenditures, we can increase our third-party sales volumes dramatically.

During 2016, we started to build partnerships with key customers in China and elsewhere that can flourish and grow as
we build out this highly-profitable business.
On production, we demonstrated strong productivity in our operations, beating annual records at locations in our
bauxite, alumina, and aluminum segments.
In bauxite, the Juruti mine worked to debottleneck the process and set an annual record for both production and
shipments.
In refining, Pinjarra and Wagerup in Western Australia, and in São Luís in Brazil reached new production records.
In alumina, we had production records for molten aluminum at four of our smelters; Bécancour and Deschambault in
Canada, San Ciprián in Spain, and Mosjøen in Norway.
As it pertains to our portfolio, last year, we continued to take actions to improve our collection of operating assets. We
permanently closed the smelter at work operations in Indiana, and have also just announced the permanent closure of
the Suralco refinery and bauxite mines in Suriname, which have been fully curtailed since November of 2015. We also
idled the remaining alumina refining capacity in Point Comfort, Texas.
These decisions are never easy, but are necessary to strengthen the remaining portfolio. We continue to be focused on
generating both earnings and cash through the active management of our portfolio of assets.
In rolled products, last year, the Warrick rolling mill successfully transitioned to a cold metal plant after the closure of
our smelter. And we're now working on customer qualifications at the Ma'aden Rolling Company in Saudi Arabia.
Together, the two plants will supply our customers with flat rolled aluminum that is used primarily to produce food and
beverage containers and lithographic printing plates.
From a total business standpoint, we plan to transition the production volume to Warrick operations in Ma'aden
eventually replacing the tolling agreement with Arconic at Tennessee operations, as they exit the can sheet segment.
Operating results for this quarter demonstrate the need for rapid action to drive profitability in this business. Our
strategic levers are clear. Finish, start up and qualifications at our Ma'aden joint venture, fill the mills and increase
capacity, improve margins in a challenging, but improving supply-demand environment, and lower our operating and
metal input costs across both plants. We have made progress this quarter and the work is continuing.
Lastly, a note about our Portland joint venture, where we were also able to resolve some important challenges. The
Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria State in Eastern Australia, which already faced elapsing of a long-term contract
in a difficult energy environment at the end of 2016, lost much of its operating capacity from the December power
outage.
Last week, we announced four-year agreements with States and Federal Australian governments and the energy
provider AGL that will help facility to better manage market fluctuations as we seek a low-cost, long-term power
solution. We are focused on making the best out of the difficult situation, and we are pleased that we will be able to
deliver a significantly improved financial outcome for our shareholders versus curtailment, while constructing a
longer-term energy solution for this modern and competitive plant.
Next, I'd like to highlight how we are using our CapEx budget for both return-seeking projects and those that help to
sustain our business. These select projects are meant as examples of how we are using our capital dollars efficiently and
with a focus on returns for our shareholders. Our leadership team has implemented a clear process to review and
approve capital projects, eliminating unnecessary complexity, so we can quickly identify the right projects, and drive
returns to the bottom-line.
We are also focused on execution and delivering on projected returns as we build out and implement each of these
projects. We see this as a clear lever for our future success.
Starting with two return-seeking projects. The first one is in our bauxite segment. With a capital investment of $13
million, the team at the Juruti mine in Brazil increased production last year to 6 million tons per year, up 12%

year-over-year to meet third-party bauxite sales costs. Last year, Juruti exported bauxite to China, Europe, and the
Americas. In 2016, 21% of production in Juruti was for export, up from 6%, the previous year. The project is expected
to have an estimated annual EBITDA impact of $5.2 million, and is in the first phase, and what could be additional
expansion project as we build strong customer partnerships for additional sales.
The next project is in our alumina business and demonstrates how we use advanced process knowledge to continually
improve operating efficiency. Our unrivaled technical experts at the Center of Excellence developed modeling
techniques for Pinjarra in Western Australia, our lowest cost refinery. The models showed how we can boost daily
production by reusing the filtrate created during calcining, which is the last stage of the refining process.
Based on our models, we installed new piping and related infrastructure, so that the filtrate could be added back into the
refining process, improving the overall yield, while maintaining our critical quality parameters. The project is estimated
to produce an internal rate of return of more than 150% with annual EBITDA savings of $5 million.
In sustaining capital, I've selected this final project to demonstrate the ingenuity that is the hallmark of being an
Alcoan, always looking for methods to improve traditional processes. In this case, one of the most capital intensive
parts of our refining portfolio. We have applied pressure filtration technology to bauxite residue, lowering operating
costs, while at the same time reducing water and land usage.
Traditional methods require drying bauxite residue on large storage areas and then, once dry, applying water to prevent
dusting. The new technology forces residue to large filters, removing water and creating a high density cake, which
limits dust and makes for more efficient use of the existing space. With the new system in place, the refinery has the
potential to extend the life of residue storage areas by 15 years. For this project, completed last year, we spent a total of
$115 million and will avoid spending almost twice that amount over 10 years, as we manage bauxite residue.
The technology is being evaluated for our other locations and holds great promise to fundamentally shift the long-term
capital footprint of the alumina business.
As you can see, we have many opportunities to deploy capital to drive returns, both to grow our existing third-party
sales, but also to sustainably lower our cost footprint.
Let's now turn to a view of our major markets starting with an overview of China. In China, both the alumina and
aluminum fundamentals are being supported by a combination of factors, increasing demand, limited supply available
to respond to this demand and rising input costs. Both markets are enjoying strong demand growth in China with
alumina and metal growing at a 7% compound annual growth rate since 2015.
Additionally, both markets have limited capacity still curtailed that can come online quickly to address increased
demand. In alumina, only about 1 million metric tons of the 14 million metric tons curtailed in the last cycle remains
offline. In metal, about 2 million metric tons of 4 million metric tons remains curtailed. What is more, Chinese
producers of alumina and metal are facing significant cost pressures.
In refining, average costs have increased approximately $40 per ton since June. This has largely been driven by
increasing caustic and coal prices. Caustic prices have been supported by the limited supply of its co-product chlorine.
And Chinese coal prices have been supported by government actions, including restrictions on the number of days
miners can operate.
On the smelting side, the same increase in the cost of coal is combining with increasing alumina prices to push costs up
approximately $400 per ton since June. Alumina, of course, has its price supported by the same factors highlighted
here, demand growth, limits on supply response and cost increases.
As we enter a period of relative quiet demand for the Chinese New Year, these cost pressures have driven more than
38% of Chinese smelters to a position of negative cash generation. Furthermore, if you consider market alumina prices
for integrated operators, 65% of Chinese smelters would be underwater.
Now, turning to our market projections. Our fundamental outlook is stable for 2017 across the three markets. For
bauxite, we expect the market to be in relative balance this year as the Chinese continue to stockpile the bauxite

strategically, while seeking new sources of high quality, consistently delivered material. Their desire to hold bauxite is
driven by major sources of uncertainty in the market, including potential changes to the Indonesian and Malaysian
bauxite export policies and the speed with which the Chinese investment in Guinea can begin production.
We continue to see this market as very constructive and ongoing discussions with current and potential customers give
us confidence, that we can continue to grow this high return business. For alumina, we see the market in relative
balance as well. In addition to the expectation of increasing Chinese imports, strong continued global demand and little
competitive capacity available to restart points to a market that continues to be strong. Our supply deficit in 2016 has
reduced inventories and we entered 2017 with strong fundamentals.
For metals, we are forecasting a slight surplus in 2017, largely driven by increased Chinese production as 2016
concluded. Demand growth in this market remains strong with Chinese demand growth of 6% driven by end-use
market growth in the packaging, electrical and transportation sectors. Ex-China growth of 2% is led by the North
American market where we are forecasting a 3% demand growth this year. One important point to keep in mind, given
the cost dynamics mentioned previously, a stronger supply side response from China in the next couple months could
skew towards the tighter market for 2017.
Alcoa Corporation stands ready to capitalize on improving markets, but is also resolutely prepared should pricing
swing downwards. We are focused on delivering strong results both in 2017 and beyond. Thus, in closing, I'd like to
reiterate what are our three key priorities. We will strengthen the balance sheet. We will reduce complexity. And we
will drive returns. As it pertains to balance sheet, we will preserve cash optionality. And whether we invest in small
growth projects or use generated cash to deleverage, we will be wise stewards of that cash.
We also intend to actively manage our pension and OPEB obligations going forward. On reducing complexity, we are
examining and simplifying each of our processes. We're looking at everything from our capital project reviews, to our
financial systems, to how we manage our people, with a very, very simple goal, to make Alcoa more nimble and to
reduce our costs.
To that end, we are also setting a net performance goal of $50 million, offsetting at least $125 million that we see in
market cost pressures in 2017 and building on the significant gains that we saw in 2016. We remain committed to
making sure that performance improvements hit our bottom-line. And lastly, we're focused on driving returns.
Based on recent metal and alumina prices, we estimate 2017 adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, to be between
$2.1 billion and $2.3 billion. Two important notes about this estimate. First, we expect our productivity programs to
show progressive improvements as the year advances. And second, please keep in mind that our first half will include
the impact of our Portland smelter restart, plus some seasonality driven by our decision to maximize energy earnings
for the year by shifting some sales to the second half.
And as we look towards the future, we're also in the midst of planning three year targets for return on capital that we
will introduce mid-year. To conclude, we're pleased with what we've accomplished over the past year to achieve a
healthy separation. We are excited about the value that we can add to our businesses and the opportunities in our
markets and we are focused on driving results this year and beyond.
With that, we'd love to turn it over to you to ask a few questions, so that we can explore the results more fully.

<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Hi, Evan. How are you?
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Pretty good, thanks. One question, it's tough. Maybe I'll stick with the company specific one
then. I saw that you put out $150 million number for transformation. And since I assume that you have pretty good
visibility on the reclamation expenses that you're going to have to incur going forward, I was hoping you can maybe
talk us through what that might look out say over the three-year to five-year period. Do you expect that to gradually
decline or is that going to stick with us for a little while?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Over the next three years, I think it will stick with us. Beyond that, we would have to look
to see what goes in the transformation. But at this point, the next three years, I think that's a reasonable estimate.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Great. Thanks. That was fast. Can I get one more in? Is that okay?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Sure, sure.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Great.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: You ask a very binary question. I can give you a binary answer.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: So, maybe just one on the market. Obviously there is some big news out last week on the WTO
pursuing some subsidy remedies against China on the aluminum front. Just wondering what you thought about that.
What sort of timing could we see about that? How do you see that playing out? Are there any milestones out there we
should be looking for?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. Thank you, Evan. We're still waiting to see the details of the case, to be quite honest. I
think there is a lot of questions still out there, exactly the approach that these discussions will take. And so, as we've
always been, we're very supportive of a marketplace that is fair and where we can all compete together. So, we're
following that very closely. But to be quite honest, we're reserving ourselves, so that we can actually evaluate the
arguments behind it and make sure that we can adapt.

The next question is from Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Hi, Roy and Bill. Thanks very much for the update and taking my questions. First one is on
bauxite pricing and margins. Obviously, I think you said your third-party sales was about 6 million tons last year out of
the sort of the 48-ish million tons. Can you guys give some color on the breakdown of margins of both the intersegment
and third-party given that the third-parties will be growth area for you guys over the next few years?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. Let me start and I'll let Bill give a more technical answer. First and foremost, when we
look at the way that we price internally, we always take into account market pricing. We try to be very fair, so that we
don't advantage one business over the other. And that we're very clear what is the opportunity cost, if we were to
choose to sell externally rather than internally. That said, bauxite is a differentiated product. So, each bauxite has its
own characteristics of alumina content as well as impurities, et cetera. So, the pricing mechanism is very dependent
upon what you're selling and to whom. So, as we develop the external marketplace, it helps us to be much better at
judging what our internal pricing should be. And as I mentioned in my comments, we'll just have our first shipment of
Western Australian bauxite going externally to China.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: And Andrew, we don't really necessarily like to get into what margins are for external
tons just because there's really not that many customers. For the segment, in total, margins are at 35%. I think, Roy
alluded to the fact that we've got some tremendous growth opportunities in the business. We think that we can grow
both Juruti and Western Australia significantly over the coming years.
The ramp-up that you see in return-seeking capital that we previously regarding to $100 million of return-seeking
capital were now at $150 million, because we are investing in our bauxite business, due to the margins in our view of

the future in bauxite. So, I think, that's about the extent of what we can share with you.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Would you say like, obviously with the WA stuff, it's a little bit lower quality than some of the
Guinea stuff. Would you say that margins, even if you ramp up volumes, margins might come down slightly or is that
not fair?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: I don't know if that's fair. So, I think we're very cognizant of maintaining margin level in
bauxite.

The next question is from Jorge Beristain at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Quickly, just maybe one for Bill. Can you comment on what
your net debt position was two months ago or in the last quarter, I just don't have the quarter-on-quarter changes?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Sure, yeah. I can – it's the question I actually like, Jorge, and the reason why I like the
question is, because we generated a lot of cash in the last two months of the year. We started the company with right
around $655 million of cash on hand. We had right around $1.45 billion of debt, that's $1.25 billion of funded debt,
$200 million of BNDES debt. We ended the quarter with the same level of debt and we had generated nearly $200
million of cash. So, our net debt position came down to roughly $600 million in net debt. So, a good strong cash
generation as an independent company.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Okay. And then – so I guess, I was asking – my second question was going to be for cash
flow statement, but I guess you're kind of telling that the change in cash generation you had was roughly your change
in cash flow?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah. Because of the carve out financials and given that we had one month of Alcoa, Inc.
and two months of Alcoa Corp. a quarterly cash flow is really, really difficult to get much out of. I think the better
indicator, at least for me, is that the last two months of the year, we generated $200 million of cash. And to be clear, a
free cash flow number would be larger than that, because that's after we paid minority dividends to our partners. So,
good, strong cash generation in the last couple of months of the year.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: And Jorge, if I can just jump in briefly as well and add-on top of Bill's comment, we're trying to
very clear internally the importance of cash to us, and how much that strengthened balance sheet helps protect us from
downside, but at the same time, as Bill mentioned in his presentation, it allows us the opportunity to grow, it allows us
to get in there, lower our cost and deploy a $150 million of return-seeking capital already in 2017. So, it is the
lifeblood, we typically say.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: And I will jump on, one more – one last comment. And you may be wondering what cash
priorities are. We'll restate the cash priorities, cash priorities after sustaining and paying towards the pension, as we've
laid out, it's a combination of de-levering and investing in the business. So, we increased return-seeking capital by $50
million excess cash flow, we'd be looking at potential de-levering at this point.

<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: I guess, first just a clarifying question. On the net productivity, if I was to sort of
decompose the net productivity for the year just completed, that $760 million, what were the different factors that
brought the net down from $760 million to $290 million just to sort of compare to the 2017 framework?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. So, let me – again, let me hit the qualitative side and I'll let Bill hit some of the
quantitative pieces. So, we had run a pretty complex system of trying to divide between gross and net productivity
before. And the fundamental idea was that we would essentially count all those good ideas towards gross productivity,
and they would be destined for two things. Number one, to make the business better, and number two, to offset
problems, or headwinds, or to unexpected circumstances.
So, we will continue to look internally at how do we make sure that we've got a robust set of initiatives, and the ideas,
and ways to drive forward our business that can do again, both of those things, offset headwinds and drive real gains on
the ground.
So, when you think about the difference between the delivered $750 million and the $290 million that hit the
bottom-line, essentially the difference is the cost headwinds, and it's things that went against us over the course of 2016
that either we expected or didn't expect. The reason we've gone, the idea behind either net productivity, which is a little
more narrowly defined our net performance, which is broader, and includes things like volume creep, and pretty much
everything outside of market factors, is quite simply, because it shows what we're delivering to the bottom-line on a
year-over-year basis. So, it holds us accountable, not just to delivering the prices that are prevailing in the market, it
holds us accountable to delivering real value for our shareholders, whether it through return-seeking projects, or
whether it's by driving down costs faster than our competitors, or holding back raw material cost.
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Great, thank you.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: And just to add on that a little bit, probably some of the biggest factors on a
year-over-year were some of the headwinds that we saw around price and mix, especially in some of the value-add
business. We did see some higher energy costs over the course of that year and some higher raw material costs. So, that
was some of the things that took that down to the net number.

The next question is from Timna Tanners at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Hey, Timna.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Hi, Timna.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: I know you were asked about WTO and it's tough to speculate, but I guess I would just
ask you to speculate on some, because that seems to be part of our job lately. But, in the Trump administration, there is
a lot of talk about tax reform. Have you put any thought as to how that would affect Alcoa in broad terms given that
you are U.S.-based company, but with the bulk of your income coming from overseas?
And in light of that as well, with some of the initiatives that he is talking about, can you talk to us a little bit about what
it might take or if you're considering what it would take to restart any of your U.S. operations?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah. So, let me address, I'll take a crack at both of those quite honestly. First one,
Timna, again, we think it's way too early to speculate what type of implications change tax policy would have on us. I
think you hit on it very, very well. We've got earnings that are generated overseas. We've got losses largely in the U.S.
due to some of the overhead costs and things like that, which we don't get a tax advantage on, and you can see that
sometimes in our ETR depending on how the profitability flows.

So, at this point, I think it's too early for us to determine. Once we get an idea from the government on where they're
going to land, we'll have a better indication of how that will impact us.
Secondly, as far as restarting facilities, and, Roy, you can jump in. But, essentially, we are constantly evaluating the
marginal facilities to see if there is an opportunity for either restarting them in the case of São Luís down in Brazil,
Wenatchee.
So, those are the opportunities we're looking at potentially. It doesn't make sense to restart them. I guess, the other one
is that typically we're in this position of talking about curtailments and we'll evaluate whether it makes sense to
continue to operate facilities too. So, at this point, no clear guidance on what we would restart.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: And just to add on that, I think Bill hit it pretty completely. But, you think about the range of
factors that we have when we think about a curtailment. A curtailment or a restart, whichever side of that bubble you
happen to be on, it's really focused on how we drive additional value for our shareholders. We look at the cash impacts,
we look at the earnings impacts, and then we also think about what the market means for us today, and what the market
could mean for us down the road.
As you probably wouldn't be surprised, they're often are very large numbers that have to deal with power contracts and
with the cost of curtailments or the cost of restart. And so, we take a pretty detailed view to really be able to determine
what the right thing to do on a case-by-case basis.
And like Bill said, that can change pretty quickly. It can change quickly depending on what policies are implemented,
whether it's in the United States or elsewhere. It can change if markets shift fundamentally. That's one of the fun parts
of the business, Timna.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Well, with the volatility in the aluminum price, I totally understand. The only thing I
want to ask you was, the point you made about how you're going to actively manage OPEB and underfunded pension,
what do you mean by that? I'm sorry, if I've been dense, but I'm just curious.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: What we mean, Timna, is that we've got around a $3.1 billion OPEB in pension, underfunded
liability. There is two ways to really solve that. The first way is to try to actively manage the liability. So, we would be
looking at other ways to reduce the liability through actions. And at this point, we are evaluating whether we would
take any action on that side. The other way is clearly, generally higher interest rates will close that liability over time.
So, those are the two things that would impact us.
<Q - Timna Beth Tanners>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question is from Tony Rizzuto at Cowen and Company.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Thank you very much. Hi, gentlemen. My first question is on the impact of the Indonesian
relaxation on bauxite exports. How do you see that playing out? And then, I've got another quick question, if I may.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Sure, Tony. Let me talk a little bit about Indonesia and then we can have your second question.
And fortunately, you'll be not too surprised when I say, it really depends on the details that they layout as exactly what
kind of exports they're going to permit. Up till this point, we really haven't seen a policy statement about how they
would implement that new announcement.
And we also don't see any understanding on the part of any of the player that happen to be on the customer side or on
the supplier side. So, right now, I think both sides of the equation are waiting to see exactly how that polity plays out.
If you think about what, what could happen? The fact is Indonesia sits very close to China, and they have been an
important supplier in the past, we think that they will likely be part of the future supply equation going into China, but
at the same time, we also get back to the fact that third-party bauxite market, which is primarily China, is going to grow

significantly on the order of 8% cumulative average rate over the decade starting in 2016.
So, they will have an important impact, but I don't think it pushes us away from our evaluation of the market if there
are real opportunities sitting in bauxite. In 2016 and 2017, Tony, it had been about forging partnerships and looking for
good customers that can value the bauxite in the consistent quality and the consistent delivery that we can provide.
Tony, your next question?
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: All right. Thanks, Roy, for that. We've seen the Midwest premium gaining a little bit of
momentum of late and likely due to the metal shortage that's in the United States. So, one is where do you see this
moving? And then secondly, does this potentially work against the trade case against China from a standpoint of
fabricators and just tightness in metal that's taking shape?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: I think it's an interesting situation that we have today. And you think about the moves in
Midwest premiums and they seem to be pretty closely tied with what's happening on the physical side. And I think
we've talked before about the fact that Midwest premiums and global premiums are much more closely related with the
physical flows of metal.
So, we've seen that premium start to come up a little bit. As is always our policy, we don't necessarily comment on
where we think prices are going to go whether it's on the aluminum or alumina side or on the premium side. However,
we continue to see that the smelting capacity that is operating in the U.S. has fallen pretty dramatically. We continue to
have robust smelters, both -
<A - William F. Oplinger>: And strong demand.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: And strong demand. We continue to produce in Canada. Rio Tinto obviously produces in
Canada as well. It connects back with some of the other questions we've had before about how that all connects to
policy and what happens over these next few critical months.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Okay.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: So, we see a lot of strength in underlying fundamental demand of the products that we sell on
that first value-added basis and we also see a lot of interest in growing that business.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: And the other thing I'd point out, Roy, is just a lot about optionality, right. We don't know
which way the government regulations will go or the view of which way the government go. We have the optionality in
the U.S. We've got some facilities that could be restarted in the case of higher metal prices, but clearly we've got to see
what comes out.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. And I think, just to add one more piece on one of my favorite topics too, the – our
Iceland Fjarðaál [indiscernible] (50:32), just back from my times, way back when I got started with Alcoa. Part of the
attractiveness of Fjarðaál was that you could sell to both North American and to the European markets. It gives us the
flexibility as do other of our plants to sell into the market that's most attractive. So we'll determine that as it becomes
more clear going forward, Tony. Thank you.

The next question is from Justin Bergner at Gabelli & Company.
<Q - Justin Laurence Bergner>: Thank you for taking a quick follow-up. I want to ask you. I mean, some of us have
the view that Alcoa is trading a moderate to meaningful discount to the value of the various businesses you have. Are
you planning in the better environment that you're seeing to consider any actions that might narrow that discount by use
of your cash or otherwise?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: I would never – I wouldn't say anything is off the table, Justin, but we do have a revolving
credit facility that is somewhat restrictive. We're currently at a BB minus credit rating. Clearly, I think, if we're
generating $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion EBITDA, there's no way we should be a BB minus credit but that's for a different
discussion. The priority for cash that I said before – the priorities for cash is grow the business with these high-return
projects and to delever at this point and then beyond that we would determine what to do.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Justin, if I can just add on top of that as well. We're trying to do two things when it comes to
reporting. Number one, we're trying to reduce complexity. It saves us work. It helps us reduce our costs and at the end
of the day makes our lives easier. But number two, we're also trying to be very clear and help our analysts and our
shareholders really understand the nuts and bolts of what's going on inside the company. And we think as outside of
corporate actions that Bill talked about, the more we can talk about how our business works and prove to our
shareholders what we're doing to make the business better, I think that that helps to get the story out there and helps to
show what we can leverage on top of what is just the metals cycle. So we'll be working on that.

long-term, let's say in the next 12 months to 24 months, what will be given a priority? Would you be looking into
reducing your debt, well, more of a pension liability or returning cash to shareholders? And I want to follow-up. I
haven't seen anything on your dividend policy. Is that something that I missed or something you're yet to convey to the
market? Thank you.
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah. Yuriy, thanks for the question. The dividend policy is that we have no dividend
currently. And so, that's where we stand. Beyond further delevering, we would be considering in an excess cash flow
situation, how to return cash to shareholders. And so, when we get to that point, it will be a discussion of around
specifically how we return cash to shareholders, whether that's a special dividend or a share buyback program.

The next question is from Matthew Fields of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Hey, guys. Just wanted to – wondering if you could talk about the trends you saw in the rolled
products side in the quarter? And, I'm a little bit confused about how – it looks like shipments more than doubled in the
quarter, but EBITDA swung negative. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Sure. On rolled products, the reason why shipments have increased so much is because
those sales that were coming out of Tennessee to body stock customers are now coming through Alcoa Corporation.
So, we're tolling metal through Tennessee, and supplying our customers on a body stock size. So, that's why you see
that volumes are up.
In the quarter, on the rolled products business, we had a number of things going on. We did have a mill outage that
affected us towards the end of the quarter, we actually had a breakdown of our reversing mill. So, that was a negative
impact.
We typically see seasonal declines in the fourth quarter, and we saw some small amount of cost increases in the quarter
also. As we move forward through the first quarter, we will start to see some better seasonality I think we've been very
clear the strategy for work is to increase the volume coming out of Warrick and we're focused on doing that. So we're
optimistic that the first quarter will be better than the fourth.
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Let me just talk briefly about the future of our rolling business too. And it comes down to some
pretty simple phrases. Number one, fill the mill and drive capacity, it's about getting that mill filled as Bill commented,
and making sure that once filled we're constantly creeping capacities, so we can continue to fill it.
Number two, to drive margins, look at who we're selling to. The products that we're selling, look to find opportunities
in the market that can help us to better partner with our customers and drive an improved margin environment.
And then number three, and thinking and about how we then drive this business is to reduce our costs, not just the
benefits of volume, but to really find ways to run that business smarter and better and more efficiently. And those are
the three tenants that we've been talking over again and again with our rolled division and really across the entire
portfolio.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Okay, thanks. So, just to be clear about the arrangement from Tennessee. You guys are taking
– Warrick is taking tonnage that was previously going through the Tennessee Mills and its body stock and you're
tolling it for your can sheet customers?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Exactly, so we're running metal through Tennessee, we're tolling it with Arconic and
shipping it to our customers.
<Q - Matthew Fields>: Okay. All right. Thanks, very much.

<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Could you explain the power generation as a proportion of either aluminum metal
production or capacity self-sufficiency, and which presumably it's in the aluminum metal segment and roughly what the
profit contribution is from your electricity generation? You made reference that there would be more in the second half
of the year. Could you explain that to some of us who don't routinely study power plants? You produce the same
number of megawatts every day or could you share it later, would you vary your metal production to some more
power?
<A - William F. Oplinger>: Yeah. So, let me – let me just explain the reporting and then I think, Roy, can jump in and
explain what he meant by the second half comment.
You know John, now we have broken out the segment, so that we've got the – the power segment separate. So, in that
power segment, we've got the Warrick generator and the Brazil hydros, are the preponderance of the – of the assets in
that segment. We've seen significant fluctuation over the years – over the couple years on the Brazil hydros both in
price and to a lesser extent volumes, but it's – we essentially anything that we do as far as Warrick transferring into the
rolling mill has transferred at a market rate, so, there is not a lot of impact on the work side.
Roy, do you want to comment on the second half of the question?
<A - Roy C. Harvey>: Yeah. And I think it's critical to understand that we are very careful not to subsidize one
business at the expense of another, so we separate out the benefits of generating power and electricity into the energy,
the energy portfolio or the energy segment.
My comment specifically about seasonality, is based mostly on what happens down in Brazil and we took a look to see
when we could sell different volumes of that hydro capacity, and our expectations and our ability to look forward on
pricing. And we've found that, we could maximize and to optimize our total profits in Brazilian energy generation by
skewing it essentially ending up selling additional volume in the second half than in the first half.
So, it's just a matter of being smart about where we operate, where we generate electricity and where we see
opportunities in the market and those happen to be in the second half rather than in the first half.
Thank you for the question, John.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Roy Harvey for any
closing remarks.
Roy C. Harvey
Good and thank you. I appreciate everybody listening in. I appreciate the really good questions.
In closing, I just wanted to take a couple of minutes just to go back over familiar territory. And just start off by saying
that we've had a good start and it's been a good two and a half months, although it feels some days like it's been two
weeks and some days it feels like it's been two years. We're enthusiastic about what we can accomplish and the
additional value that we can bring to our businesses and the opportunities that lie ahead, whether in any of the
businesses in which we operate, we're looking at the market in which we play.
And as I said earlier, we're focused. We're trying to be very clear internally and externally about what we're trying to
accomplish and it's simple. It's reducing complexity, looking at every cost that we spend and finding ways to make it

faster and easier and less costly. It's about generating cash, strengthening the balance sheet, ensuring that we are ready
if times turn down, or that we're ready if times get better.
And finally, driving a real returns mentality in every project, in every one of our businesses. And so that when we talk
to each of our shareholders, we can talk about what we're doing to drive returns and to drive earnings and cash to the
bottom line. So, that's what we're doing.
So, thank you very much for your time today. We look forward to additional opportunities to share our progress in the
future. And I wish you all the best and have a great evening. Thank you.
