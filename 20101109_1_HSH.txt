MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Sara Lee's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal 2011. Your lines have
been placed on a listen-only mode. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this
time.
I would now like to turn the call over to Aaron Hoffman, Vice President of Investor Relations for Sara Lee
Corporation. Thank you, Aaron. You may begin.
Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations
Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Sara Lee's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me for today's call
are Marcel Smits, our Interim CEO; CJ Fraleigh, our CEO of our North American Businesses; and Mark Garvey, our
Interim CFO.
Our first quarter 2011 results were released at 6:30 Central Time this morning via a press release that you can find on
our website at saralee.com. If you have any problems accessing the release, please call Jeannie Williams at
630-598-8100. And our 10-Q will be filed no later than Friday, November 12.
To begin, I'll caution you that our remarks this morning contain forward-looking statements about Sara Lee's future
operations, financial performance, and business conditions. These forward-looking statements are based on currently
available competitive, financial and economic data, as well as managements' views and assumptions regarding future
events. Such forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that actual results may

differ from those expressed or implied in these statements. Consequently, I need to caution you not to place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements. We've provided additional information in our current press release and fiscal
2010 Form 10-K that I encourage you to review concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from these forward-looking statements.
This morning, we're providing slides to go along with our remarks. You can find the slides on the webcast portion of
our website in the Investor Relations section. And as a reminder, all adjusted numbers we discuss on today's call
exclude the impact of significant items, contingent sale proceeds, acquisitions, divestitures, and the effects of currency
changes. The release also contains a reconciliation of reported to adjusted numbers.
I'd also like to point out that in the spirit of simplification and continuous improvement, we've changed the presentation
of some of the financial schedules provides with the release. I think you'll find them easy to follow and more
instructive, but we're certainly glad to have any feedback in the future about these tables.
And now let me turn the time over to Marcel.
Marcel H. M. Smits, Executive Vice President and Interim Chief Executive
Officer
Thank you, Aaron, and let me just add my welcome to everybody on today's call. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot
of news to share with you today, so let me just give you a quick perspective on where we are. Firstly, our business is
doing fine. We knew that we were in for a couple of tough quarters, but that overall for the year we'd make another
meaningful step in adjusted operating income. And with the first quarter now behind us, we're confident that we will
deliver the full-year earnings and EPS that we've guided for, and actually on account of our interest burden coming
down and the exchange rates moving favorably, our EPS guidance has come up by $0.04.
Underneath that overall statement of us delivering the guidance, we have some puts and takes of course. In some
segments we're a bit more cautious, and on the corporate expense side we have become more bullish. We have some
challenges ahead of us in terms of pricing through some of the commodity increases we've been confronted with, but
we feel good about our ability to increasingly do so. And then, of course, we have today announced that we have
reached an agreement to sell our North American fresh bakery operations to Grupo Bimbo.
So what we'll do on the call, if you allow us, is the following. I will first talk you through the key elements of the
bakery transaction. CJ will then talk to you about the first quarter results, and then lastly, Mark will take you through
the financials and show how it all hangs together in terms of the updated guidance. I'm going to try and keep this real
short so as to leave enough time for questions that you will no doubt have.
Now let's first dive into our agreement to sell our North American fresh bakery operations to Grupo Bimbo. We view
this as a very good deal for both Sara Lee and Grupo Bimbo. From our perspective, to start there, we're able to lock in
very good value for our shareholders, and at the same time we're freeing up resources to increase our investment behind
our two core growth categories, protein and coffee.
And you will of course wonder if investment also means acquisitions, and as far as we're concerned, yes it does. And
rest assured that we're going to be really disciplined about it, as we've been around all matters of our shareholders'
money. But we do see substantial opportunity for both organic investment and growth through acquisition in our core
categories. We've been very clear in recent years that these are categories where we hold real, competitive, sustainable
advantage, and therefore we can truly win in these categories and create value for our shareholders. And at the same
time for the great employees in our North American fresh bakery operations, we're excited that they are also going to
be part of a winning team.
Now let me take you through the specifics of the transaction. Sara Lee will receive 925 million of cash, and Grupo
Bimbo will assume 34 million of debt. That adds up to the 959 million that you've seen as a top line figure. Bimbo will
also assume all employee-related commitments, including pension liabilities. The purchase price is greater than book

value, meaning that there is no write-down. However, the tax basis remains high enough to say that we're comfortable
that there are not going to be any taxes paid on this transaction. The transaction also includes a small piece of our
foodservice bakery business, which is in the North American food service segment.
Now let me go through the details about how we will manage the powerful Sara Lee brand in this transaction. First, we
retain the right to sell Sara Lee branded frozen desserts and protein products like sliced deli meats. Grupo Bimbo has
the rights to the brand in the fresh baked goods – sorry – in the fresh baked good – baked good category globally, with
the exception of Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, where we still have business.
Most importantly, both sides are committed to maintaining and developing the very strong brand equity that has been
built up in the Sara Lee name over many decades. We both have a vested interest in doing so, and I have no doubt it
will be a good relationship.
Let me wrap up with a few financial considerations. As you will have seen in today's release, the segment was not
treated as discontinued in our first quarter results, but we will be doing that starting with the first – or with the second
fiscal quarter. Our guidance today consequently also reflects North American fresh bakery as part of continuing
operations. In the near future, we will provide you with restatements of historic results that move this business into
discontinued operations. At the same time, we will then provide you with updated guidance reflecting the transaction.
Meanwhile of course we have work to do, and we will use this transaction as an opportunity to look at further cost
reductions in our corporate center.
And now let me also anticipate a likely question, at this time we're not changing the parameters of our capital plans, but
this transaction does provide an opportunity to look at accelerating our buyback. And as you will probably recall, the
plan was to complete the buyback by the end of calendar '13, and we will accelerate that to be completed before the end
of fiscal '12.
So with the discussion of that transaction out of the way, let me just spend a few minutes reviewing where we stand
with the household and body care divestiture. First, let me say that we're very pleased with the substantial progress that
we've made. It's not apparent on the outside, we realize of course, how uniquely complex this series of transactions is.
And it's a testament to the teams working on these deals that they've worked through the complexity and thus far
delivered very positive outcomes, and meanwhile of course, the business continues to do pretty well.
To date, we have announced four transactions. As you can see, the sale of our share of the Indian Insecticides joint
venture and the sale of Air Care have both been closed. Meanwhile, we're working through the regulatory approvals for
a binding offer to sell body care to Unilever for 1.275 billion, or about $1.7 billion at our hedged euro/dollar rate of
$1.35. We expect the review of this transaction by the EU to be completed in late November, and as you may have seen
last week, Thursday, Unilever continues to express confidence in the transaction and still targets closing by the end of
the calendar year.
The fourth announced transaction is the sale of our non-Indian insecticides business to SC Johnson for €153 million,
which is expected to close by the end of this calendar year. We are actively negotiating to sell the remaining businesses,
which include shoe care and our Asia-Pacific cleaning products business, and we're pleased with how the businesses –
with how the process is progressing, and meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, these two businesses continue to do well.
Let me remind you about what we've said about the use of H&BC proceed debt. We've committed to buying back 2.5
to 3 billion of stock over a two- to three-year time horizon. We're well on our way to accomplishing that goal, having
repurchased 500 million through an accelerated share repurchase in fiscal 2010, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2011,
we repurchased another 373 million of stock, retiring an additional 24 million shares.
This positions us well to realize the commitment of repurchasing a total of 1 to 1.5 billion of stock this fiscal year. The
new element as of today is that the closing of the fresh bakery disposition puts us in a position to accelerate the
buyback to be completed before the end of fiscal '12. Meanwhile on October 28 at our annual meeting, our Board
raised the annual dividend to $0.46 per share, and the dividend policy and dividend amount will not change as a result
of the divestiture announced today.

During the first quarter, we also refinanced 800 million of debt early to take advantage of the extremely low interest
rates that are available at the moment. As a result, we expect to see a reduction in net interest expense of about 20
million annually, and in retiring this debt early, we have extinguishment costs of around $55 million, of which 30
million falls in the first quarter and the remainder in the second quarter.
Now I'd like to turn over the call to CJ Fraleigh, who will take you through more details about our operating
performance in the first quarter. CJ?
Christopher J. (CJ) Fraleigh, Executive Vice President and Chief Executive
Officer – North America
Thanks, Marcel. Good morning, everyone. It really is a great time to be at Sara Lee, when we're realizing true value for
our shareholders, both through transactions and by meeting our operating performance commitments. Let's start by
reminding you what we said about fiscal 2011 before the year started.
We think it's useful to keep some of these facts in mind as we talk about our business performance. We did say we
would drive strong top line performance in our highest-margin segments, North American retail and international
beverage, which we did in the first quarter. We noted that earnings for the year would be back-end loaded as we lapped
favorable pricing to commodity costs in the first half of last year.
We continue to expect that trend to reverse in the second half of this year. We expressed confidence that pricing would
take hold and offset commodity costs by the end of the year. What has changed since August, when we gave you that
guidance is that commodities have increased further. In particular coffee prices are now at a 13-year high. With four
months of the year having passed, we can be more precise about how we see the year playing out, and we can provide a
modest update on commodities and pricing.
Based on current commodity prices, we believe that we will mitigate the majority of the higher costs in fiscal '11.
While the first quarter was a significant net negative, we expect the remaining three quarters to show much better price
to recovery trends. We committed to further increases in MAP spending after a nice bump in fiscal '10. In the first
quarter MAP was up $13 million or about 18%. And corporate costs are expected to decline this year, and we've seen
early signs of that as well.
Let's turn to adjusted sales for each segment. First we should point out the simple calculation we've included on the
right-hand side of this slide. Our two largest segments, which Marcel has already talked about being the primary drivers
of operating performance, make up more than 55% of our sales and 80% of our operating segment income. Those
figures are calculated with North American fresh bakery in the total. The implication of course is that once the bakery,
the business is sold, these two growth segments will be the vast majority of the company, and they are performing very
well.
We've made substantial investments in both retail and beverage, and we're seeing the payoff with adjusted sales up
more than 7% in retail and nearly 5% in beverage. We're supporting strong innovation, like Jimmy Dean Jimmy D's,
L'OR Espresso capsules, and many others with incremental marketing investment. In the quarter our retail marketing
investment was up almost 38%, while beverage MAP increased 10%. The combination of these efforts is helping us
drive the growth that you see here on this slide.
A few important points about the other segments. We cautioned that North American foodservice would see sales and
volumes decline as a result of losing a large and extremely low-margin bakery account. We're very comfortable that we
made the right decision and will see the benefit of the bottom line in this important segment as the year progresses.
However, you should expect to see both sales and volume decline as we lap this impact this year.
The decline in our bakery segment reflects the ongoing category trade-down and weakness in a highly competitive
market. The conclusion from this chart is straightforward. We're driving sales in our strongest segments, and that leads
to an increase in total adjusted sales.

Let's spend a minute of looking at the components of that sales growth. For further reference, you can find a complete
sales bridge for the company in each segment in our earnings release. As you'd expect, we're seeing positive pricing as
we pass through higher commodity costs. And we're pleased to see strong mix contributions as we drive sales in higher
margin products, as well as from exiting low-margin businesses like the foodservice account I just mentioned.
On the surface, volume doesn't look compelling at negative 2%. However, foodservice was down more than 17% as a
result of the lost account, while both bakery segments saw small declines. Positively, retail and beverage, as expected,
drove volume. Please note that our North American retail and total volumes now exclude our commodity hog sales, as
we near the end of our contracts for this non-core business.
Let's move on to adjusted operating segment income, or OSI. We had planned for a down quarter after a very strong
performance a year ago. Another portion of the decline was the increase in commodities that occurred after we
announced our recent price increases. As I just mentioned, we are confident the additional price increases we have
taken and put in the marketplace already will mitigate commodity inflation for the full year and allow us to achieve
total operating results that we guided for.
We'd also remind you that looking back to fiscal '09, we are flat to up in the first quarter in most segments. This is true
in spite of significant commodity price swings and strategic investments. A few additional items to further highlight
this, while protein prices have soared, North American retail saw a $19 million decline in adjusted OSI, compared to a
$29 million increase in fiscal '10. Fully 10 million of this year's decline was related to incremental MAP. In addition we
had $7 million of incremental expenses related to IT initiatives in the final phase of our new, state of the art Kansas
City meat-slicing facility. We feel very good about how we've weathered the commodity situation thus far and expect it
only to get better.
For international beverage, $3 million of the decline there was from incremental MAP. At the same time,
mark-to-market adjustments related to unrealized currency hedges associated with the purchase of raw materials
resulted in a $31 million incremental loss in the quarter. Taken together, these factors account for significantly more
than the segment's $24 million decline. Again, in spite of commodity headwinds, the underlying business is doing quite
well. Let me remind you that when we provided this guidance in August, Arabica coffee prices were at about $1.75 per
pound. Today they're over $2, surging to unexpected heights.
On the other segments, let's simply say that the drop in OSI for North American fresh bakery was larger than we had
anticipated, driven by a lag in targeted pricing adjustments that were successfully made in other segments. Keep in
mind that since our last earnings call, wheat prices have risen almost 7%. Positively though, we've now gained share,
and we've recovered important private-label business, all of which will help us as we move forward. But it came at a
price which was higher than we would've liked. We see that the market – we see the marketplace changing, though
with all participants now pushing through a recovery of increased raw material pricing, hence our outlook to recover
the lost ground in operating income.
Let's take a look at operating income and the impact of corporate costs. As you can see on this chart, corporate
expenses on an adjusted basis were down $28 million in the quarter, reflecting ongoing project accelerate efforts and an
intense focus on cost management. Corporate costs are expected to decline about $50 million for the full year.
Having just mentioned Project Accelerate, let's spend a minute updating you on the critical program. In the quarter,
every one of our segments achieved cost savings and productivity gains. We're confident that the program will deliver
350 to $400 million in annualized savings by the end of fiscal '12, after incurring around $300 million in charges
related to this project.
Please keep in mind that these figures relate only to continuing operations and still include North American fresh
bakery. In the quarter, savings from continuing operations were $29 million. We currently expect fiscal '11 incremental
benefits to be 90 to 110 million. And as we've indicated at the launch of Project Accelerate, the charges would be
front-end loaded, and they've been about $250 million or 85% taken in the first two years. We're very pleased with the
significant benefits we're achieving, the rapid pace at which they're being realized, and the positive outlook that this
gives us for the full year.

At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Garvey, who will discuss some of the corporate results and guidance.
Mark?
Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, CJ. Let me add my welcome to everyone. Picking up where CJ left off, moving down the P&L from sales to
operating segment income to operating income, let's look at adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations.
We have the disclosure of earnings per share for the total company, including the discontinued business, in our press
release. For this presentation, I'll focus on the continuing business. As a reminder, the difference between reported and
adjusted earnings per share is first the impact of significant items.
We continue to see charges related to Project Accelerate in this quarter, though they were at a lower level than the first
quarter of fiscal '10. In addition, as Marcel discussed, we incurred debt extinguishment costs associated with the early
redemption of our September 2011 6.25% notes. The other difference is the impact of the contingent payments from the
sale of a tobacco business more than 10 years ago.
We received an annual tax prepayment over a seven-year period, and in fiscal '10 the final payment was received. As
such, you can see that we had the benefit in the first quarter last year but not this year. That leaves us with adjusted
earnings per share of $0.13, which was down $0.04 per share, primarily as a result of the lower operating segment
income, which included a mark-to-market currency loss of $31 million in international beverage, as CJ has just
discussed. In our view, we are well positioned to achieve strong full-year earnings growth.
Let me take you through a few of these items. First, as we've said, we expect solid top line growth in our
highest-margin segments, North America retail and international beverage. While we continue to see good
improvement for the total company, we have seen a shift in the sources of improvement that are helping to offset
slightly weaker performance in a few segments.
First, we continue to expect North American retail and foodservice to see operating segment income increases.
International beverage was previously expected to be flat to down. We now anticipate that it will be down, as MAP
investments, household and body care, stranded overhead, and higher coffee costs will offset good underlying business
improvement.
And as CJ mentioned, Arabica prices are now over $2 and are at 13-year highs. And we expect both bakery segments to
be about flat with last year. By next quarter the North American bakery business will be reported as a discontinued
operation, so we can put that aside for the moment. In international bakery, conditions in our largest market, Spain,
continue to be challenging, offsetting fundamental improvements we are making to the business model.
As discussed, corporate expense is expected to be about $50 million lower this year, compared to fiscal '10,
representing a solid reduction and a helpful earnings tailwind. Project Accelerate benefits should be robust again,
generating incremental savings of 90 to $110 million this fiscal year. And of course we will continue to reduce the
share count over the course of the year.
Taken together then, this gives us great confidence that we will achieve our earnings per share guidance for continuing
operations, which you see on this page. We have raised the guidance on both the high and low end to reflect favorable
currency movements and the lower net interest expense. As we look at the year, we are comfortable that regardless of
commodity movements and pricing absence, we are in a position to deliver full-year earnings per share results within
that range.
Clearly there are puts and takes, but we have taken appropriate views of the situation and remain confident in our
guidance. Just as currency and commodities have an impact on earnings, they also are having a positive effect on sales,
and we are raising our guidance by $300 million to reflect some new assumptions on pricing and currency. And finally,
cash from operations.

The decline we saw in the first quarter can be attributed to, firstly the lower operating results. After that, higher tax and
pension payments net of pension expense movements compared to the year-ago quarter resulted in about a $90 million
variance for Q1. At the same time, working capital is generally a use of cash in the first quarter, and this period was no
different. However, it's important to note that an increase in inventory evaluations this quarter because of higher
commodity prices was also absorbed, and we are pleased that we could hold historical trends in the face of this
increase.
Finally, I remind you that we see cash from operations falling by several hundred million dollars this year as we pay
more taxes on household and body care transactions, have higher cash restructuring repayments, and derive less income
from our discontinued operations as the transactions close. That said, our guidance for cash from operations remains
unchanged at 600 to $700 million.
With that, let me turn the time back to Marcel for some concluding remarks. Marcel?
Marcel H. M. Smits, Interim Chief Executive Officer
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to round it off with two slides. First, how do we feel about the first quarter and the
outlook for 2011? The first thing to say is we're confident that we can deliver on the earnings commitments that we've
given you today. We had some currency and interest tailwinds, and that has allowed us to raise the full-year guidance,
but underneath that, we're very confident that we can deliver what we promised you at the outset of the year.
It's clear that operationally, we have quite a bit of heavy lifting to do in the quarters to come. We have to recover more
of the commodity increases, and we're not out of the woodworks yet. Further price increases are going to have to be put
through, and that's not without risk, but given what we've done in the first quarter, we are optimistic.
Meanwhile then, we're pleased to see the investments and innovation in protein and coffee are starting to deliver more
visibility of growth in our top line. And the increased top line guidance for the company as a whole is indicative of our
guidance – or of our confidence levels here.
Meanwhile, the capital plans are coming along nicely. We're confident that the Unilever deal will close and that that
will open the route to buy backs in line with the commitments that we've given you. And, lest it go unnoticed, the
increase in dividend is yet another milestone on the delivery of attractive shareholder returns.
And then, lastly, of course, the Fresh Bakery disposition is a game-changing event. It eliminates risks and allows us to
put all of our efforts behind categories where we have a sustainable point of differentiation and an established track
record of winning. In fact, we did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation, and the impact of this transaction is that we
will have a double-digit operating margin as a company as a whole. So we're now going to be a double-digit operating
company, and we think we have a pretty good story to tell about our growth prospects.
And let me just take you through the question that you no doubt have, so where does Sara Lee go from here? Well, CJ
and I, we've had quite a bit of time to think about that, as you can imagine. So here's how we view the future and how
we would like to drive value. You may notice that the title of this slide is the same as our annual report, and that is for
good reason.
We are confident that Sara Lee is indeed a simpler, stronger and a better company. We have two large advantage
positions in attractive categories and in these two categories, ladies and gentlemen, Sara Lee has consistently invested.
We have invested to achieve superior capabilities. We have invested in better quality manufacturing assets. And we
have invested in filling a pipeline of innovation.
We have become a better company. And in both of these categories, we have an aspiration to grow faster. We want to
become stronger. Part of that wanting to grow faster is just simply the arithmetical outcome of the process of pruning
less attractive subcategories, now coming to an end.
Sales for our key core protein brands in the U.S. have grown 31% over the last four years, and those three brands now
make up 70% of our retail segments. They have innovation lined up and the horsepower to continue to grow, and they

In coffee, meanwhile, innovation and geography are the key words. We have a pipeline with exciting new products.
And you have played back to us that you thought the L'OR capsules were an exciting initiative, and we thought that's
true. And let me just note that it has achieved 3% share of the overall French coffee market in a mere six months. But
we're only just beginning.
First of all, there are more geographies to play with, or to play for with the new products that you've already seen, and
we are going to play for new geographies, and we will do so soon, though in our existing markets you should assume
that you will see L'OR capsules turning up within the near future. And then there are more new and exciting
innovations coming. And we will pursue both aggressively.
Over and above that, yes, we would like to pursue a buy and build strategy, and rest assured, we will be disciplined
about it, and we will give a lot of consideration to whether or not our shareholders get good value upside. But without
wanting to sound presumptuous, we actually believe that we have a case to make to you about being the better owner
for a number of businesses that we would like to add to our portfolio.
So we're going to be disciplined about it. We're not going to do anything stupid, but we're going to give it a try. And
meanwhile, you should assume that we are continuing to manage our costs down. By all measures, Project Accelerate
has already been a success, and there are hundreds of millions of dollars more to come.
There's more work to do in rightsizing our corporate center and we are pleased to see the results starting to come
through in this first quarter. And then, of course, we want to have absolutely impeccable credentials in driving value for
our shareholders. You've seen the buyback plans, the increasing dividend, the effort to reduce the working capital, the
effort to reduce our pension exposure, the refinancing of our balance sheet, which takes away refinancing risk and
which lowers our interest expense.
And then lastly, you've seen our efforts to manage our tax well. It is all geared towards making you as a shareholder get
the full benefit of our business performance uplift. So in short, CJ and I, and with us all of the members of the senior
management team of Sara Lee, we look at the future with confidence, confidence that together with all the great people
in our company, we're actually onto something really exciting.
That is my closing remark. And I will be very happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Judy Hong. And please state your company name.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, good morning, guys. Jason English here with Goldman Sachs. First, congratulations on
finding a suitor for the bread business. And the proceeds look to be fairly reasonable, so congratulations on that.
Thinking of the bread business, should we be aware of any stranded costs our residual liabilities such as pensions,
etcetera, that may be left with Sara Lee?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Thank you Jason for that question. There will be some stranded costs in our corporate overhead,
so we're going to have to chase that out, because some of the people that we have in the corporate center actually work
either a large proportion of their time or predominately for the bakery business, so there's some work to be done there.
That's one side. The other side of your question was -
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Well, I think you asked about employee obligations. I think.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Oh yes, sorry, employee obligations. No, all employee obligations in relation to the bakery
business are going to go to the buyer.

<Q - Jason English>: Good, good. Thank you. Turning back to continuing operations, what's left of the business,
obviously a little bit of an inflation squeeze, pricing lagging commodities? You guys clearly feel fairly optimistic about
the ability to catch up with that. How long do you think it will take to catch up? And then building on that, as you guys
have taken it sounds like incremental pricing to what you announced previously, what are you seeing with competitive
dynamics in terms of how rapidly some of your competitors are following or whether or not they're leading and I guess
the general rationality of the competitive playing field out there?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Yes. We have taken incremental pricing. We believe our significant price increases in
North America are in the marketplace, and the general reaction has been most of our key competitors are following.
There's some variations on specific categories, but based on what we've seen, pleasantly surprised in a few categories.
Other categories are a little lagging, but in aggregate in North America and in aggregate really for the whole company,
we felt confident enough to make that statement that we thought on balance for the full year that we would be able to
mitigate enough of the costs and deliver our earnings commitment.
<Q - Jason English>: That is indeed encouraging. One last question, then I'll pass it on. You're talking about your
efficiency initiatives and savings those are going to deliver. At the same time, your business is getting smaller. It's
going to leave some stranded costs, not just from fresh bakery but from HBC. As I think about the costs related to your
HBC business, are all those costs currently loaded in disco ops, or is there risk of some costs, once that business has
shrunk to zero, flowing back up into the, what's currently classified as continuing ops?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Hi Jason. It's Mark. No, all those costs are not loaded in
discontinued ops. I think what we've said, about 25 to $30 million of a headwind for us on stranded overhead costs in
international, which we're working down, and we expect to substantially have those worked down by fiscal '12.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes. That's in 2007?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Yes.
<A - Marcel Smits>: And we've promised our shareholders that we won't talk about it anymore in '12 because by that
time it will become a bit of a stale excuse.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: So it's a bit of a headwind, in international beverage .
<Q - Jason English>: But those costs are currently – sorry. Those costs are currently in the continuing ops numbers
you're giving us?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct. And most of those appear in the international
beverage segment.
<Q - Jason English>: Great.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Jason, let me just add one thing in. We have on earlier occasions highlighted that we have some
tailwind in 2012 from a couple of items. One is less amortization, and the other item that we've called out is that some
of those stranded costs – or most of those stranded costs will have to disappear in 2012.
<Q - Jason English>: Very good. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Ramey. And please state your company name.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Hi. It's D.A. Davidson. Thanks. Let's see, a couple of questions. Mark, you and I were there when
the bakery business was bought for 3.2 billion, so you and I both have some explaining to do I guess. But as I look at
the numbers, I'm thinking that what you're selling today amounts to about 60% of what was purchased in 2001. And

you took, I think, a $900 million impairment charge at some point along the way. Is that, rough and round, about right?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: I think what you're referring to are the sales numbers. I think,
Tim, in terms of the difference between the North America bakery versus of course the international bakery business.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: I'm actually thinking about it from an EBIT perspective. But we can talk about sales too.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah, I think of that more as a sales number, and from an
impairment perspective, clearly we've taken a significant impairment in the international business over the last number
of years as well.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Yes, Tim, it's Aaron. My guess is that the sales numbers, probably about
two-thirds was in the fresh baking piece, and then about one-third in refrigerated dough and international businesses.
And from a profitability standpoint, my suspicion – and without looking, I didn't check the numbers for everybody –
but that's probably inverted, that at least two-thirds of the profit was in dough and in international. As you recall, the
international business historically at certain points had a 10, 11% ROS. So significantly higher margins and profit
profiles in the fresh side. So we sold a lot of the sales today but actually not a lot of the acquired profits.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Tim, we have been focusing very much on what this does for our capital plans. We haven't
looked back all that much. Let me just say that we're pleased to hear that you are volunteering to take your fair share of
the explanations that have to be done if it comes to that. So that's very kind of you. We will take that into consideration.
Thank you.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: I'm dragging Mark with me.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: I appreciate that, Tim. Thank you.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Second, let's see – you don't give segment guidance, but I think you did give guidance earlier that
you thought North American retail margins would be up in 2011 versus 2010. We didn't get a great margin
performance in the 1Q, and fourth quarter wasn't all that great either. Would you still make that case? Or is that too
aggressive for 2011 at this point?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Tim, we said that our operating profit would be up, and there'd probably be a small
corresponding increase in margins, and we're still optimistic and confident about the business on a full-year basis.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: But not necessarily for up margins?
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: No, no. For up margins.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: No, operating income and margins.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Dollars and margins.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Dollars and margins.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Okay. That's impressive.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Yes, I think you'll see the margin won't be huge, because it will be
compressed mathematically by the incremental pricing that needs to be taken to offset some of the commodities. But I
think it is impressive in the fact that we're able to do that in spite of that mathematical move.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: And would we attribute that mostly to the lack of the commodity business in the '11 numbers and
the sliced meats business? Or can you just – can you bullet point that in any way?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: That's a contributor, but I'd say it's secondary to the pretty aggressive top line growth,
particularly around the higher margin Hillshire Farm and Jimmy Dean businesses. We just have that – the mix in of, as
Marcel pointed out, they're – along with Ball Park, they're 70% of our sales. Their margins are a lot higher than they
were, and they're driving a lot of the growth. So just the way the math mixes in, that's the biggest driver.

<Q - Tim Ramey>: Okay. And then just the guidance you gave today includes bakery, which I understand you can't
really scramble to exclude it in a one-day period, but is it fair to say that guidance probably comes down based on
moving bakery to a discontinued ops line but taking into account the proceeds?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes, Tim. That'll be the arithmetical outcome there because we've guided – we've given an
adjusted view on where we think the operating income from the segment is going to be. We've said it's going to be flat
relative to last year, so you can work out how much we're going to take out. So in terms of EPS for continuing
operations, yes, they'll come down a bit. On the other hand, of course, very important to remember that we've got
another billion of proceeds coming in, and as a result of that, we are in a position to accelerate the buyback, and
hopefully that doesn't get lost on people either. So we feel pretty good about our trajectory in terms of EPS for this
year, next year and the year thereafter.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Okay, thanks so much.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Thank you,
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews. Please state your company name.
<Q - Jaclyn Inglesby>: Hi. This is Jackie Inglesby, Morgan Stanley, on for Vincent. Just had a question on elasticity,
particularly, given that you sound like you're expecting to take some more pricing than you had previously thought.
Sort of wondering how elasticity is progressing relative to your models and what you had initially expected?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Yes, our models continue to get better year-on-year and we actually feel great in terms
of where we're positioned versus key competitors, which is probably why we find ourselves leading a lot of the
initiatives. And we would expect, obviously with prices coming up, the rate of our volume growth and share growth,
which has been quite substantial recently, would slow down, but we still feel we can hold our own from a competitive
standpoint, just not – we wouldn't see quite the share growth and volume growth that we've seen very recently.
<Q - Jaclyn Inglesby>: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up – I'm sorry if I missed it. I know last quarter you'd
talked about your basket of input being up 15%. What's that percentage now?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: We would say it's around 20, 21% right now, when you take
account of what Arabica has done, particularly over the last year. But again, as I mentioned at the last quarter, that's a
basket. It doesn't necessarily represent that's our actual cost. But if you look at the commodities we play in, on average
they're up about 21%.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Yes. Let me offer one point of clarification on that, because after the last
quarter's call, I think there's a little confusion. That number, to reiterate what Mark said, that is based on market prices.
That is not what – the price that we will pay necessarily.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Correct.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: We have hedging in place. We have strategic contracts in place. There are
a lot of offsetting factors. While it will certainly be an incremental cost over the course of the year, the 21% is
directional for people. It is not meant to be the exact amount by which our commodity costs will go up.
<Q - Jaclyn Inglesby>: Okay, thanks. And just, sorry, one last question. When is it that you expect that pricing is
going to cover commodity cost inflation? I know you said that there will be less kind of a spread as you go forward, but
what quarter is that that you're predicting?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Well, we have made a fairly precise statement about it and I just need to look it up. But I think
what we've said is increasingly as the year unfolds, we expect that we will recover commodity increases with pricing.

Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Lazar. And please state your company name.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Barclays Capital. Good morning.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Good morning.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: First just a very quick one, in the net sales bridge table, you've given us by segment, as you
usually do, unit volume, mix, price. And then there's a column that says other, which is not that sizable for most of the
segments, but it is for international bakery. And I'm just curious what that is. I don't think I've seen that one before.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: You know, Andrew, let me get back to you offline. Apologize about that.
That is a big number. I think it's probably – it's an anomaly in the quarter, and I need to go back. And I should know
that, and I don't and I apologize.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: No problem.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: I'll get back to you about that straightaway after the call. It's a good
observation.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: No problem. The other column in general, is that sort of like miscellaneous things that impacted
sales growth in addition to volume mix and price? Or is it – I'm just curious even what that category or that column
even represents.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Yes, it's typically sort of anomalous types of moving parts that flow
through the segments. Most notably though in the North American retail segment, the lingering hog commodity sales
that we've been exiting now live in that other category. So that's where you would find those.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes. And in our international beverage, that's where the Brazilian export business lives.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Yes, we have a -
<A - Marcel Smits>: The exports and we have some sales from Brazil being exported through – to Europe. That
obviously has nothing to do with our consumer-facing business, so we've put that in there. And the 3.9 on international
bakery, yes, I should have seen that as well, and I'm breaking my brains as to what it is.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Yes. We may even get the answer while we're still on the call, and if so,
we'll go ahead and answer that to the whole group.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: No problem, no problem. Thank you. And then just want to pick up on the elasticity question a
little bit. You know in a way it's kind of an interesting case study, because you had to put into place a lot of pricing a
couple of years ago to combat the cost inflation, sort of like you're doing now. But you obviously invested behind those
brands in North American retail quite dramatically over the last couple of years too and have innovated and what have
you, so I'm curious, CJ, if you're seeing when you compare like some of the – your models and some of the elasticity
that you're seeing this time versus what you may have seen last time, is there anything you can read or glean out of that
about the health of those brands now relative to then? Or is that too difficult to do?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Yes, good question. There's a couple of things we can look at it. We do have models in
place, and we also separately, as an input to that model, measure our brand health. So the impact from stronger

awareness and the passion that consumers have link – the brand health measures are stronger now in those big three
brands than they were a couple of years ago, and we can attribute some of our volume growth to the incremental
marketing spend that we saw in the back half of last year and the front half of this year. So has an impact and offsets
some of the pricing increases that we've taken and will take.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. And that shows through. You're seeing that show through a little bit in elasticity perhaps
this time versus last time?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Okay, thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Alexia Howard. And please state your company name.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: Good morning. Yes, it's Sanford Bernstein. Hi, everyone.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: Hi, Alexia.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: I guess two related questions. I'm curious about what you're seeing in terms of the general
environment in Europe and I'm thinking particularly for the international beverage business. It seems as though you
managed to get – pricing was up and volumes were up, but you've got a number of higher-priced products over there,
sort of high-margin products. So I was curious to see that business being so strong this time. So if you could comment
on that. Similarly with the food service environment here in the U.S., I know that your business is challenged just
because of the loss of those customer accounts, but are you seeing any light at the end of the tunnel? We've started to
see some comparables from the restaurants coming through a bit more strongly.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes, let me just first talk about the European business. In Europe we're going through very big
price increases on the coffee side. You should not take away that this is a sort of an easy ride. We've had some real
resistance, in particular in a key market in The Netherlands. It's published in The Netherlands. Now people read about
it in Dutch newspapers. But the good news is that it's – you can't argue that something really fundamental has happened
with our raw material costs, and therefore everybody in the competitive scene seems to be coming along, but there are a
fair amount of battles being fought across Europe.
On a go-forward basis there's more work to be done, and that's why we've said we've got more heavy lifting to be done
and we're not out of the woodworks yet. And that's also not entirely without risk. Given the fact that the first quarter
we're pretty okay with where the pricing that we've put through, so we're optimistic, but we're not sitting here saying,
oh, that's going to be an easy ride. And coffee prices are at a 15-year high, and they're going way beyond what anybody
anticipated. So we're optimistic. We are investing in the business. What's helping of course tremendously is all of the
innovation coming through, but this is not sort of a slam-dunk easy ride.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: And Alexia, on food service, I want to be careful not to overstate this, but we are seeing
positive signs of life. So the general comps of our foodservice customers are either less negative or in some cases
turning positive. So I wouldn't call it a tailwind yet, but I'd say that the headwind has pretty much died down, and that
segment looks better than – sorry, the businesses, the customers that we're selling into, look more positive than they
have in the past two and a half years.
<Q - Alexia Howard>: That's great, thank you so much. I'll pass it on.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: And actually can we stop there for a moment? Mark? We have the answer
on Andrew's question about the 'other' item in international bakery.

<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. The other item relates to – it's actually a non-core sale
element. As part of our restructuring in international bakery, we sold some machineries and lines, across those lines
specifically, and that appears in that number. So it's a non-core, non-volume item.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Makes perfect sense why you'd put it in the other, when you hear that. That's good.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: So we'll take the next question, please.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our next question is from Robert Moskow. And please state your company name.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. Credit Suisse. Had a question about all the pricing you're taking in coffee in
Europe. Is private label raising price too? Specifically in The Netherlands, I think you did call that out a while ago that
that's where the battle is with private label. Have you been monitoring price gaps in your multiple markets? And what
are they now?
<A - Marcel Smits>: The answer on – the details of the second part of your question, I wouldn't know, but I can tell
you that private label across Europe is coming up, also in The Netherlands. And what we're seeing is that not
everybody immediately reflects all of the commodity price increases that are coming through. So we're anticipating that
people will take it in steps. We try and be clear as to where we need to go, so we have, in a number of instances, taken
bigger leaps than what we've seen private label do, but we're cautiously optimistic that private label will have to follow
suit.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay.
<A - Marcel Smits>: In terms of the price gaps, I don't have that here at the top of my fingers though, Robert. I'd have
to come back to you on that.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. And then a follow-up question. Starbucks has been in the news a lot lately about their
intentions in coffee, and it looks like they'll be making more of a push internationally in the grocery channel. Have you
done any work on what the implications of that might be for your business? What markets might they try to enter? And
would you ever consider – do you think that they would ever need some kind of distribution marketing arm in Europe,
or maybe given what's happened with Kraft, that's just not possible?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: I don't think we would comment on the specifics there. I would say that we feel we have
really strong market positions where we're based right now, and we feel confident about our brand strength relative to
any competitor that would come in there. I mean it's the nature of what we're doing, and in a core market like The
Netherlands, we've been dealing with competitors for 250 years. So, of course, we take any competitor very seriously,
but to Marcel's earlier point before, with the innovation we have, we feel good that well maintain our strong position.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Ramey. And please state your company name.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Still D.A. Davidson. Marcel, just a question on one of the comments you made. You said you have
some tailwinds in 2011 with less amortization. I was thinking that was primarily a result of the fresh bakery business.
And if so, is that not really so much of a tailwind, given that that business will be gone?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Yes, Tim. You're right. This is '12, we're at fiscal '12, where we have some tailwind. On the
amortization, that is indeed – there's a fair chunk of that which is related to the bakery business, but there is also a fair
chunk of that which relates to the implementation of the first round of SAP here in North America, which will fall out

in '12. So it's not that the entirety of that tailwind relates to bakery.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Actually almost split evenly 50/50 between IT and EarthGrains-related amortization.
And keep in mind, again, that we're not selling the entirety of what we bought in the EarthGrains transaction. So even a
portion of that other 50% will stay – will be an opportunity for us to reduce on amortization.
<A - Marcel Smits>: But Tim's absolute right, and what we need to do when we give you an updated guidance for
2011, which will reflect the fresh bakery business under discontinued operation, then we'll make some statements
around what we see for fiscal 2012 relative to what we saw earlier. So we'll update both of those pieces of information.
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Okay. And then just to call out my partner in crime a little bit, Mark, you mentioned you're
confident in EPS growth. But I assume that's versus $0.78 restated for last year. I mean, it's really not going to be a year
of growth for Sara Lee, is it?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: It was versus the – yes, it's versus last year restated, confident
in that. I'm not sure, Tim, if you're referring to when you take out the bakery, what the difference is going to be, but if
you go from $0.76 I think, if you exclude the 53rd week, to between 92 to 99, we believe that's a very healthy growth
for the year.
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: And even if you take out the roughly 60 million that we're guiding for on the fresh
bakery, that would be about $0.06 a share, give or take, if we were to hit that 60 million.
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: That's correct.
<A - Marcel Smits>: And Tim, we have focused everything on continuing operations though because the guidance for
our H&BC business is very much the – how many cents per share that comes out of that is dependent upon when we
close. So that's a pretty tough number to pin down. I think the one thing that we haven't emphasized a lot on this call,
but it's worthwhile calling out, and that's that businesses is actually doing pretty well. So that – the HBC business is
continuing to do pretty well, and that gives us a bit of uplift on that side of the guidance as well. But we don't focus too
much on it. We focus more on what's the cash that we're getting out of that business? When is it coming in? When can
we turn that into reducing our share count?
<Q - Tim Ramey>: Thank you.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question is from Eric Serotta. And please state your company name.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Wells Fargo Securities. I apologize if you answered this already or addressed it in some of the
prepared remarks. I joined the call late. But did you quantify what the stranded or residual costs are related to the sale
of the North American fresh bakery business? And could you give any timeframe as to how long it should take to
eliminate those residual costs?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Eric, it's Mark. No, we did not quantify. We said there clearly
will be some stranded overhead that we have to work through. And I think what we would like to do is come back with
updated guidance in the near future to let you know what the company will look like without bakery. In terms of
timeframe, it's going to take six to eight months to close this deal, we would say. Clearly we have time to work through
that, and we will have some transition services as well which give us some time, so we're confident we can work
through it.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay. And can you remind me what the residual costs are related to the sale of the H&BC
business? If I remember correctly, you said you were going to eliminate about half in fiscal 2011. I just don't recall
what the absolute number was.

<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: I think what we said at the last call was it was 25 to $30
million of headwind related to stranded. Most of that of course is hitting our international beverage business. We would
expect by fiscal '12 we should eliminate most of that as well.
<A - Marcel Smits>: And we have in the past and I'm trying to find that, but we have also given some information on
how much restructuring expense that we have in relation to getting the stranded H&BC costs out of the system.
<A - Aaron Hoffman, Investor Relations>: 150 to 200 million of restructuring costs.
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay. And then on the area of acquisitions, you mentioned it several times in the press release and
prepared remarks, and going back a few years, Brenda [Brenda Barnes, former CEO] was talking about acquisitions
and feeling the organization was in the right place to be making acquisitions. I guess what's been the holdup to date?
Has it been the further cleaning up the portfolio with these divestitures, or a lack of appropriately valued targets? And
what's kind of changing going forward?
<A - Marcel Smits>: Well, I'm glad you asked that question. As a management team, let's first start with a somewhat
philosophical point, and that is that we feel that it makes no sense to make acquisitions until you have a established
track record of creating real value for your shareholders in a certain category.
We think that if you just look at our figures, and I can say CJ is sitting next to me, the North American retail businesses
have actually done very, very well, gaining market share, driving profitability up quite aggressively. We currently have
profitability levels which are the envy of the industry, and in the last quarter we gained share in 10 out of 12
subcategories. So that's the definition of a winning business.
And for that type of business, if acquisition candidates come along which can be had for a reasonable price –
reasonable as defined in, well, let's just compare this to doing further buybacks, we want our shareholders to know that
we wouldn't shy away from that.
Same thing on the coffee side, the coffee side is a double-digit EBIT margin business. It's a business where we now
have lots of exciting innovation coming through, and we think there are in-country consolidation opportunities, a
couple of them, and potentially, cautiously we wouldn't mind playing in additional geography.
Again, same thing, overriding consideration, you've got to be completely convinced that there is real money left for
your shareholders. So you shouldn't expect us to do deals whereby we can't simply explain to our shareholders, this is
what we pay, but this is the value that we're actually getting, and the difference is going to come to you. . So we're
going to be disciplined about it, but given the fact that we are as a company soon going to be into two large, attractive
categories where we have a very strong track record, yet we do want to say, yes, we would feel in a position where we
with confidence could stand – or go back to our shareholders and say, "hey, we've now actually done a disciplined
acquisition. We hope that this is the sort of stuff that you like as another venue of creating value."
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Okay, thanks for the background there.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Sorry?
<Q - Eric Serotta>: Thanks for the background. I'll pass it on.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Okay, good.

<Q - Ken Zaslow>: I'll ask a quick question. First is, when you sell the bakery business, is it neutral to earnings when
you take back – buy back the shares? Is that what you're thinking? I couldn't really figure out what you were trying to
get at?
<A - Mark Garvey, Interim Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, that depends very much on what you do with the
proceeds. So obviously if you put 1 billion of proceeds on the bank and you earn let's say 1% and you give up roughly
60 million of EBIT, then obviously it isn't accretive. If you accelerate your buyback, it's accretive. If you do an
in-country consolidation move and you buy something at a reasonable multiple and you have lots of synergy coming
through, it's accretive.
Let me just make one more overriding observation. You can rest assured that we're not saying today that we're
increasing the buyback commitment. We're going to take some time for this. First, we now we have to focus on getting
the transaction closed and then taking care of the stranded. But we're not the sort of people that leave unused cash
sitting on the balance sheet indefinitely. So we're pretty confident that this is a good deal for Sara Lee and that over
time that this deal will prove to be very accretive for our shareholders.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: My next question is – I know you've said a lot about acquisitions. I'm going to ask actually the
reverse of that, because my sense is your stock is up 5% today more because of the sale of the bakery business than
maybe your earnings outlook. So I guess my question is, if you're going to create value, is there something that the
stock market is trying to tell you and that you've thought about and maybe that there might be more changing of the
divestitures or is there more businesses, that maybe there's a different way to create value there other than acquiring
businesses? And how have you given that thought?
<A - Marcel Smits>: We have regular communications with our shareholders, and we tremendously value their
opinion. If the stock market is trying to tell us anything, then it is that over the last 18 months we've done pretty well.
It's 18 months ago that we were at 7. We're at the moment one of the better performing stocks in the sector. We have an
unwavering commitment to create value. We focus on everything that we can control, and everything that we can
control on a go-forward basis is to make sure that people understand that our growth profile of the two large categories
that we're in is excellent, one.
We'd like people to understand that we are now at a double-digit EBIT margin business, which is actually quite cash
generative, two. We'd like people to understand that we do everything in our powers to drive our corporate costs down,
to – through all the other good stuff like working capital reductions, and that all of those means will be applied to the
good sense for the benefit of our shareholders, three.
And we'd like to think that the investment community comes away thinking that as a management team we are going to
be, we're an ambitious group of people, but as a management team we are going to be extremely disciplined around
doing acquisitions. I can't say it often enough. You can go a long way in life by just avoiding doing anything stupid.
And we'd like to very cautiously guard our impeccable credentials in terms of doing our level best to create value for
our shareholders. If that's the takeaway, those four points: growth company; double-digit EBIT margins; trying to
squeeze everything out of the businesses, those unnecessary costs of working capital; disciplined around the subject of
value creation, that would be a nice takeaway.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Okay. But you're not – have you thought about greater number of divestitures, rather than the
acquisition side?
<A - Marcel Smits>: You know we're totally not focused on it.
<Q - Ken Zaslow>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.

<Q - Rob Dickerson>: It's ConsumerEdge Research. I just had a quick question just on potential acquisitions.
Obviously you're going to answer it how best you can, but concerning the cash repatriation issues that you've had this
year, I would assume that you would be strongly looking at potential targets in the U.S. Would that be correct?
<A - Marcel Smits>: I don't think we should go into the specifics. We just want to use the opportunity to say to people
we are now post the disposition of our bakery business. We're in two very large attractive categories. We're doing very
well in those attractive categories. Please be mindful of the fact that we are growing. Our top line is starting to grow.
We've given you all the evidence today. It's in our guidance. So consider us a growth companies in these two
categories. And we wouldn't mind doing acquisitions in a disciplined way in order to augment that growth profile.
That's the message.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot.

And we do have one further question. Our next question is from John Baumgartner. And please state your company
name.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Telsey Advisory Group. Good morning.
<A - Marcel Smits>: Good morning.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Marcel, a quick question for you, thinking about international beverages and kind of what
we're seeing on the ground right now, particularly in the mainstream category, can you walk through a little bit what
you're seeing as far as pricing in the industry is concerned. And are there any specific countries or regions where maybe
things have improved versus where things are a little bit still more challenging over the past two years? I know Spain
and Hungary have been somewhat problem areas with private label discounting.
<A - Marcel Smits>: No, if you want to make a broad split, I would say The Netherlands is tough, and that's also a
function of some consolidation which is going on between a couple of Dutch retailers. So there is a bit of intense
competition going on between the leading Dutch retailers, and that has repercussions in the way people deal with price
increases coming through.
So that's a [inaudible] to a piece of territory. Other than that, I don't think we see anything out of the ordinary. Nobody
likes price increases. The good fortune is that the price increases that were all in the coffee market are of such colossal
size and have been so well publicized that if you walk into an office of a customer and say, hey, we've got to do
something about pricing, people can't explain to you that you're crazy and that you're just trying to augment your
bottom line. We have an objective reason for those numbers.
<Q - John Baumgartner>: Great, thank you.
Operator
And our final question is from Georg von Wyss. And please state your company name.
<Q - Georg von Wyss>: Yes. Hi, Classic Fund Management. Just a quick one. How much of your pension obligation
is going with North American bakery? And how well funded is that obligation? And does this have any impact on the
additional money that you've said you need to put into pensions this year?
<A - Christopher Fraleigh>: Okay, I can answer the question. It's just a) if you look at our last 10-K, we talked about
our total pension obligations and the relative under-funding at that point in time. And of course, it's a valuation at a
point in time. And at that point our total under-funding was $530 million. The rough portion of that that relates to fresh
bakery is around $80 million. Now, that of course will change depending on the valuations that are done at particular
points in time. We'll see when we close this deal. But that gives you a perspective as to how much the bakery, relative
