On the call today, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas President and Chief Executive
Officer; with several other senior members of our team in the room today. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial
results and then we'll turn the call over to Richard who will begin reviewing our recent performance and outlook in the
slide presentation. After our formal remarks, we'll turn the call over to questions.
Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $2.5 billion or $2.38 per share for the first quarter of
2015. The loss attributable to common stock included net charges of $2.4 billion or $2.32 per share in the first quarter,
primarily for the reduction of the carrying value of oil and gas properties pursuant to SEC full cost accounting rules,
and a related tax charge to established a deferred tax valuation allowance.
Our adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $60 million or $0.06 per share during the quarter. Our
copper sales during the quarter totaled 960 million pounds, that was above the first quarter of last year of 871 million
pounds. Gold sales totaled 263,000 ounces, that was also above the last year first quarter of 187,000 ounces. And oil
and gas sales totaled 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in the first quarter.
Our realized copper price of $2.72 per pound in the first quarter was below the year-ago quarter of $3.14 pounds, gold
prices of $1,186 per ounce were below the year ago quarter of roughly $1,300 per ounce. FM O&G's average realized
price for crude oil was $56.51 per barrel in the quarter and that included about $12 per barrel of realized cash gains on
derivative contracts. Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $717 million, capital expenditures as we advanced
our projects totaled $1.9 billion for the quarter.
We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.3 billion and consolidated cash of $549 million. As previously reported, we
completed amendments to our bank loans during the quarter to provide more flexible financial covenants and to extend
maturities under our term loan. At the end of the quarter, availability under the revolver approximated $3 billion of
undrawn availability, and undrawn availability under the Cerro Verde credit facility approximated $1 billion.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide materials on our website.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone. Before we turn to the slides, I want to look back on our January call when we discussed this
year, 2015, as being a bridging year as we complete our major copper expansion projects that we started in 2010 and
transition to 2016 when we will realize the ongoing benefits of these investments.
These projects will generate volumes that will be accompanied by lower costs, lower capital expenditures. All of this
adds up to a significant free cash flow generation which will not be dependent on higher copper prices.
Now, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for the copper markets. We're supported by the world's need for
copper and the challenges in developing supplies and maintaining supplies for copper. But we are cognizant of the
near-term uncertainties on commodity prices, so we're going to continue to be diligent about controlling costs, and we'll
remain flexible to respond to market conditions.
We've already taken a series of actions to respond to these market conditions and to maintain our financial strength as
we work through 2015, the future years, when our financial metrics are expected to improve dramatically. We have
made significant progress and are nearing completion of our brownfield copper development projects. These are among
the most attractive in the world. As we complete these projects, we are positioned to achieve our deleveraging
objectives over time, increase cash returns to shareholders, and provide exposure to our shareholder to a strengthening
commodity markets in the future.
Jim is going to be talking with you about several important milestones completed in our oil and gas business since our
acquisitions by FCX in 2013. The combination of our large scale infrastructure in the Gulf was significant available
capacity to expand and our strategic lease position, and exploration and development inventory together with the
experience of our team in our Gulf of Mexico focus area position us to grow our business, generate attractive

investment returns, and increase asset values.
When we completed the oil and gas acquisitions, we established an objective for the business to be self-funding.
To-date, that has been accomplished through cash flows and asset sales. We are now evaluating a range of alternatives
to provide supplemental external funding for our oil and gas investments and we'll continue to do so.
We're going to talk today that among these alternatives, we're considering a public listing of a minority interest in
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. Publicly-traded Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas would highlight the values of our oil
and gas assets through a public market valuation and enable us to expand the financing alternatives for our oil and gas
operations on a standalone basis. Subject to market conditions, this alternative could potentially to be completed in late
2015 following a completion of an SEC review of the required registration statement.
The following review of our business and its outlook will evidence that we have a strong portfolio of assets with
attractive nearer-term and longer-term organic growth options, a dedicated and highly motivated management team and
organization to execute these plans, and a roadmap for managing our assets and finances as we deliver on our strategy
of providing long-term values for our shareholders.
Now turning to our slides. On slide 3, we have a picture of our new annual report for 2014. This report titled, Value at
Our Core, talks about the substantial value in our assets, the growing production in cash flow profile, our exposure to
markets with favorable fundamentals, our financial strength, the way we manage our business in a responsible manner
for environment, community and social aspects, and experienced management team that we have.
In the first quarter, turning to slide 4, the highlights are we successfully ramped up our Morenci expansion. We had
record quarterly sales at our Tenke Fungurume project following the completion of our Phase 2 expansion in 2013. The
Cerro Verde construction project is on track to become the world's largest copper concentrator facility. We're entering
into the phases of the higher ore grades at Grasberg as we approach completion of our mine plan to complete mining in
the open pit and we set the stage for growth, as I mentioned, in production with declining future capital expenditures.
In the oil and gas business, we had positive drilling results. At our Holstein Deep facility, Power Nap in the Vito Basin
and at the King project, [Green well] tie into the Marlin facility. This significantly expanded our resource base. We
established new production as the Lucius project came on stream, Dorado, Highlander, in our onshore deep gas project
combined these added – we're producing at 25 barrels of equivalents a day by the end of the quarter. And we have an
enhanced inventory of financially attractive development projects. And as I mentioned, we are advancing plans for
external funding for executing this plan to develop these assets.
Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2014. Of course, we're
dealing with lower commodity prices with copper prices being roughly 12% lower and oil prices half of what they were
in the year-ago quarter. Other than that, our business from a fundamental standpoint, operated in an efficient and
effective way.
Just returned from the annual CESCO Week in Santiago, Chile. That was last week. A lot of commentary there about
copper markets. When you step back and look at where we are right now in 2015, the surpluses that had been projected
for a number of past years are not developing as they were estimated. Projects have been delayed. Production has been
interrupted and the market has not moved into a large surplus position.
The focus by investors and people who followed the industry has been on China, with China's growth – lowering –
lower growth rate and uncertainties about its economy. Its base has grown significantly, government is providing
economic stimulus, and China's need for copper is going to continue to be significant and the key factor in terms of
near-term price movements. The U.S., as we evidenced, we provide over 40% of the downstream copper for the U.S.
markets, growing at a moderate rate. The economic stimulus has been applied in Europe and Japan, and we're seeing
the beginnings of growth in Europe in our business there. The industry continues to face these supply side challenges.
We're cognizant, as I mentioned, of the near-term price uncertainty, but we remain very optimistic about the mid-term
and long-term fundamentals of this business, and our company is really positioned to take advantage of that in a very
significant way. You can see on slide 7 our operating results for our mining business in the first quarter. We continue to

be focused on cost management. Our team and the leaders of that team are here in the room with me today. They've
done a great job in leading our whole organization to focus on cost.
We had good cost performance in the quarter. We came in significantly lower than our own internal plans for cost
control. And our consolidated unit cost guidance of $1.64 a pound was lower than the guidance we have last quarter,
and you can see how that operates, how that was reflected in our regional operations. Our growth in production in
North America came from Morenci; it was also a good performance at Chino.
In South America, the decline reflects the sale of the Candelaria project which produced just under 100 million pounds
last – in the first quarter of 2014. Indonesia is a stronger quarter than the first quarter of 2014 when we're dealing with
the export ban. And as I mentioned, Africa operated well and achieved record production for the quarter.
Looking forward through 2015, we have been working to get to the point now that we are approaching for several years
to be well-positioned to take advantage of what we will achieve through the completion of our expansion project, what
we will achieve in Indonesia, at Grasberg, as we enter into the final period of mining from the open pit.
You can see growing production volumes. During the quarter, lowering unit cash cost as we move forward in 2015 and
lower capital cost as we go beyond 2015 into 2016, this has been our long-term plan and now we are achieving it.
At Cerro Verde, we are just terrifically excited about what the progress is being made there. Engineering and major
procurement are complete. As I mentioned, when we complete this, we will be processing through our concentrate
360,000 tons a day and that will be the world's largest.
The construction is on schedule at this point as 70% complete. We're targeting getting it finished in late 2015; and as I
said, the entire organization, as we review this internally, is very excited about what we're doing there.
This will add 600 million pounds of copper per annum, $4.6 billion was our original estimate and that's where we are
today in terms of looking at it. So it's good to see that we're progressing on a time schedule we set within the capital
budget that we set.
In Indonesia, we continue to be engaged in active discussions with the government to amend our COW. This is – the
government has expressed – government officials have expressed a recognition of our need for certainty in terms of our
fiscal terms and our operating rights and we're working cooperatively with the government on how to accomplish this
within the government's regulatory framework.
A lot of mutual benefits for us, our company, and for the country of Indonesia with the operations in Papua, we've had
a very long-term positive partnership. We're working hard to sustain that in an environment of changes in government
and expectations and aspirations in Indonesia but this operation is the economic engine for the development of Papua
and that's something that we share in common with the government of Indonesia and with our own company, and
provide significant benefits to the Indonesian economy.
As we stand right now, all of our rights under our COW continue to be applied until we reach a mutually agreeable
approach to amending that and these negotiations are taking place.
We do have a Memorandum of Understanding that was extended earlier this year to July 2015 and as part of that
Memorandum of Understanding, we're working with partners to advance plans for the expansion of our smelter
operations. We're focused in the Gresik area of East Java where we have the existing smelter that was developed in the
mid-1990 which is Indonesia's only smelter.
At the operations itself, we have now completed the access to our massive underground ore bodies. We expect that the
DMLZ extension of the existing DOZ mine to start up late this year, and we're working to develop the underground
reserves that lie below the Grasberg open pit, the Grasberg Block Cave mine, which is scheduled to begin ramping up
in 2018.
Development capital of over $3 billion has been spent, $2.5 billion net to PT Freeport Indonesia, and we expect that
PT-FI's share of this cost will average $600 million a year over the next five years. And throughout this period, we've

been able to successfully continue with this underground development.
Beyond our existing producing asset, our expansion projects, the transition of Grasberg to being a fully underground
operation, we look to the future or projects where we're not currently committing capital to at this point, but they will
provide the opportunity for long-term growth for our company. They include a very large sulfide resource at our at El
Abra mine in Northern Chile.
This mine would – this resource would support a major concentrator development projects. Currently, our operations at
El Abra have been SX/EW operations with significant incremental production that would be achieved with that. At this
point, we are studying options for getting water, power, dealing with tailings, and working with our partners to do this
in an effective way.
In the United States, where with the lower energy cost here and the productivity of American workers, we have great
opportunities for future expansions at our mines in Arizona.
At Bagdad, there is a large sulfide resource that would allow us to more than double mill capacity, add significant
amounts of copper, and we're doing the initial steps to look at that project, including the acquisition of water rights
which is a key for that and tailings deposition areas.
At our Safford mine, which is in Eastern Arizona, near Morenci, we have additional oxide resources that would extend
the existing productive facility, that's at an adjoining ore-body called Lone Star which is near there and it has oxides
that could expand that – extend our infrastructure beyond the life of the oxides at Safford. And then at both Safford and
Lone Star, there's a significant sulfide resource for the future.
At Tenke Fungurume, besides the oxide ore, we have the opportunity for further expansion to produce incremental
volumes from oxide, that's dependent on getting power. But there is a massive high-grade mixed ore and sulfide
resource that we are conducting exploration drilling and doing metallurgical studies that we'd look for how we – and
looking at how we process that over time.
With that report on our mining operations, Jim, I'm going to turn the presentation over to you to talk about oil and gas
business.
James C. Flores
Right. Thank you, Richard. Good morning, everyone.
On page 13, we talk about the oil market commentary. You can see that WTI and Brent curves, and HLS curves here
on the graph, the market obviously continues to be volatile as it goes through its price and market discovery of where
all the oil needs to go and at what price. We see it, it's continue to be volatile. It was down 50% in the beginning of the
first quarter. It was up 20% at the end of the first quarter.
So as we bear through that and assets are re-priced both in accounting but also in the marketplace, we continue to focus
on our operations and continue to do good things with drill bit and follow through with our operating plan. We continue
to see the oil market cleaning up, if you will.
The contango curve is always a positive event for future oil prices on the Brent side and we continue to see the oil
market under strain going forward as demand has really been the big story here in the first quarter as we've seen a lot of
gasoline demand here in the U.S. and other parts of the world on the finished products side that we think is going to
continue to increase as these current oil prices take hold of the marketplace.
On page 14, I put together just a chronological series of highlights from 2013 to 2014, obviously for
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. When it was formed, it's the combination between PXP and MMR and acquired by
Freeport in 2013. We have a big adjustment period in the total oil and gas division by 174,000 BOE per day. It was a
big increase from 2012. We get our hands around all the assets and also the corporate structure of Freeport. And it was
a big achievement for us in 2013 and put us on a growth path to say how are we going to develop all these assets and

have the right personnel, right equipment, right operating plan going forward was a key part of it.
And when we looked at our asset review in 2014, we saw what assets might not fit in the next five years as far as
building value over time. They were valuable at the time but they were not going to build value over time and be
meaningful to Freeport. And the Eagle Ford Shale fell into that category. We ended up selling it for $3.1 million – $3.1
billion, excuse me, and we were able to rotate that, about $1.5 billion of that money into some significant assets that
grow over time like Heidelberg, Lucius, and our Vito project we'll talk about.
Then, we continued to acquire leases and seismic that put our projects in the best possible position of bringing forward
the exemplary results without failure and being able to use the new seismic and the additional acreage that add the
resources to our existing infrastructure.
In 2015, we started seeing results bear fruit with our first production at Lucius development. That was the discovery
that we discovered in 2009 with Anadarko that came on netting us between 20,000 barrels a day and 25,000 barrels a
day. We've successfully drilled wells at Holstein Deep and also King, Marlin areas around our existing infrastructure
that have validated our seismic and brought big resources to bear and we'll show you the Holstein Deep progression of
resources that we've identified there with additional drilling.
And then, also on our Vito area, there are several adjoining prospects and we drilled the first one that Richard has
talked about the Power Nap that was successfully, so we're off to a great start there. And you go through – on top of
that, the Highlander discovery that we announced in 2014, we put it on production in 2015 and is producing quite well
down in the lower St. Martin Parish, Louisiana and we look forward to talking about developing that further going
forward as gas prices rebound.
So all in all, we're on the edge of a big growth spurt in the oil and gas business. And then – and with the 145 projects
outlined on page 15, that all have IRRs greater than 20% at strip, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, this is all because of the
attach to existing infrastructure or has infrastructure plan that has this very cost-efficient in the Vito area. But the
Keathley Canyon, Green Canyon, and Mississippi Canyon is tying back to existing infrastructure that we own or we
have an interest in.
In the Vito area, the reserves are so large that the returns are going to be excellent from the standpoint of sizing the
facility that we're going to build with the operator, Shell, and be in a situation to maximize our economics in that area.
So with this deep inventory and so forth, what we need to focus is manage – to manage our cash flow, manage our
capital whether inside or outside going forward to make sure that we achieve the corporate objectives of FCX.
In the first quarter 2015, Freeport-McMoRan highlights on page 16, we've had continued steady production
performance from California. We advanced our Gulf of Mexico growth strategy as I've described. The Inboard Lower
Tertiary besides the Highlander, significant flow test and production at Highlander. We've had our Farthest Gate West
well as a potential discovery where we have completion underway that we hope to have that completed this summer
and be able to talk further about that. And we had about $100 million of net oil hedging realizations to help buffer the
volatile prices in the first quarter.
In our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico progress report specifically area by area, Green Canyon, Mississippi Canyon and
Vito Area on page 17, you can see there's a lot of busy work going on. And as we go through this process, one thing I
want everybody to understand is that our operations plan and our budget are risked and that's simple and everybody
does that.
But as our operation plan outperforms our risk, basically, we've had an incredible two-and-a-half quarters of excellent
drilling results and so forth and also de-risked some the capital and that's some of the upside movement in our capital
budget strictly because wells were risked at 80% success are now 100% success and so forth and it make sounds small
but the numbers are big so that puts upside pressure due to the success of all these projects and we have not done a dry
hole at all in the last two quarters.
And you can go through the detail here. The big key here, I want everybody to focus on besides the Holstein Deep,
Green Canyon area with the gross resources, we're initially 75 million barrels and now up to 280 million barrels

because of the additional drilling and then the big cash flow we're going to get out of the Dorado, King, and KOQV
area because of our seismic tie-in and the success we've had there is our Vito area, our Power Nap discovery which is
the offset discovery to our Vito area, it's a very significant discovery for several reasons. Number one, obviously, it's a
large column of oil that over-extends a nice reservoir size. On top of that, it has really helped us gain confidence in all
the additional projects. And the next one we have to drill is Deep Sleep that we're going to immediately move to after
we finish our present logging operations at Power Nap.
And the next page, on page 18, you can see the overall picture of our assets. We want to focus on Holstein Deep, right
down the Green Canyon area and Power Nap as far as the two highlighted assets that we have.
On page 19, the Holstein facility, our Holstein Deep development, you can see we're drilling on the Southwest side,
you can see Phase 1 is called the subsea, subsea 1, 2, and 3 and then you see a Phase 2 development wells in the lighter
blue and even lighter blue is the Phase 3 development. And as we go around from the initial three-well development
that we had planned, that would add 15,000 barrels a day in 2016, that's on track and expanding the drilling results, it
could add up to 75,000 barrels a day to Freeport-McMoRan by 2020. So, this project is continued to drill out above
expectations and, therefore, its budget has been expanded.
The Holstein Deep production profile on page 20, give representative to talk about cash flows and timing for your
modeling process but it's a very significant project for the company going forward.
On page 21, is our Vito area-Power Nap Discovery. The Regional Miocene picture you see up in the top left corner of
Vito development discovery that Shell operates, Power Nap just to the east of that, the two red dots, that's another
discovery. These are net BOE exposure to Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. And you can see just to the south of Power
Nap is our Deep Sleep play was a very thick part of the basin which is syncline separated from the Power Nap
discovery. And then we have our Sun project, down to the Southeast which is 240 million barrels net project, and the
Spitfire, 384 million barrel.
All in all – I skipped Ravioli and Vito North, they're smaller, but it's about 1 billion barrels of oil net to the company.
And this is the most significant long-term play that the company has on its books today. You can see the extremely
thick column of LM4 sands upper and lower fence in our Vito discovery well. It's a great seismic signature to chase all
over this mini basin.
So, when you flip to page 22, you can look at our plan going forward for the next 10 years, you could see production
growing from where it is today, 130,000 barrels a day, 140,000 barrels a day to over 600,000 barrels a day. The key
about this slide, that we wanted to put in here, is the estimated reserve replacement ratio for the next five years is
137%. Finding cost going forward, $26 a barrel and $21 a barrel in the 10-year model, is that all of these assets are in
hand, most of these have all been discovered or have validation within the basin. All of our gas assets in Haynesville,
Madden, Cretaceous as gas recovers later in this decade, our California assets, Mississippi Canyon, Green Canyon,
Keathley Canyon, the Vito Area, there's no additional exploration. There's no additional outside business acquisitions
in this model. This is all what's in hand.
So just following, in our playbook, we can increase production at least 3x through our company on the oil side. Now,
all we're arguing about right now internally and externally is timing because the assets are there, the equipments are
there, and so forth, and the cost structure is there. When you look at our five-year finding cost structure at $26 a barrel,
and just take our average LOE forecast about $15 a barrel, it's $18 right now, it's about $15 going forward because our
fixed assets have fixed cost.
And when you add more volumes to it, you dilute the per barrel cost. So if you take $26 and $15, it's about $41 a barrel,
and you add $5 corporate cost, it's about $46 per barrel all-in cost for oil and gas business. In a $65 to $70 oil market,
we make a lot of money in this business. It's very low risk because of the risk we've taken and the way we de-risk it
with the drill bit. It's very low risk from the execution standpoint because of the equipment and platforms that are in
place. So we're very excited about that. And we've been working all internally with everyone here at Freeport to figure
out the best way to fund these assets going forward.

On page 23, I just want to highlight two different ways to think about our business. Number one, the current plan,
which is what in our corporate projections of 2015, 2016, and 2017 production volumes and EBITDA on the top right.
And then if we're able to bring in additional funding, that would accelerate that business and get us up to a production
level that would allow us to be self-funding at a much faster level. The model is in the lower right-hand corner, which
is the growth plan, assuming additional funding.
And what happens here is because of all the wells we've drilled and so forth, we're really talking about how fast we
hook them up and how fast we put the equipment in to bring that production on and so forth. So, for us, we're going to
be very stingy about it from a standpoint of funding. We've looked for funding sources in the first quarter. We found
some that we're interested in participating that were very expensive. And we looked around that we found some others
that make a lot more sense.
And right now, the public sale of public equities for a minority interest in FM O&G is something that we're working
on, and we're going to probably have a decision on that here this quarter to where we file the document and get new
registration, as Richard said, for the summer and look at raising some money in the fall or JVs, carried interest or other
monetizations and/or divestitures. And divestitures are just – they help patch the hole, but they don't solve the problem.
So, the IPO alternative for Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, page 24, provides that alternative form of – a way to fund
the business. But the key thing, we think, it does is highlights the standalone value for oil and gas business. There's a
big disconnect between the value of our oil and gas business within Freeport-McMoRan today and the public market
perception of standalone oil and gas business.
We've had more success than anybody with the drill bit in the last two years, and it's caused more spending, but it's also
– it's not getting reflected in our equity. So the aspect of being able to get that visibility for the Freeport shareholder, we
think, is an important part of it.
FCX certainly plans to maintain control and majority ownership of the business. And the case study is, obviously,
Freeport has done this before, the FCX IPO. We did it at Plains with Plains Exploration. We spun it out of PXT – PLX.
And then the Vastar IPO from ARCO in 1994 that really funded their deepwater discovery developments in 1994 when
deepwater was first showing up and really it's a big part of BP's portfolio today.
The timing, it's only as late 2015 or as market conditions favorable we're going to be patient from that standpoint. And
we'll continue to assess other alternatives and have other discussions in other areas in the interim certainly from that
standpoint.
So, Richard, back to you to talk about the 2015 outlook.
Richard C. Adkerson
Okay. Thanks, Jim. We want to give you this overview of our assets and make sure that you can sense what our degree
of excitement is about the scope of our assets over both our mining business and our oil and gas business. And I want to
talk about how all this comes together financially for us as we move forward with our plans for developing them.
First of all, looking at the near-term for 2015, we are looking at sales of 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million
ounces of gold, 95 million pounds of molybdenum, and 52.3 million barrels equivalent of oil, 67% of that is oil. The
operating cash flows that would be generated at $2.75 copper would be $4.4 billion and we're highly leveraged to
copper for the rest of the year, $0.10 changes in copper is $250 million.
The unit cost is an attractive $1.53 for copper and, as Jim said, $19 a barrel for oil for this year. Our capital
expenditures reflect a $500 million adjustment for oil and gas business, it's $6.5 billion as we move forward. And you
can see, as we look beyond 2015 on slide 26, the volumes increased significantly as we talked about earlier, both for
copper, gold, with support from molybdenum and our oil project where we will be preparing for longer-term growth
through our investment activities there.

Our copper sales for the quarter will be growing, as I mentioned earlier, throughout the year and that information is
presented on slide 27. Our 2015 operating estimates for our unit cost for copper shows the effects of the higher volumes
with continued cost controls. We're now looking at projections of $1.53 a pound consolidated for copper and you can
see how our sales are divided by region.
The EBITDA models and cash flow models that we present each quarter presented on slide 29 is an average for the
next – for 2016 and 2017, average EBITDA at various copper prices with gold to $1,200 and oil at $70, this
approximates the current strip for 2016 and 2017.
You can see EBITDA ranging from $2.50 copper at $8.6 billion to $13.7 billion at $3.50 and operating cash flows
range from $6.6 billion at $2.50 up to $10.3 billion at $3.50. With sensitivities for our different commodities and
currencies are presented on slide 30 for your use. Our capital expenditure plans as they current stand are shown on slide
31, you can see declining from $7.4 billion last year to the $6.5 billion this year, $5.6 billion and $5.1 billion. And
we're going to be evaluating these as we go forward but this is what our current plan is as we stand now.
We are committed to maintaining financial strength and we have a strong track record for doing that. Our large
resource base gives us strong cash flows and we will exercise capital discipline on how we invest for the future. We've
taken significant steps to reduce costs and capital expenditures, increasing volumes, declining CapEx. That's going to
help our existing credit metrics and we are advancing plans for external funds as Jim just talked about.
We have available liquidity under our FCX revolver and we have a facility at Cerro Verde that together provide us $4
billion of availability at the end of March. So our key priorities as we go forward is to maintain our financial strength,
manage our operations and our CapEx to maximize near-term cash flows in an uncertain commodity market. But to
look forward to this great set of assets that we have for future growth, future value creation, we're really going to be
focused on executing our plans for our near-term mining projects and our oil and gas investments and to generate
values for our large resource base. Before we turn the call over for questions, Jim Bob's here and he has some
comments to be made about our company's culture and how we're approaching the current environment based on the
successes we've had over many years in the past.
Jim Bob?
James R. Moffett
Thank you, Richard. If you can look at slide 34, 1981 was the merger with Freeport Minerals and McMoRan Oil &
Gas. That started as [indiscernible] in our industry. In 1988, we had discovery of the Grasberg [indiscernible]. In 1988,
if you remember, we did an IPO of FCX. At the time of the discovery of Grasberg, we knew we had [indiscernible]
significant, but we had to rely on our geologic instincts to know that this was a major find. And as you know, actually
the drilling that we did, we ended up with the largest ore body in the world, copper, gold, and silver.
In 1990, we developed the Grasberg and we proved we knew how to manage that business because we had a discovery
in the middle of New Guinea at 13,000 feet and we had to raise $6 billion, we took it on ourselves to do that. We used
every resource in the public markets, be it, gold bonds, silver bonds, and then we made a major transaction in order to
do that.
I'll remind everybody that whatever we have, challenges going to the market, and we've been very resourceful. The
[indiscernible], the deal that really set the tone or deals in the mining business in an effort to bring production on, the
shareholders kept 100% of what they own, and we only gave up reserves in the future.
When FCX was spun off from the parent, we had $6 billion in equity value then we came upon the Phelps Dodge
acquisition. Not only did we create the largest publicly-traded copper producer, but remember, we had the instincts,
look at the oxide ore bodies and realized that the oxide ore bodies are the tip of the iceberg. But our geologic instincts,
we were able to drill these large sulfide ore bodies and then we doubled, imagine doubling the reserves of the Phelps
Dodge assets that we acquired.

Page 10 of 26
So my observation and I think everybody needs to reflect on it because from my tenure as CEO in the first part of this
history and then Rich was CEO, and Jim came in 2013, if you do a look back, when we found the Grasberg, we didn't
have the benefit of seismic because seismic doesn't work the way we can profile oil and gas prospects. We didn't have
the benefit of seismic when we projected the stuff out over the ore bodies.
In the case of the oil and gas business, the technology what it is with 3D and 4D seismic, we got these ore bodies that
are outlined, never had that kind of information. But when you look at the discoveries as Jim has referred to, for
instance the Power Nap, hundreds of feet of pay just offset the magnificent discovery that was made, the Thunder
Horse one basin over.
So, we clearly take it on ourselves from the time we acquired PXP and MMR, we sold off major oil and gas property in
the Eagle Ford and we sold off the Candelaria. Raised over $4 billion so we've done what we said we would do; now
what we have to do is to take advantage of the fact that we have this growth profile which has been the history of our
company and we've proven that geologically and engineering-wise, we've been able to complete major projects, that the
deepwater is a challenge.
But remember, we acquired PXP acquisition, the platforms out there in the deepwater, the three platforms – now with
the price drop from $100 a barrel to $50 a barrel. You can just imagine that when you have a monopoly on the
deepwater in those areas around the BP platforms, BP owned those assets for several years and they had – they didn't
just throw darts to say where we're going to put these big facilities and their geological and engineering teams looking
at the best place to put these platforms.
So it was instinctive for PXP to acquire these in 2013. But today, when you look at the price drop from $100 a barrel to
$50 a barrel, there won't be a lot of these kind of platforms can be justified. So all the production we found around our
platforms either by Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas or by third-parties who come to our facilities, so either through
equity in the wells that we're doing, tolling fees for our platform, we had about 250,000 barrels capacity.
And when you compare that Thunder Horse facility which was, of course, the first one built in the deepwater had a lot
of lead-time because they had to design some of the engineering, it took about 10 years, it cost about $10 billion to put
that facility out there. We have about the same capacity on the three platforms that we have.
So as usual this history of having our geological and engineering big projects, so although we have a challenge, just
imagine the resources that we have garnered, we're just net $20 billion of the minerals facility and that's just the starting
to turn the corner, as Richard pointed out, that we've been investing big bucks. We've had some hiccups in Indonesia.
Indonesia put an export ban on minerals not just copper, but all the minerals – caused a complete restructuring of the
margins in the minerals business. But we've been able to sustain that, we've had labor union situations there. Nobody
was having much interest when copper was $1, but copper went up – went up to $3, $4, unions have gotten interested
in the minerals business.
So that's just part of the worldwide phenomenon. As we say [indiscernible] copper was less than $1 and gold was at
$400 an ounce. So when you look at where we are today, you can see that we, as I say, we completed this $20 billion in
mineral expansion and we're starting to benefit in that. And we're just starting to see the benefit in this major
investment we made with the PXP and MMR acquisition.
So I think our company culture shows that we successfully manage them, the biggest projects in the world, within the
mineral and oil and gas business and we not only manage them from a technical standpoint, we manage it from a
financial standpoint. So, given a chance to – what we've done with the assets, we've always proven that we know how
to manage risk, know how to manage the development projects, no matter how remote they are. We've been a leader in
the industry, and it's what we've put together with our asset base. We're in a position now to really show what the
mineral and oil and gas treasure trove of assets represent.
So, this is Jim and myself and our whole team here mineral and oil and gas experts. Button up your chin strap because
it's going to be quite a ride. Thank you.

Richard C. Adkerson
Thanks, Jim Bob. And we're ready to open up the lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question
comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Thanks very much. Hi, everyone.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hey.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Hey, Richard. I've got a couple of questions here. First of all, I think many people on
this line today are surprised to see the increase in CapEx, especially after the nearly-85% dividend cut. And obviously
at a time when you're burning a lot of cash, having you exhausted all opportunities to cut costs and CapEx elsewhere.
And if 2015 is the bridge year, why not take on some additional debt here instead of diluting shareholder interest
further?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's a very complex question. I'll tell you we have gone through an exercise of looking
at our capital costs across our business and coming up with a plan that we believe reflects the objective of limiting costs
in the current environment while protecting our assets and positioning us to take advantage of them over the long term.
So we have clearly done that. Now – and we can respond to more details about that, Tony.
The issue of funding more debt is we started with a strong objective which we communicated with the market
following both the announcement of the oil and gas deal in December 12 and the closing of the transaction in mid-2013
was that we were going to be focused on reducing our debt because of our belief that the nature of our assets can best
be managed and positioned for growth with a balance sheet that's strong.
We have a strong balance sheet. We are an investment-grade-rated company and we want to take actions to protect that
investment-grade rating. We believe that's important for the credit markets, for the equity markets, but also how we
manage some of our reclamation obligations where we're able to use corporate guarantees as an investment-grade-rated
company. So you mix this all together and our view has been that we should take steps, not to grow debt but to position
ourselves to reduce debt over time. And then our board made the decision to reduce our dividend for now, we've
reduced it in 2008, as you recall. And as markets recovered, we aggressively increased it as the markets change.
My view is that's what's going to happen in the future, but we needed to take into account the uncertainties of the
near-term market conditions, position our company for future growth and for de-levering our balance sheet in years
beyond 2016. We do not have current plans to issue equity for the parent company. We – as Jim talked about this issue
of getting highlights on the valuable oil and gas business, the idea of potentially issuing equity at that level, we could
see it has benefits both in terms of highlighting those values but also giving us the opportunity to look at a broader
range of funding within that entity as a public entity.
So we can see some benefits part, by the nature of doing that it takes time, you have to file a registration statement with
the SEC, go through a review process. And for us to have that alternative, that filing would be required. That doesn't
mean that we would be fully committed to doing it. That will be based on our view of all the alternatives we have and
how the markets develop as we go forward.
We're going to have our fingers in the market at all place and we're going to evaluate all alternatives and take the
actions that best serve our shareholders.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Okay. And then just if I just switch gears for a moment, just the production at a
couple places. First at the Grasberg, the production was 20% below your January guide or estimate, primarily due to

lower mining rates. I'm wondering – and you've kind of indicated that it improved through the quarter. Could you bring
us up-to-date where you were at quarter's end in relation to capacity there?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. One of the things to keep in mind is that we are ramping-down the mining of
waste there. In fact, by the end of this year, we will essentially have mined all of the waste in the Grasberg pit. That's
the material that allows us to get to the bottom of the pit. And as we go forward, we'll be mining ore and some
low-grade material that we're stockpiling to provide throughput for our mill as we ramp-up the Grasberg Block Cave.
So, for you, Tony, and those of us that's been following this for a long time, we need to adjust our view of what mining
rates are there because that's not part of the Indonesian Government issues, or the labor union, this is just a normal mine
plan. Now, we did have a work stoppage that was not a union action during the first quarter. And some of the labor
issues within our workforce continued to be complicated, but that did not last long. And by the end of the quarter, we
are essentially operating on a normal fashion.
And so, that had an impact, not only for a very short period of time when we had a work stoppage, but it's affected
some absenteeism issues, has affected some productivity issues, and we've been dealing with these labor issues now
since 2011 and – but we now are back to a normal fashion.
We have negotiations with our union coming up this year and we have confidence going into that. We got our union
contract completed two years ago on a relatively straightforward fashion. And we're building positive – more positive
relationships with the union but there are other issues within our workforce that we'll have to continue to deal with.
So, one is, look at where we are with our long-term mine plan in the pit with mining rates going down and then we are
working with some ongoing labor issues that had an impact in the first quarter and we're going to work hard to
minimize that impact and we think we can going forward into 2015, in the last three quarters.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: All right, Richard. So, strip ratios improve as you go through the year, should allow
more normal, lesser rate of absenteeism and – so, lower unit cost there. The other question I had was on Cerro Verde.
And in the text, you talked about higher repair and maintenance expense and higher mining cost. Is that all in
preparation for the expansion you're doing there or what is that related to?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me – Red's here – let me let him respond to that.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Sure. Sure. Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: But just another comment, it's not improving strip rate. It's just the fact that we're not
mining the waste anymore.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We're just following our plan.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Mine the waste and now we're down to where we're going to be mining essentially after
this year or for the mill currently and some low-grade material that we're stockpiling to provide mill throughput when
we complete mining in the pit and ramping up the underground Block Cave.
So all of that – and that – as I said, that's what we will be doing under any set of circumstances. And before I turn over
to Red, I want to – Kathleen has given me a good note to follow up on the earlier conversation about dilution. We have
the ability to fund the plan that you see under our current revolver, which we have $4 billion of availability at the end
of the quarter. And under the current plan – now, we've got to deal with commodity prices, whatever they will be,
higher prices helps us, lower prices causes us to respond to those, but we have the ability to borrow temporarily under
our credit facility. And then as we get into 2016 and generate cash flows even at today's prices, we see that facility will
be coming back available to us in full force. So we don't have the need to do – we don't have an absolute requirement to
do external financing to execute the plan that you see today.

<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Understood.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We're focused on how to take advantage of this oil and gas assets to provide funding for
its opportunities that's separate and apart from our overall corporate financial plan.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Okay, thanks for that.
<A - Harry “Red” Conger>: Tony, just quickly, at Cerro Verde, we brought additional trucks down from our other
operation, it's ten trucks this year that, again, is one of the strengths of our company where we can do that, the support
from the other mining operations and our good equipment availabilities. So we're advancing the mining. They are
making sure that that pit's in great shape and able to feed this new big concentrator that is being built on schedule, as
Richard pointed out. So we have taken some of the mining equipment to help with the construction of a starter dam,
temporarily. And again we're able to do all of that and achieve our planned facility. It did cause a variance in the first
quarter.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Thanks for the color, Red. I appreciate it. Richard, thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Let me just reiterate something. This is Jim Bob here.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Hi, Jim Bob. Hi, Jim Bob.
<A - James R. Moffett>: If you look at where we are today, after having spent $20 billion on these minerals, did a
major acquisition in oil and gas, during the year, we have sold $4.5 billion worth of assets [indiscernible].
What we have to do, be sure we're pushing the right buttons and I think if I just stop, look at this to make sure that
we're using debt and equity as we have in the past, but most importantly, the ability for any company in managing a
company our size, taking on $20 billion of mineral expansion and a major acquisition, this is a pretty exciting treasure
trove of assets in shareholders' hands. What we need to do now is to make sure that we look forward and use the equity
and the debt that you suggested – that's what we're in the process of doing.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Thank you. Thank you, Jim Bob.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, Tony.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto, Jr.>: Thanks, Richard.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Good morning guys. Maybe this question is best for Kathleen. But where are we right now
with the carrying value or the book value of your oil and gas assets as of this latest write-down? And if you can just
give me both the 100% book value and the net to Freeport.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Okay. Jorge, if you look, you can find that on our balance sheet. We've got that detail so
you can see what the balances were at the end of the quarter compared to where it was at year-end. The full cost
accounting rules which we've talked about in the past required that we assess the ceiling each quarter. And it's
important to keep in mind that that's only using proved reserves.
So we've – as Jim talked about during the comments, we have really expanded our resources, those haven't been
converted yet into proved reserves. And the SEC requirements under full cost accounting require us to use a 12-month
trailing average for oil and gas prices. So that's why you saw the charge in the fourth quarter and a subsequent charge in
the first quarter. The trailing number for oil is roughly $83, so we could have if oil prices stay below that, we could
have additional charges in the second and third quarter until the 12-month trailing average is trued up.

But you can see here we've got – on the balance sheet, we've got $6.7 billion in oil and gas properties and that's
essentially the proved reserves and then additional $9.7 billion that's not in the full cost ceiling. And that's net of
depreciation.

<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Yeah. Sorry.
<A - James C. Flores>: Jorge, yeah, just on an operational basis for oil and gas, areas like Holstein Deep, our Vito
basin, our Highlander, all of those are not in our proved category yet. And that's how we can manage our finding costs
and our proved reserve growth going forward. We have a huge pipeline of projects that will become proved this year
and next year and the following year already established.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Right. I'm just trying to sort of get out ahead of what a book value could look like for this
unit at the time of IPO. And we've just run a quick sensitivity if we just hold Brent crude constant over the next four
quarters, and just kind of see what the trailing four quarter historical looks like. It looks like you could still be in for
about another $3 billion of write-downs in 2Q, maybe $1.5 billion in 3Q, and that's not including the stuff you're
proving up, as you're mentioning, that's not in your book value yet. But I'm just trying to get an idea of, if those kind of
order of magnitudes seem correct to you and what kind of book value do you actually see having by 4Q with the puts
and takes.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Jorge, that looks high to us. If we were to have calculated our full cost ceiling test, at the
end of March, using the current strip prices, there would have been approximately a $2 billion incremental higher
write-down at the end of March. The SEC rules wouldn't allow us to do that and – because we have to use this
12-month average. But if you were to go forward and say that strip prices would be realized over the forward, the
numbers would be closer to $2 billion than your $3 billion, $3.5 billion number.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Sure. And that's because I was using spot held constant, not the forward strip. But that is
helpful. And then to Jim's comment earlier, could you give us an order of magnitude of what you think the offsets that
could be coming against those future write-downs would be by the proving up or the conversion of resources to
reserves?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, the aspect that is going to be fully engineered and strictly a feel at this point – the
difference is of having so much of it discovered in the last two years and not – and hit the proved category, the price
function, the actual operating function, and we push out capital like we've been pushing out capital, that slows down
the proved booking process.
So if I can figure out exactly what capital we had with external going forward, what the acceleration of those
developments were and what prices were, I can answer your questions a lot closer than just saying, it's a positive trend.
I think it's the best way to really talk about it because the inventory is full. It's just a matter of all those factors coming
together and what actually gets booked and what doesn't. But the resources are there.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. And, Jorge, I'm sure you understand this, but just to be clear, once you write
something down, even though prices may come back, you have future reserve additions, you don't write it back up
under our accounting system. The book value stays there.
What higher prices or higher reserves would do – and it's important to note that reserves are a function of prices as
well. As prices go higher, economic limits extend and reserve volumes increase, and lower prices put limits on how
much reserves you can add at a particular point in time. But that could tend to offset this $2 billion number we're
talking about. It wouldn't result in write-up of past write-down.
<A - James C. Flores>: And you're going to see our DD&A rate on the oil and gas unit because of the write-down to
be more relevant to our finding cost going forward and we'll be in at reserves at that finding cost which will be
beneficial or par with our DD&A rate versus what it's been at the end of last year was $40-plus and it's going to be in

the $20s because of the write-down, I guess, going forward.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Jorge, this is Jim Bob. Just want to make sure we clarify something. When we talk about
resources if you look at the map or a detailed [indiscernible], the resources that you see there both drilled and undrilled,
the important part of that was again [indiscernible] all those wells have been drilled, that number you see going from 75
million barrels to 270 million barrels, they have logs, pays [indiscernible]. So we have two kinds of resources on these
maps resources that have been drilled and logged and put in the bank, so to speak, but we haven't been able to because
of the full cost rules haven't been able to separate, in other words, [indiscernible] in this category right now.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Fully understood and I appreciate the extra color. And just lastly, Jim, on page 22 of the
PowerPoint, are those projections for the potential tripling of your production based on the assumption that you are
self-funded or is that assuming extra capital comes into the company?
<A - James C. Flores>: That's the latter, assuming extra capital comes in the company. And when it does, it would just
– if it doesn't, if we just self-funded ourselves at a slower pace, that just means it's a slower slope and it would extend
the peak out beyond 2025. So everything just shifts forward in the future years at a slower pace. But we could
accelerate it with the additional funding that comes in.
<Q - Jorge M. Beristain>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And listen, let me just say to everyone, these full cost accounting rules are complicated
and illogical in certain respects in today's world. And so, if you have questions, call David Joint and he will answer
them or he will arrange for our people to walk you through them. So we'll make sure everybody understands what this

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Great. Thanks. First question is on the oil and gas on page 23 of the presentation, we can see
the improvement of EBITDA between additional funding versus without additional funding. But if I increased – if I
incorporate the increased CapEx footnotes under both scenarios, the net number is about a negative $3.9 billion
unlevered free cash flow for 2015 and 2017. So in the context of the impressive IRRs that were laid down on page 15 in
the handout, when should the energy business start generating positive free cash on a standalone basis under those
assumptions?
<A - James C. Flores>: It would be at 2017 at a $74 Brent oil price is the assumption. So if it's not – so if oil is not
$74 at 2017, it would be 2018 and, $74, it's a function of price and also the production scheduling, Brian.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. In 2017, there's still about a $400 million shortfall and this is higher...
<A - James C. Flores>: At these prices, you just have to get...
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: Okay. So, well, I guess, maybe I can ask you, just because the IRRs do look so impressive
because they're a lot higher than what we would typically see for the mining business. And I'm just trying to figure out
where the disconnect is versus the projections versus the more bottoms-up individual project analysis.
<A - James C. Flores>: It's probably in the snapshot of the three years from a standpoint of the scheduling of when the
– what projects are being funded in 2017 that affect 2018/2019 production. So, it's a function of prices and also
production scheduling out there. And when we sold the Eagle Ford and took that big chunk of production out of our
production profile, filling that hole, we can debate a long time when we get it done. But the sooner we fill it with
production, and then we have to worry about price, the simpler our model will become. And the only way to do that is
to schedule our wells being hooked up than we've drilled already at a faster rate with outside funding. So that's the
model and I understand your frustration. But if you can imagine, trying to put together a static model for you guys with
so many moving parts, depending on what capital's coming in the door.

<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah, the other thing we have is, through this period, you see through 2017, we have
existing rig contracts that were contracted for a couple of years back. What we're seeing is costs coming down. And so
we'll be able, post-2017, to do more with less cost. So you'll see the capital expenditure numbers reflecting – longer
term, reflecting lower costs of rigs and service costs, et cetera.

Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions related to the capital spending issue,
and maybe you've already covered some of this. But I just – I still don't understand. On the oil and gas side, CapEx
went up by about $1 billion. Obviously, volumes went up only 10% in 2017.
So my question is actually tied to slide 22. How much of the growth between 2018 and 2020 in oil and gas, on slide 22,
is now covered or whatever by these updated capital spending plans, and how much more CapEx would be needed to
get to the 400 million barrels per day target by 2020? That's my question on the oil and gas side.
And then on the copper side, can you – I missed this – what were the main drivers for the $300 million increase in
copper spending since the last conference call?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, let's see, the second part is we don't have. Dave, what are you focusing on there?
Because we haven't really changed our...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. The copper spending in 2015 is $3.7 billion. That's the same as what it was before.
Actually, we've taken down CapEx in 2016 and 2017 by a total of $300 million. It's $300 million...
<Q - David Gagliano>: All right. So we got that one backwards. So that's helpful.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah.
<Q - David Gagliano>: That answers that one. Okay. And then on the oil and gas side?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Okay.
<A - James C. Flores>: Kathleen, keep going. David, the swing here is you've got two types of capital. You've got
your drilling capital that Kathleen alluded to, the costs are coming down the spread rate. I think we have 10% reduction
this year. 15%, 20% and the 30% as we get past 2017 we're able to reduce the – some of the drilling costs assuming
those costs continue to go down.
But the other big thing is the timing of the completions and the completion capital. That's really our variable capital in
our budget, our discretionary capital. So, I can't emphasize enough, your question is, it's going to be how much we
spend early enough to get the production response so we self-funded with production versus continuing to bleed along
without the capital, without the capital early because if we're going to slow our program down, we could show for the
next – in two years, we could be totally self-funding in 2017 based on the $75 oil price and ramping up production and
close the gap that Brian highlighted. Okay?
All we could we spend four years at a slow pace, spending us less amount of money and continuing to fund the deficit
to get to the same point and we have that flexibility in the assets and that's really the question that we've been wrestling
with here at Freeport is that what's the best thing for the shareholders and that's why we're exploring the external option
for the IPO to accelerate that business, so it becomes self-funding faster versus the longer depths of spend at a slower
burn.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Is there a way just to give a number on 2018 to 2020 incremental capital needed to get
to the 400 million barrels or is that just not...?

<A - James C. Flores>: The incremental capital is a function of what extent – the base plan to what we're talking
about, the current plan or the high growth plan with outside capital?
<Q - David Gagliano>: I'm basically talking about the chart on slide 22. How much capital do you need to get to the
400 million barrels of oil a day by 2020?
<A - James C. Flores>: That would be – from this point forward, it would be as reflected in the numbers here on page
23. It would be the $3.8 billion in 2016 and $3.5 billion in 2017 on eight-eighths basis. And then depending on what –
it's the delta between that would be the additional capital. So we were projecting 2018 through 2020 it'd be self-funding
through the EBITDA growth. I don't have that right in front of me, the EBITDA growth or the EBITDA in 2018 to
2020 but it's not a negative number, it's positive.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay.
<A - James C. Flores>: I'll try to get that to you.

Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Yeah. Good morning.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Good morning.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Jim, I wonder if you can address what the incremental CapEx would be under the funding
scenario. It looks like you're looking for about $1.5 billion of incremental spend in 2016 and 2017. And then can you
also talk about why you're thinking IPO would be more preferable to try to structure either a JV or a partnership on a
project basis.
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, it all depends on what market is out there and so forth. Currently, the market that we see
is the market that has capital in it from a JV basis. But everybody has got a lot of projects to do and there's not a lot of
discretionary capital out there that's very expensive. The private equity market is very expensive as well because they're
recapping a lot of their existing business. We're just looking for the best form of capital. I mean, we've got a fabulous
growth profile on our business. We drilled the well and have taken the risk.
We're not going to certainly not going to give them away just because we don't want to borrow all the money. Here,
that's not the prerogative. We want to make sure we find the lowest, cheapest cost of capital and with the best benefits
and the benefits we get in the visibility for all of our shareholders to what we've achieved and the performance for oil
and gas business along with what we think is an inexpensive form of equity for Freeport-McMoRan in the form of
equity at FM O&G makes some sense.
Again, like Richard said, we're studying it. We hope to have go through this process. But right now, it looks the most
favorable because the industry just issued $8 billion of equity here into a pretty dynamic environment. So, right now,
that's a very viable entity for us and we're encouraged by a lot of the investment banks to pursue it.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Curt, let me – this is Jim Bob – let me go ahead and augment on this. These three
[indiscernible] especially on the deepwater side are going to be magnets [indiscernible]. As people buy leases out there
including ourself [indiscernible] or the tolling agreement with people, they buy leases – the difference is the lead-time
because the time, if they make a discovery and build their own facility, five-year period, we've got 250,000 barrels a
day capacity out there.
So to answer your question, today, we may make one assessment that the equity is the right way. The partnerships you
talked about, they generate themselves. But my comment again, just think about the platform as a magnet because

there's no other facility – there's no better out there. People have to make their decisions, do you want to go to
Freeport's platform and you want to wait five years to finish your step-on production. It's a huge advantage for us.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. Thanks, Jim Bob. And then, Richard, just a question on Indonesia. Can you comment
on kind of how the discussions are going with the MoU and specifically what the plan would be for the sell-down of
PT-FI? As I understand, I think the new mining law requires an additional 19% to 20% stake reduction with the
government having the first right to acquire that. So I'm just curious on where that stands and how do you think that
could be resolved potentially.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, that is one of the points that's covered in the MoU, and the government has
regulations that apply to different types of mining arrangements they have to existing mines and so forth. In terms of
our working with the government and reconciling our contracted work, which requires no divestitures and the
government's new regulations, the MoU reflects a mutual agreement that we would increase the current 9.36% interest
owned by the government to 30% over time.
And as you said, the way that that would be approached, that would be part of the set of points that we would agree to
in getting the extension of our rights to operate under acceptable fiscal terms is that would then be pursued over time in
steps. The agreement is that that sale would be at fair value, and the first step would be offering it to the government.
We've talked about having a piece of that ultimately through a listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, and the
government officials have expressed positive aspects of that. The province of Papua has indicated an aspiration to own
some interest and we've done some financial structures to accomplish that. All of this would come into play as part of
reaching a resolution of the long-term operating rights that we have but the MoU covers the extent of the future
divestiture.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just, Richard, wanted to get back to the – and
Jim, I wanted to get back to the oil and gas question that a couple of people asked. And if I may, you increased your
CapEx from 2015 to 2017 by $1.6 billion. With that increasing CapEx, will we get to – again slide 22 has
approximately 225,000 barrels a day which my math is about 82 million barrels a year of oil equivalent. Can we
assume that that's the figure that you're looking for in 2018?
<A - James C. Flores>: Under the growth plan, yes, with the additional capital. That's correct.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: So this is not something that is committed to in the future growth plan, it's an
opportunity for us and we're going to be assessing whether – what we've given you in our budget plans that's part of the
presentation is where we are today with our capital spending plans. We have opportunities provided we can get capital
through a variety of sources. Curt mentioned the joint venture opportunity with other companies, so whether there's
financing at a property level, whether there's financing available at the entity level. And if we're able, Oscar, to get
funding on a reasonable basis to pursue the growth plan, the chart that you're referring to is what would be achieved
under that plan.
If we aren't able to – if we conclude that the cost of capital is too expensive, then we will give you guidance as to how
that would work out under our base plan and the opportunities won't go away. It's like the projects we suspended in
2008 in our mining business. Cerro Verde was being pursued before that. We suspended it. It didn't go away and now
we developed it later.
So, we have rights to these resources that are long term and we'll be managing how we spend money, how we finance
that spending in a way that's responsive to market conditions and marketing conditions are changing, as we speak. And
so, we're going to have our fingers on all these sources of financing and we'll make decisions and we'll advise the

market as to what the consequences of those decisions would be as we go forward.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. And maybe if I ask the question this way, on slide 31, you have oil and gas expenditures
in 2015, 2016 and 2017 at $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion, and $2.9 billion, this, compared to the last presentation is $1.6
billion more.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: So, you're presenting, in 2017, oil and gas sales of $63 million – or, sorry, 63 million barrels.
So with the additional capital that we increased from last time we talked in the conference call to now, will that give
you additional production of oil and gas in 2018? I assume so, and I'm just trying to assess what's the level. Is the level
the one that you're showing in slide 22? And I can appreciate that there's opportunities, but...
<A - James C. Flores>: Regarding slide 23, Oscar, 23...
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Yeah.
<A - James C. Flores>: ...slide 23, well, that's the current – the current plan on top with the current – our current
funding that's reflected on page 31 reflects the volumes from the current plan. And this is what I was talking about, is if
we continue to put off the completion and hook-up in facilities needed to add new production as we drill it – we've
already drilled in the last two years – then we will not see it show up in the production numbers. Okay? It will be what's
in the current plan, that production isn't going anywhere like Richard was talking about and it will take longer years
four and five to get all that production on. So on a three-year outlook, you'll miss some of that production.
If we raise the additional funds and we're able to put the wells on that we've already drilled on a timely basis, then you
will see the graphs at the lower portion where it grows 143 MBOE per day to 217 MBOE per day and the additional
funding required. And our variable funding there is the completion dollars which affects the timing. And that's when I
think it was David or Curt or whoever wanted 2018 through 2020, we'll give it to you where you can see the reflection.
Basically, in the current plan, we would hit the same 217 MBOE per day a few years further out because of the
distillate spending in that funding.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Then, on – in terms of the equity raise or potential equity raise, I'm
assuming based on your comments that this will be done at the oil and gas business level. How much, or have you
thought about up to what level Freeport-McMoRan, the holding company, would be willing to dilute of its holdings in
the oil and gas business?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Oscar, we are under some restrictions, under the securities laws about how much we can
talk about details prior to filing a registration statement and getting SEC review. We can say this. Freeport-McMoRan
Oil & Gas would retain a significant majority interest in that – FCX would retain a significant majority interest in
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. And the amount of the offering and the terms of it would be dependent on market
conditions, when we're ready to enter the market, and we cannot do that for a number of months now because of the
procedural requirements of SEC review.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Then lastly, just if I may, just a comment and a question. So the comment is just I
wanted to extend congratulations to Red Conger and team for the achievements in Cerro Verde. I think it's been a
remarkable project. And then the question, you have a comment here on your release, talking about the MoU in
Grasberg. And it says, no terms of the COW other than those relating to export duties, a smelter bond and increased
royalties will be changed. Can you clarify that? Like, is the government still trying to increase royalties?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, no.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Or change the bond limit?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me clarify that. Those were agreed to – last summer, when we signed the original
MoU, we agreed to increase royalties to the current royalties under the mining law and there is no further adjustments
to that. We also agreed to put up a surety bond of $115 million to demonstrate our seriousness about pursuing the

smelter deal. There's no adjustment to that. And then we agreed to pay an export duty on a sliding scale, all of that was
agreed to in the summer of 2014 and none of those terms were changed when we extended the MoU in January and
they're not – we're not being approached for further changes along those lines.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay, great. No, thanks very much for your answers.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Oscar, this is Jim Bob. I wanted to give you a little color on questions you asked about the
capital necessary to get production rates up. Let me just set the setting for you. We have these platforms that we keep
talking about that have been built, $6 billion worth of platforms just sitting there waiting for production to be increased
because of unused capacity.
In the interim time between acquisition and what we've done to-date, we now drilled wells that are sitting there with
hundreds of feet of pay and it's a question of not guessing what the reserves are going to be, if the resource has been
drilled.
So we have the platforms sitting there. We have the wells sitting there that are drilled. And the question mark is how
much money do you spend? What's the cost of the capital to get the oil from the well on to the platform that's already
been built, already in our cost that we paid for it in the acquisition. We're geniuses around here, do extraordinary
things. The mission impossible is, it is a – what's the right decision sitting here today because that's going to be depend
on what the price of oil does. So you understand the difference between the risk factor, the platforms we built, the wells
are drilled. It's just a question of when we hit them up.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: No, just – all right, understood. Just coming from doing about 15 years of mining research oil
and gas is new and we're just learning about this risk. And it looks from a distance, it looks that oil and gas and
deepwater is a lot more riskier than onshore. And that's why we're trying to establish the parameters to give you the
right value for those assets. But thank you for your comments.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Well, it's a good thing you have a good teacher, and Jim Bob is the best teacher in oil and gas
that you've ever heard of.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Good morning, my question is going to be on capital, too. But I just want to go back to
the Grasberg capital. You've cut the five-year forecast, your share from $700 million to $600 million. But then you
make a comment that there's an additional $300 million a year for the next five years for underground ore handling, et
cetera. My first question on that is that all yours or does Rio Tinto fund some of that?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Rio Tinto does fund some of that, Brian. The percentage varies depending on their share of
production. And that's nothing new. Those numbers were always in our plan. You see in the CapEx schedule is that
we've reduced some of the CapEx in 2016 and 2017. That is related to timing of some of those expenditures that we've
pushed out. But those capital expenditures from mill modifications and power upgrades have always been part of our
plan.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Right. So that's what I thought but then it is fairly back-end-loaded, so a lot of that
spending would if I'm trying to look out things out in 2018 to be much higher numbers out in 2018 as you spent,
instead of like $600 million a year, you'd be spending closer $1 billion a year so think of it that way?

<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. I mean, as we do – we're planning when we need to do these mill modifications and
pyrite handling and power upgrade, and we're going do it prudently and with an eye on trying to match it up with when
we ultimately needed. But yeah, we'll have – some of those expenditures will be higher from 2018-2019 timeframe.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: And do you need – so the forecast you're giving us for those years 2019 to 2021, because
like the production figures have moved around a little bit. Do you need to do that to get to those numbers that you're
talking but, i.e., if you don't do this, will production be lower because of some complex metallurgy or something, or do
you need to do this for sure just to get to those forecast levels?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah, what we need to do them and what we need to do is reflected in our long range plans.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: But some of this has been adjusted because the completion of the pit was originally
supposed to occur end of 2016.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's been extended. The pyrite processing does not affect all of the new ore that we will
have from the underground. It's needed for certain of the Grasberg Block Cave ore. We need it long range for the
Kucing Liar ore body, which has high pyrite content. And so as we look at issues of copper markets and physical
activities, we adjust some of those things through our mine planning. It's in our interest to defer these costs until they're
absolutely needed. And so that's what we're going through right now and that's some of the adjustments that you're
seeing.
But the important news is that the planned capital expenditures for this project really aren't changing. As we go
forward, our plan is being shown to be the right plan. And as we go forward, we get some changing economics. It gives
us some changing cost estimates because of the effects of worldwide global energy cost and the lower cost of steel and
things like that.
So, we have some impact, not a huge impact from currency changes. So – but the basic plan has not changed. What
we're going to do? A little bit of change to when we're going to do it and some effect on the absolute amount of the cost
because of the changing global commodity prices.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Great. Thank you very much for that color. That's helpful.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Let me – this is Jim Bob. Let me address something [indiscernible]. I should say that
deepwater and the onshore gives me a chance to talk about the Highlander well producing there. The Highlander well
which I haven't been talking about it much of the detail [indiscernible] situation with big structures and good reservoir.
The Tuscaloosa sand that we perforated at 28,500 feet is the largest well to ever been completed since the Mobil Bay.
Mobil Bay if you may remember was a 47 TCF field and was such a big part of the ExxonMobil transaction at the time
of the merger was made there, they put their interests together.
And based on the performance of this well, a lot of it has been flowing now for almost three months but it shuts in at
19,500 pounds of pressure which is the highest setting pressure ever recorded on an onshore well. The structure, now
that we've been flowing around for three months, what you call the permeability calculation, this well has had no
drawdown. We've tested it as high as 75 million a day and produces at the same rate, 100 million a day. This is just like
the Mobil Bay. The reason why that's important is Mobil Bay was recompleted about 10 years ago. And now they have
flowed these wells and some of the wells we're producing over 250 BCF and are projected to produce 400 BCF. So we
appear to have a reservoir similar to the Mobil Bay reservoir and these structures cover anywhere from 30,000 acres to
60,000 acres.
So we have spent five years, becoming experts in deep drilling – in the deep potential and this whole trend is 200 miles
wide, has been opened up by this Highlander. Prices of natural gas are down a little. But when you got people and these
export terminals, these gas to liquid projects, they're going to have to have 500 million cubic feet of gas a day to 700
million cubic feet of gas a day, because of the lack in exploration for gas because everybody is worried about the gas

price. Folks in oil exploration, when they look up and see they've got to have 500 million cubic feet of gas a day to 700
million cubic feet of gas a day, I'm reminded of the time when we drilled a discovery of 1.25 million cubic feet of gas a
day in 1981, an offset to our lease that has – the lease was owned by Gulf and Amoco, and they were having to provide
a contract that they had with Florida Gas for 300 million cubic feet of gas a day and they were having to pay for – they
were having to sell at $0.35 an MCF. The well we drilled offsets it, was deregulated natural gas. We sold the gas for $9
an MCF.
So this should tell you that the margins have a funny way of turning on you and when people make these commitments,
to be able to deliver gasoline – or export gas or LNG, and you start looking for 500 million cubic feet of gas a day to
700 million cubic feet of gas a day, you better know your numbers right.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Next question, operator.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Again, coming back to the
questions around the CapEx, I think a lot of us are still having trouble understanding what the rationale is for increasing
your base case CapEx for the oil and gas business by $1.6 billion over the next three years when the incremental impact
to your production over that same timeframe is relatively negligible. Thank you.
<A - James C. Flores>: Again, Orest, it's timing. The aspect of delaying the completions – we increased the CapEx for
a couple of reasons. Let's talk about that first off. The discoveries at Power Nap, the additional drilling there, the
acceleration of offset exploitation projects like Deep Sleep by the operator that obviously we're going to participate in
because of the low-risk nature of it, and the de-risking by the Power Nap well. Also, when we drill our exploratory
wells like Farthest Gate West, we risk them at 25% success.
So when they're successful, we have to complete them, we have to add capital in for that. We've also taken – we're
going to take a delivery of an additional drill ship called the Rowan Relentless here in the late third quarter to drill
development wells around the Horn Mountain area to further make our operation out there more efficient. And we have
to shut those – we're going to have to shut that platform in for the facility modifications.
Those types of things are making our operation more efficient and making our reserve replacement more achievable
and building our business over the long term. You're not seeing it in the first three years with dynamic production
growth because we're delaying a lot of the completion dollars for those projects because of budget concerns.
So the whole exercise on page 23 that everybody is struggling with is that if we would spend the money to complete the
wells earlier than what we planned in our current plan, and we had the capital to do it, we would see those production
adjustments in 2017 as per the bottom part of page 23 versus the current plan we have on the top part of the page. It's
strictly a production timing issue, and we're going to get back – David Joint will have some information on 2018, 2019,
and 2020 where you can see the rest of the production profile.
So if we have the additional capital, we're able to accelerate those hook-ups, not the drilling, not the risk and so forth of
drilling wells – it's strictly hooking them up and the capital involved there – then you'll see the production response
within the three-year period.
But under the current plan that we have, that's on the prudent finance plan of allocating capital, reducing our CapEx
company-wide, we're taking a more measured approach bringing that capital forward. And if the contango curve and
the oil curve is correct that we're in a $70 oil market in a couple of years, that's going to be much more beneficial to
delay that production coming on because of price going forward. So that was the magic of it. Does that help clear it up?
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: It does, to some extent. But perhaps, can you quantify, this $1.6 billion? How much
incremental production does that give you, say, in 2018 versus the three months ago forecast?

<A - James C. Flores>: It would give you another 30,000 barrels a day.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. But that's not the story. Let's take the success we've had in the Vito basin area as
an example. I mean, we acquired an interest in this area that Shell has been working on a development plan. Together
with Shell, we drilled this Power Nap well that's had tremendous amount of new information about the geology in that
area and it's a very positive well. It's leading us now to look to develop to drill another exploration-type well called
Deep Sleep which will provide us significant new information which has been de-risked significantly and has the
chance of identifying a huge structure there.
So the information that we get from Power Nap and Deep Sleep could change the whole idea about how to develop that
Vito Basin area. In best case – in best case, for developing that, that's going to take a number of years because this is
the case where we have to put in new production facilities. It's not tying back to these existing production facilities.
And so, this has similarities to making decisions for major mine development. First, you have to understand the
geology. You have to develop – you have to come up with a development plan for it. That development plan takes a
number of years to put in place. So the increment that has been added to capital expenditures because of the success at
Power Nap and the Vito basin area is going to lead us to spend some more capital to understand what we have, how it
should be developed, and make decisions on development and so that production is not going to come on stream for a
number of years.
<A - James C. Flores>: And that's illustrated on page 22 and 2019 is when Vito area starts producing and in 2020 it
starts growing very fast to illustrate exactly what Richard just said.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And we still don't know because when we drill this Deep Sleep well, that may provide
us some new insights as to how to develop this whole area. So it's something that's unfolding. It takes time and it's not
going to be a question like some of hookups that Jim was talking about that have production consequences much
quicker. But this is a major, major development project that could be one of the biggest projects in the entire Deepwater
Gulf of Mexico.
<A - James C. Flores>: It's net 1 billion barrels for the company.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Okay. Thank you very much. And just one more question on CapEx, how much incremental
CapEx should we assume will be spent on the smelter in Indonesia which I assume is not in your guidance here?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: No, it's not something where capital will be spent of significance until post-2016
because of the permitting time and so forth with that. In order to give you a sense of that, to think of the smelter project
because we've come up with an approach of expanding, not necessarily expanding, making a bolt-on type addition to
our existing smelter at Gresik with partner, Mitsubishi.
Being – an expenditure on the order of $2 billion, with working capital or something maybe slightly more than that.
And so, our plans would be to obtain project-type financing for a majority of those costs. And then there would be the
underlying equity that would be funded by a partnership structure which we would have the major part of, but we
would have other partners coming in and we're negotiating that. And so, our share of that project's cost would be a
portion of the underlying equity for the project financing for the majority of that cost and that construction at best
would be started in late 2016 or early 2017.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Okay. And Rio would be responsible for their kind of proportionate share of that as well. Is
that correct?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: You know, Rio – I'm not sure everybody on the call knows that Rio is our partner now
and their interest in Grasberg steps up to 40%...
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: ...post 2021. And so they would have an interest in seeing that we come up with an
arrangement for – with the government for extending beyond 2021. We're in discussions, we have a great partnership

with Rio and we are talking with them about how best to proceed. We don't have an agreement on that now but I'm
confident we'll get one that will be good for all of us.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Okay. But it sounds like you're suggesting that we should not assume that Rio is planning to
fund 40% of it or am I misunderstanding?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Mitsubishi is a potential partner. There is other potential partners out there. You
shouldn't assume that we're going to fund 60% of it. So we're at the stage right now of working with a Japanese
construction firm on the construction contract. We're working with the land owner which is an adjacent fertilizer
operator where we have an additional deal with on land ownership rights and sulfuric acid offtake. We're working
through permitting, so there is a lot of work to be going forward.
Let's go back to your original question about capital spending. We're not looking at $2 billion of capital coming to
Freeport; we're looking at a smaller amount coming in over years in the future. And we'll update you as we go forward
in getting the details and structure of this project completed.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Great.
<A - James R. Moffett>: Let me just be sure that you understand. The change in the export that took place last year
[indiscernible], it wasn't just for the cracker. It was for cracker aluminum, zinc, et cetera, what this means is, just to add
to Richard's comments, the smelters that are sitting in Japan today [indiscernible] means that you can't take ore from
Indonesia into the Japanese smelter without paying a big export tax.
So that means that the Japanese are sitting there with their smelters with no feed. So this is not just a problem for the
exporter, the miner, this is a problem that's caused a complete restructuring of the market. In other words, to make it
simple, everybody understands that these smelters have been there for 100 years in Japan and other places are going to
have feed. What Indonesia is doing – we're not going to let you export without a huge tax which is not an optimal
contract to work. That's why these negotiations are still in the womb. So the smelters don't have a slam dunk just to say
well, [indiscernible] huge problem having an island that has no minerals on it and yet it has the downstream part of the
business. So that's why it's so hard right now to say who's going to find what because this is not just one guy's problem,
everybody has got the same problem. It's a complete restructuring of how the business is doing between the concentrate
and the smelter.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Thank you for that color.
Operator
Our last question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Thank you. I had two questions on Grasberg. One, based on your conversation with the
government so far, do you get a sense that they are open to renew your contract sooner than 2019 as long as there's an
agreement on other issues like divestment, et cetera?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes. That's our mutual objective, and we are working towards that. And the issue is –
and we're working on that happening this year, sooner this year than later, and the government officials we're working
on recognize that as well.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. And out of the total CapEx this year, how much are you spending at Grasberg including
sustained CapEx?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let's see, it's...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: The...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: ...around $600 million?

<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: The underground capital is in the $800 million range and sustaining is in the $200 million
range.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. And actually just one last one. I know you've given in the past some sort of guidance
for the cash cost at Grasberg when you go completely underground. Can you just remind us what that number is?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. Well, the guidance we've given is based on getting the full capacity. So, in the earlier
years, as we're ramping up, it will be higher. But at current gold prices, we continue to expect that Grasberg
underground will be the lowest cost in our portfolio and certainly less than $0.50 a pound. So we're not seeing huge
changes in the open pit cost versus underground because of the nature of underground mining and the absence of
stripping.
So we've got a very good cost structure, large scale, it will be similar to the track record you've seen with Grasberg over
the years.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: With all of this noise that we've had to deal with for the past several years, none of us
here lose sight of just what a fabulous ore body this is. I mean, it's really special in terms of the copper grade and gold
grade that you have available to us. The ability to operate large scale Block Caving operations is spectacular. We're
moving towards having a 250,000 ton per day concentrator mill built totally by underground operations. And that's
unique in this industry. And we've shown that we can operate Block Cave scales, Freeport's been Block Caving there
since the early 1980s in our DOZ mines and its predecessors at shallower elevations have had years of successful
operations. So we have the kind of ore, the kind of host rock that allows us to operate at truly world-leading scale to get
to this high grade ore and the rates of return on this project are spectacular.
<A - James R. Moffett>: And this is Jim Bob again, we just think about it this way, you've been operating in an open
pit, and in an open pit you have to mine both [indiscernible] and ore because you can't just make a straight hole with a
pipe underground. When you get into blockading, the country rock that surrounds your ore are all very substantial. It's
metamorphic rock and when you start the blockade, all you do is get the ore that falls out of this blockade, you don't
have to deal with all the waste. So imagine being in that open pit in the [indiscernible] with all these trucks running
around versus having to just sit there and scratch the bottom of this blockade [indiscernible] that you have to first blast
and then truck out of there and find a place to put it. It's been an enormous part of our open pit mine but that's because
you have to build the pit wall before you [indiscernible] so you can really see the angle of repose.
And when you look at it years from now, when you go into that underground mine, if you look up, you don't see a big
shot hole that goes up [indiscernible]. So that's why you have the change. It sounds like – people, historically, thought
underground was more expensive with the size of this ore body and the purity of the ore not having to mine that waste
changes the whole impression of how many trucks you need, how many people you need. But remember, you're
operating underground, it doesn't rain underground, there's no [indiscernible] underground.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. And for the industry as a whole, underground mining is a lot more expensive. But
that's a unique characteristic of this Grasberg ore body is that we are able to mine such large volumes of high grade ore
and reduce that unit cost down to depending on diesel fuel and so forth, the levels that are – and the price of gold, levels
that are consistent with our historical price cost levels there. So, it's great asset.
Richard C. Adkerson
Listen, we appreciate everybody's participation in, I think, a record setting length of a conference call. But we had a lot
to talk about today. We want to make sure that in the context of these commodity markets and the changes in our plans
that you understood what our assets are that we have to work with, what options we have to do, how we are
approaching it. We're going to have, as I've said, our fingers on all aspects of the markets for commodities, the markets
for capital that are available to us, and we're going to find the right alternatives to go forward and achieve our strategic
objectives creating value out of these assets.
