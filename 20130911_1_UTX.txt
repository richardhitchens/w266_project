Good. Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. You saw in the press release this morning, no surprises. UTC
closed out a transformational 2012, just as Louis laid out for you in December. Full-year sales were just under $58
billion. That was up 4% from 2011. That, of course, was driven by the Goodrich and IAE acquisitions. Earnings per
share was $5.35 and that included about $0.50 of headwind from FX, pension and E&D. For the year, Goodrich is only
about $0.06 dilutive, a little better than what we had expected due to lower amortization, financing and one-time deal
costs, and more importantly, better underlying performance in the Goodrich business.
Free cash flow was again strong at 108% of net income attributable to common share owners and we paid down about
third of the Goodrich debt just as we had planned. As we all know, 2012 was a challenging global economic
environment, and while there is still plenty of uncertainty ahead for 2013 in both Europe and the U.S., we have seen
signs of stabilization, particularly in Europe and we started to see a gradual recovery in the U.S. economy, led by a
rebound in housing market. And we continue to expect solid growth in emerging markets throughout the coming year.
As you have come to expect from UTC, we just didn't wait for the economy to recover. We proactively leveraged our
scale and optimized our cost structure while we continued to invest in game-changing technologies, all the while
transforming the portfolio to take advantage of the growth opportunities over the next decade in our core markets of
aerospace and commercial buildings.
We also took the difficult actions this past year, reducing our structural overhead costs and focusing on global growth
markets. In 2012, we invested nearly $600 million in restructuring, of which $258 million was in the fourth quarter
alone, as the businesses continued to find solid payback projects to reduce costs and position us for earnings growth
this year and beyond.
Okay, slide two. Turning to fourth quarter results. Total sales increased 14%, again, driven by Goodrich and IAE.
Organic sales were flat in the quarter, a slight improvement from our third quarter results. Segment operating profit was
also flat, although Climate, Controls & Security had a very strong quarter with 17% operating profit growth on flat
organic sales.
As expected, Sikorsky did not ship any of the Canadian maritime helicopters in the fourth quarter, but we did record a
charge of $157 million related to costs associated with the program delay as we now expect. While we are continuing
discussions with the Canadian government, we're also encouraged by the progress we have made since Louis spoke to
you in December. Nothing new to report today, but we are cautiously optimistic and Mick will provide you with a full
update in March. We're also maintaining our place order of eight aircraft deliveries for 2013 at Sikorsky and there is no
change in the projected P&L impact of those deliveries. If you recall, that's a loss of lot about $14 million per aircraft.
Right, back to Q4. Segment operating margins was down 200 basis points with the CMHP charge and Goodrich
acquisition, each accounting for about 100 basis points of the headwind. Restructuring, savings and productivity
benefits offset $140 million of headwind from pension, E&D and FX.
Fourth quarter earnings per share were $1.04. That includes $0.25 of restructuring and one-time charges. The
restructuring was spread across the business units, including $75 million of UTC Aerospace Systems, as they continue
to make good progress with the Goodrich integration. Excluding restructuring and one-time items in the fourth quarter
of both years, earnings per share decreased about 9%.
Tax rate was 30.1%, a little better than we expected back in December, but still a $0.08 headwind versus last year. Free
cash flow, very strong, 139% of net income, great performance, especially as we contributed nearly $200 million in
cash for international pension plans.
Okay. Moving to slide three, order trends. As you can see, they are showing signs of improvement. Pratt & Whitney's
large commercial spare orders were up 46% in the quarter, including the additional share of IAE. Excluding that
incremental share, Pratt's orders were down 8%, following the 21% decline in the third quarter.
Legacy Hamilton Sundstrand commercial spares orders were down 4% following a 6% decline in the third quarter, but
importantly book-to-bill for both Pratt and Aerospace Systems was over 1% for the quarter. So the rate of decline has
moderated at the Aerospace unit and we saw a good order growth across the commercial businesses in the fourth

quarter.
UTC Climate, Controls & Securities, North American residential HVAC orders were up 20%. Global commercial
HVAC orders grew 7% in constant currency. And at Otis, new equipment orders were up 13% on the same basis. And
importantly, Otis saw new equipment orders in China grow 17% at constant currency as they continue to gain
momentum there. Orders also grew in North America, up 18%, while not surprisingly, Europe was down slightly. We
also saw a solid growth in emerging markets. Combined BRIC orders for the commercial business units were up 11%
this quarter. So order trends broadly improving, a good leading indicator for UTC's return to organic growth in 2013.
I'll come back in a second to talk about 2013, but let me turn it over to Jay to take you through the business unit results.
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Thanks, Greg. Turning to Page 4. Otis operating profit was down 5% on flat sales in the quarter. Foreign currency
translation reduced sales and profit by 1 and 2 points respectively. Operating margin was 21.9%, 110 basis points lower
than prior year. At constant currency, new equipment sales were down slightly as growth in China and the Americas
was offset by declines in Europe and the rest of Asia. Service was up low single digit led by growth in modernization
and contractual maintenance.
Lower volume and continued pricing pressure in Europe more than offset the benefit of ongoing cost reduction and
profit growth in the rest of the world. As Greg mentioned, at constant currency, new equipment orders were up 13%
with double-digit growth in all areas except Europe where orders were down slightly. China orders for the quarter were
up 17%, solid improvement after being down 11% over the first three quarters of the year.
For the full year, profit was down 7% on 3% lower sales. At constant currency, profit fell 3% on flat sales. We expect
the improving new equipment order rates, especially in China, and the aggressive cost reduction and restructuring
actions taken over the past year to result in a return to profit growth in 2013.
On slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security drove profits up 17% on 6% lower sales, resulting in another sharp increase in
margins, up 270 basis points from prior year to 13.7%. Organic sales were flat overall with mixed results across the
businesses. Mid-single digit growth in the Americas led by solid growth in residential HVAC was offset by low double
digit and mid-single digit declines in Transicold and the U.S. security business respectively.
Asia and EMEA were flattish. CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth despite flat organic sales. Profit
growth was driven by restructuring and productivity, including savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire &
Security, lower commodity costs, and a $22 million special dividend from a distribution partner.
Global commercial HVAC orders were up 7%, driven by a sharp uptick in China toward the end of the year. Transicold
orders were flattish with container down about 10%, offset by growth in Europe and North America truck trailer.
Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were down high single digit, given economic conditions in that region,
while orders for global fire and security products were up low single digit.
Current order rates are consistent with our expectations for a gradual resumption of organic sales growth at CCS this
year. For the full-year 2012, CCS grew earnings by 116 million or 5% on flat organic sales. With operating margin at
14.1%, up 190 basis points from prior year, CCS is well positioned to achieve 15% margin in 2013, two years ahead of
target.
Turning to Aerospace on slide 6, at Pratt & Whitney, sales were up 12% in the fourth quarter, driven by the
consolidation of IAE and the AeroPower business. Organically, sales were down 4% year-over-year as higher military,
Pratt & Whitney Canada and Power System sales were more than offset by lower commercial aftermarket. Large
commercial spare sales were down 18% organically year-over-year. On a reported basis, large commercial spares were
up 30%, including consolidated IAE sales.
Operating profit in the quarter was down 25%. The impact from lower organic sales of large commercial spares on
favorable engine mix and higher E&D and pension costs were partially offset by the benefits from the IAE

consolidation and restructuring savings. Also, the prior year included a benefit of about $0.04 from a contract
termination. Commercial spares orders were down 8% organically and up 46%, including the benefit from the IAE
consolidation.
Embraer's recent selection of the GTF to power the second generation E-Jet family is another significant endorsement
of the technology. Even with the small incremental E&D from this win, Pratt & Whitney still expects to increase profit
by 100 to 150 on mid to high single digit sales growth in 2013.
UTC Aerospace Systems, which includes the Hamilton Sundstrand business and the full quarter of Goodrich, finished
the year strong with sales in the quarter of 3.2 billion and operating profit of 339 million. Organic sales in the quarter
were up 4% with OEM sales up high single digit, commercial aftermarket up mid-single digit, and military aftermarket
down mid-single digit. On a pro forma basis, Goodrich sales in the quarter were flattish. Orders for commercial spares
were up sequentially, both at the legacy Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich businesses.
Organic operating profit in the quarter at Aerospace Systems was flattish with the benefit of higher volume offset by
higher E&D and pension cost. The EPS impact from Goodrich in the quarter was neutral to UTC's results.
Turning to Sikorsky on slide 8, operating profit decreased 20% on 3% higher sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky
shipped a total of 91 aircraft. 77 aircraft were based on military platforms and 14 commercial. Higher sales were driven
by international military and commercial aircraft volumes, partially offset by lower after-market sales and the absence
of two Canadian maritime helicopters in 2011. Operating profit benefited from the higher international military and
commercial aircraft deliveries, but was more than offset by the charge taken on the CMH program.
For the year, Sikorsky delivered 243 aircraft. Including the CMH charge, operating profit of 765 million was down 7%
on 8% lower sales. Accordingly, we are updating Sikorsky's 2013 operating profit guidance. We now expect profit to
be down 100 million to 150 million versus our prior guidance of down 250 million to 300 million.
Despite the earnings decline in 2013, Sikorsky is well positioned. We announced 10.9 billion of orders in 2012 and
ended the year with a record backlog of over 14 billion, including Denmark's selection of our MH-60R for its Maritime
Helicopter Replacement Program and orders for more than 35 aircraft in the fourth quarter.
With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks, Jay. So close to 2012, that was essentially in line with our expectations, and importantly, order rates
coming out of the fourth quarter that give us confidence as we head into 2013.
Before I talk about 2013, let me just spend a minute on some of the accomplishments for 2012. And obviously 2012
was a transformational year for UTC as we repositioned the portfolio to focus on those key growth markets of
aerospace and commercial buildings, but the business has had some other big accomplishments.
Pratt & Whitney made great progress in developing the GTF and bringing this disruptive technology to market. We've
now completed nearly 4,200 hours and more than 12,400 cycles of full engine testing. We recently completed the final
significant test on the C-Series engine, including the FAA mandated 150-hour endurance test and we expect to certify
this engine shortly.
As you saw, the GTF's also been selected to power Embraer's second-generation E-Jet family, the fifth airfreight
manufacturer to use our technology. This is a big win for Pratt & Whitney and solidifies our position in the regional jet
market well into the future. And with nearly 3,000 firm and option engines in backlog, airline customers have
embraced the lower fuel burn, emissions, noise and operating cost of the GTF technology.
At UTC Aerospace Systems, the integration of Goodrich is progressing well. We've deployed a customer-facing
organization with a single point of contact for our key customers around the globe and we've conducted integrated
program reviews with many of these customers. We're developing new solutions based on the best technology from

each of the legacy organizations and we've achieved over $60 million in cost synergies in 2012 and we're well on pace
to achieve nearly half of the $400 million of synergies by the end of this year. At Sikorsky, we secured Black Hawk
demand for the next five years of the multiyear eight contract, part of a record $10.9 billion in orders at Sikorsky in
2012.
The Climate, Controls & Security team integrated the Carrier and Fire & Security businesses seamlessly. Nearly $100
million in savings in 2012 helped CCS grow operating profit 5% despite flat organic sales. With 14.1% operating
margins, they're well ahead of their schedule on their goal to 15% by 2015.
And Otis continues to regain momentum in China. Although new equipment sales declined 2% in 2012, orders grew
17% in the fourth quarter, as Otis continues to win significant projects such as the Guangzhou Fortune Center, where
we will install 49 elevators including Gen2 and Double-Deck units. Otis is well positioned in China, entering 2013 with
a $1.5 billion backlog. So good progress at the business units, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment in
2012.
As we look at 2013, really not much changed the expectations that Louis laid out in December. We continue to expect
2013 earnings per share of 5.85 to 6.15 on sales of 64 billion to 65 billion. That's organic growth of 3% to 5%.
We have had some positive development since our December meeting. The pension cost came in a little better than
expected with a discount rate of 3.9 versus our plan of 3.8 and we had a planned return last year, the domestic plan of
14% and there are two pieces of tax extenders that were passed as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act in January,
which will benefit us in '13.
First, the benefit from the 2012 E&D extenders will provide us with a first quarter pre-tax benefit of around $100
million. This will drop the tax rate in the quarter and offset some of our restructuring investments this year. For the
year, we now expect $300 million of restructuring offset by one-time gains, so that's up from the previous estimate of
200 million. The 2012 piece of the tax extenders will partially offset a tough compare in the first quarter 2011, which
you'll recall, had $0.21 of gain on excessive restructuring. The second piece of the tax extenders, the 2013 benefit, will
be booked throughout the year and will reduce our 2013 tax rate to about 29% versus our initial expectation of 29.5%.
We're also keeping an eye on FX. Europe remains a question mark, but we have seen some recent upside to our plan of
euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.28 with euro averaging about 1.32 so far, so a little bit of good news.
So in summary, we've seen good news on pension, FX and the tax extenders. So that gives us some additional
contingency for 2013, but I'll just remind everybody, it is early and there's still a lot of uncertainty in some of our key
end markets, particularly Europe in the aerospace after-market.
Our plan, as you recall, is based on 3% to 5% organic growth. And although order trends have been improving,
commercial spares have yet to attain our growth assumption of mid-single digit at Pratt and about 10% at Aerospace
Systems. And with the continued fiscal uncertainty in Washington and the threat of sequestration, we remain cautious
early in the year.
Turning to cash flow, very strong close to 2012 with free cash flow at 108% of net income for the year. We made
significant progress on debt reduction, delivered on our commitment by paying down about a third of the Goodrich
related debt in 2012. We paid down the $2 billion term loan, nearly all of the commercial paper and about $800 million
of the Goodrich debt.
In 2013, the combination of solid cash flow performance and proceeds from the remaining divestitures will position us
well to pay down additional debt and to fund our share repurchase program, which we restarted this January. Despite an
increase in investment for the Aerospace OEM ramp, we expect free cash flow equal to or in excess of net income.
2012 was a transformational year for UTC, and as we enter 2013 with a stronger portfolio, we are positioned to
outperform. Our end markets are showing improvement and we're focused on integration, execution and delivering the
EPS growth that you've come to expect from UTC.

Just one final point before I open it up for Q&A. I know there's a lot of questions and concerns about the 787. And as
you guys know, we are a key supplier on the 787. Although we do not supply the lithium ion battery or the battery
charger, we are supporting both Boeing and the NTSB in their ongoing investigation.
The 787 went through the most rigorous certification process in aviation history and we're highly confident in the
design and performance of the aircraft. However, given the ongoing review by regulatory authorities, I can't make any
further comments at this time other than to say that we don't believe that the results of these investigations will have a
material impact to UTC.
So with that, let's open up the call for questions. Stephanie?
Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your
line is open.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
Greg, can you just elaborate a little bit more on Sikorsky for us? So the charge in the quarter is basically just late fees
as it were because the deliveries didn't happen?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Let me take you through it. Really, the charge was related to all the costs that we foresee related to what we
believe will be later deliveries than contractually required. As you know, we were supposed to deliver all the aircraft
this year, the final 19. We didn't deliver any next year's. So our expectation, our assumption now is that we'll deliver
the helicopters over the next three years, we've put a placeholder of 8, as you know, for each of the next three, which
we think is a reasonable schedule for both ourselves from a production standpoint and the customers from a delivery
standpoint.
But having said that, we recognize that there are contractual revenues that we'll have to cover as it relates to the
Canadian government and then we're going to also have fewer flight hours and we're probably going to have some costs
on the program related to that longer timeframe. So really three pieces. There's some contractual relief cost, there's
some flight hour degradation, and there's just additional program costs and all that added up to the $157 million charge.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
But we still absorb, whatever it is, $4 million a unit as you ship those eight a year over the next three years, correct?

Page 7 of 24
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's 14 million a year. Again, we should point out, we obviously can ship more than just the eight a year. We can
probably deliver most of the helicopters this year. We just don't think that that's practical. I think Mick and the team
have made some really good progress in the last month since Louis spoke, having discussions with the Canadian
government. And I think, again, we'll hear some good news coming out of Mick in March.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
And just on share repurchase, you said you started here in January. Obviously the cash has been strong. Do you have a
little bit more leash with the rating agencies to try to at least kind of fully arrest share creep in 2013 or potentially even
go further than that?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think we'll certainly be able to arrest share creep with the share buyback that we've got. As you know, we've got
a placeholder of 1 billion for share buyback this year and 1 billion for M&A. As I think about the cash, we're still going
to see about 1.5 billion of cash proceeds coming in from these divestitures that will close here in the first half. We
ended the year with strong cash flow, almost 5 -- over 5 billion on the balance sheet. We'll have strong cash flow for
the year.
So I think -- thinking about the calls on cash, we've got 2 billion going to dividends, we've got 1 billion for share
buyback, we've got 1 billion of debt that's due in December, that's the 18-month floater. We'll certainly be positioned to
pay that. We'll probably pay down another 1 billion of debt, so I think it's due in '15 or '16, and then we'll talk to the
rating agencies about talking up the number. But I think cash flow is very strong, stronger than what we expected. And
of course my boss is pushing me to do a lot more than 1 billion, but it's January, so we'll see what happens.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
And then just finally and then I'll move on. Just can you elaborate a little bit more on the complexion of what you're
seeing in Otis, China, whether it's primary cities, secondary cities, residential versus non and anything to add there
about how things are playing out?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think, again, as we talked in December, where we're seeing the growth is in the western provinces. Along the coast, I
think the residential investment's picked up a little bit, but the real strength we're seeing is on the residential side in the,
I'll say, the third and fourth tier cities. The factory in Chongqing that we just opened in September of last year is
probably fully utilized. And I think we will ship about 10,000 units out of there this year. So that's really where the
growth is coming. It's from the west. It's nothing new. I think it's the same phenomenon we saw last year, but we're also
seeing, I think, just an uptick in the overall economy in China. It wasn't just Otis that was strong. CCS had a very good
fourth quarter from an order rates perspective there.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
Hi, good morning, Greg.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Howard.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
Just two questions hopefully. One is, you talked about impairment charges in CC&S. Could you give us a ballpark idea
of what you are close to selling or dispensing with, so we can think about next year's baseline in that business?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think we had a placeholder of about $800 million of divestitures. I think we've got gone, what Jay, about 550 of
those?
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
A little bit less than that, yeah.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
About 500 million of that last year. So we've still got a little bit to go. I think we took a $65 million impairment charge
on a number of the -- some of the legacy F&S businesses and I think we laid all that out for you back in September in
terms of the listing of those businesses, so no surprises. I suspect most of the transformation -- portfolio transformation
probably done in the first half, some of them will linger into the back half, but I think that they've got a pretty good line
of sight to get that all done this year.
Howard Rubel, Analyst

You wouldn't be giving me a hard time about that if you were to say that because I think, again, Carrier, just based on
their guidance, is going to hit 15% this year, assuming their markets come back as we expect. So thank you. The
integration of Carrier and F&S is crossed without a hitch. So I think 15% ought to be very achievable, if the markets
co-operate.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
And then on Sikorsky, if we exclude all these -- I know for accounting, you can't exclude the 157 million, but for us,
we can back that out and you end up with something north -- something around 16% operating margins in the business
unit. Was there just some catches and maybe some absence of R&D and I know you sort of alluded to a lower decline
year-on-year in the business. Could you talk a little bit about core operating performance?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think core operating was actually very good at Sikorsky. They delivered 91 aircraft as at the end of the fourth quarter,
so huge number of aircraft. I think they delivered 242 or so for the year and 91 of that was in the fourth quarter. So a lot
of shipments. Again, profitable, we saw good shipments on the commercial side. The S-92 is going out. We saw the
S-76, I think we delivered four of those in the quarter. So it's really just a very strong quarter. And you'll recall, again,
the operating performance in terms of profit growth is not very strong throughout the year, so really all the profit
growth came in the fourth quarter.
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Yeah. Howard, To add, they had nice mix, good restructuring benefits, and also just as a reminder, strong backlog as

Seth Seifman, Analyst
Okay. Good morning, guys. Actually it's Seth on for Joe this morning. Just two quick questions. Good morning. First of
all, if there's anything you can say at this point, and I know it's difficult about sort of the calendarization of the
improvement in the aftermarket for 2013?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I wish my crystal ball was clear on how that calendarization is going to work. Obviously, we talked about kind of
mid-single digit growth at Pratt & Whitney and it's about 10% of the Aerospace Systems business. Obviously, the order
rates in the fourth quarter were still not positive, but they were a lot better. So again, this is probably more back half
than front half, but we're seeing airline profitability continuing to improve. The trend line was good. As I said,
book-to-bill was over one, but I'm not sure if this is going to be a second quarter or third quarter, but just given the
cycles that the airlines are flying today, we know that there is going to be a recovery here sometime. Whether it's
second, third, fourth, I can't tell you.
Seth Seifman, Analyst
Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up, is there anything else you can say now about the agreement you came to with
Boeing on pursuing Army helicopter award?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's a teaming arrangement. Really it's a win-win for UTC and Boeing. It teams us with Boeing. This is on the
joint multi-role helicopter program. We'll be submitting a joint bid with Boeing here in March. This is for up to 4,000
helicopters. This is -- we'll develop a prototype. We won't actually deliver production helicopters for 10, 15 years, but
this is a great team and it puts again -- Sikorsky is going to lead on the aircraft itself, Boeing will lead on the mission
system equipment, really capitalizes on the strength of both companies. And you'll recall, this is not a new thing. We
teamed with Boeing back 15 years ago when the Comanche program was launched, and we have very good working
relationship between the two organizations.

Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Good morning, Carter.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Just a couple of questions. First, on the Pratt spares, it looked like your compare there would have eased a lot, but
obviously there was still a lot of pressure there on the revenue side. I wondered if you might speak to, from a platform
level, where that pressure is coming from, and if you are seeing it in one area more than another, maybe it's PW4000s
versus what you are seeing in the Vs, but any color you can provide there on that sort of continued weakness would be
helpful.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think it's the same trend we've been talking about really for the last four or five months. We continue to see weakness
on the wide-body fleet, which is the PW4000, and we continue to see strength in the narrow-body, which is the Vs.
And even the PW2000 and 757, we thought the 75s were going to be -- start to see some acceleration of retirements.
We haven't really seen that. In fact, they're flying more now. So spares actually look pretty good on 75s and on the Vs.
And all of the weakness we're seeing, all the year-over-year decline is really in the 4000 family. So again, we know
those wide-bodies are flying, those are relatively newer aircraft. We'll see spares come back.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Okay. And that 4000 weakness, would you attribute that to cargo? Can you see that in the trends?
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
A decent size of the 94-inch fleet is cargo, Carter, but it's difficult to tell exactly where it's coming from.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It surprised us. As we looked at this, the cycles of a cargo aircraft are not much different than the cycles on the
commercial side. So although we talk about cargo versus commercial, from a spare parts perspective, it doesn't make a
heck a lot of difference at the end of the day.
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Right.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Okay. And on China, in your comments there on Otis, I wondered if you might comment about the sort of implied
change in market share that you are looking at there relative to 2012. I mean, I'm assuming you lost a couple of points
of share, and is it the plan to regain that, all of it, part of it, some of it? Can we -- any comment you can make there?

I can make a lot of comments. I guess, I would say just a couple of things. Obviously, we did lose share earlier in the
year. I think we regained a lot of momentum in the third, and then even more so in the fourth quarter. I think Pedro
Baranda, President of Otis, has talked about regaining all of our lost share by the end of '13. I think we're well on track
to do that. The market is very dynamic and I mean, we're breaking it down between social housing and residential and
then you've got the factories and the office. In all of those markets, I think we've got a pretty good share, and again, I
think the momentum coming out of the fourth quarter ought to continue into 2013.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Does the plan imply that Pedro hits that goal?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Absolutely.

Myles Walton, Analyst
No. Absolute.
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Yeah, absolute they were up, but you'd always expect them to be up, because of the (inaudible) price type of ordering
activity that happens in the quarter.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Okay. And then, Greg, on the contingency, I think on taxes, it sounds like $0.04 has been added to the contingency,
euro, maybe $0.03 or $0.04. Pension, could you size that?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, it's another probably $0.05 or so.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Okay. Is that roughly the puts that you have? And then you mentioned spares as being an unknown or aftermarket as
being an unknown. Is there anything else that is kind of emerging as being more of a put to that $0.15 or $0.16
additional contingency?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
In fact, I think, surprisingly, it's been a pretty good start to the year. As we said, we feel a little bit better today than we
did back in December because we've got this additional, call it, $0.15, $0.16 or so. Plus, recall, we've taken up
restructuring by about $100 million. So we feel good about the guidance range. And again, if the business units hit their
high end of their guidance range, we will certainly see ourselves towards the top end of that range as opposed to the
midpoint, but recall at the midpoint, we didn't have much contingency and now we've got, call it an extra $0.15 and
$0.16 of contingency sitting there today. So we feel pretty good.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Okay. All right. Great. That's it from me.

Sam Pearlstein, Analyst
Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about Aerospace Systems? If I just look at the 2013 guidance of 13.5 billion, 14
billion in revenues and the 2.1 billion in operating profit, just looking at where you were in the fourth quarter, which
would have had a full quarter of Goodrich in it, I mean, it certainly seems like you need to step up the run rate on a
quarterly basis. And outside of the 87, I mean, what else is really going to help move that quarterly run rate up so much
over the course of the year to hit those numbers?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, there are really two things that are going to benefit Aerospace Systems as we move throughout the year. One, of
course, will be additional synergies. We've recognized about 100 -- or let's say, about 60 million of synergies last year.
This year we'll probably add another 100 million plus in synergies, maybe 120 million in synergies. So that will help
the run rate, and you've got a recovery in spares. The thing about withholding margins down in the fourth quarter at
Aerospace Systems is really the decline in spares year-over-year. So again, if we get to that 10% spares up that we had
expected, plus we see the synergies, I think you'll certainly see an improvement in the run rate.
Sam Pearlstein, Analyst
Okay. Thank you. And then just in CC&S, some of the other companies that have reported, I guess, the December
quarter talked about some softening in some of the HVAC end-markets. I think it might have been more refrigeration,
but just in general, have you seen any trends in any areas within the HVAC markets that might have been softening
over the course of the quarter and into January?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think -- well, let me go through it piece by piece because obviously there's puts and takes in the CCS portfolio,
but res, as we mentioned, ended very strongly, up 20% orders, up 10% in sales. Commercial HVAC globally was up
about 7%, again, strong in North America, strong in Asia, not so good in Europe. I think the one kind of governor of
the year is going to be Transicold, specifically the container business, which was still down in the fourth quarter. And
it's not clear that we're going to see a big recovery, although we're certainly hopeful on the container market.
Looking at the Baltics Dry Goods indices, obviously, that's still down at a relatively low level and this doesn't bode
well for the containers, but it's a very cyclical business. So containers were down and commercial refrigeration in
Europe was also down year-over-year. Again, not much going on there in Europe, but we are, of course, very strong
there.
Sam Pearlstein, Analyst
What is in Geraud's guidance in terms of the container assumption for this year?
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Container is up, I believe, about 15%.

Cai von Rumohr, Analyst
Yes. Thank you very much. So on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter, where are we in negotiations with the Canadian
government? Are you in talks?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me be very clear about this, Cai. I mean, again -- we are in discussion with the Canadians. We have not entered into
a renegotiation of the contract yet. We're in discussions to get to that point where we can restructure the deliveries of
the IMH, which is the interim configuration of the helicopter. We started those discussions late last year. I think they're
going very well, but it's not -- we're not at a point yet where we're ready to put pencil to paper.
Cai von Rumohr, Analyst
Okay. So I mean, obviously, you kind of had a lower number than expected at Sikorsky last year, but you brought the
decline down a little bit. So I mean, do you feel better today than you did in December about those discussions?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think, yeah, generally we feel better in general about the relationship. I think we're making progress every day up
there, Mick and his team have been working very closely with the customer. And it just takes time to work through all
this.
Cai von Rumohr, Analyst
Okay. And then help us understand maybe the tax rate. You took it down 50 bps, but you said, what, there is 100
million plus from the R&D tax credit in the first quarter for 2012; presumably another 100 million, so by 200 million
benefit. Shouldn't that be a little bit more than 50 bps?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, yes. In fact, the benefit will be a little bit more in 2013 than we saw in 2012. Again, we're taking the rate down
by half a point and probably wanted to come down a full point, but this actually gives us an opportunity to make sure
we actually hit that rate. As you know, we have to do some tax planning to get from the statutory rate down to that
target rate of 29.5%. This takes some pressure off of that. And we'll see how the year goes. There's obviously a little --
it helps a lot by having that R&D tax credit out there.

Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Cai, the 2012 piece that we booked in the first quarter will reduce the reported rate. When we refer to 29%, we're
talking about the operational rate, and then that $100 million, as Greg spoke to, will basically be used to offset the
incremental restructuring that gets us to $300 million. So you are correct, the reported rate will be lower than 29%.
Cai von Rumohr, Analyst
I guess I didn't get that. So the reported rate will be lower than 29%?
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Yeah, the operational effective tax rate will be 29%, but because of this 2012 extenders, it will be booked in the first
quarter actually.
Cai von Rumohr, Analyst
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, I get that. Maybe you could also help us, so like where should we expect the rate to be in the first
quarter, and assuming the 2013 is kind of equally spread, where should it be for the last nine months, approximately?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, in fact, what will happen is, to Jay's point, you're going to get this $100 million benefit or so on R&D in the first
quarter. So the rate normally is going to be about 31% in the first quarter and it declines throughout the year as we
implement tax planning strategy. So this $100 million will help in the first quarter. I don't have an exact number. We
can get back to you on -- in fact, when we update you, I think, sometime here coming up in February, we can give you
probably a better look at what that rate is going to be quarter-by-quarter.

Just a couple of things on cash flow. So I mean, CapEx jumped up in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about sort of what
the focus areas were there and should we assume this kind of percentage of sales close to 4% as a run rate?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about CapEx. I think we spent 641 or $642 million on CapEx in the quarter, and almost 1.4
billion for the year. That was up like 500 million year-over-year. So we saw that spending all over, but really it's on the
Aerospace side, as Pratt gears up for production of the GTF, and as Hamilton Sundstrand and Goodrich businesses, as
they gear up for this big increase in OEM production, we're seeing a lot of pressure on CapEx.
Same time, we also had spending on the commercial side of the business. I think Otis was up to $142 million, so that's
up about 70 million year-over-year. So we're making investments around the business. I think we'll continue to see
pressure on CapEx. That number wants to be higher in 2013. We obviously got a little work to do to hold that to a more
reasonable level, but that 1.4 billion could well go up to 1.5 billion this year.
Shannon O'Callaghan, Analyst
Okay. So a little bit of an increase year-over-year, but not -- so fourth quarter was sort of a heavy quarter?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. In fact, we didn't actually believe the forecast that could get rolled up because we've never seen a quarter that big
before, but the ramp is real. I mean, 787 production is going to go from seven to 10. You've got A380 production
increase. I mean, really across the aerospace platforms, you're seeing big increases and that just leads to CapEx.
Shannon O'Callaghan, Analyst
Okay. And then just where did you end the year on the funded status in terms of pension? And you put in a couple of
hundred million of the international plans in the quarter. Any plans to contribute in '13?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We ended up about 85% funded. And again, we had a very good year on the pension side. I think the returns were
around 14% on the domestic side. We did put a couple of hundred million into the international plans in the late
December. We'll probably put a similar number in this year. There is no U.S. contributions this year; none required this
year and probably none for next year. So again, the funded status, again, we have a good run-up like we did last year
and it will correct itself, plus discount rate helped us a little bit at the end at 3.9 versus the 3.8. So still a long way to go
from where it's been historically, but I think all those factors point to the need for very little funding.

Okay. Great. Thanks.

Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Good morning.
David Strauss, Analyst
On Goodrich, came in a little bit better than you guys forecast, $0.06 dilution. Looks like synergies were a little bit
better. Also sounds like, and in response to Sam's question, you are now forecasting a little bit higher synergy number
for '13. Did anything else for the Goodrich forecast in terms of accretion changed for '13?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, we're still looking at $0.60 of accretion year-over-year. Again, you'll get about 1.2 billion of EBIT and you get the
synergies and offset and then you get 90 million or so of amortization. So none of that has really changed the
restructuring. It's still about $100 million. Maybe the one kind of nuance in this is that $0.60 of accretion includes $100
million of restructuring and we'll cover that 100 million of restructuring at the top level. So the real number you're
going to see is probably more like $0.58 of accretion year-on-year.
David Strauss, Analyst
Okay. And then CCS, given what you're seeing today, I think back at the meeting in December, you had talked about
the underlying assumptions there being about mid-single digit growth in resi volumes and mid-single digit growth on
the commercial side. Does that still hold today?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I think so, but again, order rate would seem to support those numbers coming into the year and I don't think there's
been any change to those base assumptions.

Good morning.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning, Noah.
Noah Poponak, Analyst
Just wanted to try to dig into the commercial aftermarket broadly again. It looks like we could see airlines destocking
inventory throughout 2012. You guys have talked about this dollar cost per shop visit being under pressure. It sounds
like things are getting a little better there, but that behavior isn't really changing. And Greg, you mentioned flight hours
are growing in a nice clip, airline profitability is pretty solid relative to prior cycles. Can you just sort of elaborate on,
when you're talking to the customer, why are they behaving that way, what's making them do that?
It seems like oftentimes you answer that question as just broader macro and broader uncertainty, but that was true.
That's been true for four years now and there have been pockets of inventory restock and destock. So why are they
doing that now and then -- and what is it that will make them stop so that that trend reverses?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think what we will make them stop is the shelves bear (inaudible) and they won't able to dispatch aircraft. So
this is a very cyclical business. You go back in 2009 and we saw spears down 25%. It came back in '10 and '11 and last
year, again, there was a lot of uncertainty from a macro standpoint, what's going on in Europe, we saw a big reduction
in the European airlines order rates, U.S. uncertainty, again, a slowdown in China. All of those macro factors, I think,
impacted the airlines perception of how much do I need to order, how much stock do I need to have.
It will come back. I mean, it's a very cyclical business. And as I said earlier, I'm not sure if this is a first quarter, second
quarter or third quarter or fourth quarter, but we know typically these cycles run 12 to 18 months where they have to
buy -- come in and buy parts.
Now, the good news is as we go to this next generation of aircraft, more than 80% of our customers are electing to go
on some type of an FMP. So it will take the volatility out of this eventually, but today that number is less than 40%. So
we're still seeing revenues today, just not seeing an incremental piece from all of these flight hours that are out there.
Noah Poponak, Analyst
And you don't have the data on what the customer holds and to give you a little bit more precision on when they are --
when they do have the shelves bear and need to start restocking?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, keep in mind, there are a couple of different phenomenon here. At Pratt, we know pretty well as going into the
year, which engines are going to come off and which for overhaul and how many inductions we should be seeing in our
shop. And we can -- we'll know that within 10%. What we don't know when we do that forecast is what level of
overhaul the customer is going to ask for, whether it's a light or a heavy. And what we saw last year of course was a lot
more of the lights than the heavy. So the scope, again, that just shortens the interval between overhaul cycles.

Now, the Hamilton and Goodrich side is a little different. Those are primarily non-condition repairs where something
breaks, they can -- they have to fix it, but there is no time-based overhaul. So that's another business. I think that's why
the Hamilton business is down nearly as much as the Pratt business because, again, as things break on plant, they have
to fix them, but they still have some ability to (inaudible) that or to use up the spears that they have in stock.
Noah Poponak, Analyst
Okay, okay. That's very helpful. And just one other question on a separate topic. Otis margins, can you just elaborate
on whether or not the margin in the quarter -- or how the margin in the quarter compared to what you thought it would
be? And I know you have 2013 guidance that shows a little bit of improvement there. Is there any change to the longer
term a few years down the road you thought on what the right margin is in that segment, particularly as you start to take
that market share back?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Obviously, there is no surprises in terms of the fourth quarter. We knew margins would come down about 110 basis
points, I guess, which is -- just where I think Pedro had calibrated us really for the fourth quarter. This year margins
will go up a little bit again as we expect to see a recovery in equipment sales and we expect to see stabilization in
Europe.
I think the margins are 23%, we probably aren't going to see those again anytime soon. And that was really because
new equipment sales were down so much in the aftermath of this great recession. So as new equipment comes back to
kind of more normal 55% and sort of 60% of revenue, or it goes back to 55%, we should see again probably those
margins maybe in the 20% to 21% range long-term.
Noah Poponak, Analyst
Great. Thanks very much.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Thanks a lot. Yes, so my first question is just on the overall UTC-wide organic sales growth. It's flat in Q4, flat in 2012.
The midpoint is up 4% for '13. Looking at the full main order numbers that you always call out, half are down, half are
up. And so without getting too sort of bulk down or if we're getting commercial aftermarket forecasting, when do you
think the overall UTC-wide entity will start to see a decent organic sales growth? Will we have to wait till Q2 or Q3, or
you think Q1 will start to see some growth again?

I would expect you'll see modest growth in the first quarter and then it should accelerate as the year progresses. And
again, I think you can think about the CCS business, it's obviously seasonal as well. So second and third quarters are
typically stronger than first quarter, but I think you will just see as a gradual resumption in organic revenue growth.
Last year was clearly an anomaly for UTX. It's been a dozen years since we've seen sales growth at that level. So we
are well positioned in the emerging markets. I think China is going to come back strong this year after a weak last year.
We've seen that in the order rates at both CCS and Otis.
Again, commercial OEM will be strong. We know that the backlog is very strong there. Sikorsky, again, down a little
bit on the Black Hawks, but commercial business is doing well. So spares is probably the big question mark in terms of
whether that's a first, second or third quarter recovery, but I'd expect kind of this gradual recovery in organic growth,
but we should see some in the first quarter.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Got it. Thanks. And then just to circle back quickly on Otis, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that Europe in
some areas was stabilizing. It doesn't sound like that had happened in HVAC or in Aerospace. So does that mean
you've already seen some stabilization in Otis Europe?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, I think you have to look at it almost country-by-country as we go across Europe. Obviously, Spain was down
big, Italy was down big, France was relatively flat, then we saw a decent growth in Russia and the emerging Europe. So
again, parts of Europe are okay, other parts are still, I would say, still in the doldrums, but again, Spain has stabilized. I
think it's not getting worse. Italy we think has stabilized, not getting worse. So it's at a low level and I think we should
see a gradual recovery. We're not expecting much this year. Remember we're talking two or three points of growth out
of Europe after a down two years.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Got it. And pricing in Otis, I mean, obviously you had some changes in strategy in China in the spring of last year. For
now, Otis sort of region-by-region the pricing strategy is unchanged?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think, again, there is pricing pressure across the globe in the Otis business. We see it especially in China and we also
see it in Europe. We're actually seeing pricing get a little bit better here in North America, but it's a fight every day.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Got it. Thanks.

Good morning.
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Good morning.
Doug Harned, Analyst
I was interested if you could give a little bit insight into the CC&S margins. Good margins, but if you were to separate
what's caused the improvement in terms of, say, mix, commodity costs and the benefits of the integration, exit from
lower performing businesses, and you did give us a special dividend, how would you sort of give those puts and takes?
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Let me just talk about the growth because the growth in the quarter was essentially, as we said, the restructuring
benefits, you had some improvement in commodities, and then you had the dividends. As far as the operating margin,
you did get some -- and I think we've talked in the past, about a third of the benefit comes from the portfolio
transformation, but again, a lot of that is the heavy lifting that they've done related to the consolidation and the
restructuring that they have done and continued to do over the past number of years. So I think that's mainly the big
drivers of their operating margin expansion.
Doug Harned, Analyst
And how much was it in commodity cost -- reduced commodity cost?
Jay Malave, Director, Investor Relations
Commodities was, say -- wasn't much, Doug, but I can get back to you on that.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It wasn't the biggest driver. I think, if you think about it, restructuring is probably the biggest, followed by the special
dividend out there, and then we would get down to commodity pricing.
Doug Harned, Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then on Otis, now that orders, you've seen some pickup in orders, in terms of lead time today,
what do you see in terms of when that would turn into sales?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, market-by-market it will vary. Typically in China we're seeing about a six to nine-month lead time from order to
delivery. The U.S., some of the -- especially some of the big megaprojects or even in the UK like this crossrail project,
we won't be delivering those for a couple of years. So again, the U.S. orders, it's more like 18 to 24 months as opposed
to Asia, which is typically much shorter cycle.

Doug Harned, Analyst
And then, have you seen any changes in competitive behavior here with regard to pricing?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think again, as I mentioned before, pricing is difficult in all of the markets. I don't think that we've seen any
changes per se, but it is a very difficult pricing environment in all of these markets. Again, as orders pick up, obviously
some of that pressure abates, but it is still a very, very competitive market out there.
Doug Harned, Analyst
Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator
And our final question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Peter Arment, Analyst
Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Greg and Jay. Just more of a clarification on the restructuring. Greg, the additional
100 million that you picked up here, where exactly is that going to fall? Is it in the Goodrich comments that you've
mentioned earlier about covering the restructuring costs there or is it placed in CCS?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, I think, in fact, what you'll see is the 100 million of restructuring that we had at UTAS or the Aerospace Systems,
that is unchanged from December. What we've seen is really both at Otis and at Pratt & Whitney is a desire for more
restructuring dollars. They've got projects that they're working on both domestically and internationally where they're
looking for some restructuring dollars. So again, we see really good payback. This is one to two-year payback kind of
projects and the list is longer than my funding ability right now. So again, I think you'll see it just like you did last year
across each of the businesses.
Peter Arment, Analyst
Okay. And then just for clarification, going back to your EPS, kind of walk that you laid out in December, it sounds
like we're going to have a little bit less of a headwind here for Sikorsky given the charge and pension came in a little
better in a slightly lower tax rate as the midpoint still is intact because of the additional restructuring. Is that a fair way
to look at it?
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, I think the midpoint is intact, then we've got a little more contingency. The $100 million of additional restructuring
is actually covered by the tax extenders from 2012, which, although we got -- because we got them in January, they
come through in the fourth -- or in the first quarter of this year. So I'm going to take that 100 million of kind of good
news and we're just going to use it to fund additional restructuring.

Page 24 of 24
The other good news like on the tax rate from the 2013 extenders plus the good news on pension, FX and all that, that
just really gives us more contingency at the midpoint and we're not going to take the guidance up because of that good
news today, but certainly we feel better about where we are than we did even a month ago.
Peter Arment, Analyst
Okay. Understood. Thank you.
Gregory Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you. All right. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you guys listening in on the call. We'll see everybody in March
at our annual investor meeting where each of the business unit presents and look forward to talking to all of you. Thank
you.
