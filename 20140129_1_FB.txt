Mark Elliot Zuckerberg
Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. This was a great quarter and a great way to end the year. We
saw strong growth in engagements around the world and we are very pleased with the growth of our ad business,
especially on mobile. Overall, 2013 was an important year for us. If 2012 was the year where we turned our core
products into a mobile product, then 2013 was the year we where we turned our business into a mobile business. I
expect 2014 will be the year where we begin to deliver new and engaging types of mobile experiences.
As of the end of the year, more than 1.23 billion people now use Facebook each month. Last quarter was our first
quarter where more than 50% of our ad revenue came from mobile. Looking back at the year, we have launched an
important product and initiative: Internet.org, Graph Search, Instagram video and Messenger 3.0. We also made a lot of
improvements to the performance and reliability of all our mobile apps.
One important trend from the last year is the continued growth in size and engagement of our community. In 2013, we
added 172 million monthly actives, 139 million daily actives. That means that our daily engagement continues to
increase. In the last quarter, more than 60% of our monthly actives visited Facebook daily. Given the size of our
community, we're very excited about this pace of growth.
We're also seeing people engaging more. On the average day in December, we saw more than 6 billion likes. That's up
59% from 3.8 billion likes a year ago. These trends show that our strategy of improving the quality of our core
experiences over the last year has paid off, and we're now in a good position to focus on our longer-term goals of
connecting everyone, understanding the world, and building a knowledge economy. Connecting everyone is about
bringing the Internet to everyone, and giving them the tools to stay connected with the people and things that matter to
them. Today, more than 750 million people use Facebook every day.
While that makes us by far the largest social network in the world, we're still a small part of the world's population.
Only one-third of the world's population has access to the Internet today, and for even many of those, their Internet
experience remains pretty weak. Helping more people get connected is important to developing the global knowledge
economy. Once people are connected, they can access tools like basic financial services, health information, and
education tools to help them take care of their families, and join the worldwide economy. That's why last summer we
launched Internet.org, a partnership with industry leaders to make affordable Internet access available to everyone in
the world.
In 2014, we're going to focus on achieving Internet.org's mission by deepening our relationships with mobile operators
around the world, and working to develop new models for Internet access. Our existing partnerships with operators are
something we've already invested a lot in over the years, and this is an area where we're really excited to build on going
forward.
Connecting everyone also means giving people the power to share different kinds of content with different groups of
people. This is something we've focused on by building separate mobile apps beyond the main Facebook app.
Messenger and Instagram are examples of this. We've launched a new version of Messenger to make the app even
faster for mobile-to-mobile communication. Messenger was among the top most downloaded apps on iOS and Android
in December, and we've seen meaningful growth in engagement since launching. The number of people using
Messenger grew more than 70% in the past three months. And we've seen a large increase in the number of messages
sent. We've a lot more coming to Messenger in the first half of this year, and I'm excited to build on these early results.

Instagram also had a busy quarter, bringing Instagram to Windows phone, launching our first ads and launching
Instagram Direct, a new way to send private photo and video messages. We're pleased with the early reaction to all of
these products. With ads, the team has taken an especially careful approach, working closely with a small number of
brands that are already important members of the Instagram community to create a great early experience.
I'm also excited to report that there are now more than 500 million people using Facebook groups every month. Groups
is one of our core products and it provides a private space for sharing with small groups like your family, close friends
or sports team, or for larger communities like schools or even companies. One theme that should be clear from our
work on products like Messenger, groups and Instagram is that our vision for Facebook is to create a set of product that
help you share any kind of content you want with any audience you want. We're not just focused on improving the
experience of sharing with all of your friends at once, although that's growing quickly too, a lot of the new growth we
see is coming from people – from giving people the tools to share with different size groups of people.
Now, moving on to our business, last quarter, I talked about our efforts to grow our business through improving the
quality of our ads, rather than just increasing the quantity. Our goal is to reach a point where the ads are as relevant and
timely as the content your friends share with you. To do this, we put a lot of effort into measuring people's sentiment
around our ads, and seeing how people engage with them. We do some of the broadest surveys in the world. We survey
more than 35,000 people every day to see how we're doing, and we use the results to drive our product development.
Our approach is working.
In the second half of 2013, we saw an improvement in sentiment about ads on mobile, even as volume grew during that
period. We also saw sentiment on desktop remain stable. Interestingly, even as the volume of News Feed ads has
grown, click through rates have also remained stable. We're very pleased with these results and they suggest our
strategy of improving quality is working.
Our plan is to continue focusing on improving quality since we think this is the best way for us to improve the
experience for people on Facebook, returns for advertisers, and our own revenue, as well as achieving our long-term
goal of providing ads, which are as relevant as organic content. So that's my update on where we're focusing our efforts
in the context of our longer-term goals. It has been a strong quarter and a great year for Facebook.
Next week, Facebook turns 10 years old. It has been amazing journey so far, for me personally and for all of us at the
company. But what's ahead of us is even more exciting. Many of the successes of the past 10 years have simply been
steps on the path to achieving our long-term vision of connecting everyone and improving the world you're sharing.
Over the coming months and years, you will see us continue focusing on many of the same themes but now with
greater scale, ambition and resources.
Finally, I just want to thank everyone who works at Facebook for a great year in 2013 and over the past 10 years. What
we have achieved together has been a result of all of your hard work and I'm grateful that so many talented people are a
part of our team.
Thank you. And now here is Sheryl.
Sheryl K. Sandberg
Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. I am really excited to report earnings this quarter and proud of the teams at Facebook
who delivered these results. We ended 2013 with a terrific fourth quarter, continuing the strong momentum we saw
throughout the year. Our total revenue grew 63% year-over-year, led by 76% growth in advertising revenue.
Approximately, 53% of our ad revenue came from mobile. This is not only the first time we crossed the 50% threshold
in mobile, but it's also our first billion dollar mobile quarter. In fact, our Q4 mobile ad revenue of $1.25 billion was
nearly as large as our total ad revenue in Q4 of last year.
This growth continues to be very broad-based. The combination Mark spoke about of our growth in users and
engagement, the effectiveness of our ads and News Feed, works together to provide marketers with a powerful way to
reach people. This impact is evident in our results. This quarter, we saw healthy increases in every region around the

world and positive momentum in all four marketer segments.
There are three key drivers propelling our business. First and foremost is strong mobile engagement. Every day, more
people around the world are spending more time on their mobile devices and marketers are starting to shift their
budgets to reach them. This was especially clear during the holiday season where, not surprisingly, Black Friday was
our single biggest mobile ad revenue day in the quarter. When people are shopping in stores, they are on their phones
and when they are on their phones, they are on Facebook. A recent study by Millward Brown Digital showed that while
shopping in store, people who use Facebook do so at four times the rate of any other app or search. And for those
people that use Facebook as a source before shopping, over half stated that it was a very influential source of
information for them while they were shopping in the store.
The second driver of our ad business is a continued growth in the number of marketers using Facebook. Again, this
growth is broad-based and diverse across marketers, verticals, geographies. I'll update you briefly on each of our four
marketer segments. Demand from direct response marketers was strong in the Q4 holiday shopping period, particularly
in e-commerce. These marketers focus on short-term ROI. So the growth we're seeing speaks to our ability to
efficiently drive sales for them. For example, online retailer, nomorerack, used Facebook to promote its holiday deals.
They hit their aggressive ROI targets and they generated $8 million in revenue on Black Friday alone.
We're also making remarkable progress with SMBs, a segment that many in the industry have long considered the Holy
Grail of online advertising and a segment that I have been particularly focused on throughout my career. In November,
we reported that more than 25 million SMBs maintain an active page on Facebook. We have made a big investment in
simplifying our ad products over the last year, and that investment is working to convert these SMBs into advertisers.
Of the new SMB advertisers we acquired in Q4, 72% started with our most simple ad products.
For developers, mobile apps are generating very healthy revenue growth. We launched mobile app install ads just over
a year ago, and mobile app engagement ads last quarter based on a very simple idea that we can help people find and
use great apps. This is working even better than we hoped. We're helping developers attract new customers and keep
them engaged. We remain excited about the opportunities in this small, but quickly growing category.
In addition, last week, we announced a small test to show Facebook ads in third-party mobile apps. We won't have
meaningful results for a while, but it's an interesting area for us to explore.
And finally, we're making steady progress with our brand marketers, particularly in verticals like CPG. We're helping
them connect with customers in more dynamic ways, starting a small test of our new video ad product and measuring
our impact on their sales, which is super important to driving their business.
The third driver for both the quarter and the full year has been our investment in product development. We're especially
pleased with the improvements we've made to our targeting capabilities and measurement tools. Our goal, as Mark
said, is to make our ads as useful as possible for consumers, and to generate greater returns for marketers, eventually
making all of our ads as valuable to users as our organic content.
Custom Audiences is our most important product in this effort. When we launched it over a year ago, it allowed
marketers to reach their current customers on Facebook. Since then, we've built more targeting capabilities while
maintaining user privacy. These include lookalike targeting that lets marketers reach people who are similar to their
best customers, Partner Categories, which use third-party data to improve our targeting. Now marketers can reach
exactly the people they are looking for, such as people who buy fashion apparel, or are in the market for a new car.
We've more than doubled the number of Partner Categories in the U.S., and now offer more than 1,000, and we believe
there's still significant opportunity ahead as we continue to improve our targeting capabilities.
We're also making major investments in measurement so that we can measure the impact of our advertising on in-store
sales. In December, we launched offline conversion measurement. To date, our results show that the average return on
ad spend from News Feed campaigns is eight times, a result that is really impressive when compared to other returns
marketers have available.

As Mark noted, this is the beginning of a new year and our 10th anniversary. So I want to reflect really briefly on
where our advertising business, and we believe the marketing industry, is heading. Before mass media, all business was
personal. Sales happened customer-by-customer at the local store or door-to-door. The evolution of mass media made it
possible to sell at scale, but business was no longer personal. On Facebook, marketers can do both. We're building the
world's first global platform that lets marketers personalize their messages at unprecedented scale. This is marketing
where you are, for who you are. This shift to personalization represents the biggest shift in marketing in generations,
and it's one that we are uniquely positioned to lead.
Facebook is the only place where 750 million people visit every day, increasingly on mobile, to discover what matters
to them. As we continue to leverage our understanding of people to make marketing more personal, and do it at
massive scale, we will dramatically improve the quality of ads and drive more personal discovery. Facebook is making
business personal again. And like Mark, I want to thank the team that we get to work with every day at Facebook who
are doing a great job to make this happen.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to David.
David A. Ebersman
Okay. Thanks, Sheryl. Overall, 2013 was a great year for Facebook. We performed well against all our key financial
priorities, growing revenue to $7.9 billion, delivering operating profit and free cash flow each of over $2.8 billion, and
making investments that position the company for continued growth.
Today's results strengthen our conviction that we're in the early days of capitalizing on a significant opportunity. Let's
start with some user and engagement highlights. During the year, the population of people using Facebook on a daily
basis increased by 139 million to 757 million, and the population of people using Facebook each month grew by 172
million to 1.23 billion. In December, 62% of our monthly users used Facebook on an average day.
Mobile continues to drive our growth. When we began 2013, we had more daily users on desktop than mobile. By the
end of the year, our daily users on mobile outnumbered desktop by around 200 million. We're also pleased that
engagement per user continued to increase in 2013 based on measures such as time spent per user and feedback per
user. And none of these stats include Instagram, which doubled its user base over the past year.
The network of people who use our products remains the foundation for everything we do and they are the most
important audience we're trying to serve and delight every day.
Turning now to the financials, in Q4, total revenue was $2.59 billion, up 63%, and ad revenue was $2.34 billion, up
76% for our highest year-over-year growth rate since mid-2011. Exchange rates had no meaningful impact.
We continue to experience strong revenue growth around the world. Ad revenue in each of our four reported
geographic regions grew by more than 65% in Q4 compared to last year. The key driver of ad revenue growth
continued to be the strong performance of News Feed ads on mobile and desktop, which helped us attract more
advertiser demand. Mobile ad revenue increased from approximately $881 million in Q3 to approximately $1.25 billion
in Q4, a healthy increase that of course benefited from seasonal effects.
In Q4, total ad impressions declined 8%, and the average effective price per ad was up 92% compared to last year. The
decline in ad impressions was primarily due to the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer
ads compared to desktop since there's no right hand column ads on mobile.
The significant increase in average price per ad was driven by the mix shift to more News Feed ads that have much
higher engagement and click-through rates, increasing the average effective price per ad impression. The price volume
trends were pretty similar across our four geographies.
Total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 was $241 million, down 6% versus last year, remembering that in Q4 last
year, we recognized revenue from four months of payments transactions. On a more apples-to-apples basis, payments
revenue from games, which represents the substantial majority of our payments and other fees revenue, grew

approximately 8% in Q4 versus last year, despite the fact that our payments revenue from games is limited to our
desktop users, a population that's declining.
Turning now to expenses, our Q4 GAAP expenses were $1.45 billion, up 37%, and non-GAAP expenses were $1.13
billion, up 33%. For the full year, our non-GAAP expenses were up 44%, driven largely by growth in infrastructure
expense and a 37% increase in head count over the year.
As our revenue has grown, we've worked hard to stay disciplined in terms of our expense growth, focusing on
investments where we're most confident of creating value and meaningful ROI. We're pleased with the returns we
achieved from many of our investments that we made in 2013, including those to advance our ad products, improve
mobile product quality, increase engagement, and drive efficiency improvements in our infrastructure.
Our Q4 GAAP operating income was $1.13 billion, representing a 44% operating margin, and our non-GAAP
operating income was $1.46 billion, representing a 56% margin, up from 46% last year. As you know, margins are
typically the strongest in the fourth quarter, given the seasonal strength in our advertising business.
Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for Q4 were 54% and 46% respectively and for the full year 2013, our GAAP and
non-GAAP tax rates were 46% and 41%.
The tax rates in Q4 were higher than the rates for prior quarters of the year, primarily because of intercompany
payments that occurred in Q4 related to our international operations. Also at the end of 2013, we had a tax net
operating loss or NOL carry forward of almost $8 billion.
In Q4, GAAP net income was $523 million or $0.20 per share and non-GAAP net income was $780 million or $0.31
per share, up approximately 80% compared to last year. CapEx was $483 million in Q4 and $1.37 billion for the full
year. Our efficiency investments, including the Open Compute Project on the hardware side and proprietary work on
the software side have enabled us to significantly increase the amount of data and the number of users we can support
with each server we buy, and these investments have saved us over a billion dollars over the past three years. We
wouldn't be able to deliver the profit and cash flow numbers we're reporting today without the success of these
efficiency investments. Our Q4 free cash flow was $748 million and our full year free cash flow was $2.8 billion,
including the benefit from a $419 million tax refund in Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the year with $11.4 billion in cash and investments. This number includes $1.5
billion from our secondary offering of 27 million shares in December at the time of our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.
Now, I want to share a few thoughts on 2014. In terms of expenses, we're planning that our total 2014 GAAP expenses,
including cost of revenue, and including stock comp, will likely grow in the neighborhood of 35% to 40%, and
non-GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue but excluding stock comp will likely grow in the neighborhood of 40%
to 45%. We plan to invest with a continued emphasis on technical head count and product development to take
advantage of the opportunities we see to create new experiences and more value for our users, marketers and
developers.
On taxes, we expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in 2014 to be roughly similar to our full year tax rates in 2013,
although this could vary widely depending upon acquisitions, our international revenue and expense mix and other
factors. Our tax rate in 2014 and over the next several years will continue to reflect the fact that we're in the early years
of investing in our international operations. Longer term, we expect our tax rate to be in line with peer companies who
have similar operations and international revenue mixes.
We ended 2013 with 2.6 billion diluted shares outstanding, including the December stock offering, and we estimate that
our diluted share count will increase roughly 2% to 2.5% by the end of 2014, although this may vary depending upon
our stock price and new share issuances, for example, to support M&A. We anticipate our 2014 CapEx will increase to
be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The significant year-over-year growth will be driven by an expansion of our
Menlo Park headquarters, infrastructure-related expenses such as the build-out of our Iowa data center, and by our
investment plans to support initiatives like Internet.org that are designed to increase Internet penetration in the
developing world. We'll also continue to make strategic investments to improve capital efficiency.

Last, in terms of revenue, in 2014, we hope to build on our success from last year. 2013's strong growth in ads revenue
was driven by the rapid ramp-up of News Feed ads, growth in users' engagement and marketers using Facebook, and by
the product investments we made that improved the quality, relevance and performance of our ads. As Sheryl
described, we believe we're still early in the evolution of our advertising business and the mobile ad business in
general. This makes for a difficult time to forecast near-term revenues with any precision, but it also makes for an
exciting time and we're looking forward to capitalizing on this opportunity.
To sum up, Q4 was a strong end to a great year for Facebook. Thanks for joining us on the call today, and now let's
open for questions.
Q&A
Operator
We will now open the line for a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from
the line of Ben Schachter with Macquarie. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Guys, congratulations on a fantastic year. Sheryl, I was wondering if you could rank order the
four groups of marketers and discuss how SMBs play out over time versus the larger enterprise companies. And then,
Mark, if you could talk a bit more, and expand more on what you mean by standalone mobile apps and really what your
vision is there? And I understand you're speaking at Mobile World Congress, so any update on what we should expect
from that. Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: We don't break out by segments, but all four segments are growing and we're pleased with
the growth there. I'm glad you asked about SMBs because it's a particular focus for us, and somewhere I'm really proud
of our performance. Our teams led by Dan Levy and others have just done a great job. There are 25 million SMBs that
have pages on Facebook and that's a really great first step because it's just historically very hard to get small businesses
online. What we've done over the last year is we've really worked at simplifying our ad product and that's working
because the way to convert our SMBs who are using our free pod -products into being advertisers are with these really
simple ad products. So rather than go to them and say, do you want to become an advertiser? You say, do you want to
promote a post? And that's what's working and we're able to convert them to advertising and then up-sell them from
there in large numbers and we're excited about it.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. And in terms of the focus on building new and separate experiences, our theory
is that there are all these different ways that people want to share and communicate. Almost any kind of content that
you can imagine sharing text, photos, videos, links, location, events, games any type of content, with any type of
audience whether it's privately on a one-on-one situation or small groups, or with all of your friends or a larger
community, or publicly. There's an interesting intersection between most of these things and one of the things that we
want to try to do over the next few years is build a handful of great new experiences that are separate from what you
think of as Facebook today that are just kind of helping to explore that space and give people new ways to share. And I
think you can see that. That's something that people want from some of the mobile apps that exist out there today. You
can see it from our own offering with not just Facebook but also Instagram and Messenger already today, and we're
going to keep working on this over the next few years.
Operator
The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one, there's been a lot of talk
about Messenger over the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering if you could share with us how you see the

aggregated a large number of users in the space?
And then my second question is just for David in regards to seasonality of ad revenue, it obviously typically declines in
Q1, I'm just wondering if we're at the point now where we should see seasonality of mobile ad revenue in Q1. Thanks
so much.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: So I can talk to Messenger a bit. So if you think about the overall space of sharing
and communication, there's not just one thing that people are doing. People want to have the ability to share any kind of
content with any audience. There are going to be a lot of different apps that exist, and Facebook has always had the
mission of helping people share any kind of content with any audience, but historically we've done that through a single
app, right?
And one of the stats that I shared today is that we now have more than half a billion people using groups every month.
And that's not something that I think a lot of people are paying attention to because it was sort of seen as a feature of
the Facebook app rather than its own product. So what we're doing with Messenger now, similarly, a lot of people are
using Messenger every day, but it felt like a feature of Facebook rather than its own network or standalone thing. And
we're making it more of a standalone app and we've actually in the last quarter, we've taken it out of the main app, so
that way it gets room to breathe and blossom as its own great experience. And we're going to focus on making that
really good and adding a lot of new things. And I mean some of the stats that I shared are incredibly promising. I mean
in the last few months, 70% more people are using it and a lot of message volume growth. So we're still focused on
kind of general growth for Messenger rather than going country-specific at this point in its evolution.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: And, Heather, this is David. Thanks for your question on seasonality. Of course,
seasonality is an important factor in an advertising business and affects Q4 and makes it a typically strong quarter. At
this point, given how new we are with the mobile business, I think it's really difficult for us to quantify the impacts of
seasonality. That's – I think it will take some more time before we can understand it better than we do.

The next question comes from Mark May with Citibank. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my question. Just would love to get some updates on some of the efforts that
you are making in terms of brand and real-time conversations. I think on the user side, would love to get some interest
in terms of the usage and engagement with video content early on and real-time conversations particularly around
entertainment-related content; and then on the advertiser side, kind of early adoption by brand and TV like advertisers
with some of the brand and video solutions that you have out there.
And then for David, given the significant transition that the business continues to go through that is affecting these ad
impression and average price metrics, can you give us a sense of the breakdown between the ad impressions between
desktop and mobile? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: I'll start here on the public content piece and then I think Sheryl will get into some of
the specifics, but I just want to put this into context of the overall strategy here. We were just talking about some of the
standalone experiences and Messenger. And public content is part of this overall spectrum of content that people want
to share and consume as well. It's in some ways it's on the opposite – the complete opposite side of the spectrum from
one-on-one messaging, but it's also an area where I think the medium of News Feed and Facebook works really well.
So we've been focused on improving the tools for public discussion and folks to be able to share public content,
including premium content like videos and making it so that they can autoplay in feed. And this is an area where just
like messaging and some of the other things that we've talked about, you should expect us to keep focusing on a lot. It's
part of the overall space of sharing that we think is quite valuable. So I think Sheryl is going to get into some of the
specifics on this.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: Yeah, I can start with video and then go to the overall brand question you started with. We
have a current video ads product, it works very well. It's part of what's driving our growth. We are also – have recently

started testing an autoplay video ad test. It's a very small test. But overall, we're seeing what Mark has talked about,
which is that marketers and users are using video more as they have the technology to do so. And we expect that to
continue to grow.
In our overall brand effort, we're making really good and steady progress as we are with all of our market segments. All
of the Ad Age Global 100 advertised with us over the past year. And the real key there is proving measurement to our
clients. Our team, led by Carolyn Everson and her people all around the world, really have to go client-by-client and
show them that we cannot just increase people's happiness or brand affiliation, but ring the cash register at the end of
the door.
I think this is part of the big story for us in 2013, which is, if you look back a year, we didn't have that ability to look at
the A/B test of who saw our ads, and what the difference in sales is. And now we have that. And we still have a lot of
hard work to do client-by-client ahead of us, but being able to prove that we have really strong ROI, and I think
increasingly efficient ROI compared to the other marketing opportunities they have is what is going to move the brand
marketers to Facebook and to mobile.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: So, Mark, yeah, your second question about mobile and desktop impressions, as you
know, per user or per unit of time on the desktop, we show a higher number of ads, because there's the right-hand
column ads in addition to News Feed, but we're extremely pleased with how well the News Feed ads continue to
perform, and that's really what's driving up the average price per ad, as I described. So these ads perform well for
marketers and are still continuing to contribute to the positive user experience that Mark described earlier.

The next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi. Thank you very much. First for David, I wonder if you could comment on the ad
load on Facebook. Do you expect it to continue to remain stable or is there a possibility that the ad load creeps up over
time? And on Instagram, I know it's a new product and you guys are taking it slowly at first, but I wonder if you could
also talk about how long it might take for Instagram to get to a similar ad load to Facebook's levels.
And then one last question for Sheryl, I wonder, Sheryl, is there a way when you compare Facebook to television for
brand marketers to look at the disparity of ROI, or I should say the improved ROI for Facebook, and sort of extrapolate
where you think pricing could go, obviously, pricing doubling quite a bit. How much more upside to Facebook News
Feed pricing can we expect to see based on the ROI differential? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: I just want to start off here and then David can get into some of the details on the
number of ads and all that. But the strategy has been for the last period and will continue to be to primarily focus on
increasing the quality of the ads and the experience. And I really think that it's easy to look at the model and say, okay,
well, if we ran more ads, then the business would grow faster in the short term, but investing in quality is really actually
the most important thing, because it's what improves the experience for the people who use the product. It drives
greater returns for advertisers, and over time, it increases the potential size of our business. So – and I think that you
can say that that's a harder path for us to take, but I actually think that the results over the last couple of quarters have
really shown that by focusing on improving quality instead of just increasing quantity, we can actually drive pretty
incredible business results. So we think that there's more to do here and that's what we're going to keep on doing.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: I think I can take most of the rest of this. So in terms of ad load, I mean, the one piece of
context maybe to start with is that the variable we're really focused on optimizing isn't ad load per se, but it's the user
experience as you can measure that based on engagement or user feedback, et cetera. And ad load is one of the
variables that impacts that, but there's other relevant variables as well such as the positioning of the ads, the size of the
ads, and of course critically the quality of the ads. So ad load only gives a part of the picture.
And we're really one or two years into this and we're still learning how to provide the best experience. I think one of the
most important pieces of positive news from 2013 was as we ramped up News Feed ads, they performed as well as they

did, delivering great value for marketers, having a very minimal effect on the user experience, and enabling Facebook
to deliver the kind of results that we reported today.
So going forward, we'll continue to tweak what we do in terms of trying to find the right balance and optimize the
performance of the ads for marketers and for users, but generally, as Mark said, the most important place for us to
invest is going to be in improving the quality and relevance of the ads. You asked about Instagram and pricing, so let
me just cover those quickly. Instagram, I would say we're just really early with Instagram. So it's too early to talk about
where we're going to be going. We're still trying to learn what the right way to approach that product is and we're going
to move slowly, because we think that's the right thing to do for Instagram
In terms of pricing, it was our expectation that if ads in News Feed worked well that they would deliver more value for
marketers, be more engaging, and that they would contribute to the average price per ad on Facebook going up. And we
also believe, looking forward, if we continue to improve the quality and relevance of the ads we show that, that's a
critical way that we can drive pricing up in the future.

The next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask two things. First, you announced an
initiative or perhaps an algorithm tweak, I think, in early December to have more news stories in users' feeds and I was
just curious what the adoption has been thus far from users there, and what are the implications on usage and
engagement, and then also ad load? And then secondly, can you give us an update on teen engagement trends? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Sure. So to start with the public content, the change that we made is basically a lot of
what our algorithm looks at is straight engagement. So the amount of content that people click, like, comment, and
share in feed. But what we found was that when we asked people qualitatively what they prefer getting, it didn't often
match up because a lot of things like memes got scored very high in terms of getting a lot of people to like them, but
weren't necessarily when you asked people what they wanted to see in feed, or whether they were happy seeing, didn't
score that way.
So we ended up doing an adjustment to the algorithm, which made it so that qualitatively things and especially public
content and news that people rated as higher quality qualitatively scored more, and that was basically the adjustment to
the algorithm. It had really no impact on ads. It was an organic content adjustment that we made to improve the quality
of the experience. So I think David can talk about teens.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: Sure, Doug. In terms of teens, we don't have any new data to report today. As you know,
we take engagement very seriously and we're focused on building great products that all our users, including teens, will
find useful and engaging and that's the most important thing for us to stay focused on.

The next question comes from Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi. I had a couple product questions for Mark. The first one on Graph Search, just wondering
how users are engaging with the product developed, the product is, in terms of what we can see today relative to what
your longer term aspirations are for the product and then just to follow up on Doug's question, related to the news flow
integration into News Feed, another feature that's been added more recently is trending and attaching trending to news
articles and News Feed as well. So if you could talk more broadly about your interest in real-time information and news
as it relates to public content, that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Graph Search, all right. So starting with Graph Search, we're really early in the game
on this, and I think you can see that because we haven't even really rolled out our mobile version of Graph Search yet,

and we're a mobile company, right? And we started on desktop and the way that we're thinking about this is there's just
so much content that people have shared on Facebook that simply building the infrastructure to index all of it and start
ranking it is a multiyear effort, which we're making our way through. So the first release indexed more than a trillion
connections between all the people and interests and events and groups and things that everyone was connected to. The
second release that we did recently was around all the updates, right? So there are more than a trillion status updates
and unstructured text posts and photos and pieces of content that people have shared over the past 10 years, and
indexing that was a really big deal, because as the number of people on the team who have worked on web search
engines in the past have told me, a trillion pieces of content is more than the index in any web search engine.
So we're kind of making our way through this. Pretty soon, I think you should expect us to roll out the mobile version
of this. I think that that's going to be an important step, because most of the usage in Facebook overall is on mobile, so
we expect that that's where engagement will really start to come from on Graph Search over time. But it's also only in
English so far, and we have to internationalize it. And so there's a long roadmap of things that we need to do that I
think is pretty clear, but it's just going to be incredibly useful when it's ready. So we look at this as an investment over a
three to five-year period rather than a one to two or shorter kind of period. So that's how I think about that.
The other question was about trending topics and that really ties into the public content push that we have. And we
talked a bit about this before. But in terms of – we're trying to build great experiences for all types of content that
people want to share and consume with all audiences. We think public content is great. Folks who are making news or
making premium content on TV or movies or celebrities and different types of folks are extremely interesting and
produce great content and we want to be a great place for people to share that content, and for people to be able to learn
about it and consume it. So trending topics is one step in what you will see as a pretty long roadmap of things that we're
going to do to make Facebook great for public content.

The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first one for Sheryl, I would like to get an update on
how the company is thinking about mobile retargeting ads, you've seen a lot of success with retargeting on desktop, but
how you can think about the evolution of retargeting in the mobile environment as a future product. And I guess second
question for Mark. Not a lot of talk on the payments business so far on the call and I just want to understand maybe an
update around games or other areas of e-commerce that you think are opportunities for the payments business. Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On re-targeting, retargeting has been proven really valuable across all platforms. We've
allowed it through FBX, and increasingly we're allowing it through our own products as well. As part of our Custom
Audiences suite of offerings, we're offering website Custom Audiences and mobile app Custom Audiences. And these
all allow marketers to target ads in privacy safe ways that improve the relevance and improve results.
I think when people think about targeting, what they're really thinking about is relevance, and taking the data and using
it in a privacy safe way to increase the relevance of ads to users. And that's something we're working on.
Operator
The next -
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah, so for payments, I actually – we don't think about our business so much as like
an advertising or payments business as much as a way for people to reach – we build this network and we help
businesses reach people with relevant messages. And payments historically has been a great way for game developers
especially on desktop to – an efficient way for us to monetize that business because instead of charging them up-front
for most of the ads, we can charge them only when their business grows because someone is paying for something.

On mobile, I think the natural evolution of this is for that to move towards app install ads, where we're not running the
payment system on mobile. The operating systems are integrated with that. But – because a lot of the goods that people
are buying in games are no marginal cost, a developer's economic incentive is to advertise to the point where – or to get
more people to come into their flow to the point where – for as many people as they can get to buy the goods. So even
though a game developer might be paying 30% to the operating system maker for payments, we're finding that people
also really want to buy a lot of app install ads, and that's grown incredibly quickly and is one of the best parts of the ad
work that we did over the last year.

The next question comes from John Blackledge with Cohen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, Mark, you referenced 2014 as a year of rolling out
new and engaging mobile products. Maybe could you provide some color or highlight the types of products that users
can expect, or maybe how you think about improving mobile engagement? And then just on Instagram, could you give
us an update on the number of monthly active users ending 2013 and give us a sense of how the beta testing is going
with advertisers and when it might be available for all advertisers? Thanks.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Sure. Before I get into some of the newer types of things which we've actually
touched on most of them already on the call, I also want to take a moment just to emphasize that we're going to start
building new experiences but we're going to start small compared to where the core Facebook is, right? So most of the
results that we're going to see in terms of increasing engagement and sharing and in our business are going to come
from the core Facebook experience because mathematically it's just so much bigger than everything else that is out
there that it's like the numbers, it's just – you would have to be multi-year investments to add up to that. You can look
at, for example, comScore puts out these numbers every month or so that reference the amount of time that people
spend in different mobile apps. And Facebook, I think, is almost 5 to 10 times bigger than the next app that is out there.
So it's going to take a while for any of these things to turn into huge thing. So some of the things that we're thinking
about are all of the different kinds of ways that people might want to share different kinds of content with different
audiences. So I talked about groups earlier on the call. That's something that half a billion people are using. It's
currently a feature within the Facebook app giving experiences like that room to breathe and really develop to be their
own brand, I think, is a huge and valuable thing. It's not necessarily the next thing that we're going to go do, but it's
kind of an example of the type of audience and type of content that people might want to share. Examples of things that
we have done are Messenger is a really big focus for us and we're focusing on that as a standalone experience.
Instagram is a different kind of community than Facebook. We just launched Instagram Direct within Instagram, which
is one-on-one or small group photo and video sharing. And you can kind of view that as the kind of experience that
we're going to be rolling out. But there's a lot of space here for a lot of different kinds of things, and what I think you
should take away from this is that while the core business growth is going to come from the main app that exists, just
because the numbers are so much bigger than everything else today, that that's going to just be where most of the
momentum comes from. You should also expect us to start building a few of these other things that we'll focus on over
a long period of time and hopefully build into meaningful things like Messenger and Instagram are today.

<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On the Facebook ads in third-party mobile apps, it's a small test we just started that aims
to show Facebook ads off of Facebook for mobile apps, so we don't have results yet. We are very excited about the
mobile app space in general. If you look at our mobile app installation ads, we've really done a great job working with
developers to help users discover and download their apps. And the product we rolled out last quarter, which is the
engagement ads, then help developers get people engaged or reengaged – reengaged in their apps. And so it's a small
important and growing space and we feel really good about the progress we've made with those ads on Facebook.
When you look at off Facebook, really early test.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: In terms – this is David. And in terms of desktop, I'd say that two trends that really
benefited desktop in the fourth quarter were similar to what we described earlier. One was just the holiday strength that
we saw in the business and the second was the strong performance of News Feed ads, which we show on both mobile
and desktop. So that worked well for us in the fourth quarter. Just recognizing still that the user numbers on desktop
continued to sort of decline modestly overall and that's obviously an important headwind for the revenue from that part
of the business.

The next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. Mark, I had a follow-up from one of the previous questions on closing the loop
in mobile. You guys have made a lot of progress improving the total mobile ad experience, yet there is still a lot of
friction in downloading apps and making purchases today. You guys have recently rolled out some new ad formats and
you have some partnerships with the likes of Braintree and Stripe and some of the other payment guys. So what's your
vision for removing some of this friction for marketers and do you envision a scenario where users can buy physical or
digital products within the Facebook mobile apps? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: I can take this. Obviously, the mobile app world is a new world and just not just the
functionality in ads is still developing, but the functionality of what then people can do. You can do a lot more on the
desktop in many ways than you can on mobile. I think the best role we play is to help connect consumers with
marketers and with companies and services, and I think reducing the friction there is really important. We don't have
any plans to go into the direct e-commerce market because the advertising products we provide, I think, are the best
thing we can provide to help grow this market.

<Q - Tom Forte>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. On contextual advertising,
this is essentially the Holy Grail for Facebook, and I think you understand this. Can you talk about where we are as far
as innings on getting contextual ads? And can you talk about the role that Instagram plays with visually appealing ads
and the role that video plays? Thank you.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So as I said, and I've talked about each quarter, targeting is a huge, huge issue for us and a
huge opportunity and challenge. Our goal is in a privacy safe way to get information we can about what consumers
want and then help connect marketers so that the ad experience is great for users. We're serving relevant ads. Whether
that information comes from the kind of things people like on Facebook or other websites they visit or contextual
statements they might make in their status updates, our goal is to use that information in a privacy safe way to improve
the targeting of the ads on Facebook.
To take one example, if you look at what's happening with our direct response business, which has been a very strong
segment for us, if you look at people trying to find consumers, we offer the opportunity to get people before they
search. We can judge interest based on other things, other things they're interested in, and give people the opportunity

<Q - Jordan E. Rohan>: Thanks so much. I'm curious if you could help me understand the international market
development and monetization for Facebook's ad platforms. Specifically, can you speak to the build-out of the
international direct sales force, the channel partners, the number of international markets in which FBX is operational,
and the extent of geographic rollout of the cost per install ad units in the News Feed? Is that available everywhere?
Where are we compared to the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: So the build-out globally is going well. We've always been pretty conservative. We wait
until we have a very strong user base in other countries and we wait until there is a developed ad market. But we're
growing. We have a PMD ecosystem, which now covers 45 countries. I was actually in Turkey at the beginning of last
week and had a chance to meet with our advertising partners there, and they are increasingly using our platform to
reach consumers. We are growing our offices. We're growing our offices in Asia particularly this year, and we've rolled
out offices across Europe as well. In terms of rolling out products, we tend to roll out products in our most developed
markets first. And as we extend those products, we then extend them to the rest of the world.

is for the company and how you think that AI will help Facebook over time. Thanks.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: On the first, we are excited about our mobile app install ads and our mobile app
engagement ads. It's a small, but growing category we don't split out by segment. But one thing that's really important
to note is that our mobile ad strength is very broad-based. Our mobile ads are not just bought by people who are
looking to drive engagement or usage of mobile apps, but is very broad-based. We're being used by SMBs, brand
advertisers and direct response advertisers as well.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: Yeah. And I can speak to some of the deep learning work. In the last quarter, Yann
LeCun, one of the – like really the earliest folks and one of the founders of deep learning and a professor at NYU,
joined us to lead our AI group. And it's – this is a long-term research group that we have that it's going to fit into our
strategy over a longer, maybe five-or 10-year period, and their goal is really just to try to understand how everything on
Facebook is connected, right, by understanding what the posts that people write mean, and the content that is in the
photos and videos that people are sharing. And it'll help people with tasks like, if you're sharing a voice clip in
Messenger, being able to transcribe that for people so that they can receive it more easily. So these are some pretty big
tasks in AI that are things that we have teams that are working on that will need to be researched over time and will
have obvious implications for the products that we do. But over time, the real value will be, if we can understand the
meaning of all of the content that people are sharing, then we can just provide much more relevant experiences for
people across everything that we do.
So I mean you can kind of think about this. Internally, we talk about our strategy and there's a three-year strategy, a
five-year strategy and a 10-year strategy. And the three-year plan is really all about building new kinds of experiences
for sharing like so many of the questions on this call have been about. The five-year approach is really mostly about
helping people use their network to answer interesting questions or solve problems that they have and that's where all

of the Graph Search work and the Open Graph work and some of the early parts of the AI work that we're doing, you're
going to start to see over that period of time.
And then over a 10-year period, I think you'll really start to see a lot of the impact of some of the Internet.org work that
we're doing where I'm hopeful we will see some impact a lot sooner than that as well. But over a 10-year period, if we
can get a lot more of the world on the Internet, I think that's going to really mean a quite different world in terms of
what folks in a lot of developing countries have access to in terms of some of the things that I said in my opening
remarks around basic financial services and people can get credit to start businesses and buy homes, really
life-changing stuff, or get access to health information or education materials which I think are just a really big deal.
And over the long term, we've always wanted to help out with that and I think that's where we're going to go on that.
<A - Deborah Crawford>: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator
Our last question will come from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. David, could you just talk about the sustainability of the gross margins that you had
in the quarter, seemed pretty high. And then, Mark, I know this question maybe – hopefully this isn't redundant. When
you think about the potential for ad quality at Facebook over the next three to five years, and you've gone through a lot
of learnings over the last many years, or I guess two years on ads quality. How do you think about what the upside is? I
know that's a broad, general question. But you think about all the different drivers. Have there been certain moments
when you've seen real gap opportunities? Are there any proxies out there that you see that you say, well, this is where
Facebook could be? Any thoughts on how much higher, how much better over the years and quality could be on
Facebook. Thank you.
<A - David A. Ebersman>: So, Mark, I'll start with the question on gross margins. I think in Q4, as you know, gross
margins tend to be seasonably strong because revenue goes up in the fourth quarter, and the costs associated with
operating our infrastructure don't go up accordingly with the seasonal strength in advertising revenue. So directionally,
I think it's important to know we really had a great year in 2013 in terms of the efficiency investments that we made.
But going forward, this is a compute-heavy service that we provide. It requires a lot of data centers and servers and
infrastructure. We're going to continue to invest in those things, and we do expect to increase our infrastructure costs
over time while trying to do that as efficiently as possible.
<A - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg>: And in terms of quality, I just think that there's a lot of room to grow here. I said in
my opening remarks that we have this long-term goal of making the advertising quality or content as good and as
relevant and timely as the content that your friends are sharing with you and at first blush, I think that seems kind of
crazy and that your friends' stuff will obviously always have the advantage of being immediately socially relevant to
you. But at the same time, a lot of the folks who are advertising really invest in the quality of the content that they're
producing, and putting into their ads and improving the targeting of their ads to deliver the right messages to the right
people. And I don't think that there's a single step function that we're going to see here although there are things like the
video formats that really enable new kinds of rich experiences that folks who can invest in building those can really
benefit from.
But at the same time, I think a lot of this is going to be incremental, right? So as we make improvements, more
advertisers come into the system and as more advertisers come into the system, we have more options of relevant
content to show to people and that improves the quality as well. So this is going to be something that we're going to
focus on for a while and there's a long way to go before we get to the quality level that we want. But I think over a
multi-year period, we can get there or at least very close.
<A - Sheryl K. Sandberg>: And it's a nice way to end the call, because one of the really big opportunities we have is
to make these ads app scale more personal. So just as we can have social context obviously from the user content, we
put social context into ads. So we can take these ads that marketers can deliver upscale, improve the targeting, and give

them social context which will help drive the kind of opportunities Mark's talking about to make the ads as relevant as
the user content.
