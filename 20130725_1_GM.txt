MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2013
Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will
conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded,
Thursday, July 25, 2013.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor
Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Randy C. Arickx
Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review the GM Financial results for the second
quarter of 2013. A press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the Investor
Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call on the web.
Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of
the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language.
This morning, Dan Akerson, General Motors Chairman and CEO, will provide opening remarks; followed by review of
the financial results with Dan Ammann, Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Ammann will then conclude the
remarks portion of our call with some closing comments.

After the presentation portion of the call, we will open the line for questions from the analyst community. Also joining
us today are Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer; Chuck Stevens, CFO of North
America; and Jim Davlin, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer.
Let me turn the call over to Dan Akerson.
Daniel Francis Akerson
Thank you Randy and thank you to everyone joining in the call today. Once again, General Motors has delivered a
strong quarter, driven by our ongoing success of North America and China, progress in Europe and some very well
received new vehicle launches around the globe.
As you can see on slide 2, we increased our second quarter global delivery by about 4% from a year ago. Our net
revenue increased by $1.5 billion. EBIT adjusted was up 7% to a robust $2.3 billion and adjusted automotive free cash
flow was $2.6 billion.
For the remainder of the year, we'll continue to focus on delivering great value to our customers, executing, flawless
vehicle launches and addressing business challenges head on.
Looking deeper into the quarter, our aggressive roll-out of new products in North America is continuing to drive
improved results, especially for Chevrolet and Cadillac. In Europe, lower cost higher volumes in United Kingdom and
strong new vehicles like the Opel/Vauxhall Mokka helped narrow our year-over-year loss. But a demand-driven
recovery isn't in sight yet, so we have to keep working on cost, complexity, and brand building.
In China, our joint ventures delivered record sales and our results have been particularly strong in the mid-sized upper
medium and luxury and SUV segments.
Finally, GM Financial continues to grow side-by-side with our core vehicle business and deliver very good
risk-adjusted returns. Strong results in these businesses are helping to offset difficult conditions in other parts of the
world, especially in GMIO outside China and GMSA outside of Brazil. Dan Ammann will go in more detail on these
issues, but I will say we are working hard to improve the things we can control just like we are doing in Europe. For
example, Holden has introduced a redesign of its flagship VF Commodore sedan, which sets a new class standard for
performance and refinement; and Chevrolet is launching the Spin crossover in Indonesia, Thailand, and other ASEAN
markets.
We are working to improve the competitive position in GM Korea, which is under pressure because of the higher cost
and the strength of the won versus the Japanese yen. The launches of our redesigned large SUVs in early 2014 will
improve our competitive position in the Middle East region. And in South America, we are working to offset the
impact of currency declines through pricing.
Now, let's turn to slide 3, which summarizes some other highlights for the quarter. I want to start with our quality,
because it's the report card that matters most to our customers. The good news is third party data shows that we are
right on track. For example, in 27 years, no American company has earned the top spot in the J.D. Power Initial Quality
Study. Let me repeat that, no American company has earned the top spot in the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study until
this year, when GM took top honors.
In fact, the GMC and Chevrolet were the highest ranked non-premium brands in the study. Just yesterday, the Buick
Encore and three Chevrolet; the Volt, Sonic and Avalanche each earned awards in the J.D. Power APEAL Study, which
measures what customers like about their new vehicles. Chevrolet actually had more segment winners than any other
brand. And just today, Consumer Reports announced that the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala was their highest rated
sedan with a score of 95 points, that put the Impala on par with cars like the Tesla Model S and fully competitive with
the Audi A6.
Results like these are changing perceptions about our brand for the better, and you can see that trend reflected in our
sales results. For example, Chevrolet had record global sales in the second quarter and for the first half of the year. That

makes 11 straight quarters of higher year-over-year sales.
Chevrolet's performance is a broad-based, both geographically and from a product mix standpoint. Deliveries in the
United States and China, the brands' two largest markets, were up about 6% through June. And we've seen strong sales
of the Sail, Cruze, Malibu and Captiva, which account for about 25% of Chevrolet's global volume. Keeping this
momentum going and making sure we deliver a consistent brand experience around the world drove the recent
appointment of Alan Batey as the Global Head of Chevrolet. As Alan can tell you, there's plenty of headroom for
Chevrolet to keep growing on the strength of these new products alone. For example, this year we'll launch the
Chevrolet Tracker small crossover in Brazil. We're continuing to roll out the all-new Chevrolet Silverado in North
America.
The launch of the Silverado and the GMC Sierra has gone well so far, and things couldn't be better, thanks to the
nascent U.S. housing recovery. The new crew cab models were the first to reach the market earlier this summer. The
quality and craftsmanship has been outstanding, and the reaction from our dealers and customers has been very good.
The demand drivers are equal parts of value, fuel economy, capability, refinement, with a healthy dose of pent-up
demand. The next all new models in our launch cadence are the extended cab models, which began shipping to dealers
this week.
Cadillac's year-over-year growth has been good, thanks to the all-new ATS and XTS. These two products made
Cadillac the industry's fastest-growing brand in the first half of the year, with sales up more than 33%. The Cadillac's
opportunity is no longer limited to just the United States. There's a proverb that says that the best time to plant a tree
was 20 years ago, and the second-best time is now. This perfectly captures the opportunity we see for Cadillac in
China. This year, we began local production of the XTS, which helped drive a 35% first-half sales increase for the
brand in the Chinese market. And just last month we broke ground on a new Cadillac assembly plant in Shanghai. This
plant is a linchpin of our strategy to triple Cadillac volumes by 2015 and achieve 10% share in the Chinese luxury
segment by the end of the decade. This will give us much-needed scale and further diversify our earnings base.
As we put these growth plans in place, we're taking great pain to make sure the company's internal systems, processes,
and controls are robust. For example, we dedicated an all-new GM-owned data center this quarter, and we broke
ground on a second, mirrored, fully redundant facility that will go online in 2014. This will allow us to continue
winding down 23 leased data centers -- facilities, if you will -- around the globe.
Between April and June, GM Financial completed the acquisition of Ally Financial European operations. And we also
created an all-new Global Business Services Group to streamline our back office processes, including finance, HR,
facilities, real estate and indirect purchasing. We benchmarked some of the world's best companies as part of this effort
so we fully expect that we will meaningfully reduce our overhead costs. These are just a few examples of our progress,
but I chose them because they show that GM is inherently stronger company than it was even a year ago both
operationally and on the showroom floor. That will become clear as Dan Ammann walks you through our detailed
results over the next few minutes.
With that Dan, the floor is yours.
Daniel Ammann
Thanks, Dan. On slide 4, we again remind you of the results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was $39.1
billion, the $1.5 billion or 4% increase from the prior year includes a $400 million unfavorable impact from foreign
exchange. Our GAAP operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion. Net income to common stockholders declined
$300 million to $1.2 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share came in at $0.75.
Net income from the quarter includes an increase in tax expense of $0.5 billion or $0.29 per share compared with the
second quarter of 2012. Automotive net cash from operating activities was $4.5 billion, a $700 million increase from
the same period of 2012.

For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT adjusted was $2.3 billion in the second quarter and the EBIT adjusted margin was
5.8%, up from a year ago. Adjusted automotive free cash flow increased $900 million to $2.6 billion for the second
quarter.
On slide 5, we disclose the special items that impacted earnings per share. Net income to common stockholders was
$1.2 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.75, impacting these numbers was a $200 million loss
related to the acquisition of GM Korea preferred shares; this charge had a $0.09 unfavorable impact on earnings per
share.
I'd also like to point out that due to a recent increase in our common stock price; we now use the if-converted method to
calculate EPS. More information on this change in methodology is available in our supplemental slides.
On slide 6, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we list the
revenue and margins for the same periods. Our GAAP operating income margin for the second quarter was 4.5%,
slightly lower than the prior year period and our EBIT adjusted margin increased 0.2 percentage points to 5.8%.
Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.6 million vehicles in the second quarter, a slight increase from the
prior-year and our global market share decreased 0.1 percentage points to 11.5%.
On slide 7, we explain the $200 million increase in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. Volume was $300
million favorable, due primarily to higher wholesale volumes in GM North America. Mix was $500,000 million
unfavorable spread across North America, Europe, and GMIO.
Price was $400 million favorable due to strong performance in North America and in South America. Costs were $200
million unfavorable, as we maintained tight cost controls; and other was $100 million favorable.
Slide 8 gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segment; GM North America increased $100 million to
$2 billion, GM Europe had a much improved performance, but still recorded a $100 million loss. The performance in
GMIO deteriorated by $400 million to $200 million driven by consolidated operations. And our South American
business had a slightly improved EBIT adjusted of $100 million. GM Financial improved $300 million in earnings
before taxes; and our corporate sector was $100 million for a total EBIT adjusted of $2.3 billion in the second quarter.
We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 9. For the
second quarter of 2013, our total U.S. market share was 18%. Our retail incentives on an absolute basis were higher
than the prior year period, but slightly lower than the prior quarter. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.2% of ATP,
which puts us at a 114% of the industry average. We expect further improvement in these numbers through the balance
of the year.
Slide 10, shows GMNA's EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was
$23.5 billion, up $1.9 billion from the same quarter in 2012. EBIT adjusted margin was 8.4% for the second quarter, a
slight decline from the prior year. Our U.S. dealer inventory declined sequentially to 708,000 vehicles, approximately
flat to a year ago despite higher sales.
GMNA's wholesale vehicle sales were 809,000 units, 49,000 units higher than the prior year. North America market
share came in at 17.3%, which is 0.1 percentage point decline from the prior year period but higher than the previous
three quarters.
On slide 11, we provide the explanation of the $100 million year-over-year increase in GMNA's EBIT adjusted.
Volume was $400 million favorable because of increased wholesale volumes, driven by a growing industry and our
successful vehicle launches in new segments including the Buick Encore and Cadillac ATS.
Mix was $200 million unfavorable due to our recent entrance into the small crossover and mini segments and lower
sports car production as we prepare for the launch of the 2014 Corvette Stingray. Price was $300 million favorable on
the strength of our recently launched vehicles including the Chevy Impala. Cost was $400 million unfavorable
primarily due to fixed cost increases related to manufacturing launch costs, reduced pension income, and increased
depreciation and amortization.

On slide 12, GME reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $100 million for the second quarter, a $300 million improvement
from the prior year. Revenue declined 7% to $5.2 billion for the quarter. However, the EBIT adjusted margin in the
segment improved 5 percentage points to a negative 2.1%. GME's wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 276,000
units, 14,000 units less than the prior year and our European market share was 8.5%, down 0.3 percentage points from
prior year but a small increase from the prior two quarters.
On slide 13, we provide the major components of GME's $300 million increase in EBIT adjusted. Volume was a $100
million unfavorable due to a declining industry. Mix was a $100 million headwind because of negative car line mix and
price was a $100 million unfavorable due to continued competitive pressure in the industry.
Cost was $400 million favorable due to $200 million in lower depreciation and amortization and $200 million savings
in other fixed costs, including engineering costs and other ongoing initiatives to transform the business. Other was a
$100 million favorable due to foreign exchange. This totals to GME's EBIT adjusted loss of $100 million for the
second quarter of 2013. Although, we're pleased with the favorable year-over-year performance, we expect financial
performance in GME results to exhibit some seasonal decline in the second half of the year.
We now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 14. Second quarter performance was
affected by strength in China, volume price mix pressures in the consolidated operations, and the impact of several
warranty and recall campaigns. EBIT adjusted was $200 million including $400 million in equity income from our joint
ventures. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from consolidated operations was $5.3 billion. The $600 million
decline from last year reflects the challenges in our consolidated operations, while our EBIT adjusted margin was a
negative 3.6%, down significantly from the prior year.
Our net income margin from our China JVs remained strong at 9.4%, approximately flat year-over-year. Regions
wholesale vehicle sales were 268,000 units for the consolidated business and 772,000 units for our China JVs. Our
market share in the Asia-Pacific region was 9.3%, a small improvement from last year, due to the growth in our China
sales.
On slide 15, we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume was $100 million
unfavorable due to 27,000 unit decline in wholesale volumes and our consolidated operations. Mix was $200 million
unfavorable due primarily to country and product mix. And price was $100 million unfavorable as the devalued yen
continued to drive competitive pressures across multiple markets in the region.
Cost was $100 million headwind and other improved $100 million because of the higher equity income from our China
JVs. Going forward, we expect our China business to continue to be strong. With regard to consolidated operations, we
should see the benefit of important launches in the region in the second half and we're developing and implementing
action plans to adjust the ongoing challenges in the marketplace.
Slide 16 provides a look at GM South America's performance in recent quarters. Revenue improved $200 million to
$4.3 billion, despite a $400 million headwind from foreign exchange. EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was 1.3%,
nearly a full percentage point higher than the prior year.
South America's wholesale vehicle sales were 278,000 units, up 13,000 from the prior year. South American market
share declined slightly to 17.1% in the quarter, although our deliveries were greater than the prior year. In the six
months ended June 30, we have the number one market share in South America at 17.2%.
On slide 17, we look at the change in year-over-year EBIT adjusted, which rounded to zero. Volume and mix had no
impact. Price was $200 million favorable due to actions we've taken in Venezuela and Argentina in response to
inflationary and FX pressures. Cost had no impact and other had a $200 million adverse impact due to unfavorable
foreign exchange in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. This totaled to $100 million EBIT adjusted in South America for
the second quarter.
Slide 18 provides our walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter. As a reminder, our net income
to stockholders was $1.2 billion. After adjusting for non-controlling interest and Series A preferred dividends and
deducting GM Financial earnings, our automotive income was $1.2 billion. We had $200 million in non-cash special

items and our D&A expense was $1.5 billion.
Working capital was $300 million source of cash. The variance from the prior year is due to production scheduling
differences and a reduction in inventory as we continue to drive working capital efficiency. Pension and OPEB cash
payments exceeded expense by $100 million in the quarter and other was $1.3 billion source of cash, $400 million
decline from the prior year. This totals to automotive net cash from operating activities of $4.5 billion. We had $1.9
billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $2.6 billion.
On slide 19, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the second quarter with
$24.2 billion in cash and current marketable securities and $10.6 billion in available credit facilities for total available
liquidity of $34.8 billion. Debt was $4 billion, the decline from the prior quarter is due to the redemption of GM Korea
preferred stock and the elimination of $700 million of GM wholesale financing upon the consolidation of the Ally
international operations. Series A preferred stock obligation remained at $5.5 billion; and on a reported basis our U.S.
qualified pension plans were underfunded by $12.9 billion and our non-U.S. pension plans were underfunded by $13.1
billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability was $7.6 billion in the second quarter.
Slide 20 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial has already released their results and
will hold their earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the second quarter was 8.6%, about
flat to the prior year. Our U.S. lease penetration increased further 4.6 percentage points to 20% in Q2 as we continue to
leverage our financing relationships and capabilities and improve residual values to drive toward industry competitive
levels in key segments.
Lease penetration in Canada was at 9.2%, up slightly from the prior year. GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM
Financial originations rose to 68% in the quarter with the closing of the portion of the Ally IO transaction; and GM
Financial's percentage of GM's U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 25% in the quarter. GM Financial's
annualized net credit losses remained low at 1.4% and earnings before tax was $254 million for the second quarter,
reflecting both continued strong performance in the North American business and the acquisition of the IO business in
the quarter.
Finally on slide 21, I'd like to emphasize several initiatives we are focusing on in the second half of 2013. We must
continue to successfully execute the launch of our new vehicles with design and performance that will consistently
exceed customer expectations. We'll be focusing on reducing cost and complexity in the business to ensure we can
deliver winning vehicles at a price that works for the customer and a cost that works for us. We'll build on the
momentum we've received with our recent IQS award from J.D. Power and we'll develop and execute initiatives to
improve our performance in the consolidated operations of GMIO.
And here again is Dan Akerson with a few closing remarks.
Daniel Francis Akerson
Thanks, Dan. Quickly, as you can see from the quarter strengthening our brands, improving quality, and streamlining
the organization is starting to pay off. Not only are GM products the best in memory, our businesses are much more
resilient in the face of economic headwinds. I say resilient, not immune. There'll always be currency shifts, recessions,
or unrest somewhere in the world that we have to manage through. But at GM, the short term challenges are no longer
the tail wagging the dog, that's the benefit of our fortress balance sheet, and aggressive new product program and our
systemic attack on the issues that hold us back including complexity and costs.
With that said, we're now happy to take any questions you might have.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning guys. First question on Europe, given the great performance there. Is there any
consideration in moving forward your target from 2015 to 2014 on your breakeven there because everything you're
doing is real self-help, you're not getting a lot of help from the market itself, you're really creating this performance on
your own. I'm just curious what your thoughts are there?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yes John, we don't have an updated target at this point in time. We're a few quarters into our
plan and executing to our plan, the market environment remains quite challenging as you're well aware. So, we're
pleased with the year-over-year improvement we've shown through the first half of the year. We do typically have as
you know some seasonal challenge more in the second half, so we're going to work to – work our way through that, but
we're pleased with the performance so far, but still long way to go, particularly in the macroeconomic environment.
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: John, we're pleased not satisfied. We're going to continue to push both play offense
and defense. The new product rollouts will help on offense, but we're going to continue to focus on taking costs out of
the business.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: It's been great so far. Second question, Chuck maybe on pickup pricing; it's been much
stronger than expected. I know on the new truck versus the old truck you're keeping MSRPs flat, but obviously that's
not the full story on average transaction prices. I am just curious, is there the possibility that you might get even better
pricing than you initially expected on the new truck in the back half of the year because the pricing on the outgoing
truck has been better than expected?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yes, John, I think it's too early to make predictions about whether we're going to have upside
or not on the new truck. We've just launched it in the month of July. About 20% of our sales will be the new truck. It's
just the crew cab. I would say that what we've seen in the market over the last three or four months with the stronger
segment share, our performance with the outgoing GMT-900 and the reduction in incentives would give us some
cautious optimism that the pricing will hold up and we may have an opportunity, but it's really too early to tell on that
truck.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay then, Dan, just on the pension on slide 19, the $12.9 billion underfunding for the U.S.
plan. Does that include a re-measurement for discount rates or any other actions?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: No, it does not.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay, good. And then just lastly, Dan Akerson, you talked about in your opening comments
the Global Business Services Group, and it sounds like a great idea, and it sounds like it's at the early stages. I'm just
curious, as you work through that process, is that going to be more of a cost saving exercise, or is that going to create
more efficiency through the organization? I'm just trying to understand really what the true aim of that is and what we
can expect out of it.
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: I've seen this done when I was on the board of American Express. We benchmarked
off – then we benchmarked off of P&G, and what you do is you consolidate your back office systems and try to get
more efficiency and take cost out, and it does have organizational implications.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay and the timeframe for that, is there targets?
<A - Daniel Francis Akerson>: We just started in earnest. We are really in the early stages of it. But over the next
year or two, we hope to take – well, I don't want to give a number, but we have a strong ambition, strong targets to
reduce our cost.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay, thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hey, everybody. Just a first question on GMIO. Can I ask kindly to give a bit more detail about
where the execution issues are, maybe between India or Australia or other factors? And also within that question, has
the change in the segment reporting shifted a little bit of profit out of GMIO and – into GMIO from the GM Korea ops,
has that also been an impact here that you'd like to quantify?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah, so let me address the second piece, and then I'll go back to the first piece. The short
answer to the second piece is no. There's no impact on the year-over-year comparisons, because last year was – is
represented on the same basis.
Back to the first question, there's really three aspects to this that I'd identify. One is there are a couple markets that have
underperformed, from a volume point of view, the overall market. So, think about the softness in India as an example,
Russia to some extent.
The second dynamic is more sort of Southeast Asia including Australia, where we have a lot of competition from the
Japanese manufacturers, who are sourcing to those markets out of Japan, whereas we're sourcing more out of Korea. So
there's been a currency impact there. And then the third element, more on the cost side, is we have had a handful of
warranty and recall items hit us in the second quarter. So the way to think about this going forward is we'll continue to
have some impact from all of those things probably rolling into Q3, but as we exit the year we do have some important
launches ahead of us in the second quarter. We do hope that the warranty recall related items will fall away, and
obviously we'll need to address whatever the competitive dynamic is in the market from a currency perspective as we
go.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: So the warranty recall seems to more fall on execution and the others are more market conditions
and competition. Can you quantify the warranty recall? Is it a $100 million or $200 million order of magnitude?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: I'd say it's – more than half of the impact is market related, and less than half is the warranty
and other expense related.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay, that's great. A question on North America: Would you describe kind of big picture that the
truck changeover year-on-year in the quarter was a net positive, negative or neutral when you factor in say benefits on
pricing versus the delta year-on-year with the changeover, knowing that you're also doing some changeover
pre-production and deferred maintenance last year as well? What was the balance of the truck isolating if you could,
directionally?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah, from a financial perspective, net slightly negative in the quarter impact. There was $300
million of manufacturing pre-production and start-up. We only produced about 50,000 K2s, so I would say from that
aspect, slight negative. Overall, truck performance in the quarter, quite positive from a share standpoint. Our retail
segment share, primarily on the strength of the GMT-900, retail was up 140 basis points year-to-date, so I would say
that had a benefit and helped from a pricing perspective as well on the GMT-900.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: That's very helpful, thanks. And last question, just on GM Financial credit losses. Would the
credit losses still have improved year-on-year even excluding the Ally IO addition?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yes, is the short answer to that.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Great. Take care, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just give an update on your guidance for North
Americas? Do you still expect the second half to be stronger? I think you started the year saying that the percentage

margin should be flat year over year. And then I guess sort of related to the question on the K2xx, that $300 million in
preproduction costs, will that go away in the second half? Or do you expect similar costs there?
<A - Charles Stevens>: Yeah. On the first question, I don't think we're really changing our guidance. Our guidance
was aggregate. EBIT would be up year-over-year with the cadence, more backend weighted. And I think the plan is
being executed to that, and nothing's changed versus that. From a preproduction startup perspective, relative
specifically to the K2xx in Q3, we're going through the kind of same launch process we went through with [ph] solough
(33:53) in Q2, so those costs will be present in Q3. And I would expect them to start to mitigate a little bit going into
Q4 with the launch of the heavy-duty's and full size SUV in Q1 next year.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And you had very good cash flow in the quarter. Any thoughts on dividends for common
shareholders? I mean, what factors would sort of drive that decision to add a dividend?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: We have no decision on dividends at this point in time. What we've outlined from a capital
allocation point of view is, first and foremost, we're going to be reinvesting in product and the product portfolio. And
you've seen us do that over the last year or two. We're obviously looking to preserve our fortress balance sheet. We
took some action in the quarter along those lines, retiring some expensive debt that we had internationally, which is
obviously accretive to the bottom line.
And as we look out over the next 12 months, 18 months, we do have a significant opportunity later next year to redeem
the very expensive preferred that we have outstanding to the VEBA Trust. So that's something that we'll want to
address. And balancing with all of that is returns to shareholders, we obviously took an aggressive move at the end of
last year with a significant stock repurchase to help facilitate the U.S. Treasury exit. And we're going to look to keep a
balanced approach between those three buckets, between reinvesting in the business, strengthening the balance sheet
and returning cash to shareholders. That balanced approach that you've seen so far will continue.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And just lastly, any update on your partnership with Peugeot? You know there was some
media reports, I guess a month or so ago, you know, claiming that you may be interested in increasing your stake. Any
thoughts on that would be helpful.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Our focus right now is on executing the alliance that we have discussed over the last year
plus. We have product programs that are being actively worked on. Logistics work that's being done. Purchasing work
that's being done. And that's really where the focus is right now.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. Thank you for your help.

Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Yes. Good morning. You know vis-à-vis South America we did see improvement
yesterday from one of your competitors there. I don't think we've seen the Fiat numbers yet. But just what is the path to
sort of getting back to 2%, 3% profits there? And since you are in a product roll out, why aren't we seeing some of the
benefits? Or are we just seeing that swamped by currency and things in other regions?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: I'd say there's really a couple dynamics. As you point out, we do have essentially a brand new
product portfolio in Brazil which is clearly the biggest market. And that is performing the way that we want it to. And
we are in the market place getting the results that we're looking for. There's really been two dynamics that have
impacted us to date this year that were not fully baked into the plan, if you like, from the outset.
The first being the just political unrest that we're seeing in Venezuela which has disrupted our operations on multiple
occasions through the year. And that's an important market from a profitability point of view for us. The second
component is there has obviously been some very substantial moves on an FX basis. While we are significantly
localized in the market from a production point of view, we still have some meaningful amount of imported
components and so on into the market. And so when we have the Brazilian currency, for example, devaluing in the way

that it has it does cause an impact to us; so our portfolio working well, Venezuela disruption making an impact, and FX
making an impact.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: And last year we asked a similar question. You talked about the process to localize
component sourcing. Is that under way? And is there a flip-over point in model years or anything we can look forward
to? Or is it just going to be very gradual?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: That's going to be sort of a component by component activity and it's underway. But further
to go on there.
<Q - Brian Arthur Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody. Just first to follow up on that last question. As far as the outlook for
Latin America in the back half, are there any factors maybe product-related that could offset a bit of a weaker macro
environment?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Obviously we'll be looking at what's going on in the marketplace from a pricing point of view
as to what we can recover on the FX side there. So we'll pay close attention to that. And then the Venezuela situation
will be a variable but from a product point of view, we are finishing up the launch activity through the first half, so it
wasn't all – we didn't come into the year with the whole portfolio launch but we're getting – excuse me, close to that
point now. So we'll get a little bit of tailwind from that in the second half.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. But relative to what we see in Q2 it may accelerate a little bit? Is that fair?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. There's a possibility. Again, it's going to be a function of Venezuela situation and
currency and what we can offset in the marketplace.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. And can you pass along any thoughts on China? What is the impact of a bit more
moderate GDP growth and SHIBOR issues there? Is there sort of a range of expectations that you might have if GDP
growth there has a six handle instead of an eight handle? Any kind of broad macro thoughts there on that market for
you?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Our industry view is still to see the industry up high single digits for the year, 7% to 9%.
We're obviously participating nicely in that and both from a share point of view and margin management point of view.
So our outlook remains reasonably favorable, but obviously we're keeping a close eye on the short term dynamics,
credit markets and all those things.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: All right. And then just lastly, pretty impressive number for Europe in terms of the cost savings.
Is this the run rate that we should be thinking of going forward? Are there elements here, whether it's restructuring that
takes a while to get implemented, or the PSA cost savings that actually continue to, they would be accretive to this?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Well remember, a piece of this is obviously the D&A savings that we talked about...
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Right.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: ...at some length, so that'll roll through. Beyond that, it's really just what you're seeing is the
result of just day to day blocking and tackling, and driving hard in the business. We've got a terrific team on the ground
there that's really executing. We've still got a long way to go to get to where we want to get to. We'll see as we go
along, some restructuring items coming through as we make progress on some of our rationalizations, but we're driving
very hard to continue to deliver good year-over-year improvement.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Great. Thank you. Congratulations.

Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just on pension, I'm curious if the rise in interest rate
changes in any way you think about the pension. Does the rise in interest rates, does it make strategic actions less
imperative, or could it in fact be the opposite that an improvement in the funded status might mean that you could take
that improvement and reinvest it in strategic actions that increase the underfunding, but decrease the overall liability
and risks, such as the transaction that you did with Prudential.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah, I'd say that as the plans get more fully funded, it gives us ultimately more flexibility.
We've been on a long journey now for the last few years, and we've talked about it at great length of de-risking and
having the plans get more fully funded. I think we've made some very significant strides so far. I think everybody's
been anticipating at some point that interest rates would increase. We've seen obviously a piece of that happen so far.
Rates can also go down just as easily as they've just gone up here. But as and if we get more fully funded, I think it
gives us more rather than less flexibility.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Then just lastly, obviously you continue to have very strong results in China overall,
and I know that your 1Q performance there was unusually strong and those margins were unlikely to continue at that
rate, I think it was indicated a few months back. But I'm curious, just given that your wholesales in China were up
something like 11%, why there was not much resulting operating leverage there with the net income margin rising only
10 bps year over year? Is this about the pricing pressures that we often read about? Or is it maybe something else, like
lumpiness of reinvesting in the business or something? Thanks.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: I think it's a reasonable representation of where we are from a run rate point of view. So the
business grew, but it's a competitive market, but we were able to within that competitive market not only hold margins,
but increase them slightly. So we think that's a solid result, and we're going to obviously be continuing to try to work
that going forward.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yeah, thank you very much. Good morning. On the – a follow-up question on the
pension front, the sensitivity, just going off of what's in the K, on the U.S. plan I think it's something like $2.2 billion
for every 25 basis points in rates. Of course it's sort of been well publicized that your allocation to fixed income is now
a lot higher at about 60%, I believe. So clearly there'd be some offset from the decline in your bond portfolio. Can you
help us think about how we might put together a net sensitivity, either in dollar terms, or how we think about the
duration of your asset portfolio?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: I'd say the simplest way to think about that is to halve the sensitivity that we've put out there.
So take the liability side and multiply it by half, and you get the result. Another way of saying it, the effective asset
allocation, approximately half on the asset side of fixed income.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Right. Like $1.1 billion negative for every 25 bps?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yep.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. That's straightforward enough. I had a follow-up question on Brazil. Just with
some of the social unrest that you've seen there and people sort of broadly starting to take down or continuing to take
down, I should say, their GDP expectations, how are you guys thinking about the end market demand for that region
and then Brazil specifically? Are you starting to see that show up in slower showroom traffic? Or has it been fairly
resilient?

of a risk element for our order market in the second half of the year, but like I said, no real signs at this point.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover from Guggenheim. Please proceed.
<Q - Matt T. Stover>: Most of my questions have been addressed. I guess just sort of a big-picture question. There's
been a lot of discussion about the housing market and pickup trucks. And with the snap up in rates and the adjustments
that we see in mortgage rates and the adjustments that we're seeing in some of the housing stocks right now, is that
causing you folks to change your view of how the pickup truck market could or should develop over the course of next
year?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: I wouldn't say that there's a fundamental change. I mean, we're quite focused on what's
driving the underlying demand of the business and the role that interest rates play in that either directly or indirectly
through the housing market. So we're keeping obviously a close eye on that, but there's more than just the housing
market that's driving the truck business at this point in time. We've got obviously our product cadence, a lot of pent-up
demand just generally.
<Q - Matt T. Stover>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just one clarification on cash. Free cash flow was at $2.6 billion,
but it looks like the cash balance, the automotive cash balance was flat sequentially. If you could just help us walk
through that.
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yeah. There's a couple components, or really three main ones and some other cats and dogs.
The first one is we invested $1.3 billion in the quarter into GM Financial to facilitate the Ally International acquisition
in the first part of that. Remember when we announced that deal last year we said that there'd be a $2 billion capital
contribution from GM into GMF. So you saw the first leg of that this quarter. Then we spent about $700 million to
redeem the remaining portion of the GM Korea preferred, which shows up as a debt instrument on the balance sheet. So
it's a 7% coupon instrument that we're able to redeem as we viewed that as expensive. And then the final piece is we
have our preferred dividend that we pay every quarter that rolls through below the cash flow or after the cash flow
measurement line. So those would be the main components.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: That's helpful. And then going back to Europe, I mean, last year you identified about $500
million of fixed cost savings between 2013 and 2015. Can you update us on how much of that $500 million are you
realizing this year, roughly?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: We're getting into a reasonable chunk of it, and we're not constraining ourselves obviously to
$500 million. We're going after everything that we can find. But as you know, the first dollars on those kind of
exercises are the easiest ones to get, and we've made some good progress, but we've still got a fair amount of work to
do.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Just lastly, Chuck you may have mentioned it in the past question, but did you quantify
how much if any positive pricing you saw in the wholesales for K2xx in the second quarter?

<A - Charles Stevens>: I did not indicate that specifically. I would say generally when we looked at Q2 pricing, the
overall impact of new and majors, including the K2, Impalas and other vehicles, net-net was about $600 million of a
tailwind in Q2 with carryover products, primarily the GMT-900 at $300 million headwind.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with
RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Mr. Spak, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Thanks for taking my question. The first one is just a point of clarification on Europe, are you
talking about a tougher second half seasonally? You are still counting on improved performance on a year-over-year
basis, that was just versus the first half?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yes. That's correct. We're driving obviously for year-over-year improvement, but if you go
back and look at the last two, three years you'll see clearly a seasonal decline in the second half.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. And then maybe if you could just give us some color and we could listen to the fixed
income call later, I guess, but what the impact of rising rates has been so far? And whether you've really seen the
consumer rates move up in tandem with rates? Or whether you guys internally, and maybe some of the independents
have been eating some of that interest rate increase?
<A - Daniel Ammann>: Yes. We haven't really seen it at all in terms of the consumer rates in a meaningful way from
– remember again, we're more operating from that perspective at the shorter end of the curve. So the short answer is no.
No meaningful impact at this point.
