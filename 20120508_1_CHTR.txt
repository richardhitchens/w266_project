MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon. My name is Brenda and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Q1 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background
noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Ms. Robin Gutzler, Vice President, Investor Relations, ma'am, you may begin.
Robin Gutzler
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2012 first quarter earnings call. This morning, we issued a press
release over PR Newswire at 8 A.M. Eastern Time detailing our results.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q. We won't review those risk factors and
other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we've reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2011. The
pro forma results reflect the acquisition of certain cable systems in 2011 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011
unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this morning are on a pro forma basis.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that
accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under Financial Information. The press release
and trending schedules are also posted on our website under Investor & News Center.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thank you, Robin. In the first quarter, we saw significant improvement in customer trends, and overall results were as
planned. First quarter revenue was up nearly 3%, while adjusted EBITDA was down approximately 2% year-over-year.
The change in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the costs associated with accelerated customer growth. Free
cash flow was $102 million this quarter versus $74 million in Q1 of last year. We gained 274,000 RGUs, more than
double the net gain last year. We grew 20,000 video customers for the first quarterly video growth in five years.
Internet customer additions grew by more than 50% year-over-year, and we added nearly 100,000 new relationships in
the quarter, more than triple the gain a year ago.
Given the higher level of customer acquisition, we have an excellent opportunity to upgrade the level of service we
provide those customers. In evaluating the key levers to drive further growth, my focus in the first three months has
been on revising our pricing, packaging and selling structure and accelerating our path to an improved product set,
particularly our video product. The goals are to have higher ARPU per connect, lower transaction costs per customer,
better retention by improving the value relationship with our customers, and increasing operating cash flow across the
12 million homes we pass.
Our Internet product is superior across virtually our entire footprint. The company has been smart in using this Internet
advantage to gain new customer relationships and we'll continue to press this competitive advantage. In video, we've
improved the quality of the product we offer today and we will accelerate that. For example, Charter's goal is to have
100 HD channels by the end of this year. Today, we're on a path to reach that by midyear. Above and beyond HD
channels, we will also employ a number of tactics to achieve higher digital sell-in and HD DVR take-up. We have the
necessary products and network capabilities today to create a compelling digital offer for existing customers and
successfully compete for new video relationships by having a better video product than our competitors can replicate.
Our voice product will be more fully featured and priced more favorably than our competitors. And our commercial
business is rapidly growing, with a strong competitive position and a superior product offering. The company is
under-penetrated in the marketplace both in residential and commercial and has a significant opportunity for growth.
We have a powerful network and capabilities, and we're ramping our strategy and accelerating activities, which will we
believe will deliver results.
I'll now turn it over to Chris to give more details on the results for the quarter.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. Before I begin, I'd like to point out two reporting changes we made this past quarter. We moved revenue
and customers related to bulk residential agreements from commercial to residential. In addition, we're not including
residential customer relationships related to these agreements on an equivalent bulk unit or EBU basis. Both of these
changes are reflected in our financial results and trending schedules including historically and more details can be

found in the footnotes to those schedules.
Turning to slide four, first-quarter revenue grew 2.8% year-on-year. Residential Internet grew 9%, driven by share
gains and growth in home networking, partially offset by the impact of promotional offers. As we discussed on the
fourth quarter call, our focus is on driving penetration and using Internet to create customer relationships, increasingly
bundled relationships as our video product improves. Phone revenue was up 2%, reflecting customer growth and also
slightly lower ARPU consistent with our strategy to use attractively priced offers to drive deeper product penetration in
homes we serve. Video revenue was down 3% year-on-year. In video, while we did significantly better with our basic
customer base in Q1, we still have a year of net losses that impact the top line. As we start to do better in video, it will
take several periods to see the full benefit in revenue.
In addition, we saw a $12 million decline in premium and VOD over the prior year. We expect to get greater benefit
from premium as part of the pricing and packaging strategies Tom discussed and while free VOD usage is up
substantially, paid VOD usage has declined. In addition, Q1 was a poor quarter for events.
As I mentioned on the fourth quarter call, we continued to offer promotions to drive share gains during to first quarter.
We were able to achieve the significant volume growth with little impact on total ARPU per residential customer
relationship, which declined $0.78 from Q4 2011 to Q1 and reflected a higher mix of lower ARPU non-video
relationships.
We also rolled through price adjustments towards the end of Q1, which included increases to certain Internet tiers and
basic and digital video. April will be the first month of those increases – the first full month of those increases, so these
had little impact on Q1, but will have a positive impact on revenue in Q2.
Turning to slide six, commercial business continues to accelerate, growing revenues over 20% compared to the first
quarter last year. Our cell backhaul pipeline is stronger than ever, but we had fewer activations in Q1 driving [ph] less
install (7:36) revenue. And ad sales were up 6.5% year-over-year driven primarily by the accounting change we had
discussed in previous quarters and we also saw price increases in volume in political and automotive spend.
Moving to adjusted EBITDA on slide seven, we saw margin pressure in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA was down
2% year-on-year. There were three big drivers impacting earnings and margin in the quarter. First, our video margin. I
already mentioned the revenue pressures for video. Stabilizing and returning the video category to growth would be a
significant top-line and bottom-line drivers for us down the road, but our emphasis on growth will likely result in both
OpEx and CPE investment in the near term. On the expense side, we recognized programming and re-trans cost
increases of $22 million, but these were not matched by price adjustments in Q1; and therefore, impact the
year-over-year comparison. We expect improvement in Q2 related to the rate adjustments.
The second large driver was the impact on margin from accelerated customer growth. We estimate the higher expense
to drive the accelerated growth inside the quarter relative to the same quarter last year was approximately $17 million,
driven by marketing, sales and reconnect expenses. We'd like to see more of this and hope it continues, and as Tom
mentioned, we'll look to further improve the ROI of that spend by including more value into what we sell, resulting in
higher revenue per connect and greater customer lifetime value.
And the third main driver of lower EBITDA was our customer experience investment, which totaled approximately $9
million in Q1. This was driven by increased contract labor and higher levels of preventative maintenance. This is likely
to continue in the near term, but should pay off in the form of lower churn and better cash flow.
Importantly, in areas outside of customer experience and growth-related cost, we remain disciplined on non-revenue
generating expenses. For example, first quarter bad debt expense was 12% lower than the prior year, even as we grew
sales.
Turning to slide 8 and CapEx, recall that we estimated 2012 CapEx at $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion on the Q4 call. As we
mentioned, this will likely – will give an uptick in Q2 as we finalize and implement the strategy that Tom highlighted.
Spending in Q1 totaled $340 million, which was $16 million lower than last year due to timing of our scalable
infrastructure spend, which was partially offset by higher CPE spend to fund the customer growth.

As you can see on slide 9, we had another quarter of positive free cash flow, which was $28 million higher than Q1 of
last year, driven by working capital improvements, partially offset by higher cash interest payments.
Since March 31, we continue to refinance our debt obligations to optimistically improve our maturity profile and to
amend certain provisions of the credit agreement to bring in them line with other parts of our capital structure. Slide 19
contains our pro forma maturity profile for all transactions completed since quarter-end. We expect our annualized
interest expense pro forma for all refinancing activities to-date to be approximately $860 million. And our leverage was
4.8 times at quarter-end.
In closing, I'd like to remind everyone about out tax assets highlighted on slide 10, which are equally important for debt
and equity holders. As of 12/31 we had $9.3 billion of tax basis, and $7.4 billion of NOLs and we don't expect to be a
significant taxpayer until after 2017. Simply put, $1 of EBITDA for Charter is not the same as the $1 of EBITDA
elsewhere, given our NOLs and outsized tax basis. With positive free cash flow, a moderate leverage target and
valuable tax assets, we have a unique financial profile to drive triple play growth.
Operator, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first audio question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm wondering if Mr. Rutledge could maybe
discuss in a bit greater detail what some of the changes to your pricing and packaging you may be considering Would
you consider ever moving away from the focus on offering, for example, your single play HSD product which you've
been doing since I think the back half of 2010? And then I do have one follow-up question.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, the most significant thing that we're doing from a packaging perspective and from
a pricing perspective is improving our video product and adding value to our video product. Charter has a superior
network infrastructure and hasn't been fully taking the advantage of it because of the legacy of its analog subscriber
base. And what we're doing is improving the digital product we go to market with in video. So the most significant
impact from a consumer perspective will be that, when they buy video from Charter going forward, they're going to get
a much richer package in terms of the kind of quality of picture they get and the amount of channels they get. And
they're going to get offered that in a way that, combined with data and voice, make to the compelling offer from a
competitive point of view. And it'll be a superior product to satellite, a superior product to U-verse.
In the video space, it'll be obviously a better data product; already is a better data product than our wireline
competitors, and the voice product will be more fully featured and less expensive. So combined, it'll be actually sold at
a higher ARPU than we currently sell, but the value proposition for the customer will be much greater; we'll be taking
advantage of our network assets.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Okay. And one – I guess the follow-up question, I'll just go back to the original question.
Would you – are you still as focused – do you think going forward, will you still be as focused on pushing the single
play HSD product that you had priced at about the same price as it was as part of the bundle back in the end of 2010, or
do you think you might steer clear of doing that going forward?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: We continue to have great success with our high-speed data product and we'll continue to
support that in the marketplace as a standalone product, but we'll be also enhancing that market posture with additional
packages.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next audio question comes from the line of Bishop Cheen with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bishop Cheen>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Your leverage continues to improve, although it seems to be
at this -- inside five times. As you look out with all of the other projects you have going on for capital allocation, where
do you think you can take your leverage a year from now? Or for a little wider look, say, by the beginning of 2014,
where would you like to have it as a stable place?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, I think you know, absent providing – this is Chris -- absent providing EBITDA
guidance, we remain focused on getting into our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. Frankly, the timing for us
getting there depends on the level of success that we're having in driving some of the initiatives that Tom was
describing and the strategic opportunities that present themselves along the way. So, in the meantime, our first and
largest priority is to protect the long-term EBITDA and cash flow generation capability of the business. And that may
mean investing more in OpEx and capital to go drive that kind growth that puts you in a better steady-state cash flow
position, which ultimately deleverages you significantly through – mechanically really through EBITDA growth.
So the timing of that depends not only on the long-term success, but also the upfront organic opportunities that present
themselves to good invest for growth. So I don't want to provide a guidance as to when we're going to be hitting that;
it's a function of the growth opportunities and other strategic opportunities that come. But it's safe to say that we still
believe that 4 to 4.5 times plus or minus a half turn periodically to enable strategic opportunities, that 4 to 4.5 times is
the right place to be for us. Hope that's helpful.
<Q - Bishop Cheen>: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Your next audio question comes from the line of David Joyce with Miller Tabak.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment a little more broadly on the strength that
we're seeing in the video product. Does it seem like there's more consumers coming back into the Pay TV
environment? Granted you break out residential and commercial video subs, but the residential was a nice surprise and
if there is more color you could provide on it, be great.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Not sure I can tell you what the exact macro trend is, but it's certainly – there's a couple
of favorable winds at our back, which are certainly the economy isn't getting worse. I'm not sure it's getting better from
a housing perspective. But it's not getting worse and the amount of Telco overbuild as a percentage of passings activity
has declined year-over-year and it looks like that's a longer-term trend as well. So, that's having somewhat of a
favorable impact on growth opportunities.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: And where are you generally on the evolution of the TV Everywhere product becoming more
available?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: We have it in our product roadmap for this year and our plan is to roll it out – I shouldn't
say TV Everywhere, but a tablet-based video product, some elements of which will be TV Everywhere, but parts of it
will be cable television as well inside the house.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: All right. Thank you.

<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. I have two, Chris. Wanted to ask you or Tom about the
incremental spending in the quarter. I think you said $17 million related to customer growth, and it includes marketing?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: That's correct.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. So I mean, look, you added 100,000 plus incremental TSUs, you guys talked
about the RGU increase. If I strip out the marketing increase, and I'd love for you guys to comment on the marketing
spend in the quarter, whether that – where that was sort of aimed, if that was brand or kind of more direct marketing or
variable with customer growth. I mean, you're spending – you're not spending much money to add a lot of incremental
services. So I'm wondering if that's how you guys think about it, if I back out marketing, it was like $5 million increase,
or $50 an incremental TSU, which is a pretty fabulous return. So I'm wondering if you could talk about the marketing
spend, how much that was brand versus sort of directly related to customer growth, and then if that's the right way to
think about your sort of return on investment on subs going forward.
And then just on the price increase in April, Chris, would you be willing to comment on EBITDA growing in the
second quarter or not at this point? I know you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but obviously, you're investing quite
a bit, but you also have some help on the ARPU front in 2Q, which you talked about.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So, maybe I'll take the second one first, which is we're not going to provide Q2
guidance for revenue or EBITDA, but it's safe to say that given the dynamic of having the bulk of your programming
increases flow through in Q1 and at the same time not taking a rate increase until effectively Q2, it certainly will be
beneficial to the top line, much of which or all of which [inaudible (19:45) bottom line, so it should be an improvement
relative to Q2.
On the second one as related to...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. I was going to say we're not going to break out our marketing spend by brand and
by acquisition, but marketing costs are a factor obviously in growth, but so are transaction costs. Our objective is to
create more valuable products that have longer subscriber lives, which means that the ROI or the cash flow per
transaction goes up on a lifetime basis. And that's our primary objective and we already have a good transaction
process, meaning that the cost of a transaction for us is positive from an ROI perspective, and that includes the SAC
costs or the marketing costs and we think that we can improve it.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And Tom, you mentioned the video product getting better and talked about high def and
adding more programming. What about the Guide? That's been an area where customers I think they probably had
some negative experiences, and particularly on some of the legacy boxes. What's the plan for the Guide at Charter over
time? Are you happy with the product today?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we have an issue with the product in our legacy boxes on how to deal with that,
and as part of our – my prior answer about TV Everywhere, what we're contemplating is putting out IP products in the
home and out of the home that give you control over your existing set-top boxes, so the ability to program a DVR, to
do search and to do other kinds of – even to change channels, have been deployed in other parts of the cable industry as
applications on tablets, smartphones and PCs. And I think that that opportunity allows us to take our legacy boxes and
make those legacy boxes work better from a user interface perspective and allow functions like search and discovery to
appear on all of our existing set tops.
So, I'm actually fairly positive on the situation we have in terms of the way the consumer electronics industry has
evolved. It actually creates an opportunity for us to take our existing capital base of deployed boxes and make them
really work a lot better without having to replace all those boxes with a new more powerful box that has a capability of
carrying a more robust Guide. And I think that has long-run implications for the kind of money that we're going to have
to invest in the CPE. I think that means that we can have thinner client CPE going forward which means that it should
cost less on an incremental basis.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just a question for Mr. Rutledge. There is a perception in the marketplace and I don't
know if you agree with this that the video product is still very much the anchor product for cable and then once that
relationship is lost it's very difficult to sell in other services. I guess my question is two-fold. Do you agree with that as
a general premise or do you see that sort of changing as data becomes more important? And given that, is there – is it
fair to say that your top priority is to sort of get the video customers, as a percent of all the passings up as sort of a
prerequisite to drive other products?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I don't – I wouldn't say it's a prerequisite. Video is a great business as a standalone
business and it's a very powerful medium and it allows you to advertise effectively and sell other products across your
platform. So having – when you're a multiproduct company, having a video relationship is a real competitive
advantage. That said, it doesn't mean that all of the products that the network is capable of providing shouldn't be sold
to the market niches that exist. So for instance, commercial is not particularly video-centric in terms of the opportunity
and yet, it's a big piece of business.
So at the residential level, we are under-penetrated from a video point of view. It's a good business from a return on
investment perspective. It allows you to sell other products. And so, I think it's an essential part of our product mix and
we ought to take advantage of it because our network's capable of doing it. But that doesn't mean that in places where
video doesn't work as a driver that we shouldn't use other aspects of our network like high-speed data and voice, Wi-Fi
to create additional opportunity. So I don't look at it as a prerequisite, but just as a significant opportunity.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital Group.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, on the video side, could you talk a little bit
about where you are seeing disconnects? How much of that is losing subscribers to satellite? How much is losing
subscribers to over-the-top? How much is just losing households, people moving in with one another and so forth due
to the economy?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we actually gained subscribers in the first quarter.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Right. But on a net basis, certainly you had disconnection and if we were to think about
those disconnects, just would love to get a little sense of where you think those guys are going?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, essentially, I mean, to speak in generalities, there is very little over-the-top
substitution going on. Almost – and the whole multi-channel universe is highly competitive. The biggest competitor
that Charter has is satellite, and so a lot of activity is a result of moves and other commercial activity, but in the end the
subscriber base is subscribing to multi-channel television generally at very high penetrations, and the biggest
competitor we have in the video space is satellite.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Okay, thanks. And then on – with respect to the programming costs, do you see when you
look out – I mean do you see any easing on the horizon or should we expect kind of continued unit cost increases that
we've been seeing over the past several quarters?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I think that the programming cost is a – there's nothing changing the current trends in
programming except that it's become a very big number. There's some regulatory pressure on programmers. The
re-trans issue has the potential of creating additional regulatory pressure. And so whether that'll cause programmers to
moderate their rate of increase, it's hard to say, but right now, it's a difficult part of the business to manage from a cost
perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi. Thank you. I'm sorry if you said this in prepared remarks. We got dropped off the call for a
little bit. But I was just wondering if you could just update us on where you are with the TiVo rollout. I think that it was
originally scheduled for second half and then that was going to be delayed. And then, also just wanted to see if you
could comment on the gross add versus the churn trends, I know gross adds obviously accelerated with the increase in
marketing spend, but was wondering what you were seeing on the churn side? Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Do you want to take about churn?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. So the bulk of our performance inside of Q1 and Q4 really came from
improved acquisition. We did see improved retention levels as well. And so year-over-year improvements and we
continue to do well as the customer experience investment has taken hold. But the bulk of the net gains improvement
still remains from an acquisition side.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And we continue to work integrating the TiVo product, we have a complicated bot
infrastructure and we're continuing to work on getting on that product developed.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Do you have any kind of update on the timeframe for the commercial rollout, or...?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: We do have some customers in place in Texas, but we haven't announced the general
rollout as of yet.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi with S&P Capital.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Hi. Good morning, there, and thanks for taking the questions. So as I look at the penetration
for Charter, one of the things that strikes me is that you guys have the – among the highest digital penetration in the
industry. And yet, that seems to not translate into some of the other potential drivers that some of your peers have been
able to leverage. So Tom, speaking to – perhaps your experience at Cablevision, what is it that strikes you here as the
potential anomaly in terms of actually leveraging this very high digital penetration and how should we think about that
going forward? The video penetration overall is still far below the industry average, and yet, the digital is very high and
it seems to me as you alluded to that, the plant is as good as anyone else's, so any thoughts on that, thoughts on
addressing that would be helpful?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Sure. Just because you have a high penetration of digital boxes doesn't mean your entire
product isn't digital. And what we are doing is removing analog signals and increasing the amount of total digital
signals in the product mix so that all incremental customers going forward are 100% digital, and that's different than
the digital set-top penetration, which is publicly reported. So the actual customer experience, taking advantage of the
network capability, will be a greater experience going forward. They'll have more digital signals, more HD signals,
more two-way interactive signals and the product will be better than what competitive satellite companies can replicate.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Okay, that's helpful. Just a follow-up question for Chris on the liquidity situation. It seems like
working capital was a potential contributor this quarter. I'm wondering how you think about that in a context of the full
year. Do you expect the working capital to be a positive contributor and how does that kind of fit into your overall

liquidity management? I know you have about $1 billion avail on the facility, yet cash seems to be relatively
precariously low. So I'm just kind of wondering whether this – you view this as a potential constraint to liquidity
management and how you intend to address that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, I think there is a distinction there between cash being low and that's just good
treasury and good debt management to make sure you're paying down in your revolver; you're sitting flush with cash
when you don't need to. As to working capital, it was a good working capital order inside of Q1. It's highly seasonal,
and you'll see it pop up and down during the course of the year. But from an annual perspective, there's nothing inside
the business that makes it a significant user or contributor of cash. We tend to be somewhat working capital neutral as
in the past and nothing has fundamentally changed. But there will be seasonality between the quarters.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi. I have a couple of questions. Chris, can you sort of talk about what was your rate increase this
year on video and also on the broadband side on whether it's also for the service and hardware component on
broadband? And second, more on the strategic side, given your assets are across I think 25 states, is there still an
aggressive strategy to rationalize and make them more contiguous doing swaps and is that market still active right now?
Any color on that would be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Do you want to take about the rate increase?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. So the rate increases for both basic and digital customers as well as Internet
range anywhere from $2 to $5 and so roughly 40% of our base got a 3% increase. And that was the effect of the rate
increase and March was not a full month and so the first full month will really begin in Q2.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And while there is an opportunity to rationalize assets, we don't discuss M&A activity.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan from Raymond James.
<Q - Alex Sklar>: Thanks, this is Alex Sklar here for Frank. So you talked about the wireless backhaul backlog being
significant, I'm wondering if you could provide any more color on, how many fiber-to-the-tower deals you've signed to
date and what the total opportunity is there? And then the follow-up on the TiVo question. Given what you were saying
earlier on finding ways to improve existing boxes rather than spend on new equipment, is TiVo still going to fit into the
long-term plan or can you go all IP without them? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Maybe on the first question, I'll hand that over to Don Detampel, who heads up our
Commercial Business.
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Thanks, Chris. So, as you mentioned, our cell tower pipeline remains very strong, so we
reported 2,600 cell towers either in service or under contract. So you can do the math on it, we had a very strong first
quarter. I do see that continuing into the near future as carriers continue to push – the wireless carriers to drive their 4G
networks. And these carriers started in largely the Tier 1 markets. And as you know, we service primarily Tier 2, Tier 3
markets. So now, this bandwidth demand to the towers and their deployment of 4G is kind of moving in our realm and
we're very well positioned with our network to take advantage of it.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And your question about going all IP in terms of set-top boxes -- there are TVs that are
coming out in market that are all IP, or can take an IP feed, I guess is a better way of saying it, because they can take a
regular feed as well. Creates an opportunity to have a cable system that both feeds IPTV and MPEG TV and there are
multiple variations of MPEG as well, which actually from a technical perspective are more efficient than IP from a total
data throughput perspective.
And our network, because of the server-based architecture that we've constructed, can serve multiple kinds of devices.
So we can serve legacy set-top boxes with MPEG-2. We can create new hybrid boxes that are IP and MPEG, using
more efficient MPEG standards for server-based programming, and we can mix and match all of that in the same cable
system, and there's enough channel capacity to serve all of those functions. So as I look forward, I think our CPE
evolution will result in a world where our incremental cost of CPE per customer will go down as we buy world-class
CPE, world-vendor-class CPE, and buy that in multiple formats. And so how that will all evolve, I'm not sure, but the
architecture that we've constructed allows us to follow the marketplace to its most efficient place.
<Q - Alex Sklar>: All right. Thanks. That's very helpful.

Your final question comes from the line of Rich Tullo with Albert Fried & Co.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Hey. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Not too many left. Can you remind us how
many channels were added in the first quarter?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: In terms of HD?
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Yeah.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Look, there's multimarket...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, it's by market, it's multiple systems. I think the key stat you want to be thinking
about is that at the end of 2010 we were at 43 average HD channels; at the end of 2011 we were at 75, and we'll be over
100 in – by mid-year.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: That's right.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Okay. And was the lower Video on Demand usage a function of consumers in the economy or
more of a function of just the video calendar with not a lot of big movies out?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: It's hard to say that the transactional Video on Demand went down, meaning Video on
Demand that people pay for, but the amount of total product that's available in Video on Demand, including free Video
on Demand is increasing dramatically and usage is increasing dramatically. So that the overall cable platform
infrastructure from a VOD perspective is increasingly being used and increasingly being valued by customers.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Great. Thank you, everyone.
