net earnings of $331 million or $0.61 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $6.2 billion.
A GAAP reconciliation of special items can be found on charts two and three. In the following discussion of the
business segment, I will refer to chart 4 through 10.
Turning to chart four. This illustrates the change in contribution by business segment from third quarter 2011 to fourth
quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the fourth quarter refer to changes from the third quarter unless otherwise noted.
We begin our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, charts five and six. Timberlands
contributed $70 million to pre-tax earnings, $8 million more than Q3. Earnings from the disposition of non-strategic
Timberlands increased $17 million to $21 million.
Fee harvest volumes rose 2% in the West and 5% in the South. Log prices declined 4% in the West due to weaker
Chinese demand. Log prices were slightly higher in the South. Road and silviculture costs were seasonally lower. Fuel
costs were higher.
Wood Products, chart seven and eight. In the seasonally weak fourth quarter, Wood Products lost $61 million, $18
million more than in Q3 but less than in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales volume seasonally declined: lumbar 8%,
oriented strand board 6%, and Engineered Wood Products 12%.
As illustrated on chart eight, price realizations for most products were lower. Lumber and oriented strand board prices
decreased 2%, engineered solid section prices declined 4%, and engineered I-joist prices were 1% lower. Operating
rates were lower in response to weaker market demand. Downtime across all product lines increased from 12 weeks in
Q3 to 47 weeks in Q4. Unit manufacturing costs were higher due to market downtime.
Cellulose Fibers, chart nine. The pre-tax contribution to earnings in fourth quarter was $134 million, $1 million less
than in Q3. Average pulp price realizations declined 3% or $25 per air-dried metric ton. Pulp sales volume increased
10%. There were no annual maintenance outages in the quarter.
Real Estate, chart 10. Real Estate contributed $41 million to pre-tax earnings, $31 million more than in third quarter.
Earnings were also higher than in Q4 2010.
Single-family home closings seasonally increased 15% from Q3 to 582 homes. Year-over-year closings declined 4%.
The average price on homes closed decreased $5000 from the third quarter. This reduction was due to mix.
The single-family gross margin was 25.4%, an increase from 23% in Q3, but lower than the gross margin of 26.1% in
the year-ago quarter. Land sales contributed $19 million in earnings and Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other was $6
million lower in Q4. Gains on foreign exchange were more than offset by increased charges for share based
compensation and other items.
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
Despite continued economic challenges, our company took full advantage of every opportunity to improve our overall
performance during the past quarter and the entire year and I am pleased with our overall results.
In my remarks this morning, I'll provide some highlights of our fourth quarter results for each business segment as well
as observations on overall performance for the year. I'll also provide my perspective for the year ahead. Patty will then
present our first quarter outlook as well as financial highlights and then I'll add a few more remarks before turning to
your questions.
First, before commenting on the fourth quarter, I want to set a context for the full year 2011. As we entered the year, I
told you that we were basing our plans for the year on an assumption that we would begin to see some recovery in U.S.

housing. We targeted a level of 525,000 single-family housing starts, which would have been an 11% increase from the
2010 level of 471,000. Unfortunately, we never experienced the eagerly awaited spring selling season and single-family
starts ended the year at 429,000, even lower than 2010 and 18% short of our forecast.
Offsetting this negative drag from lower than anticipated housing activity was the continued positive strength in our
Cellulose Fibers markets for most of the year plus increased opportunities for log exports to China during the first part
of the year.
The other major surprise during the year was the devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan on March 11.
Though we suffered immediate short-term disruption to our export sales of logs, lumber and Cellulose Fibers, we were
able to work through this extreme upset condition with minimal impact. This was mostly due to the extraordinary
efforts of our team in Japan, which worked so effectively to meet the needs of our customers.
Now let's shift to a discussion of the accomplishments of each business segment in the past year. In Timberlands,
stronger export markets for the year help to offset continued weakness in U.S. demand. We fully leveraged our
long-term export relationships and our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands to use these markets to increase
earnings over last year.
Harvest levels for the full year increased 19% in both the West and the South. Increases in the West were primarily
related to increased export sales, while increases in the South were primarily the result of increased emphasis on
third-party sales.
Log exports are an integral part of our Timberlands business providing valuable market diversification. In 2010,
exports represented approximately 60% of our third-party sales volume from our western lands.
We spoke throughout the year about the significant impact of increased demand for logs from China. We were able to
quickly respond as this opportunity emerged using all of our competitive strengths in the log export market, including
harvesting, hauling, port access and sales and marketing relationships.
While maintaining historic volumes to our largest long-term customers in Japan, we added additional volume to meet
increased China demand resulting in a slight shift in mix among our Asian markets. In the fourth quarter, export
volume decreased from the third quarter as a result of an anticipated slowdown on exports to China. For the full year,
however, overall export volume was up, coupled with an increase in realizations.
In addition to the log sales, we generate income from our lands from a variety of sources, including mineral rights,
recreational leases, and biomass. Our minerals revenue was lower in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year.
Production levels of natural gas dropped in response to lower prices. Reported revenue from lease fees declined, as fees
collected in prior years were fully amortized.
Turning to Wood Products, a business that was challenging enough before the 2011 slowdown in housing, we
maintained our focus on using all available levers to improve cash flow and profitability. In the seasonally slow fourth
quarter, we experienced soft market conditions with lower prices and reduced volumes. We responded by taking more
market downtime.
For the full year, taking into consideration adverse market factors, we improved performance in areas that we can
control. For the year, we were able to offset the significant negative effect of lower prices and higher log and trade
costs with performance improvements in a number of areas across our business. Our ongoing improvement efforts
reduced manufacturing and related costs over $100 million, and we reduced SG&A by nearly $60 million.
In addition to our focus on reducing costs and selectively increasing price for certain products, we added new
customers. We also expanded our sales in select geographic markets, including sales of Canadian lumber to meet
growing Chinese demand.
In Real Estate, we continue to pursue our strategy as a regional builder and land developer, adapting to individual
market conditions and diverse customer needs. For the second consecutive year, WRECO was profitable, which is
strong performance relative to our competitors. Despite a decline in closings for the year, consistent with the overall

market decline, our strong margins held firm, helped by mix.
In the fourth quarter, traditionally our strongest, as homes sold earlier in the year are delivered to customers, we had a
profitable quarter that included earnings from both home closings and land sales. Land sales historically represent
about 10% of our total Real Estate revenues, though timing throughout the year can be a bit uneven. In the fourth
quarter, land sales represented a higher percentage of our revenue than normal, but were in line with our historic
averages for the full year.
During the quarter, we experienced lower traffic year-over-year, but conversion rates of prospective buyers improved.
As we approached year-end in November and December, we had an encouraging pick-up in sales, about a 5% increase
over the same period last year. This positive momentum has carried into the New Year as sales for the first five weeks
of the year are up an average of 16% over last year. Though individual market conditions vary, and five weeks does not
establish a longer-term trend, maybe we're beginning to see some green shoots in the market for new homes.
In Cellulose Fibers, as expected, we experienced slowing conditions during the fourth quarter as market inventories
increased and prices came under pressure. Our realizations were down, which was offset with increased volume,
resulting in earnings approximately equal to our strong third quarter.
For the full year, this marked the second consecutive year of record earnings for Cellulose Fibers, a strong
performance, given more challenging market conditions. All products contributed to this success as we maintained our
focus on operational excellence, product innovation, and meeting the needs of our customers.
Before turning the call over to Patty, let me provide some context for our outlook for the upcoming year.
As we enter 2012, we still face an uncertain environment. December's reported unemployment levels improved slightly
over one year ago, so we're moving in the right direction, but progress is slow. This morning's report shows some
additional slight improvement.
Consumer confidence is still very weak, and though somewhat improved at year end, it is still languishing near the low
levels seen in 2008 and 2009. Uncertainty about the pace of housing recovery is still high. Structural issues in the
mortgage market are not resolved, and the direction of prices is not clear.
The good news on the housing front for me is that the Fed clearly is now engaged on this issue. This may generate
some increased attention to the critical role that housing must play in the overall recovery of our national economy.
With this backdrop, we are basing our 2012 plans on 665,000 total housing starts, 455,000 single-family, which is a
modest 6% increase over 2011, plus 210,000 multi-family. We consider this to be a conservative assumption, and there
are certainly some who are more optimistic. Given our experience in 2011, we are planning cautiously while being
prepared to flex up, if we have the opportunity.
For Timberlands, we are planning to increase harvest levels approximately in line with our forecasted increase in
housing starts. Most of this increase will occur in the South, where we also have an increasing third-party sales.
In 2012, we'll continue to play to our strength in export markets, plus take advantage of opportunities for other revenue,
including minerals and biomass. We expect natural gas prices to remain low, though we had some opportunities in the
Tuscaloosa basin shale oil play where we leased land in 2011 for exploratory activity.
With respect to biomass as a renewable fuel, we're positioned to respond to market demand in the U.S. as well as
overseas, if public policy supports this renewable fuel resource.
In Wood Products, in 2012, we will focus on continued improvement to reduce cost and increase revenues, introducing
new products, broadening our customer base and improving our relative competitiveness. As market conditions
improve, we have the production capacity to respond quickly to meet customer needs.
In WRECO, we expect to increase volume and pace with the overall housing recovery, though we believe that public
builders such as ourselves have an opportunity to increase share over the next several years, given our land base and
our access to construction capital. We will anticipate what today's homebuyers want and respond quickly with

appealing new homes in great communities, leveraging our regional value propositions and industry-leading customer
satisfaction.
As the market begins to pick up, our land position gives us the capacity to increase home production, plus we're poised
to sell desirable lots to land-short builders as part of our long-term strategy.
In Cellulose Fibers, we will continue to focus on what we consider the basics: continuously improving manufacturing
excellence, carefully targeting capital expenditures to lower costs and increase volume, and developing innovative new
products to meet the needs of our strategic, growing global customers.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook as well as provide financial highlights.
Patty?
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning everyone.
The outlook for the first quarter by business segment is summarized on chart 11, I'll begin the outlook discussion with
Timberlands.
In the West, fee harvest volumes will likely increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. We are
expecting a higher mix of logs to Japan versus China which should result in a higher sales realization for export logs as
our Japanese customers buy our premium grade logs. Domestic log prices in the West are anticipated to decrease
slightly. Dan mentioned earlier that fee harvest volumes in the South are projected to increase for the full year of 2012
compared to 2011. However, fee harvest volume in the first quarter should be similar to the fourth quarter as typically
the first quarter is seasonally our lowest volume quarter. Prices will likely be flat quarter-to-quarter, although we
anticipate a slightly positive mix variance. Costs are expected to increase due to higher silviculture spending in the
South and diesel fuel costs will likely be higher across all geographies.
Non-strategic lands sales are expected to be lower compared to the fourth quarter but the timing of these sales is often
difficult to forecast. Excluding the effect of non-strategic land sales, overall Timberland earnings in the first quarter are
expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter.
In Wood Products, lumber prices are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth. Oriented
strand board pricing is anticipated to increase over 5%. However, pricing for both product lines is anticipated to be
lower than the first quarter of 2011. Volume for both product lines should increase over 5% compared to the fourth
quarter.
Engineered Wood Product prices are anticipated relatively flat, while volumes are expected to increase. Log costs in
the South and Canada are expected to be higher offset by lower cost in the West. Operating rates will likely be higher
across all product lines as manufacturing resumed normal operations after the market and holiday downtime in the
fourth quarter.
As is typical of the first quarter, we anticipate as seasonal working capital build and we will continue our sharp focus of
matching supply with demand. We accept that our loss in Wood Products will narrow in the first quarter compared to
the fourth quarter and be similar to the first quarter of 2011. Lower prices and higher freight costs compared to Q1
2011 are anticipated to offset our improving sales volume and operating rate.
In Cellulose Fibers, we expect significantly lower realizations for pulp in the first quarter driven by the continued
economic uncertainty in global markets and high inventories worldwide. Shipment volumes are expected to be slightly
lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth. This quarter, we will also have increased maintenance costs and lower
production as a result of more scheduled annual maintenance compared to the fourth quarter when there were no
scheduled maintenance outages. We expect costs for chemicals, fuel and energy to be higher due to the planned
outages. Also, fuel and energy cost will increase due to the winter season. Overall, we expect considerably lower
earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth.

In our Real Estate segment, the first quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year for home closing. In addition,
we continue to battle the headwinds of continued challenging economic conditions and mortgage qualification hurdles
for homebuyers. We expect approximately 360 single-family home closings compared to 582 in the fourth. Prices are
expected to be lower with margins in the high teens, down from margins of 25% in the fourth quarter due to a shift in
market and product mix.
On the encouraging sign, as Dan mentioned, we have seen stronger sales during the month of January compared to last
year but these will not affect first-quarter earnings as the closings for these sales would typically occur later in the year.
Excluding any earnings from potential land sales, we expect a loss in our Real Estate segment in the first quarter.
Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had cash of $953 million,
debt declined to under $4.5 billion as we reduced debt by over $30 million during the fourth quarter. Our total debt
maturities over the next five years are approximately $600 million with about $188 million of that due in 2012. In
addition, we have $1 billion credit facility that has no borrowings outstanding. So as a result, we continue to have solid
liquidity.
The underfunded status of our pension and other post-retirement plans increased by approximately $540 million
compared to this time last year. This was largely due to changes in actuarial assumptions, the largest of which was the
lowering of the discount rate. For example, in our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan. The discount
rate decreased by 90 basis points and is now at 4.5%. Reductions in future benefit payments as a result of plan
amendments to our other post retirement benefit plans decreased the overall liability.
Based on the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plans, as of year-end 2011, we estimate that we will have a
cash contribution of up to $60 million. This payment is not due until September of 2013. No cash contribution was
required for this plan in 2011.
Contributions in 2012 for the remaining plans, which include our Canadian registered pension plans, our non-qualified
pension plans, as well as other post-retirement benefit payments will be similar to the amounts contributed in 2011 for a
total of approximately $140 million. During 2011, we had capital expenditures of approximately $240 million. During
2012, we expect to spend in the range of $260 million to $290 million.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty.
As I conclude my remarks this morning, I'd like to end where I started. I am pleased with our performance in the
context of the challenging market conditions that we faced in 2011, but I am not satisfied. Given the level of
uncertainty in our markets, for 2012 we are planning conservatively while maintaining readiness and looking forward
to the opportunity to flex up to meet increased demand. All of this in Weyerhaeuser are committed to taking full
advantage of every opportunity to improve our overall performance and to safely deliver the sustainable results that you
expect and deserve. And now, we welcome your questions. Kathy?

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning. In Wood Products, your initial goal last year was to be cash positive and
obviously the market became much more challenging later in the year. Can you share with us how you are thinking
about the Wood Products business reaching cash flow positive or being operating income positive in 2012?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes, Anthony. As you know, we ended up in 2011 encountering a more difficult market in
2010. Nevertheless, we made a significant number of improvements as I noted throughout the year, both in improving
operating cost as well as reducing SG&A, which help to offset declines in prices and increases in costs, such as logs
and freight. As we look forward into 2012, we continue the ongoing improvement efforts in every single one of our
businesses. As I noted, we are focused on improving revenues where we have the opportunities to obtain higher prices
for certain products. We are adding new customers. Our efforts in terms of cost reduction touch every single one of our
operating businesses, lumber, oriented strand board, Engineered Wood Products, and distribution. And at this point,
given our outlook for housing at the level that we are projecting today, we have an expectation that for the full year we
would be EBITDA positive, cash neutral.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We continue to – as I noted in my remarks, use all levers that we have. I am encouraged by
the improvement and our focus continues to be to improve profitability at today's level of starts, and then be able to
take advantage of the upside levers that comes with an improving market.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Thank you. That's helpful. And then just a question on capital expenditures, I think on the
last call you had guided to about a $100 million in the quarter which would have brought you kind of closer to that
$250 million to $270 million range that you had earlier guided to. And I guess you ended up a little short of that. And I
was just wondering if you could give us any color on any projects or investments that may be you've slowed back or
pushed back a little?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It's fundamentally timing difference, Antony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Yeah.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We haven't changed the scope of the products or the projects. As we move into 2012, our
CapEx continues to include reforestation expense, rework in the woods in order to open up lands for harvest, and the
most significant capital expenditures continue to be in our Cellulose Fibers business, where we focus our improvements
on projects that reduce costs that have the added benefit in many cases of improving volume and continue to move us
forward towards maintenance schedule in our Cellulose Fibers facilities where we will be stretching out our – what has
been our annual maintenance over the next two to three years to an 18 month schedule.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Yes, and good morning all.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Good morning Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: First question is – hey there – is on, if you could just give us a roadmap to think about pulp – or
I am sorry – for the Cellulose business this year. Especially given the downtime, I know, you normally, I believe have
that heaviest in the second and the third is sort of when you let it rip, so to speak. And should we see a similar pattern
this year? And, I guess, if you look at last year, the profit sequentially in the first were off about 38% without the prices
falling. So I would guess you're expecting it to be a deeper drop in the first quarter this year even though we're seeing

signs of it turning up later, could you – if you could comment on that as well, I'd appreciate it.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Chip. If you compare the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2011, the
mills that are be taking their annual outages will be similar, but the length of the outages is going to be somewhat
extended, both to allow for some completion of some capital projects, but also positioning those mills for an 18-month
frequency between the plant to shut down. Now the benefit of that increased frequency will actually start to accrue in
2013. But we're setting those mills up to be in a position to do that, as we take their annual maintenance shutdowns this
year. So we'll have a little bit longer outages, and do a little more maintenance work to prepare for that in addition to
the capital projects. So, I would estimate that the actual maintenance spend for the quarter will be about $25 million to
$30 million. Then if you factor in the lost productivity and the additional cost for chemicals, energy, and fuel, I'd
expect that the total dollar impact of the outages would be on the order of $45 million to $50 million.
And then as you referenced, the other major difference quarter-over-quarter in the results will be lower pulp
realizations, which is also likely to be around $45 million coupled with the realizations and also a little slightly lower
volumes. And then we will have some seasonally higher input cost as well. So I think that will help you dimension the
change from the fourth quarter to the first. And in terms of our maintenance schedule for 2012, we had completed all of
the maintenance in 2011 by the end of the second quarter, and I think our schedule actually calls for a little bit of
maintenance also coming in, in the second half as those mills just change a little bit. But for the first quarter, they are
very similar to last year in terms of the operations themselves.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you. And a quick follow up Patty, on the – you gave a great rundown on the pension
funding situation. Could you let us know how the expense change will be at least from a GAAP book basis from 2011
to 2012?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. Chip, I think just to reiterate, maybe if you could look at the cash flow statement that
we have in the analyst package.
So on page three, we break out in the cash flow from operations, on two separate line items, the impact of cash
contributions, as well as the non-cash charge that goes through the income statement for pension and other
post-retirement benefit. So let me just start with the cash impact to reiterate that. So I'm looking at the line item which
is two lines up from net cash from operations, and it's titled pension and post-retirement contributions.
So you see that we had $143 million that we contributed in 2011. We would expect that those contributions for the
plans that I mentioned in my remarks would be similar in 2012 or about $140 million.
Now that doesn't include the U.S. qualified pension plan, which did not have a contribution due in 2011. Based on the
funded status at the end of this year, we would estimate that the cash contribution would be about $60 million, and we
would not need to make that contribution until September of 2013. We certainly have the discretion to make it earlier if
we want, but it's not due until September of 2013.
Now let me address your other question, which is the difference in the book expense on a GAAP basis. So if you go a
little further up the page from where we were before, you will see a line item called pension and other post-retirement
benefits under the non-cash charges to income.
So in 2011, for the full year that number was $81 million. The comparable number for 2012 is about $115 million.
Offsetting the $115 million, though, we will have amortization of the changes that we made in at some of our
post-retirement benefit plans at the end of the year.
So we made some amendments to those changes or to those plans, and we will be amortizing those in 2012. And that
will just about offset that $115 million. In fact, I think it's a little more than a $115 million, but they just about offset
each other.
We will call those out as special items in 2012, but that's the way that the expense will flow through the income
statement.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Gail.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Just on pulp realizations for a moment, Patty – and this is very helpful guidance. I am just
wondering what you are expecting to recognize in the first quarter. Do you think that would represent a trough? Or
would you expect kind of further erosion as contracts recognized pricing that's already been published?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, you know, as – prices came down through the fourth quarter and certainly softened
into the first quarter. But we would expect that they are pretty much at a bottom at this point and wouldn't expect
further erosion coming out of the quarter.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And would you be seeing any signs that [ph] the margins could cover (36:50) over
the next quarter or two? Or do you think it could stay at this level for a while?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: That's really hard to speculate. We usually just limit the guidance to the first quarter in
terms of the outlook. But I think we have, as I said, are starting to see some stabilization in that full price.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And then, can you give a little bit of color – that pick-up that you're seeing in
housing activity so far this year, is that – any differences across the regions in which you operate, or is it pretty
broad-based?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Could you ask that one more time? I've got a little bit of a bad connection.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Sorry. The improvement you are seeing in your home building business so far this year –
any differences on what you're seeing in trend across the various regions, or is it pretty universal?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, it does vary by region. And as I noted in my comments, it's a little bit difficult to
extrapolate from five weeks. However, I've made the point a number of years in the past that we normally don't see a
pickup in housing until after the Super Bowl. So it's actually encouraging that we've got some increase in activity
during January.
We're seeing more strength in the Phoenix market, in the Pacific Northwest. Texas continues to be very strong. We've
seen a little bit of softening in the Washington D.C. area, which was stronger during 2011. And in Las Vegas, we're
still relatively challenged. We're seeing a bit of pickup in all of Southern California, with the exception of L.A. County.
So it's a bit mixed, but for the first five weeks, overall, we're encouraged. That mix will translate to differences in
margins as we go forward. So last year, we did have increased sales in all of our markets, with the exception of Nevada
and California. And California especially is our strong margin market. And so that's some of the mix change that Patty
is talking about, as she provides an outlook for the first quarter.
So we're encouraged, and we'll track it through the balance of the quarter and look forward to, in the next call, being
able to update you.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Just one last, super-quick question. Patty, can you give a little guidance on the tax
rate in the first quarter and for 2012?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. I think the way to think about the tax rate, Gail, is really it's not only just the rate, but
it's also the mix of income between the REIT and the TRS.

So as you think about our Timberlands business, most of that income is at the REIT, so no tax would be applied to that.
And then for the TRS, the income, which also would include not only the TRS businesses but also the interest expense,
you would think about a tax rate of around 35%.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Yeah. Patty, can you talk – just following up on [ph] that (40:26) tax rate question, can
you give us a little color on the tax rate in the fourth quarter?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. As you think about the rate itself, there's a couple of things impacting that fourth
quarter.
So one, of course, is the mix of income that I just mentioned. We actually also had a special item that we exclude as we
talk about our results. So for the full quarter, quarter four, we actually had a tax benefit of about $10 million, and most
of that was a result of the special item of $19 million. Tax affected would be around $7 million or $8 million. So most
of that is the result of that additional benefit, that when we talk about our earnings, we exclude as a special item.
Then if you think about the mix of income, as I talked about before for the quarter, and this doesn't work exactly
perfectly, but if you looked at chart one, for example, you'll see that our pre-tax earnings before special items was about
$160 million. And subtract from that the Timberlands earnings of $70 million. And also subtract from it the interest
expense of $88 million. And you get just about a push for the quarter.
And then also as the fourth quarter, you have a little bit of true-up – not much – running through the quarter. So
basically we ended up with a small benefit of about $3 million from continuing operations.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. That's very helpful. Dan, second question just in Wood Products, is there – are
there particular segments of the Wood Products business that you would regard as sort of the biggest challenges for you
in getting to the cash breakeven? Or is it really just kind of a question of better volume across the whole system?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The markets to which our products flow has some impact on this, Mark. So longer we have
the broadest set of markets, it certainly flows into new home construction, but it's also – runs to the repair and remodel
market. So we are less dependent on single-family new home construction.
Our oriented strand board product is used in new home construction, but also some portion of that runs through the
repair and remodel market. And then, when you move to Engineered Wood Products, that has a lot heavier
concentration in new home construction.
And so our challenges for Engineered Wood Products, which also – I would couple that with our distribution business,
because there is a good portion of our engineered material that flows through our distribution business – is reliant on a
recovery in new home construction.
And so if you look at our utilization rates across our facilities, they are the lowest in engineered. They are higher in
OSB, and then they're the highest in lumber. Lumber also has the benefit of being able to flow to offshore markets, and
there is a portion of our Canadian lumber that goes to Japan and recently China. So we will be recovering more quickly
in lumber. OSB would follow on, and then I would say our Engineered Wood Products and our distribution.
In our distribution business, we picked up distribution of some third-party specialty products. They bring in some
additional margin contribution. And so, we're pleased with our progress there.

I would say, overall, once again, our goal is to get to cash breakeven with the level of starts that we have, but we have a
tremendous amount of operating leverage, as the market starts to recover. And this business in a recovering housing
market, will have the benefit of increased cash flow, and then ultimately earnings.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay. I think it actually would be helpful in May, when you are out here, if we could get
a little more color on sort of what the footprint looks like in distribution now, because I know you've made some
changes over the last several years.
Last question I had, just on the housing market. You mentioned California being the strongest margin area for you,
typically. Can you give us some sense of how much of that is a question of just sort of the types of homes you're
building, the size of homes? And how much of that might just be from the – well, maybe a low-cost land base in
California.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It is both, Mark. So California is a big state, and so we have to look at submarkets within
California.
Our strongest position historically with respect to earnings and margin is San Diego. In San Diego, we are now the
largest builder. And so we build a higher-end house that has a lot higher price point. And the margins in those homes
are much higher, in part because of the product that we're building, the neighborhoods in which we're building, and to
some extent, our land basis.
The lower margin portion of the market would be the Inland Empire, with LA County being about in the middle.
So there is a significant impact on our margins overall if San Diego was strong. And San Diego was stronger in 2010 as
compared to 2011. Now, in the first five weeks, we're seeing sales up in San Diego. That's a real positive. And we've
got a strong land position from which to build in San Diego.
The other high margin market for us historically has been the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington D.C. It's
also a higher-price-point product. And the margins there are fundamentally related to the homes that we're building and
the price point, rather than a low land basis.
<Q - Mark William Wilde>: Okay, all right. That's very helpful. Thanks, Dan.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning. I just want to continue on WRECO, Dan as you think
about, are there any regions where even if you do like your land bases around the country, where you are perhaps,
maybe less advantaged or had less ability to flex, if in fact the market recovers more than you expect?
And a related question, if I look back at the fourth quarter, your ratio of closings relative your backlog coming into the
quarter is a little bit higher than it normally would be. It's usually 90%, but a little bit higher than that. Does that have
any impact on your ability to grow with the market, at least early on in 2012?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Let me first address the question of our land position. As we've talked about this in the past,
we have a relatively long land position as compared to many other public builders. And in large part, it's related to our
value proposition in the markets in which we operate. So we generally would have a longer land position in a market
that is more challenging for entitlements processing.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Sure.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: And then we have a lighter land position in markets where it's relatively easy to process land
or to acquire land.

So the extremes for us would be San Diego County, where it may take a decade to get property entitled. And one – the
benefit of that is that that becomes very valuable property. And it's important to have access to land in markets like that,
in order to be an effective profitable builder.
And the other extreme would be Houston, Texas. Houston has no zoning. There is a vibrant land development
community there. And historically, we're able to acquire many of our lots on a rolling-option basis. And so we don't
need a long land position in Houston. And then the other markets falls somewhere in between.
In terms of our ability to flex, one of our challenges over the last couple of years has been to redeploy some of our land
capital to markets where we may be a little bit land-light. We made a conscious decision in Phoenix to sell land that we
had impaired earlier in the recession because we were confident that we can obtain the land from others as the market
recovered, and that has been the case so far.
If we had a very strong recovery in the Pacific Northwest, we might find ourselves a bit challenged to flex as much as
some other markets, but we're comfortable with our land position as we look out the next three to five years in our
markets and we do have the ability to flex up in response to increased demand. But it varies by market.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. I guess next question I had switching to Wood, realizing that hopefully this year,
operating leverage will be one of the factors that contributes to your ability to get to cash breakeven. What additional
cost benefit do you have, if you will, incrementally already banked for 2012 versus 2011? Or have you realized more or
less, what cost benefits you had been working on in 2010 and 2011 within the segment? And what capacity if – we're
surprised again to the upside. What capacity, what in percentage terms could you restart, say within a couple of quarters
within lumber, within OSB to meet the market?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We've been engaged in a broad process for over a year to improve performance in this
business. And as I've discussed it, it includes revenue improvement as well as cost reduction. Some of the cost
reduction will come from reduced operating cost and input costs. Some would come from increased productivity. We
captured some of those improvements in 2011. We have more to come in 2012. And so, I can't give you a number as to
what we would have "in the bank" for 2012, but we are making good progress. We should expect to see more
improvement in 2012.
As I look at our operating rates, we operated in the fourth quarter our lumber system at about 75%, OSB was running at
72% and our Engineered Wood Products were around 30%. So, we have much more room to flex up in our engineered
business as the housing market recovers. But, we've got plenty of capacity in Lumber and OSB and we're looking
forward to the opportunity to test the margins when we're fully utilizing all of our facilities.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: All right, Dan thanks. I'll turn it over.

Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Great. Thank you and good morning. First of all, could you remind us the percentage of your
wood that you sell into your facilities, and conversely how much outside wood your mills are buying?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Is this – this is a question, Steve, around Wood Products or...?
<Q - Steve Chercover>: No, your Timberlands obviously sell to China and to third parties, and I want to get a sense of
how much they are selling to Weyerhaeuser facilities and then are Weyerhaeuser facilities 30% be holding on your own
Timberlands and buying 70% from third parties or – I want to get the ratios, please.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: In each of our businesses, we participate in the outside market, both Timberlands and in our
Wood Products facilities as well as Cellulose Fibers. If we think about the Western Timberlands and these are rough
numbers, Steve, about a third of our logs would go to the export market, a third would go to domestic third parties, and
about a third would go our own mills. In the South – and those numbers will move up and down on a year-over-year

basis. In the South, much higher percentage of our logs historically have flowed to our own facilities. But, as I noted in
my remarks this morning, we are consciously increasing our sales to third parties from our Southern Timberlands. Last
year, that number exceeded 28% and that's been a good market for us. We're getting good prices and we are building
relationships with third party customers that we will able to continue to serve in 2012.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Terrific. And the other quick question also focused on the Timberlands is, we've seen a few
small deals recently at very good prices, where the buyer approach the vendor. Are you open to hit the bid, if good
offers materialize, or would you rather grow your asset base?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are in the market all the time as a prospective buyer. And at the right time and the right
place, in the right circumstances, we could be a seller. But generally we're – and we have routine dispositions of
non-strategic land that in some cases are part of 1031 transactions or HBU land. In general, our strategic intent is to
grow our Timberlands position. But, we are engaged in the market and have exposure to both buyers and sellers.
<Q - Steve Chercover>: Sure. Do you have 1031s that have to be crystallized in the near future?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We always have some in process. And so, I can't talk about specifics. We match up the
buy/sell opportunities.

Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks, two quick questions. First, Patty, working capital was a very big negative swing in
Q4 which took free cash flow a lot lower than I thought. Can you give us a sense of what seasonal pattern we should be
expecting and if there was anything funny in this quarter? And then a quick question for Dan. You talked about the
ability to sell land. Would you consider buying a land short builder at this point or do you still want to keep your
exposure to homebuilding where it is?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Patty, you want to address your question?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. On the working capital, you had a couple of things in the fourth quarter. So,
typically, our working capital in Wood Products would come down a little bit in terms of reduced receivables in the
quarter. We did have some inventory build in the fourth quarter to take advantage of some markets that – new markets
in terms of customers that we are building in the Wood Products business. The other swing that you had in working
capital was in our Cellulose Fibers business, where we had more volume that we sold into the fourth quarter. And so, I
believe our receivables went up those would certainly flex with the volume that we said would be a little bit lower and
little bit lower prices as well in the first quarter compared to the fourth.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: To your second question, Mark, our focus in the homebuilding business is to grow
organically. We like the markets that we're in. We've got strong regional local brands that you are familiar with and our
focus in growing that business will be to flex up with the operations that we have and improve our selling activity and
our production in those operations. As you know, today's volume is about a third of what it was at the peak. So, we
have great operations that have the capacity to build more as the market begins to recover. If there is a land light
builder out there that need lots, they ought to be talking to us because we'll be happy to sell lots assuming we could do
so profitably. So, it's part of our ongoing business and it's important for us to have a balance between our land sales and
our homebuilding operations.

Your next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Market.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Hey, thanks very much, good morning, and thanks for taking the call. Just a question on the
plan for 2012 on the outlook at 665,000 starts. That's split between single at 455,000, so just 68% single-family, 32%
multi, which is quite a big change from what we saw back in 2005 and 2006 and would suggest that future OSB and
lumber consumption would be down 10% from that time point. I guess, it's more of a question on the future. Do you
see this sort of new sort of mix ratio staying at this level going forward and what do you – what is your information on
in terms of house size and log and OSB consumption?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: During the recession, we've seen some reduction in average square footage in single-family
homes, Paul, maybe 10%. There has been a swing to multifamily during this timeframe. Multifamily market right now
is really record low vacancy rates in many markets. And a lot of that I attribute to buyer uncertainty more than a shift
long-term in choice of multi versus single-family. So, it's a little bit too early to tell. As I talked about the numbers for
2011, single-family dropped, multifamily starts were actually up. We have the ability to sell all of our Wood Products
into the multifamily market. Multifamily units generally have a floor square footage on average roughly 50% of
single-family. The amount of utilization of products varies.
In multifamily units, our data which show that if you look at lumber, lumber utilization in the multifamily unit as
compared to single-family maybe about a third of what a single would be, OSB about the same ratio. When you move
into Engineered Wood Products, our numbers indicated about 60% on average usage per unit. So, our strength in
Engineered Wood Products will help in serving any multifamily needs and I think it's going to take some time through
this recovery to see how the ratios between singles and multis actually settle out. I think what we are seeing now is
multis being stronger, lot of buyers on the side lines. My personal view is that as people start to reenter the
single-family market, you will see vacancies rise in multifamily and people will take advantage of record low interest
rates and low prices for single-family and that will be what disburse the recovery in single-family overall.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Thanks very much for your interest and on the EWP consumption.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thanks, Paul. Next question?

Your next question comes from Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions. First, you mentioned in your remarks that you
had higher Japan volumes in the first quarter. Do you think that's a sign of a larger trend with reconstructions starting to
happen more in Japan now or is that just something that's seasonal for Japan?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: It's not clear yet, Josh. Our volumes to Japan during 2011 were about equal to what they were
in 2010. And that is in light of the disruption that we experienced, the country experienced during the earthquake and
tsunami. So, we've seen a pickup in demand from our customers and so as Patty talked about the outlook for first
quarter that incorporates the increase in demand we are seeing. It appears that that is primarily growth of our customers
and perhaps their share rather than the rebuilding efforts following the earthquake. The areas that were most severely
impacted, I think are going to take some time to recover because they have very significant infrastructure needs that
need to be addressed. I can't add any more color than that.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. One other sort of housekeeping item. Your deferred income taxes on the balance
sheet seem to have dropped fairly sharply this quarter. Was there anything that was due to or is that just some one time
funny tax fluctuations?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It's really the booking of the additional liability for pension. So, pension is the biggest
reason for why deferred taxes moved around.

We do have time for one more question. Your last question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Thank you. A couple of quick clarifications. I apologize you may have said this to Chip's
question before, but the pension expense on a book basis, what's it going to be this year versus last year?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So we said that, this is pension and other postretirement benefits both. So, they both go
into the same footnote. There are about a little over $80 million in 2011, in 2012 we would anticipate that that will be
around $115 million.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: But there will be an amortization of a special item that will offset that $115 million for
changes in the retirement benefit plan. So, what I said to Chip was that we'll call that out as a special item so it was
clear, but that's the change year over year.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And is that going to primarily show up on the corporate line or at the segments and
maybe an easier way to answer, corporate in 2011 was roughly $100 million, is that a decent number to use for 2012 or
should we be adding the $35 million increase in pension expense?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, we charge to the segments themselves sort of normal service cost. And on page four
of the analyst package, we actually give you that breakout of what gets allocated to the business segments versus what
stays at corporate. I would expect that the amount that gets allocated to the segments next year will increase a little bit
as service cost increases, but the bulk of it would stay in the corporate segment.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And so corporate expense overall, would you expect that to go up a little bit 2012
versus 2011?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: It will be a little bit up for that item. The corporate segment does move around from
quarter-to-quarter. In addition to these expenses, the other things that account for swings quarter-to-quarter or what
happens to share-based comp as well as foreign currency exchange fluctuation.
So it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but sort of as a rule of thumb, I would think about $15 million to $20
million a quarter.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. And then lastly, on the performance fibers, I was a little bit surprised, the magnitude
of the impact you're expecting from pricing, given that you ship roughly 450,000 tons. At the same time, I was a little
surprised by how resilient pricing for you had been in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering, is that a function of the
way your contracts are set up? Are they either quarterly? Do you have a fair bit of annual contracts? How does pricing
typically flow through into that business?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Mark, could you – we didn't hear all of the start of your question, I apologize. Could you
just rephrase it a little bit so we can get a better feel for what you are asking?
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Sure.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: I think your question was about mix in the fourth quarter, or was about pricing in the
fourth quarter that was a little stronger than what you would have expected?
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: And then also the magnitude, I think you said about a $45 million impact 1Q versus 4Q,
which you should go back...

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, that – yeah, the $45 million is about – is a combination of both pulp realizations and
slightly lower volume quarter-over-quarter. And in the fourth quarter, you had a little bit higher mix of specialty
volume that went to the quarter as well.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: I see.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So there is a little bit of mix in the fourth quarter and then there is a little less volume in
the first quarter compared to the fourth.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Very good. And so there is not much impact from the way your contracts are set up. Do you
have much in the way of annual contracts in particular? In the pulp business?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: [ph] Those contracts generally run (1:08:12) longer than annually – for a longer period of
time. And they have some adjustments that are built in. But for our long-term customers, we have mutual commitments
to keep them supplied and that's really one of the great strengths of our businesses that is the great longer-term
customers that we have that are growing around the globe and that provides a lot of strength for us in this business.
<Q - Mark Weintraub>: Okay. Thank you.
