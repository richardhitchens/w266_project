And with that, I'm pleased to turn it over to Lachlan.
Lachlan Keith Murdoch
Thanks, Reed. Good afternoon and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. After my remarks, I'll turn
the call over to John and James, and then, we'll take your questions.
Despite some near-term challenges, most specifically due to foreign exchange and disappointing results at our Film
division, we are making good progress on our objectives across the group. The core growth strategies that will move
our business forward over the long term, building powerful brands that offer great value to our customers, delivering
great story-telling, must-have news and sports and innovating in advertising and packaging are delivering real results
for the business.
Domestic affiliate revenues increased strongly in the quarter. This predictable revenue underpins our financial position
even in an environment with an increasing number of viewing options, our affiliate revenues continue to grow. This
underscores the strong demand for and the value of our brands.
Developing these brands has been a key strategic priority for us. We believe the work we have done and the
investments we have made render our portfolio indispensable for any broad consumer offering, whether established or
emerging. The expansion of our National Geographic partnership is an important milestone in the execution of this
strategy.
Our overall domestic multi-channel subscribers continue to grow, increasing, in aggregate, by 1% over the prior-year
quarter. This despite the fact that the average fully distributed channel in the MVPD universe lost around 2% of their
subscribers over the same period. And we are seeing strong momentum in high-growth international markets, like at
STAR in India, where we continue to expand our customer base and our offerings.
While foreign currency headwinds are creating short-term issues, they reflect the size and scale of our international
businesses, which are increasingly well-positioned. The strength of our global brands is, of course, a direct result of our
success in creating unique and compelling creative content. Our distinction in this area was recognized last month with
eight Golden Globe awards across our film and television businesses, more than any of our peers. 20th Century Fox
film not only led the industry with Golden Globe wins, but currently dominates the competition for this year's Academy
Awards with a total of 30 nominations, double our nearest competitor.
But success in the content production business can be tough to deliver consistently, and this year we have seen mixed
results at our film studio. Financial results from The Martian were strong, but they were more than offset by
less-than-anticipated results from several of our other releases. While our Film business is running behind our financial
expectations, we feel good about our releases moving forward. The Revenant and Kung Fu Panda 3 are currently
performing well. Deadpool and Eddie the Eagle are slated for later this quarter, and X-Men: Apocalypse and ID4:
Resurgence for the fourth quarter.
At our television production business, there is also good momentum. We are producing 36 scripted series this broadcast
season, including 20 returning and 16 new series. Many of the new shows are supporting the turnaround at the Fox
Network, including The X-Files, which drew an audience of over 21 million people, surpassing the original series
most-watched season ever. Globally, The X-Files reached an impressive audience of more than 50 million viewers
across our international network of Fox-owned channels.
Developing and producing our own shows, which, in turn, drive enhanced ratings on our own platforms is a priority for
us. Just this last week, one of our productions, The People v. O.J. Simpson, premiered to the highest ratings ever on
FX. That is in all the key demos and in total people.
What I've just described is at the core of our long-term value that we drive for shareholders, namely, our ability to
create, own and monetize hit content that powers our global brands. Overall, we are pleased with the momentum at the

majority of our businesses. Our focus on building powerful brands, creating compelling content for consumers, and
driving advertising innovation continues to create meaningful long-term value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to John.
John P. Nallen
Thanks, Lachlan, and good afternoon, everyone.
To start out, I'll remind you that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky in November of 2014, our
comparative reported financial results for the second quarter are not like-to-like. So as we've done in the past, we're
providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in the prior
period, and most of my comments that follow will be on this adjusted basis.
In the second quarter, adjusted revenues of $7.4 billion declined slightly from the year-ago quarter as higher revenues
at both our Cable Network and Television segments were offset by lower revenues at our Film business. Note that
adverse foreign currency movements combined with the absence of Shine negatively impacted quarterly revenue
comparisons by approximately $340 million in the aggregate. Absent these factors, our second quarter adjusted
revenues would have increased 4% over the prior year.
Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.73 billion, a 2% increase over a year ago. This increase
was led by the Cable Network segment and was partially offset by slightly lower results at our Television and Film
segments. Overall, this quarter's EBITDA results included an approximate $110 million negative impact from
unfavorable foreign currency movements, which reduced our comparative reported results in both our Cable Networks
and Film segments. Absent this impact, our overall quarterly EBITDA growth rate would be 8.5%.
From a bottom line perspective, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $674
million or $0.34 per share. Excluding the net income effects in both years of Other, net and equity earnings adjustments
primarily related to Sky's acquisitions and dispositions, second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.44 this year versus a
comparable $0.53 a year ago, but as a reminder, last year's net income included the recognition of certain non-recurring
tax benefits of approximately $250 million, or $0.12 per share.
So now let me provide some additional context on the performance at our operating segments in the second quarter, and
we'll start with the Cable Network segment, where total segment EBITDA of $1.25 billion was up 8% on segment
revenue growth of 9%. Domestic revenues increased 11% in total, led by affiliate fee growth of 10% and advertising
increases of 3%. Fox News and our domestic sports channels led the advertising growth, posting double-digit
percentage increases. But this was partially offset by lower revenues at FX due to reduced ratings against a year-ago
comp that included the final season of Sons of Anarchy.
EBITDA at our domestic channels increased 7% over the prior year, reflecting the strong revenue growth, partially
offset by higher regional and national sports rights costs. Also note that the inclusion of the National Geographic
Partners businesses that were acquired in November added approximately $70 million to quarterly other revenues and
about the same to expenses. So those acquired businesses were not significant to second quarter EBITDA.
Second quarter reported international cable revenues grew 6%, driven by a 15% increase in advertising revenues, with
strong growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels. Reported international affiliate revenues were
essentially flat against the prior year, as low double-digit organic growth, led by FIC, was offset by negative foreign
currency movements. Reported international channel EBITDA contributions increased 8% over the prior-year period
from strong local currency growth at both STAR and the Fox International Channels, which was partially offset by an
approximate $60 million negative impact from foreign exchange.
Turning to our Television segment, second quarter EBITDA was $279 million, $11 million lower than a year ago.
Revenues increased 6% overall, led by low double-digit ad revenue growth at the Fox Network and higher
retransmission consent revenues. This overall revenue increase was achieved despite the cyclically lower political

advertising revenues at the stations due to last year's midterm elections and two fewer World Series games this year
versus last. The revenue gain was offset by increased programming expenses, principally from contractual step-ups in
our NFL and MLB rights.
At the Film segment, second quarter EBITDA was $302 million, down $34 million versus last year. This quarter's
higher contributions from the film studio, owing largely to the successful theatrical release of The Martian, were more
than offset by lower TV production contributions. And those reduced contributions were from the substantial increase
in the number of new first-year series delivered and their related initial deficits as well as lower contributions from
Sons of Anarchy, which aired its final season last year.
Additionally, foreign exchange movements negatively impacted this quarter's segment EBITDA by approximately $50
million. Revenues decreased 14%, primarily reflecting both difficult home entertainment comparisons to last year's
very successful releases, including X-Men: Days of Future Past and Dawn of Planet of the Apes, as well as the absence
of revenues from Shine.
Shifting over to capital management, from July 1 through today we've repurchased approximately $3.5 billion worth of
Fox A shares, of which approximately $3 billion has been against our buyback authorization of $5 billion. During the
second quarter, we also completed our planned investments in National Geographic Partners and the Maa TV channels
at STAR. In addition, in the quarter we issued $1 billion of new debt, repaid $200 million in maturities, and we have
approximately $500 million of future maturities over the next year.
At this halfway point in our fiscal year, there are a couple of obvious headwinds that will impact our full-year
performance outlook. First, we continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign currency rate comparisons in our
sizable international cable and film operations. While the local currency performance at these businesses is strong, the
converted U.S. dollar amounts continue to be affected by the strengthened dollar.
Just for perspective, last August, when we gave full-year guidance for fiscal 2016 earnings, we estimated that currency
changes would negatively impact our growth rate by three percentage points or approximately $200 million based on
exchange rates at that time. So far in fiscal 2016, currency rate movements have already adversely impacted the
six-month EBITDA results by approximately $220 million. And based on where exchange rates are today, the full-year
impact from currency movements will be approximately $350 million, or nearly a six percentage point impact on our
EBITDA growth.
Additionally, it's clear that our content production businesses have underperformed our original plans largely from the
theatrical releases of most of our films so far despite the success of The Martian. So based on these principal factors
and all of the assumptions inherent in our current outlook, we now expect that our total segment EBITDA percentage
growth rate for fiscal 2016 will be in the range of flat to up low-single-digits, above the $6.49 billion we reported for
fiscal 2015.
With that, let me turn it over to James.
James Rupert Murdoch
Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone.
As Lachlan said earlier, we're confident that the business is really on track to support our long-term objectives.
However, too many factors, continued currency movement against us and disappointing commercial results in the Film
business are simply too significant for us to offset over the next six months to hit our original near-term target. But if
our only goal was to hit short-term targets, we'd pursue efforts like cutting programming costs at the expense of
building future profits. That's not our approach. We think shareholder value is better built through long-term
investment and growth.
Our near-term outlook should not detract from the fact that in the first half of the year, we've accomplished much. We
renegotiated or negotiated multi-year agreements with two of our largest U.S. distributors, successfully achieving

pricing and revenue goals as well as providing for better products for customers. FBC had its highest rated autumn in
four years, and Fox News is ranked number one across all cable channels. We completed the National Geographic
Partners transaction and the acquisition of the broadcast business of Maa TV in India. We reorganized our International
Channels business, as well as made significant strides in cost management across the company as we reshaped the
company to best compete in the future.
And as we start our second half, we're delivering outstanding new content across our markets, including the X-Files,
Lucifer, American Idol, and Grease Live at FBC, to name a few. The People v. O.J. Simpson, American Crime Story,
and Baskets at FX, a new season of Kabaddi at STAR, and a strong post-season at the NFL, capping the second
most-watched NFL season on Fox ever. At FBC, we're encouraged by the clear turnaround underway. Broadcast season
to-date primetime ratings have stabilized and overall ad revenues for the network were up in the quarter.
While linear ratings at Fox show much improvement, the more meaningful measure of video consumption is 30-day
multi-platform viewing, which is up mid-single-digits season to date. Whether the show is being watched on a linear
broadcast or on a time-shifted basis, all viewers are alive, so all live viewers need to be measured. And in order to
better monetize that viewing, we've been focused on innovation with new ad products and packaging options that are
showing clear results. There's a sizable opportunity to monetize this audience and it's one that we're determined to
seize.
That said, the bulk of our broadcast revenue today is from linear advertising, and then, the quarter performance was
strong. National scatter is up at 20% premiums versus upfronts and local station markets were up 3% to 4% in the
second quarter, excluding political spending. Lachlan commented earlier on our production businesses; and while
we've fallen behind our earlier expectations, we continue to invest in developing and producing the creative assets that
will drive the business in the future.
At our non-consolidated businesses, we're making good progress, too. In fact, Sky recently reported first half fiscal
2016 earnings with 10% earnings per share growth driven by the addition of 337,000 new customers in the December
quarter. And Hulu also continues to grow, deepening its content offering and adding customers. Hulu is an important
platform for us to roll out our targeted and interactive ad capabilities and new ad-free packaging for customers;
initiatives that are off to a great start.
So while the team has much work to do, the progress we've made in the quarter against our long-term goals has been
good. And we think the key fundamental to our long-term success are in place. Investments in our brands are reaping
rewards; our international portfolio continues to flourish, particularly at STAR in India; our sports and news audiences
are expanding; our U.S. broadcast business is stabilizing; and we're implementing solutions to improve monetization.
And while short-term film performance is obviously a disappointment, the business is fundamentally sound, and at 20th
Century Fox Television, the strength of several new series will add considerable value for years to come.
As I said at the outset, shareholder value is built through long-term investment in growth. And we, in this exciting time
for our company and industry, are confident we have the right assets and strategies in place to achieve that goal.
So with that, we're very happy to take your questions.

<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks. So I just wanted to follow up on James' comment on Hulu. All the partners
have been – while the investors have been ramping up – you've been ramping up investment in new programming. It's
obviously an important asset, but I'm just – can you comment on how effective you think these recent investments have
been in terms of establishing the brand and the subscriber base?
Most of the industry has been very supportive of holding back SVOD rights and accumulating greater stacking rights
for pay-TV providers. Can you talk a little bit about how you, as a company, are viewing the risks and opportunities
Hulu faces in this current environment?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Jessica. Sure, happy to talk about that. Look, I think, as I said, Hulu is
important asset for us, and it's one that we're exciting to see the growth, and I think all the partners would say that. And
we're excited to see the real innovation that's happening at Hulu in terms of creating new options for customers both
with respect of ad innovation, new ways to monetize inventory there, as well as these ad-free options The ad-free tier
that actually is going well. I think Hulu's going to continue to develop. And I think we're very focused – and Hulu's
very focused on how to continue to innovate in terms of products and packaging to expand its offerings and grow into
larger segments.
So I think as a distributor of our program, and we think Hulu's very important and we think it's a good distributor of our
programming. And we're really happy to push it forward. But that said, we're also very focused on distributing our
products and our programs through our other clients and other distributors, the MVPDs and others.
And with respect to stacking rights, with respect to all of the sort of – this construct of the SVOD windows, we were
very, very focused on first and foremost creating a customer experience around our product that's very, very good;
creating an ease of discoverability, if you will, so they can find the product and get it at the right time. We are
interested in having fewer holdbacks outside the SVOD windows so that we can actually provide a better product for
customers, and provide our MVPD and over-the-top distributors with a better ability to deliver a good product
experience.
So I don't think those two things are incompatible at all. And I think we have to see our distributors, be it an online
distributor like Hulu, or a traditional facilities-based distributor like a cable company, I think actually from a customer's
perspective, the package of those products just needs to be great. They need to be able to discover the programs in the
right way. But we also need to be, as a supplier, able to take our brands to those platforms and have more flexibility
with respect to how their product is found, how it's stacked, how it's consumed.
More flexibility with respect to how advertising innovation works and what we can do as well, I think, an
understanding of data capabilities to understand who's using our products, particularly, as the streaming element or the
time-shifted element grows at such a big clip, because that's a really important part. So I don't think those two things
are mutually exclusive in any way. And we're really excited that Hulu's able to really set the pace in terms of
innovation in a lot of these areas.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Right. Can I just do a quick follow-up just a second? In the trades, I don't know if you
announced anything, but the cost-saving activity at both studios, film and the television/cable networks, can you talk
about how impactful that will be and when? Is that a fiscal 2017 event?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think first of all, cost management is something that happens in a business on a
continuous basis. So while that was a public event with some changes that we're making at the Networks group and at
the studios in the company there, we focus on cost across the business all the time. We haven't really quantified overall
how that works, but I think it's more a 2017 and 2018 and going forward to really make the business the right shape.
One number that's been out there is $250 million of savings around this particular program, but these are programs that
are going to be ongoing.
<A - Lachlan Keith Murdoch>: And, Jessica, they run across all the businesses, not just the studios.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Okay, thank you.

<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thank you, Jessica. Ryan, could we have the next question, please?
Operator
It comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the new guidance. Clearly, with
what's going on in the market and in the macro environment, there are some worries about a recession. And you guys
have a big global business that sees that in terms of your advertising business, so I guess I just wonder. To what extent
is any macro uncertainty embedded in the new guidance, or would any uncertainty there be incremental or an added
risk to the new guidance, John, that you provided?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Anthony, it would have to be pretty significant to dramatically impact it because there are really
just six months left in this period of time. We've got good visibility around affiliate fees. The advertising market feels
pretty good. And internationally, businesses are operating pretty well also. So I don't think there's a dramatic issue
outstanding on a macroeconomic basis. I think we put into it what we know today. We don't know beyond what we
know today, so that's what's reflected in our outlook.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up, maybe this is for James on your
relationships with the MVPDs. You guys put up double-digit affiliate fee growth and that's quite strong, but we
continue to get questions from investors about cord-cutting, about the pace of the subscribers in your business. And
there continues to be speculation about these minimum subscriber limits. Do you think some of the MVPDs are running
up against their contractual minimums on the subscriber limits? And if so, how should we interpret that? Would that
slow subscriber losses, slow cord-cutting that might be driven by these skinny bundles either for the industry and/or for
Fox? Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Anthony. Look, I think on our relationship with our distributors or the
MVPDs, some of our distributors, I would say, actually, first of all, they're pretty good. As I mentioned in my
comments, we've renewed two important large affiliate agreements in the last quarter that we felt both sides were really
able to achieve their goals. We haven't seen any material change in the distribution requirements or minimum
distribution requirements in any of those agreements. And I think the strategy that we've laid out and that we've
executed over the last few years of really investing in these brands, investing in the rights around these brands, and
being able to offer something that really matters for our distributors' customers has borne fruit for us with respect to
pricing and distribution gains.
With respect to the whole – the question of overall the affiliate universe and the subscriber universe of the MVPDs, as
John mentioned in his comments, obviously the total universe for extended basic for those MVPDs has contracted. We
continue to see growth. Our networks are distributed at different levels, each one different to another. Some of them are
young like Fox Sports 1, some of the NatGeo brands, and some are more fully distributed. So we have pretty good
visibility on reasonable growth going forward. And I think the things like minimum distribution guarantees, et cetera,
haven't been really impacted, at least in our latest negotiations and latest renewals, and we think that's encouraging.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Okay. Thanks, James.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Anthony. Ryan, could we have the next question, please?

<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much, gentlemen, maybe a couple of questions for James. James, I was just

investment prospects you might see that would hold back the trajectory of margins we're all hoping for, and certainly

anything driving revenue that's new.
And separately, Thursday Night Football obviously went to CBS and NBC, and I imagine that was something that Fox
was looking at. It certainly feels like it would fit with Fox. Any comments you want to make around the dynamics of
Thursday Night Football might be helpful to understand your investment strategy. Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks. Thanks, Doug. First of all, in sports rights, as we've said before, really it's
around – we're a big investor in sports, we believe in sports is a real driver of the business. But that said, you make
choices around different packages. You make choices about how much you're investing in different things. With
respect to STAR, the landscape for sports rights in the near term really probably dominated by what happens with the
BCCI, the domestic Board of Control for Cricket India and the IPL, the Pro Cricket League domestically there. And we
have to see how that shakes out over the next couple of years. I think in the next year the IPL picture becomes clearer.
That's something that we don't hold today.
But fundamentally, there's nothing that we see out there that we feel would necessitate us or adjusting our goals for the
business both from a margin perspective and an absolute profit perspective over the next four years to five years. The
STAR business is going very strong. And while there are some of those lumpy sports rights out there, we're really
through the peak investment in those, as we've said before.
And with respect to Thursday Night Football, as you would expect, we're a partner of the NFL and a very happy partner
of the NFL. And as all players were, discussions were had around Thursday Night Football. Ultimately, the NFL –
NBC and CBS were able to get a deal done there. But we're very happy with where we are with the NFL. Our Sunday
package is something that's very, very strong. As I said in my comments earlier, this NFL season was our second-best
ever, and we feel very strong going forward with those rights well into the next decade.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Ryan, could we have the next question, please?

And that will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask you two questions, if I could. One, I just wanted to hear
your thoughts on the need for you to have rights to offer a streamed direct-to-consumer RSN service, and just
wondering if you had obtained any of those rights yet through your agreements?
And secondly, just on Hulu, is there likely to be another funding round for Hulu coming up this year or next year? Or is
Hulu at a point where it's close to being self-funded? Or have you already increased the funding quietly? Thank you.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks. On the streaming RSN business, I think we have announced the one change
in rights has been around baseball, which is the ability – we obtained the ability for the RSN to do in-market streaming
of baseball games on an authenticated basis alongside the RSN distribution. But there's no plan to do any separate
over-the-top kind of RSN business there. It's really embedded in the experience of the overall – of the RSN in that, but
– and those are new. I think we announced that recently.
And with respect to Hulu, the needs of the business are something that the shareholders are going to be looking at on an
ongoing basis. If we see the opportunity to really grow the business well, then investment is something that all the
shareholders are going to be – have to look at.
<Q - Bryan Kraft>: If I could just ask a follow-up. Is the focus on Hulu going to continue to be domestic? Or is there
a case where it might make sense to broaden out internationally?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: I think primarily domestic right now. I think there is an opportunity internationally for
Hulu to compete, but that's, again, a decision that all the shareholders will have to make at the time with the company.

That question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you. So taking on the theme of cash flow, John, I'm wondering if you
could just remind us what your expectations – or what our expectations should be around working cap use this year. I
think you'd said similar this year to last year, but you're running, I believe, quite a bit above that in the first six months.
And I didn't know if what's happened in the marketplace on the credit market front had changed the company's
perspective on leverage or cash balance. So just maybe you could remind us on that.
And then one unrelated, since you've called out Film performance this year being less-than-expected, I thought it would
be a good time to ask about whether you had an update on Avatar timing. What that looks like at this point? Thank you.
<A - John P. Nallen>: Okay, Ben. Thanks. I'll handle the cash pieces of it. Our first half of the year is always a big
working capital investment period. We've got the biggest billings for the NFL for our fall season, and this year for a
particularly large number of releases that were in the last two quarters of the calendar year. So it's just traditional for us
to have a big receivable and working capital investment.
It also is a big for our inventory, because as you know, we make all of the NFL payments, as an example, before the
end of the calendar year, with the biggest games happening really after the calendar year with post-season, et cetera. So
looking at this period, it's not unusual at all as against our working capital build-up would be in any six-month –
December period. For the year, we're still at the same place. The working capital level we expect to be about the same
as a year ago. So we're consistent in that regard from what I said back in August.
To remind you, our targets were to have a $2 billion to $3 billion cash balance and 2.5 times to 3 times gross leverage
on our balance sheet. And as we look through the year to the end of the fiscal year, we'll start approaching those levels
there or thereabouts in the next – around that time or six months after that.
And as far as the credit markets, we continue to have long-dated bonds; we look at our maturities. And unless we have
a capital need, which isn't present right now, we're not accessing the capital markets in any unusual way given where
they are right now.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: And then, Ben, on the Avatar timing, there's no update now or no change there that I
can give you on that as that all gets worked out. But I would say that we're pretty confident about the overall slate in the
Film business leading up to that going forward. As Lachlan mentioned before, with The X-Men and Independence Day
coming up in the balance of this year after Deadpool just next week, but we think a really strong slate leading up to
that. And the Avatar when it's confirmed, we'll be disclosing that, I'm sure very loudly.
<Q - Benjamin Daniel Swinburne>: Thanks a lot.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Ben. Ryan, could we have the next question, please?

Next question comes from the line of Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you look at Facebook, which added like $2 billion
of ad revenue in calendar Q4 year-over-year, growing something like 50-odd-plus-percent, how do you think about the
importance of mobile to Fox overall? Do you all need to start new business, meaning, invest organically in new

launches? Do you need to acquire businesses to just overall shift your exposure more towards mobile versus legacy
TV? How do you think about that?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Well, thanks, Rich, for the question. I think first of all, I would just say that what
we're really focused on is making our programming, the creative assets that we make available in as wide a way as
possible. And mobile is increasingly an important part of that. As we look at TV Everywhere-type applications like Sky
Go in Europe, for example, increasingly consumed on mobile phones and tablets, as well as consumption in the U.S.
growing as video entertainment or audio-visual entertainment on mobile platforms.
I think the key thing for us is how do we invest in the capabilities to monetize that viewing, measure it and monetize it
in the right way. And I think we would look at investing to create those capabilities as we have, for example, with the
formation of our advanced ad products group, et cetera, which is making real headway into streaming.
I think that I would look at the mobile piece for us really as just part of the overall streaming landscape as opposed to
brand-new types of content for us, et cetera. For us, the priority is how do we execute with our creative assets today as
well as we can; make them more available, not less to customers; and how do we really innovate and get better
capabilities in terms of how we then monetize that platform going forward?
And then in discrete places where there's a really big opportunity, we would start a new business. If we look at
something like in India, the hotstar business is a mobile Internet-only video platform, which we launched early this year
– or I should say early last year, which has really gotten off to a great start. And that's a sports and entertainment
platform that is growing very, very rapidly from a mobile consumption point of view in India. And we would look at
individual brands really being able to embrace those kinds of opportunities going forward.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: And just in terms of overall consolidation in the space, is there interest? If there was renewed
interest from big players, do you think consolidation needs to happen to improve overall industry fundamentals, which
clearly are concerning investors?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Look, as we've said in the past, we actually are pretty happy with the asset mix that
we have. Obviously, there are times where we'll be opportunistic. We'll add assets like we have in this quarter with the
balance of the National Geographic Partners agreement as well as our Maa TV acquisition. And there are other places
where we might look to do similar things. But overall, our thesis isn't driven by consolidation. Our assets we think are
very strong. We think we've simplified our business dramatically over the last number of years. We've invested in these
brands to be stronger and more dynamic. And we're very focused on executing the business and the plan as well as we
can.
<Q - Rich Greenfield>: Thanks very much.
<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Rich. Ryan, could we have another question, please?

It comes from line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just a quick question for James Murdoch. I'm sure we're all sitting there with that $500
million of EBITDA in that STAR in fiscal 2018. I was just wondering if you could comment. If the rupee doesn't
change relative to where we are now, would you be willing to give us a revised number if FX holds steady?
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: A revised number upwards?
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: However you want, I think.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Look, I think we've generally assumed a modest appreciation over the rupee
normalized over a period of time. We found over the years that sure, we get that wrong in a given year, but generally
over time that's held true. And in those numbers – in those targets, we've assumed modest appreciation there. So it

could go either one way or another, but we're not in that business of currency forecasting. But with historical trends and
where the rupee has been and where we think it might go if it holds the same, we feel pretty confident about the
trajectory of the business there. It's a strong business with real velocity behind it.

<A - H. Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Jason. Ryan, at this time, we have time for I think one last question.
Operator
Okay, and that will come from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Thanks, guys. Good afternoon, two questions. First, I'm hoping you can talk a little bit about
your competitive position relative to Netflix, especially as it pertains to technology. And what I mean is Netflix is
spending a lot on technology, hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And they used to only be a distributor, and now
they're I would say infringing on your content territory by launching their own content. So how do you feel about your
need to invest in your own technological expertise to compete with them on that front?
And then second, on the Regional Sports Networks, you've talked about how you like them, the tribal element. The
investor concern seems to be around everybody paying for the RSNs a certain price. But maybe from your perspective,
how do you look at the price inelasticity there for the true fan who wants that network, and do you think maybe that's
underappreciated by those who are concerned about dollars and cents? Thanks.
<A - James Rupert Murdoch>: Thanks, Michael. Look, with respect to investment in technology, we invest
constantly in technology around delivering a better product to customers where we can. We've definitely been doing
that with respect to advertising innovation, investing in that, creating new capabilities there. And we've also been
investing in our capabilities, which are improving around domestically here in the U.S. direct-to-customer distribution
with our authenticated apps, for example, and other platforms. So we think there is an investment in technology that's
ongoing, and it will continue.
And then around the world, where we're heavier in direct-to-customer businesses and product-oriented businesses, for
example, with the Sky businesses, it's very heavy investment in technology that actually bears real fruit in terms of
creating a product for customers that they really like.
I'm not sure that the investment in technology you referred to really has a bearing on the production of creative assets
and getting into original production. I think that's a different issue. We feel very good about our ability to do that. I
think in the future, as we do today, we're going to see continued competition for talent, continued competition for
storytellers, and a continued real appetite for various players to invest and there will be multiple Internet TV companies
doing that, including our own. So I don't think the investment in technology necessarily has a bearing on that creative
output or that competitive dynamic that you mentioned. But it clearly does have a bearing on the product set for
customers, how good they are and how you can monetize there as well.
And as to your second question with the RSNs, I think at this point, we feel pretty good about RSN pricing, where we
are anyway. I can't speak for the overall market. And as I said, in the renewal of recent distribution agreements earlier,
we're able achieve our goals there. For example, price inelasticity for the hard core fan is something that there probably
is some price inelasticity there. There are those fans that would pay a lot. But I think you have to remember that the
RSNs are very broad. They're not just for super fans. The RSNs in many of our markets are the number one rated
broadcast platforms in their market, particularly in baseball season, where you see markets like St. Louis, for example,
beating all broadcast networks on those game nights.
So I think it's a very, very broad offering and one that we try to price in the fairest way that we can that provides both
returns for our partners, the teams in those businesses, but also a fair price for distributors that they can pass on to
customers in the right way.
<Q - Michael Morris>: Great, thank you.
