Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for an update on our first quarter
performance. As you know, we started 2014 with a clear objective of restoring the momentum of our global business.
This morning I'm pleased to report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. In the midst
of continued headwinds, we achieved: sequentially stronger 2% volume, cycling 4% volume growth in the prior-year
quarter despite the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of this year; comparable currency neutral net
revenue growth of 2% after excluding the impact of structural items; growth of an incremental 100 million unit cases or
the equivalent of 27 million incremental servings per each day; and both volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages with value share gains ahead of volume share gains.
These top line results underscore our system's ability to leverage our occasion-brand-price-pack-channel architecture
across our entire portfolio of leading brands. They're also a reflection of our ability to drive performance, improve
incidence and simultaneously enhance price/mix, which increased 2% globally in the quarter. And we increased our
marketing investments while decreasing other SG&A costs consistent with our commitment to identify savings
opportunities and to increase support for our brands.
From a geographic perspective, volume in our developed markets was down 1%; however, volume grew in key
developed markets including Japan and Australia, while volume in North America was even. Importantly, volume grew
3% in our developing and emerging markets with China up 12% and Brazil up 4%. Both India and Russia also grew
volume in the mid-single digit range, while gaining non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share.
We remain steadfastly focused on the five strategic priorities we announced on our fourth quarter earnings call and
later, which I outlined at CAGNY. As a reminder, those five strategic priorities are as follows: firstly, to accelerate
sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola; strategically expand our portfolio -- profitable stills portfolio; thirdly, increase
brand investments by maximizing productivity; fourth, win at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system;
and last but not least, invest in our next generation of leaders.
I'll devote the majority of my remarks today to talking about these strategies and the progress we're making in restoring
our momentum. As usual, you'll find further operating group performance details in our earnings press release issued
earlier this morning. These five important strategic priorities serve as a means to further sharpen our focus. They also
serve as beacons to collectively align the efforts of our more than 700,000 system associates all around the world.
Now beginning with our first priority. We are determined to accelerate sparkling beverage growth led by Coca-Cola
and we've established comprehensive strategies to do so. The foundation of this plan is to invest in and deliver great
marketing to support our sparkling brands. We're adding a sharpened focus with our bottling partners to increase
sparkling brand penetration as well as cold drink availability. We're overlaying disciplined
occasion-brand-price-pack-channel strategies supported by revenue growth management capabilities to drive sustained
value growth. We're continuously innovating to meet evolving consumer needs and also we're engaging with partners
and stakeholders to promote trust and to address category misperceptions. These strategies to accelerate sparkling
growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the year.
Highlights of actions we took in this past quarter include a terrific Sochi Olympics campaign executed across, all over
Russia supported by solid trade activations that resulted in 7% sparkling volume growth and 9% brand Coca-Cola
growth, the 17th consecutive quarter of growth for brand Coke; the successful recruitment strategy in China, where
immediate consumption tax drove sparkling volume growth of 6%, brand Coke growth of 3%, and transaction growth
of 10%; and ongoing sparkling innovation in Japan that contributed to 3% sparkling growth in the first quarter. We
clearly see growth potential in the sparkling category and along with our system partners, we are investing in the

wide-ranging sparkling innovation, world-class marketing, and unparalleled local execution to satisfy our consumers'
thirst for refreshment.
It is still early in our journey to restore sparkling momentum, yet we are tenaciously focused on building and improving
upon this quarter's performance. This is underscored by the programs and the marketing campaigns that are already
underway in the second quarter, like our FIFA World Cup campaign that has 175 countries participating, the broadest
reach of any campaign in Coca-Cola's history. We're happy to share that the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is visiting
the United States this week with stops in Washington DC yesterday, Miami today, and Atlanta and LA later in the
week. From here, the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is heading to Brazil on the final leg of its 90-country journey.
The activation of this exciting global property coupled with initiatives such as our Share a Coke program with
individualized, personalized Coca-Cola bottles and cans, continued support and innovation on Sprite and Fanta and a
wide range of new package introductions across our entire sparkling portfolio is going to bring excitement and
engagement to our sparkling brands all around the world.
Moving now to our second priority, to strategically expand our profitable still beverage portfolio. Our still beverage
brands account for approximately a quarter of our total global volume currently. Today, we are the global value leader
in still beverages with $11 billion still brands, more than any of our competitors. In the first quarter of this year, our
still beverage volume grew 8% while gaining both volume and value share. Given our leadership position in the
industry, we are keenly focused on working with our global system partners to build strong profitable and
competitively advantaged brands in fast-growing and profitable still beverage categories.
We're building on our leading juice and juice drink portfolio growing volume 3% in the quarter. This was fueled by
exceptional brands like Simply, which grew double-digits in North America and Minute Maid Pulpy, which grew 8%
in China. This also marks our ninth consecutive quarter of value share gains in juice and juice drinks. Our global tea
portfolio grew 4% as we delivered double-digit growth across Honest and Gold Peak in North America as well as
Ayataka and Sokenbicha in Japan. This resulted in the 10th consecutive quarter of global ready-to-drink value share
gains in tea.
We are leveraging our packaging leadership to expand our PlantBottle and crushable bottle packaging, creating an
important point of value differentiation for brands ranging from DASANI in North America to I LOHAS in Japan. And
we're developing a new profit enhancing beverage drop platform that now includes the DASANI Powerade, Minute
Maid and vitaminwater brands. As you will note, we continue to innovate across our still portfolio to further drive and
enhance our leading position.
Our third strategic priority is to increase brand investments by maximizing productivity. On the brand side and as
announced earlier this year, we will grow our investments by $400 million in 2014 and by $1 billion by 2016. We
began to ramp up our investments in the first quarter to support robust marketing programs like our Sochi Winter
Olympics campaign across multiple markets. We're also increasing our media investments and quality in North
America, as evidenced by our Super Bowl ads. It's beautiful and growing all the way. In Latin America, the first of our
operating groups to launch the FIFA World Cup activation viral marketing efforts targeting millennials included short
films that have already exceeded 10 million views on YouTube.
And also, our worldwide marketing team is collaborating with our partners to deliver enhanced consumer experiences.
A couple of examples that leverage new technology platforms include Misfit Wearables, which produces the Shine
fitness tracker, and Spotify, the world's leading on-demand music streaming service. Our strategic partnerships with
these two companies in which we've made minority equity investments will enable us to forge even more meaningful
connections with our consumers.
And while it's too early to speak to results from our increased level of investments, we are confident in our plans and
approach, which is based on robust analytics across our top markets. The insights from this analysis have equipped us
with the necessary information to prioritize both the quantity and quality of our investments across markets, across
brands, and across media channels. With regards to productivity, we are diligently seeking, identifying, and securing
efficiencies across all parts of the business. This effort is focused on standardizing and streamlining our processes while

also clarifying roles and accountabilities.
Let me just provide you with three examples of how we're doing this across North America. We've instituted an
ownership cost management focus, thanks to which our associates are identifying and delivering significant savings.
Second, about 50% of our plants in North America have completed an operational excellence diagnostic with the
remainder scheduled to do so by 2015. This is resulting in savings of approximately $1 million for each location and
following each implementation, the focus on year-over-year productivity continues. And third, in our warehouse and
delivery operations, we've focused on our layout and process standardization. Thanks to initiatives ranging from
real-time data transfer to smart selling, we can now optimize warehouse capacity, work more efficiently, and reduce out
of stocks.
Here is just a few examples of the productivity work that we're doing to identify and extract savings that will be
redeployed and reinvested to drive long-term growth. We've also made progress on our fourth priority, which is to win
at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system. Our focus on winning at the point-of-sale is not new. What is
new is the increased emphasis on flawless execution across our system. This includes an accelerated focus on capturing
new outlets and greater alignment in the execution of new brand and package launches. We are also intent on exceeding
our Right Execution Daily or RED targets and ensuring that our products are well placed as well as merchandised to
optimize our sales. This fourth priority emphasizes the importance of capability building and collaboration on all front
lines where our sales associates, drivers, merchandisers, are often the final link in ensuring that our Coca-Cola and all
our brands are always within an arm's reach of desire.
In the first quarter we saw many concrete examples of how together with our bottling partners, we are winning at the
point-of-sale, including excellent execution of our Sochi marketing campaign, leading to significant share gains across
almost all beverage categories in Russia. Occasion-brand-price-pack-channel architecture changes in many countries
including a significant focus on immediate consumption package reductions leading to immediate consumption volume
growth ahead of future consumption growth, and an improved RED penetration and scores. Right Execution Daily now
covers approximately 40% of our volume, an increase of about 3 points over the past year. And our FIFA World Cup
Trophy Tour program has now reached 90 countries where our bottling partners have activated the program in 400,000
retail outlets. Importantly, the partnership required to win at the point-of-sale extends beyond our bottling partners to
include our customers to more than 24 million retail outlets that we proudly visit on a weekly basis. We are
continuously collaborating with our customers to identify ways to add value to their business.
Our fifth and final priority is to invest in our next generation of leaders, both here in the U.S. and all across the world.
In this context, I want to remind everyone that today is Gary's last quarterly earnings call, and I want to commend and
acknowledge him on an outstanding 14 years as the Coca-Cola Company's CFO. We sincerely thank Gary for his many
years of outstanding leadership service, his steady focus, countless insights, and the enormous value he has helped to
generate for our company and all of our shareholders. Collectively, he and his finance leadership team have carried out
a thoughtful and purposeful transition.
I'm going to recommend that our board elect Kathy Waller as our new CFO next week and this is a great example of
the talented and experienced bench strength that we are building with our next generation of talented leaders. I hope all
of you welcome Kathy to the role of Chief Financial Officer.
As our fifth priority outlines, we're committed to investing in our next generation of leaders across all levels of the
Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system. So as you can see, we're making progress across each of these critical
strategic priorities, and I look forward to providing you with further updates as we progress throughout this year.
Now let me address a couple of other topics across our operating groups. First, there's the question of profitability in
North America, where comparable currency neutral operating income declined 8% in the quarter. This decline was
largely due to the impact of one less selling day and a shift of Easter into the second quarter.
We've been encouraged by the results of targeted marketing efforts in several North American markets in recent
months, and we're excited about the trends that we are seeing. Enhanced marketing and disciplined retail pricing
strategies in North America resulted in volume that was even to brand Coca-Cola. At the same time we achieved a 2%

increase in sparkling price mix. We also gained sparkling value share ahead of volume share making this our 16th
consecutive quarter of value share gain.
Our priorities in North America remain very clear. As we shared in our year-end call, our focus remains on building
strong brands, creating customer value, and enhancing our capabilities. We are streamlining the way we work and
identifying ways to operate more effectively and efficiently in our sales warehouse and delivery operations.
I also want to speak to our results in Europe, where our volume was down 4% as our business was adversely impacted
due to the Easter shift and by ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Volume in France increased 4% and volume in
Germany was even with prior year. During the quarter, our Europe Group realized 10 points of price/mix, thanks to the
consolidation of innocent and to a broad focus on earning/price across our business units in Europe. We seek to
continuously earn price/mix by balancing disciplined pricing with packaging changes. A recent example of this is the
transition from a straight wall 2 liter to a contour 1.75 liter at the same price in Great Britain at the end of the first
quarter.
As we look ahead, we are cautiously optimistic about our outlook in Europe, despite the continuing volatile operating
environment. The strong and integrated programs that we have developed together with our bottling partners fuel this
optimism. These initiatives will help us leverage our marketing assets, implement critical innovative packaging and
dispensing initiatives, and execute impactful marketing programs during the year to come.
A number of these initiatives in Europe began in the first quarter, including the FIFA World Cup promotions and
three-time World Cup winner Germany offering our Coke Zero consumers a chance to win one of the 200 tickets to
Brazil; a new Fanta marketing campaign; and in and out flavors successfully launched in Austria, Switzerland,
Romania, and Hungary, as well as Cappy Pulpy's geographical expansion in the Southern European belt. However, we
see most of the benefit coming during the remainder of the year due to various factors, such as the timing of Easter, a
ramp-up in World Cup activations, as well as the timing and intensity of our marketing programs.
Before handing over the call to Gary, I want to also remind you about our recently announced partnership with Keurig
Green Mountain, which closed in the first quarter. We believe Keurig Green Mountain is the perfect strategic partner to
collaborate with to capitalize on the many opportunities we see available in the market, and we look forward to
providing you with further updates later in the year.
As I complete my prepared remarks, I want to reinforce that there is so much runway ahead of us, and the Coca-Cola
system is well positioned to capture more than our fair share of growth. This is a business that has barely tapped into its
full potential. Globally, consumer populations are growing. Purchasing power is increasing and spreading to a new
middle-class. Urbanization continues to intensify, and lifestyles and consumer preferences are changing in ways that
significantly favor our expanding and evolving beverage portfolio.
We have an unparalleled reach with leading global brands and a bottling system that is investing for sustainable
growth. Having said that, we do not take anything for granted. We fully understand that attaining our 2020 Vision will
require more than just counting on industry growth. Indeed it is up to all of us, up to our global system leaders, and up
to each of our associates, to make the right decisions and to take the right actions that are going to enable us to seize the
abundant opportunities that are before us.
Gary will now provide you with some additional details on our first quarter financial performance.
Gary P. Fayard
Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter of this year, we began executing and delivering the
strategic plan that we outlined and shared with you on our 2013 yearend call and at the CAGNY and CAGE Investor
Conferences earlier this year. Our clear and focused commitment remains on long-term value creation and the strategic
priorities which Muhtar just outlined today, and they're tailored to do just that. While much work remains to be done,
we're confident in our strategies and are fully committed to this plan as we firmly believe that the Coca-Cola Company
is a sustainable and great long-term growth business.

As mentioned, we grew unit case volume 2%, a sequential improvement from last quarter and cycling 4% growth in the
prior year. Global price/mix increased by 2%, and we gained both volume and value share in non-alcoholic
ready-to-drink beverages in the first quarter, a constructive start towards restoring our momentum in 2014. Comparable
currency-neutral net revenue grew 2% after excluding structural items, while concentrate sales were even with the prior
year. We do expect concentrate sales and unit case sales to be in line for the full year.
Comparable currency-neutral operating income grew a solid 7% after excluding structural items, while also including
an increase in marketing investments in support of our brands. Comparable currency-neutral earnings per share grew
5%, with currency creating a 10-point headwind on comparable EPS. And for the math people in the room, you will
notice a comparable EPS decline of 4%, implying 9-point headwind, so I just wanted to point out that the 10-point
headwind is in the rounding.
We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations, and our net share repurchases through the first quarter were $713
million. Our cash from operations increased significantly versus the prior-year quarter, primarily because we made a
large contribution to our pension plan in the first quarter of last year. Cash from operations also benefited from efficient
management of working capital, and these benefits were partially offset by unfavorable exchange. Because our largest
pension plan is currently fully funded, I do not foresee any significant cash contributions to our pension plan in the near
term.
As it relates to overall cash management and as we have discussed in the past, we follow disciplined guidelines for how
we use our cash to create sustainable shareowner value. First, we are reinvesting in the business to further strengthen
the equity of our brands and to accelerate growth. This includes capital investments in new cooler placements,
route-to-market enhancements, brand and packaging innovation, and marketing investments that include not only more
marketing but better quality marketing as well. Importantly, along with our increased investments, our bottling partners
are also stepping up their investments, thus further enhancing growth for their overall system.
Second, we continue to reward shareowners by paying a healthy dividend, which is $1.22 per share this year, a 9%
increase over last year. It's worth noting that we've increased our dividend every year for more than half a century.
Third, we evaluate opportunities to grow through bolt-on acquisitions, strategic partnerships, and value-added joint
ventures when appropriate. Recent examples include the Keurig Green Mountain partnership, which opens up an
exciting new packaging format for our brands, investments to further enhance our leading juice portfolio like innocent
and Rani, and investments that allow us to broaden our reach like ZICO and Core Power.
And finally, we conduct meaningful regular share repurchase. As we look to the second quarter of 2014, we plan on
continuing to execute our five strategic priorities, and our full-year plan remains firmly intact.
First, let me address operating leverage. As you can see in our release, we achieved four points of operating expense
leverage in the quarter as we benefited from the timing of year-over-year expenses. Consistent with what we shared
with you on our year-end 2013 call, our outlook for operating expense leverage for the full-year 2014 has not changed.
We expect to achieve even to slightly positive operating expense leverage for the full year as we increase brand
investments.
Secondly, let me address the outlook for currency. We now estimate based on current spot rates and hedging that
currencies will have a 7-point headwind on operating income both in the second quarter and for the full year. Our
analysis reflects and includes the negative impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation, partly offset by
improvements in other currencies as compared to the outlook we provided at the time of our yearend earnings release.
While we are very cautious in forecasting currency movements, we have managed through more than $2 billion of
currency headwinds at the top line in the last two years, and as you know, we anticipate significant currency headwinds
for the remainder of this year. As we look further into the future, we think it is unlikely that we'll have the same level of
headwinds going forward.
Third, I would like to comment on structural change. As we've previously disclosed, the bottling transactions
completed in 2013 are anticipated to have an unfavorable 1% structural impact on both our full-year 2014 revenues and

operating income. As a reminder, this impact hits the first and second quarter results as the Brazilian bottler transaction
took place on July 3 of last year.
As Muhtar noted earlier, I have elected to retire next month after a very special and memorable 20 years at the
Coca-Cola Company, and I want to congratulate Kathy Waller on being recommended to the board for election as the
company's new CFO, and I reinforce my full confidence in her leadership in this position given her 25 years at the
company. I have to say, as a retiring officer with this wonderful company, it is comforting to know that I'll leave the
CFO office in great hands and that we have built a talented and deep finance leadership organization that will support
both Kathy and Muhtar.
It also gives me great comfort to look around this room this morning during our conference call with Muhtar, Irial,
Ahmet, Sandy, Kathy, and Jackson and to think about the experience, focus and dedication of this company's senior
leadership. It's been a tremendous honor to serve as CFO of the Coca-Cola Company over the past 14 years, and I have
greatly enjoyed building long-lasting relationships with all of you across our investment community.
In closing, I want to leave you with a few thoughts. First, I have every confidence in our ability to reignite sparkling
growth beginning with brand Coca-Cola. Second, we are continuing to build leadership positions in still beverages,
much like we have done in the sparkling category since 1886. And third, our franchise system is not only the strongest
it has ever been, but it also provides us with a global footprint and an invaluable local resource, all at the heart of a real
value-creation model. And lastly, there is nothing quite as refreshing as an ice-cold Coca-Cola.
So to all of you on this call, I sincerely thank you for your candor, your partnership, and your thoughtful questions over
the last 14 years, and I encourage you to continue to reach out to the senior leadership team for meaningful dialog on
ways to further enhance our business and to build long-term value for you and all of our shareowners.
Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Good morning. Congratulations, again, Gary and Kathy.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thank you, Bill.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Thanks, Bill.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Muhtar, if you could talk about what gives you the confidence that Coke can hit its long-term
growth algorithm in 2014, specifically. And also when you look at the improving momentum here in the first quarter,
how much would you attribute to any relief you're seeing in external headwinds versus the impact of the internal
actions that you're taking? Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Thanks, Bill. Good morning. First, let me say again that I am pleased to report that our
growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. And in the midst of still continued volatility headwinds
achieving sequentially stronger 2% volume growth, that means delivering an incremental 100 million unit cases in the
past 90 days or so, that means incrementally every single day an additional 27 million actual servings for each day. As
the base grows, we are still very proud that we can continue to drive growth.
And this is a quarter where Easter has shifted, where we were cycling 4% from prior year, where as I said macro
volatility continued, and where we had the harshest winter in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the U.S. We
don't think this is a great result, but satisfying as one step in the right direction to restore momentum. Germany, U.S.
was flat in the past quarter. We think given what we went through and what economies and consumer and climate,
Turkey was up 2%, Japan was up 3%, France was up 4%, Brazil was up 4%, India and Russia was up 6%, China was

up 12%. These show and give us the proof points that our actions are working.
And I think this is a quarter, again, where only a small fraction of our incremental marketing was deployed. I'd say
probably around – so 5% of our total incremental marketing for the year was deployed in this quarter. As we ramp up
the quality and also quantity of our marketing, I believe that certainly we're going to drive better alignment. We have
really good plans in place, fully aligned with our marketing partners, and I would be disappointed, as would be all my
colleagues and associates, if we don't go back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for volume growth.
But also, importantly, we are driving not just volume growth, but we're driving immediate consumption growth, which
is really important for our business. When you look at, say, in this past quarter, with top five countries growing at –
China up 18% in IC growth, Indonesia up 9% in IC growth, Vietnam up 8%, Brazil up 5%. These are really important
numbers, because it's sustainable growth, it's profitable growth, and it's growth in transactions, which is directly
married to the health of the brands and health of our portfolio.
So from that perspective, again, I want to just register cautious optimism that I feel we would be disappointed if we do
not fall back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for the remainder of the year in terms of the volume
growth picture and also the other key metrics that follow on from there.
<Q - Bill Pecoriello>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning. And, Gary and Kathy, congratulations to both of you.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thanks, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So just wanted to drill in a little bit further on Latin America, and I guess sort of three
topics. One, in Mexico, the volume decline was a little bit less than we thought. So, if you could just talk about whether
what we're seeing now is sort of the expected elasticity or if there's something else in the future that might change the
elasticity. So has the consumer really seen the full effect of the pricing?
And then second, if you could just talk a little bit about some of the drivers of price/mix in the Latin America segment
in the quarter, how much of it was driven by Venezuela?
And then finally, just in terms of the Brazil comp being better sequentially, how much of that do you think is just that
maybe the consumer is a little bit better? Was there anything specific that Coke did in the first quarter to drive a better
performance in Brazil?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Bryan, good morning. Last question first. On Brazil, I think, Brazil was out of the gate
first in terms of the FIFA World Cup activations. A lot of noise around that, a lot of activation in stores, and I think that
certainly we also see a little less malaise in terms of the macroeconomic environment. And again, in terms of also the
relationship between durables and non-durable consumer goods was a little bit more in favor for us. So we feel that's
going to continue, and that Brazil will have a better year. And I think the government is also aware of what they need to
do as they lead into one of the biggest events in their history, which is hosting a memorable event like the World Cup.
As far as Mexico is concerned, I think, sparkling volume for us was sort of in the mid-single-digits decline for the first
quarter. The important thing here is that because of the strength of our brands, because of also the incredible richness of
our packaged portfolio and our occasion-brand-price-pack-channel architecture, the strength of that in Mexico, we are
seeing that we are gaining market share versus both local competitors and our international competitor in Mexico as
well. And again, it's early days related to Mexico, but I would say that we're again executing with great precision and
passion in Mexico with our great bottling partners.

And then in terms of price/mix, including the favorable geographic mix, other points came as a result of high inflation
in local markets, and again, I'll ask Gary to comment related to the Venezuela piece.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yes, Bryan, Venezuela definitely contributed positively in the quarter to positive price/mix.
Now with going forward, that will no longer really be the case, because as of the end of the quarter, we have adjusted
the exchange rate and will be using the Bs.10.08 exchange rate going forward for most of the revenues, for a large part
of the revenues in Venezuela. So that will come down. But that impact is included in the latest currency forecast that I
gave you; so again, some of the other currencies actually have improved from what we talked about in the February call
that offset now by Venezuela, so still at the same 7% impact.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: As we're modeling price mix in Latin America just going forward, there is some price mix
in there that is positive excluding Venezuela? I guess that was what I was after.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Oh, yes. Yes.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: That's definitely yes, Bryan
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Yeah, definitely positive price mix going in there. And I think the other thing to point out, and
Muhtar said it, I said it, but I think it's really important as we look at this quarter how we grow value share ahead of
volume share. So we are definitely focused on rational pricing across the world and getting our earning price.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from John Faucher with [ph] JPMC (41:34).
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you very much. And Gary, it's been great over the last 14 years, so best of luck as you
move forward; and Kathy, looking forward to working with you as well.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thanks John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Gary, I had to finish off with sort of one accounting question here. So, you guys drove
tremendous SG&A leverage in the quarter, and you talked a little bit about sort of how you haven't put a whole lot of
marketing spend to work yet. So, can you walk us through maybe how we should think about the sales curve over the
next couple of quarters and what we should look for on the SG&A line as we look to model out the balance of the year?
Thanks.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: I'll try, John, and we'll see how this goes. But basically there, let's go to marketing first and
let's talk about it in two different ways. One is how much of the marketing is actually in the market, and that's what
Muhtar was referring to. How much of the marketing is actually hitting the consumer, and a lot of our incremental
spend actually has not hit the consumer yet. It's much more weighted starting in the second quarter on through Q4. A
lot of the first quarter really focused on getting the quality of our marketing up and that sort of thing. That is different
from the way we account for marketing and marketing, as you reference, is on the sales curve. So on the sales curve
that incremental marketing is included in what we expensed in the first quarter.
Now then we get into the marketing that we're cycling quarter-by-quarter from last year, and so it was an increase in
marketing in the first quarter; the increase will significantly grow during the year based on what we're cycling. That is
part of why I said that 4 points of operating leverage will go to even to slightly positive and we're also benefiting from
some other timing in the first quarter in just some of the OpEx expenses as well.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay. And then, Muhtar, if I could ask you a follow-up question on, you talked about the
strength of the bottling system. And obviously the equity income line is getting hit by FX, but we have seen some
comments from Amatil in terms of what's going on there. And then also, SAB talked about cutting some positions in

their soft drink business. Can you just talk a little bit about the mood of the bottlers and what they're seeing now and
how we should look at some of the headwinds they're facing in the shorter-term and how that maybe will differ with
what happens in the longer term there? Thank you.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I would say the mood is positive in terms of their willingness to invest, their
appetite for new territories. I've always, you've heard me say this before in terms of litmus test for the health of the
business, there's a lot of appetite for growing horizontally in territory, for trying to get expanse, and I think in terms of
the quality of our marketing, in terms of the quantity of our marketing, I feel that based on all the bottlers that I have
[ph] questioned (44:40) this past quarter, I feel good, I feel positive about the sentiment both here in the United States
as we start our path to franchising and as we look at how we expand and how we hasten the pace of franchising, but
also across the world.
I recently have been with many bottling leaders and talked to many of them. We have a global system meeting next
month. Also, about 50 of the top bottlers get together with their CEOs and chairmen, and we are there to further align
our plans for 2015 and beyond. But I feel good related to the plans in place, related to everyone's desire to execute
better and to invest more into the future, and again, based on the investments that have gone into the marketplace in the
third and fourth quarter of last year, that's why I feel confident that you're going to see us back into the corridor of the
3% to 4% long-term growth algorithm for the balance of the year as we keep restoring momentum. So that's what I
would say.
Do we have some pockets of challenges? You mentioned Coca-Cola Amatil. I feel, again, very cautiously optimistic as
Alison Watkins assumes her new role there and we're working very closely with her and her team, and again, we're
very much aligned as to how we move forward with SABMiller and their management team related to their
nonalcoholic beverage business.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and I also echo my congratulations to Kathy. And Gary,
it's been great. We'll miss you.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thank you, Judy.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Thank you.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So just wanted to maybe delve a little bit into Europe in the quarter and the question, number
one, just relating to Great Britain, obviously sparkling being down double-digits. If you can give us some context of
trends that you've seen throughout the quarter and sort of strip out some of the one-off factors with respect to the Easter
timing as well as some of the transition into the 1.75 liter packaging and whether you're seeing some improvement
there. And then just in terms of Southern Europe, we're hearing more from some of the consumer companies that things
are trending a little bit better in markets like Spain and Portugal. So, maybe you can also just give us whether we're
seeing a similar improvement for your business in that part of Europe.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thanks, Judy. I'll ask Ahmet to give you a response on to your question. Ahmet?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Judy. Yeah, the results obviously for Europe for the first quarter was less than what
we would've desired, with the minus 4%. A lot of things came into play with that. You mentioned Easter obviously,
that was definitely a factor. And Muhtar has mentioned the transition into a new future consumption pack in GB. I
would add to that that there was sort of a pricing activity in the marketplace on future consumption packs that had also
had some impact, and we are in very close discussion and alignment with our bottlers to make sure that we actually sort
of respond in a way that we maintain rational pricing in the marketplace but also balance volume growth and value
growth at the same time, so that was one.

You mentioned Southern Europe. The slight improvement that everybody sees in Iberia and Spain, that we see as well.
Our numbers had a bit of noise in it with regards to the strike in our Iberian bottling partners that you all have heard
about before. We've had great mitigation plans in place and executed them. And the restructuring is expected to end in
May, and we continue to see improvements in our Iberian business as well. So, we expect as we move into quarter two,
remove the effect of Easter, fully implement our OBPPC in GB and continue to finish our restructuring in Spain, we
expect to see improvements in Europe over the next quarter and the rest of the year.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay, great. And then if I can just follow up on North America just on the pricing side, so
sparkling up 2% seems encouraging, but the broader North American pricing kind of being flattish, how should we
think about that going forward? Do you expect to see the still pricing being a little bit more pressured or do we see
improvement there going forward, so the broader North American pricing turning positive?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Judy. This is Muhtar. Let me just frame again just a couple of important takeaways
for Britain. Rational pricing was really the theme for us in Q1, and the strength of our marketing program, the strength
of our commercial program leads us to believe that we will see improvement as we go into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 in
Britain. That's the takeaway I'll say. Again, the same phrase and motto for our U.S. business, rational pricing, that's the
takeaway, and we had 2% to 3% price/mix in our sparkling portfolio in the U.S., and you'll see that continuing, and I'll
ask Sandy and Irial to reflect on further details on that in the U.S.
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas>: Thanks, Muhtar. Pricing, we expect pricing for the full year in sparkling to actually
improve from the first quarter. Our plans are in place with our customers. The market is rational. Our focus on
immediate consumption growth will drive mix, and our rate should continue to be healthy and even improve as we
move through the second quarter and into the third quarter, where we are lapping some promotional activity. So that's
point one. Point two is on stills. The case-pack water business continues to grow, so it pulls down mix. We see
opportunities, however, on a targeted basis in our bottle/can sales and improved pricing, and will take action to do that,
Paul, Irial and I see opportunities on a category-by-category basis.
And then finally, in our chilled juice business, we have just fielded [audio gap] (51:48) increase to respond to the
commodity issues with orange juice in Florida, and that's taking root. And our juice business continues to be
advantaged from a share perspective and I think all that wraps up from a pricing standpoint to a much more favorable
profit outlook for the full year. I mean, we saw some timing related issues, and obviously, we've talked about having
one less selling day in the first quarter, but all of that is going to come together with our price and volume plan for the
year to produce profit growth for the full year. Irial?
<A - Irial Finan>: Yeah. The only add I would give is we are about building a long-term sustainable profitable
business in the U.S. and to do that with most of the balance of pricing and volume growth and pricing is a really critical
part of that. And we will in this year end up with sparkling in the 2% to 3% range in pricing, or price/mix I should say
and that's really it and that's what we're focused on, that's what Sandy and the team, Paul and the team, all of us
together are focused on delivering that, delivering a healthy business that's going back to growth as well.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the performance of your key markets
in Asia and particularly China and Indonesia. The China volumes have rebounded quite strongly now for two or three
quarters, and I was just hoping you could shed some light on what's been driving that? Was it the new strategy, the new
team that's been put in place there? Whether that's all paying off or whether it's really, mostly due to relatively low
comparison basis stuff. And then a similar question on Indonesia, volumes continue to be stronger. I was just
wondering what's driving that.

<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Michael, it's Muhtar. I'll say just a couple of top line, and then ask again Ahmet to
contribute. But I will repeat what I said about IC. Particularly pleasing was China, IC was up 18%, Indonesia IC was up
9%, Vietnam, up 8%. These are really important for us as we drive profitable growth in our business, and again, our
newly architected packaging portfolio in China is really working with the smaller packs and new price points, and I
think also the new team certainly is really delivering what we expect of them as well as our bottlers with renewed
focus, both our Bottling Investments Group but also Swire as well as Costco really doing a good job in the first quarter,
and I think a lot of really good investments and activity and commercial leadership is in place to continue to drive that
momentum both in the stills as well as in the sparkling portfolio in China. And so again, Ahmet, if you want to just
highlight some more.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. I think, Michael, you've listed a lot of reasons. But my headline would
be, it's all of the above, but let me color it a little bit. Certainly the new team and the new strategy that we covered with
you last year is really coming together nicely. And we're happy with the quality of the growth. Sparkling is growing,
juices are growing, and those are the categories that we told you that we were betting on for our growth in China. You
might see growth in waters, that is an important category, but we've just had some recent launches into CNY2 water,
which improves the profitability of that; very, very early days, and it's doing well.
Also we are quite encouraged with, again, very early results on some of our innovation with Schweppes, [ph] C-Plus
(55:44) and just a couple of weeks out, the plans, is our isotonic. So we're getting that good mix of sparkling, juices,
and innovations that is beginning to work for us. I would just caution us though; you did mention the easier cycle rates
from last year. That is definitely the case, and 12% growth we are very happy with. But we would expect to see growth
in China, continued growth in China, probably in the range of mid-to-high single-digits that we can expect over time.
So that's basically I think covers everything.
And just one other point I'd highlight, Michael, is Japan very pleasing that it grew 3% – 3% in sparkling and stills grew
4% in Japan in the quarter. And again, despite the longest monsoon that I've ever experienced in terms of season and
how long it took, India grew 6% and should do much better going forward, so. And again, I'm certainly very proud that
this is the 31st consecutive quarter of growth in India for us, and including continued share gains.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Okay. And then Indonesia, could you just comment similarly?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, and again, Michael, that's a very important market for us, and we've been focused
on aligning with our bottling partner Amatil there on a new plan or let's say an evolved plan as was the case in China
with the revised OBPPC investments in sparkling and still beverages. There's been a recent change in management on
the ground, and all of that, again, we're cautiously optimistic about the progress we're making in Indonesia, are
beginning to deliver good results, and certainly that market has so much more opportunity to grow in the coming years.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning. First, Gary, congrats on a great run and best wishes on the farm, and
congrats to Kathy also.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Thank you.
<A - Gary P. Fayard>: Thank you.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: And, Muhtar, I was hoping to discuss if your expectations have changed at all here over
the last year just regarding the long-term growth potential in the sparkling category? So not necessarily from a market
share front, but more just in terms of category growth. And if one looks at industry data, it looks like sparkling trends
slowed more in 2013 than we've seen in other CPG categories. So I was just hoping for some perspective on that, the
drivers behind it and expectations going forward.

<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Dara, no changes as far as my perspective is concerned, and I can confirm that
both our entire team and as well as our bottling partners feel the same way as a system. We are blessed to be in a great
business both in the sparkling area as well as in the stills. We continue to innovate. I believe that we have a great future
where hundreds of millions of people and so many large markets haven't tasted a Coca-Cola in the last month or in the
last six months or in the last year. We have tremendous opportunity going forward, and I believe that through
innovation, packaging, equipment, and great marketing will continue to grow our business going forward, both in
sparkling and in stills and I feel confident that we will go back into the corridors of our long-term growth algorithm this
year and years to follow.
And with new innovations like creating new path to consumption, creating new consumption occasions like the Keurig
Green Mountain innovation, like Freestyle that is driving we know everywhere, every time it's actually installed in an
outlet. It drives traffic, it drives incidence, it drives increased sales and it drives excitement for the consumer. And at
the same time, our contour packages you'll see us being focused much more on the contour. Next year is the 100th
anniversary of the contour bottle, the iconic contour bottle, you'll see a lot of activity around that also. So we feel we
have a lot of work to do, but we feel that isn't that a great place where you have a lot of work to do and you believe in
your future.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And on the innovation front in the U.S., can you give us a bit more detail in terms
of maybe potential timing of sweetener innovation and how impactful you think natural sweeteners could be to your top
line results eventually?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I think they will. I'm certain innovation is going to be impactful, and I can't give you any
more details on timing.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah. Sure.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
So just thank you again, Gary, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial, Jackson. We're just once again firmly committed to
advancing our growth trajectory in 2014. Our strategic priorities are yielding tangible and measurable results, and
they're consistent with our long-term goals in our overarching business strategy. Increased marketing investments and a
relentless focus on execution underscore the confidence we have in our systems alignment as we seek to execute these
strategies while we further strengthen the foundation for profitable and sustainable long-term growth. Our 2020 vision
calls for a well-balanced growth, that is growth in sparkling beverages and also growth in still beverages across more
than 200 markets, countries, and in revenues and margins.
And thanks to this balanced growth in both portfolio as well as geographic mix, we see a path that leads to global
volume, revenue and profit growth in line with our long-term target. Our focus is unwavering, and our execution of our
five strategic priorities is going to enable us to restore momentum for growth to our business. Thank you for your time
this morning and for your continued interest and trust in our company.
