I will now hand over to George to take you through the numbers.
George Rollo Fairweather
Thank you, Gerald. I'm pleased that we've delivered good results, which is a fitting close to what's been an outstanding
financial year for the company, exceeding the upper end of our guidance when we have again experienced strong
currency headwinds and some challenging market conditions.
As usual, this performance has been achieved through a combination of operational progress and corporate efficiencies.
In particular, we've managed our costs well, and generated a healthy cash flow. At the same time, we've announced a
number of significant strategic partnerships in the U.S., which Stefano will talk about later.
But first, I'll take you through our fourth quarter results. Let me start with the financial highlights. Sales totaled $28.6
billion, up 0.4% versus the comparable quarter last year. Our results were impacted by currency translation, and on a
constant-currency basis, sales were up 2.5%.
GAAP operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 36.4%. GAAP net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots
Alliance were $1.0 billion, and diluted EPS was $0.95.
Adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, up 7.2%, and in constant currency, was up 10.3%. Adjusted net earnings
attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.2 billion, up 20.3%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was
$1.07; that was up 21.6%, and the adverse currency translation impact was around $0.03.
So now, let me turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter, beginning with Retail Pharmacy USA. Retail
Pharmacy USA sales were $20.7 billion, up 4.0% over the year-ago quarter, comparable store sales increasing by 3.2%.
Adjusted gross profit was up 0.5% to $5.4 billion; adjusted gross margin being lower for both pharmacy and retail.
Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales improved by 0.9 percentage points to 20.7%. Adjusted operating margin was
stable at 5.3%, resulting in adjusted operating income of $1.1 billion, up 4.4%. This increase was primarily driven by
increased pharmacy volume, procurement efficiencies, and cost control, partially offset by lower reimbursement rates.
We continued to make strong progress on our previously-announced cost savings program, the majority of which is in
the U.S. Overall, we're well on track to deliver our $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2017.
We now expect total pre-tax charges associated with the program to be between $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, which is
$300 million lower than we previously estimated.
So next, let's look in more detail at pharmacy. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 6.2%, driven by increased script
volume and improved specialty sales. We filled 229.5 million prescriptions, and that's on a 30-day adjusted basis,
including immunizations, an increase of 3.7%.
On a comparable basis for stores, which excludes central specialty, pharmacy sales increased by 5.0%, with scripts
filled up 3.9%, mainly due to continued growth in Medicare Part D volume. Our reported market share of retail
prescriptions, on the usual 30-day adjusted basis, was 19.3%, up approximately 40 basis points over the year-ago
quarter.
As you may know, IMS restated its market share numbers for the comparable period due to an enhancement to the IMS
panel. In the appendix, we set out fully comparable historic market share statistics for the division.

As in the last quarter and as we expected, gross margins were lower, mainly due to reimbursement rates and changes in
mix, which were partially offset by procurement efficiencies.
Retail sales on a comparable basis were down 0.3% on the same quarter last year. Sales were impacted more
significantly by declines in certain consumable categories and seasonal items, such as back-to-school and commodity
electronics, where we took action to proactively clear out old and legacy stock as we move to the next phase of our
retail transformation program.
We're also seeing the impact of direct management action in tobacco, where we've continued to reduce space and
visibility as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking.
Importantly, the health and wellness and beauty categories performed well. Our gross margins in the quarter were
slightly down. We don't see this as a permanent weakness, as the recent declines have been mainly due to actions we
have taken to put in place foundations for long-term growth.
I'm delighted to report that the first phase of our new beauty offering reached more than 1,600 stores across the U.S. by
the end of the fiscal year. This is three core elements; product, store environment and customer experience.
First, the products. In this phase, we are highlighting two of our best-known brands; No7 and Soap & Glory, alongside
existing national brands already well known to Walgreens customers.
The second element is the store environment. Our stores' beauty areas are being transformed to provide a welcoming
and colorful environment, with improved signage and lighting and a product range chosen to suit all types of
customers, regardless of age or background. The third element of the new Walgreens beauty offer is the customer
experience. This involved training and deploying specialist beauty consultants to offer high-quality advice to our
customers. The program has drawn on our experience internationally, most directly from Boots in the UK, but has been
tailored specifically for the U.S. market based on customer engagement and research. This is the first phase of a
multi-phase, multi-year strategy to differentiate Walgreens' beauty offering.
So now let's look at the results of the Retail Pharmacy International division. Sales for the division were $3.0 billion, up
1.4% in constant currency. On the same basis, comparable store sales declined by 0.6%, mainly due to Chile and the
UK, which I'll cover in a moment.
Adjusted operating margin for the division was 8.1%, up 1.0 percentage points. This resulted in adjusted operating
income of $247 million, an increase of 15.7% in constant currency.
To improve comparability, you will see that we've made certain classification changes to prior period sales, cost of
sales and SG&A. These changes have had no impact on operating income. To help with modeling, in the appendix,
we've provided revised numbers by quarter for fiscal 2015 and 2016.
Comparable pharmacy sales were flat on a constant-currency basis, as the loss of institutional contracts in Chile offset
growth in other markets. In Boots UK, comparable pharmacy sales were up 0.6%, and while we continued to
experience reimbursement pressure, pharmacy services continued to perform well.
Comparable retail sales for the division decreased 1.0%, due to a weaker Boots performance in the UK, where
comparable retail sales were down 0.8%, impacted by a particularly volatile and poor June.
So now, let's look at our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division. Sales for the division were $5.4 billion, down 1.5% on a
constant-currency basis, due to the disposal of Alliance Healthcare Russia in April. Comparable sales on a
constant-currency basis, which excludes acquisitions and dispositions, increased by 2.9%. This was marginally behind
our estimated market growth, weighted on the basis of our country wholesale sales, due to competitive market
conditions in Continental Europe.
Adjusted operating margin for the division, which we defined to exclude AmerisourceBergen income, was 2.9%. This
was up 0.3 percentage points on a constant-currency basis versus the comparable quarter last year.

Adjusted operating income for the division was $208 million, up 39.2% in constant currency. While the increase was
mainly due to equity earnings from ABC, excluding this, adjusted operating income grew by 7.6% in constant
currency.
As you know, we report our share of ABC's net earnings on a two-month lag. As a result, this was our first full quarter
of recognizing approximately 16% of ABC's net earnings.
In modeling ABC, remember that equity income related to our increased ownership from the August warrant exercise
will be reflected in only five weeks of the first quarter, due to the two-month reporting lag.
So now, let me turn to the full-year numbers for fiscal 2016. As I said at the beginning, this has been an outstanding
financial year, exceeding the upper end of our guidance. These results are, of course, not directly comparable with the
previous year due to the Alliance Boots transaction.
In summary, GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.82 was down 4.5%. This reflects a number of factors,
including the fluctuations in the ABC warrants and last year's non-cash gain relating to Alliance Boots.
On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 18.3% to $4.59. Adjusted effective tax rate, which we
calculate excluding the equity income from ABC, this was 25.4%. This was lower than we had anticipated when we
spoke to you last quarter.
Ignoring discrete tax items, our underlying adjusted effective tax rate would have been 26.3%. Discrete items of
approximately 0.9 percentage points, primarily included completion of certain U.S. tax audits and true-ups of prior-year
accruals.
The tax rate also reflects changes in the geographical mix of our pre-tax earnings and the U.S. taxation of our non-U.S.
entities.
Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $7.8 billion in the full fiscal year. Over the course of the year,
working capital reduced by $1.4 billion due to improved payables. Cash capital expenditure was $421 million in the
quarter and $1.3 billion in the full fiscal year.
During the year, we invested in key areas to develop our customer proposition, including investment in stores and the
U.S. beauty program, as well as upgrades to our IT systems, which we began earlier in the year.
Store investment included over 100 new openings in Mexico, which continues to be a focus area for expansion.
Overall, this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of $2.2 billion and $6.5 billion in the full fiscal year, a
year-on-year increase of $2.1 billion.
So turning now to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid; as announced on September 8, we remain actively engaged with
the FTC on its review. And today, we still expect that the most likely outcome will be that the parties will be required
to divest between 500 stores and a 1,000 stores.
We believe that we'll be able to execute agreements to divest these stores to potential buyers, pending FTC approval, by
the end of calendar year 2016. I now expect to close the acquisition in early calendar 2017.
Taking into account our current expectations of store divestitures, we continue to expect that the acquisition will be
accretive to adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year after closing. We also continue to expect that we
will realize synergies from the acquisition in excess of $1 billion to be fully realized within three to four years of
closing. These synergies have been updated where practicable and as previously disclosed, are expected to come
primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.
So turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017, we're expecting adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of
$4.85 to $5.20. This assumes Rite Aid accretion of $0.05 to $0.12, based on the assumptions that I just mentioned, and
on the continuation of our normal anti-dilutive buyback program relating to equity incentives, and in addition, this
guidance is based on current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year.

Please remember, sterling today is around 15% lower versus the dollar than our weighted average operating income
translation rate for fiscal 2016. This had an adverse impact on our guidance of around $0.13. In terms of phasing, the
timing and development of our recently announced new strategic pharmacy partnerships in the U.S. means that we
expect Retail Pharmacy USA script growth to be stronger than usual in the second half of the fiscal year. The new rates
come into effect on day one of the contracts, mainly around the end of the calendar year, while we believe that the
enhanced volumes will take some time to build.
Overall, we therefore expect Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins to continue to decline in the coming quarters, but
expect to see sales and profits for the year as a whole to continue to grow as the expected volumes come through from
our pharmacy contracts in the second half of the fiscal year.
So I'll now hand over to Stefano for his concluding comments.
Stefano Pessina
Thank you, George. As you have heard, this was a good quarter, despite both currency and operational challenges. It is
our fourth quarter in what I believe has been an extremely good year as a whole for the company. That said, the work
that we have been doing to control costs, reduce waste and return our business to a passive growth has been showing
market effects for some time.
For the past eight quarters in a row, we have grown our adjusted net earnings over the comparable prior period. In
fiscal 2014, if you make just basic adjustment trading that 55% of Alliances Boots not reflected in the historical
published results, we would have generated an estimated $3.9 billion of adjusted net earnings. As we reported $5
billion of adjusted net earnings in fiscal 2016, this could represent an increase of approximately 28% over the last two
fiscal years on a reported-currency basis. This is a compound annual growth rate of around 13%. It also represents an
annual increase of over 15% on a constant-currency basis.
In addition, we have delivered $10.9 billion of free cash flow over the same period. While I believe that this is
impressive by any measure, it is not solely due to the merger that created Walgreens Boots Alliance. We have
continued to see progressive operations grow across the company, which has been a significant driver of our strong
financial performance. This success has been achieved despite it having been a very busy time.
Let's take a moment to remind ourselves of everything we have achieved in the past year. In the U.S., we launched
significant initiatives to advance our retail and pharmacy offering. This included investing in the customer experience,
especially in beauty, to differentiate Walgreens as a retailer.
We also reset our relationship with healthcare payer and PBM, and worked to develop close partnership as a platform
for our future. Examples of these strategic partnership include our new 90-day prescription agreement with OptumRx
and EnvisionRx, our announced agreement with Express Scripts, and our innovative partnership with Prime
Therapeutics.
These close partnerships are central to our strategy of increasing volumes to our pharmacies and driving footfall to our
stores. We strengthened our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, exercising both tranches of warrants and extending
our pharmacy sale distribution and sourcing agreements.
This move further cement the strong and collaborative working relationship our companies have built together over the
past three years. Our pending acquisition of Rite Aid continues to progress, as George said.
Globally, we continue to expand our reach and presence in Russia, we divested our [ph] retail (24:01) business, and as
part of the deal, retained a strategic stake in the country's leading health and beauty retailer. And in South Korea, we
signed an agreement to form a franchise relationship with one of the country's leading retailers.
At the company level, we reached and surpassed our $1 billion synergies goal from the WBA merger and further
progressed cost saving goal of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal year 2017.

At the same time, we changed the roles and responsibilities of our senior management team to structure our leadership
more efficiently and move to operating a truly unified company.
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to face the same headwinds we encountered this year, but with some additional
factors that are going to slightly change the profile for the year.
We are entering a period where we need to consolidate much of the recent activities in the company. We must ensure
we are properly positioned to get the full benefit of our work to-date. As expected the volume increases from our new
commercial agreement begin to flow to our U.S. pharmacies and global procurement network.
Additional benefits will come as our retail transformation work accelerates and compounds the expected increase in
traffic that flows through our stores with this agreement. We therefore expect a different phasing for the year end, with
anticipated growth skewed significantly towards the second half of the year, but as you have heard from George, we are
expecting the year as a whole to continue our record of healthy growth.
We believe this phasing is a temporary phenomenon as we see our work to transform the company ahead and increase
the impact. Transformation and integration, if done properly, is never instant or easy but we are progressing well.
While we are delivering on the promises of the merger, we are also building strong foundation, based on establishing
an outstanding team and structuring our company for growth in the core business, especially Walgreens. We are doing
this without losing sight of the global opportunity, and are preparing the company to play an even greater role as
healthcare rewards in the U.S. and around the world.
Thank you. Now I will hand you back to Gerald.
Gerald Gradwell
Thank you, Stefano. Kevin, can we open the line for questions, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Willoughby>: Oh, hey, George. What clarity do you have now on the volumes slated to come in from
Prime and Express and United? I think you'd have to have a healthy degree of conservatism in the guidance not
knowing exactly how their selling seasons are going. And have you assumed any incremental volume coming through
to Rite Aid stores from these relationships?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: We obviously don't comment on individual contracts, but I think what we've tried
to indicate, as I said in my prepared comments, is that we expect the volume to increase in the second half of the year
as we look forward relative to the increase that we would anticipate in the first half, because it takes time for obviously
contracts to come through. And in terms of Rite Aid, obviously we cannot make comments at this point, as I'm sure
you'll appreciate.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi. Good morning, Bob. It's Alex here. We're obviously – we're really pleased to have
this volume coming through. The majority as, I think George has said, is coming through in early part of calendar year,
next year, apart from Tricare, which we expect to start to flow on November 1.
The teams have done a lot of planning here to make sure we take care of customers when they appear back in
Walgreens and sometimes new to Walgreens. And obviously as the year progresses, we'll be able to get a better feel on
our ability to both get customers back into Walgreens and hold on to them. And remember, many of these new
contracts are maybe narrow, but some are actually pretty broad. The Tricare contract, for example, still has the vast

majority of pharmacies in the U.S. in that contract. So we've been – what we think is a good estimate from what we
know into the forecast and if things change, as George has said, we'll update you.
<Q - Robert Willoughby>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Ross Muken>: Good morning, gentlemen. So I guess just maybe not specifics on sort of how gross margins in the
U.S. retail business are going to pace on a numerical basis, but more qualitatively? Obviously, you're getting a volume
pickup to get that and there's obviously reimbursement pressure in the market. So can you just help us in the phasing of
that relative to the procurement savings and then relative to the new beauty rollout to just so maybe qualitatively how
we should think about the different elements as they roll in, whether it's Tricare or it's these new PBM relationships?
And then offset by the front end, how we just should think about either the cadence or the other pushes and pulls
outside of that?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, Ross. This is Alex here. Yeah, we have a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to
deliver both these strategies. So the first one is speaking about is the new volume, where we are giving a better value to
volume that we believe that we've seen already with the Med D work in the past, that this is really accretive to our
model. And again, as I said, I think the previous question to Bob, most of these contracts start in January 1, so we'll see
the majority of the volume, as George has said, in the second half of our fiscal year, which I think starts in March of
next year. So that will start to build up.
And then we've built solid plans on what we know about the market and what our great partners who are helping us to
build this business have told us about their networks. And some of the selling season is happening right now. You'll see
some more of this being announced, particularly through Prime in the days and the weeks ahead.
On the front-end strategy, this is a multi-year, multi-phase approach. We've put 1,600 new beauty departments in the
ground. Not complete, but new in terms of the brands that George mentioned, particularly No7 and Soap & Glory this
phase, with new lighting and importantly upgraded training and development of our consultants to give the customers
the information they need. And this is in the ground based on the trials we did before.
The majority of this work will phase in over a two or three-year period in reality. But you should expect the ongoing
improvement to the margin, gross margins, throughout 2017, and in the years ahead.
Remember that we focus our business on the whole box. We focus our business on operating margin, including costs,
and of course, on adjusted net earnings. All of this work is designed to drive all elements of profitability within the box
of Walgreens, and we are very confident with what we're doing and the pace is accelerating.
<Q - Ross Muken>: I guess to that point, what I'm trying to get at is, should we think about on gross profit in more a
dollar growth basis versus a margin basis so long as it's accretive over time to kind of returns in the operating margin,
because the market's been a little bit myopic on the margin percentage overall, but obviously not everything you can do
to drive value will be necessarily gross margin accretive, correct?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: I think, I don't remember. Our big focus is on growing our operating income, our
overall income and our cash flow. So, in terms of reimbursement pressures, it's something that we've seen in the past,
it'll continue to happen. We've got to continue to drive efficiencies. It's got to be a way of life. So, really this is what
we're focusing on, on offering our customers a competitive offer and then being very financially disciplined in a way
that we can drive our overall shareholder value. So in terms of thinking about it, that's how I would really encourage
you to think. We're absolutely focused on our operating profit. That's what we're focused on in summary, yeah.

Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.
<Q - Brian Gil Tanquilut>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a question on your views on the supply chain. As we think
about potential pricing pressure in the drug world, whether it's government driven or just the pressures on the drug
manufacturers, how do you think that flows through to your business as we think about that flowing through the
distributors and the PBMs? I mean, what's your exposure in your minds to drug pricing pressure?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Hi, it's Alex here. Yeah, I mean I think we've spoken of this for, since we've really
been here with some experience from Europe, where reimbursement pressure really does come through the supply
chain. And in fact, you'll probably see if you read the UK papers this morning, the government's finally made their
announcements and confirmed what we expected was a supply chain pressure and reimbursement coming through in
the UK business as we planned for and as we expected. So we are quite used to this pressure.
And, again, if you think back to what Stefano and George have said, we are working really closely now with
AmerisourceBergen, they are proving to be strong partners to help us to not just improve our availability to make sure
we take care of customers, which is driving our volume, but to make sure we do that in a really efficient and integrated
and more integrated way going forward. So we feel confident that we can use our scale, use our partnerships, use our
knowledge and knowhow from Europe to be in a good position in what we expect to be continued supply chain
pressure.
<Q - Brian Gil Tanquilut>: Got it. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning. I just want to take an opportunity to go back to
the strategic partnerships that you talk about and just have a better understanding as to how it works contractually? If
we think about the fact that you've had PBM relationships with all of these parties in the past, how do we think about
those relationships compared to the new strategic relationships?
And what I'm trying to get at is that my understanding is that come January 1, the trade of the volume for the price has
to do with specifics around products on the maintenance side where you're getting people to a 90-day script. It's not
your overall PBM contract. But I just want a clarification to better understand that.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Lisa, this is really our strategy, it's always been our strategy. We want to partner with as many
people as possible, and when people understand this, they accept that we are on the market and we have to offer our
best services to everybody who is in the market. If you don't really accept, you as an operator of the market, if you don't
accept this concept of collaboration, sooner or later you are isolated and you cannot really exploit your potential at best.
So when we have announced some of these deals, of course, we have spoken to the other customers that we have, the
other PBMs, and we have explained which is our logic and we have explained that we are willing to help, to collaborate
with everybody and you have seen that in a few months we have been able to announce agreement, special
collaboration practically with most of the operators in the sector. This is a strategy, a strategy which has always worked
for us in the past, in other countries, and I believe will work also in the U.S.
Of course, as George said, every time that we do something new, every time that we propose a, let's say, an agreement
or taking to consideration an agreement which is proposed by one of our customers, we are running the numbers in a
very disciplined way, considering, of course, everything, considering the volume, considering the discounts,
considering what we can extract more from our suppliers if anything, considering the increased efficiencies of the
pharmacies, and then at the end we decide whether we can do this particular kind of deal or not.

And of course, we are very conscious that when we come with an innovative deal or with a partnership on the market,
we have to be prepared to offer similar things to other people. I believe that this is the beauty of being independent. We
can work with everybody and we can offer our services to everybody and we are not seen as particularly skewed
toward this or that player in the market.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay, great. And then if I can just follow up, when I think about your strategy, specialty is
clearly a big and growing area. Stefano, do you feel that you need to make an acquisition in the area of specialty to
continue to grow that business? Or do you feel that some of the partnerships that you have today, most recently Prime
and talking about making some investments around specialty there that, that will be enough?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: We believe that if we could improve our position in specialties through partnership, these
would be much more efficient and much more profitable because if we had to buy something in bulk, first of all, we
would have to buy something in the market, which is a potential for development. And now in this market, we see that
many people have an outlook, which is not particularly positive in our judgment, but first of all.
And secondly, this would be extremely expensive. And so again, we are very disciplined. We will not buy something
just because it's nice to have. We want to be sure that if we use our money, our money will have an important return, a
cash return, and we value all of what we do, not in terms of earnings per share, we value it in terms of IRR, in terms of
EVA, it terms of cash. Maybe, Alex, you want to add something about specialties?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, specifically on Prime, Lisa, I think this is a joint venture, which we will get done
in the first few months of next year. We have always had good relationship with Prime and the team at Prime through
Jim. And we're getting closer, which is fantastic. But fundamentally we're combining our central specialty and a joint
venture operational, so we use the efficiencies that we can bring together to the market, and we can buy better together
in that area as well.
So actually what we're doing here, and of course, by doing that, through the PBM, which is owned by the Blue through
Prime, we hope to be able to over time, when we get that efficiently in it, attract more patients and more customers, this
is a build out strategy. It's a classic example of [indiscernible] (41:45) sort of partnership approach that Stefano
described.
<Q - Lisa Christine Gill>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.
<Q - Michael Cherny>: Good morning, guys and thank you for all the details. So just a quick question I guess, on the
front-end retail side. You talked about some of the investments you're making in improving the beauty side in
particular. I don't know if you touched too much on the digital initiatives that you guys are pursuing? Can you maybe
talk about the success you've had so far as you expand areas around the loyalty card and other digital marketing
initiatives? And then if you can, any incremental plans you have in terms of targeting improved areas on a go-forward
basis?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Sure, Michael, yeah. I think, as we said before, and I think as people know, we've had
a successful digital team in action for seven years I think now, and really quick fill continues for refilling prescriptions
continues to be a breakthrough app that we continue to develop along with the mobile app, which we continue to
develop to make it absolutely fit for the modern customer and we continue to get the CSAT scores the team frankly
deserves, and it's a great platform for us.
We obviously transformed the photography business here in the U.S., and through that approach a couple of years ago,
and we've transferred our knowledge to Europe as well. So where to next, which I think is your question. Well, we
closed down operations for beauty and drugstore.com. That's been done successfully. I mean I started to focus really on
the retail product business. We announced last Monday, order online, collect from store or ship to store in 7,600

drugstores, including Duane Reade, a model we successfully built in, again, the Boots business. The sharing of
knowledge between the front-end in the UK is a really important part of our journey here.
So we continued to invest behind the digital team. They are a very strong team, in my view; very impressive team. And
we are very confident with the platforms we have and know-how we have, and now we are focusing back on
Walgreens health and beauty strategy, particularly in the front end, to become the integrated omni-channel retailer.
We have a lot of room to grow. And while the risks are very clear, we understand the risks very well. We believe with
the eight corners across America and this capability, we are pretty well positioned.
<Q - Michael Cherny>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning and thank you. My first question is on Rite Aid. Obviously
divesting the Rite Aid stores have been taking longer than expected, yet you did include the Rite Aid accretion in your
guidance. So, what gives you confidence in an early 2017 close?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Rite Aid, yes. I agree with you that it is taking more than we expected, but I have to tell you
that as you have seen from our presentation and from the fact that we have included some part of our Rite Aid potential
profit now in our guidance, from this you can really understand that we are confident, as confident as we were before
about this deal.
Nothing has changed. We have just delayed the execution of the deal. This is our perception. We have always been
optimistic because we have never seen an attitude from the FTC, which was absolute negative. Of course they were
inquiring. They were very detailed. They were asking a lot of questions. Sometimes they were taking time to respond,
but at the end of the day, I believe we have had a good collaboration. We are having a good collaboration. We tried to
respond to all of their needs. This takes time, but at the end we are still confident.
Of course, I know that we read on the papers very different news. No idea about the sources of this news, but for sure if
we could talk, and of course you know that we cannot, our news would be different. For what we see today, we see just
a long administrative process, but we don't see substantial differences from what we were expecting.
Yes, probably more stores, a little more stores here and there, but at the end of the day, as far as I can see today, as far
as we can see today, we are absolutely confident that we can create – that we can do the deal and we can create the
value, just this value would be a little postponed on time because even when we would do the deal, of course for the
first month, we will not be able to start immediately the synergies, it will take some time, and we were hoping to do the
deal at the beginning of this fiscal year for us, in this case we would have had time to develop some of the synergies. Of
course, if we close the deal relatively late in our fiscal year, the synergies will be small, but we will find all of them
next year.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is about the PBM contracts that you
signed. When we think about the partnerships, in aggregate, they manage more than 50% of the U.S. script market
versus your share that's a little bit below 20%. When we think about the opportunity from a long-term perspective, how
much incremental share do you think that you can gain through these relationships? I mean when we look at CVS, we
estimate that their share with their maintenance choice accounts at retail is about 33% versus the 20% national share.
So, is this a good goalpost for us to use when we think about this opportunity and the returns over the longer term?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Ricky, it's Alex here again. Yeah. We don't really [indiscernible] (49:03) what we're
focused on is two elements of growing our business, one which we've seen in the last period, which is a combination of
access through Med D, that channel grows, it's a growing channel, but really through delivering for customers. Our
customers experience goals in our pharmacies have moved and a big credit to Richard Ashworth and all of the teams
involved and Brad because that really has been a big shift in how we've been able to take care of our customers in our

pharmacies. That really has been a driver of the recent share you've seen in the past, and we'll be completely focused on
continuing to do that.
And secondly, as Stefano so well put, we want to make sure that the people who are paying for these prescriptions, both
customers and payers, we just make sure we get the right understanding of what they want from the networks that we're
in and that's what we're trying to do in different ways. And we have all sorts of different ways as we're demonstrating
of getting that done.
So, we do it really customer-by-customer and payer-by-payer, and also network-by-network to make sure that we can
grow our business. And we're early in this strategy, Ricky, to be honest, we're early in this strategy, and we're still
learning how to really drive this and make it work. And we remain confident that we'll learn a lot this year with the
ambitions we have, and analyze to have access back into Walgreens that didn't have access before. And again, we'll
continue to re-evaluate internally our goals going forward.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you. And lastly, does the new terms of Express had any impact on the
margins in the fourth quarter or it's all in fiscal year 2017?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Could you repeat? Sorry. [indiscernible] (50:51)
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, so the Tricare contract, as you know, is the one that we declared and that starts
December 1 [indiscernible] (51:02) 2017. Yeah.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: But for the rest of the Express books, assuming that that has been re-priced as well, so
did you see any impact on that in your fourth quarter results? Or is this all going to be in fiscal year 2017, outside
Tricare.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Ricky, as you know, we agree what we disclose with our partners very carefully, and
we haven't disclosed anything outside of Tricare, so we can't disclose anything else this morning.
<Q - Ricky R. Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Stefano and George. So just a question or two on the
Medicare margins. It seems like with Medicare becoming a bigger part of your mix, I mean, I guess there was some
noise in the channel about maybe some Medicare gross margins compressing as calendar 2016 was progressing for the
industry and we're kind of seeing that in your U.S. gross margin as well, so kind of look at the progression
year-over-year.
So I guess I'm wondering, first, are you seeing any fall off in Medicare gross margins as calendar year 2016 is
progressing, or have they remained fairly stable? And then also, just – is it maybe just a mix issue where if Medicare is
a bigger part of your mix, we're just seeing our Medicare gross margins maybe lower than commercial gross margins? I
just wanted to sort of just tackle those two angles on the U.S. gross margins. Thanks.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, hi. It's Alex again. Yes, Steve. As stable the margin as we expected, clearly there
is pressure in the margin in Med D because the volume is growing, but it's stable as we expected. And the mix, as you
can see in our bigger business is shifting. So therefore that's what's driving the further pressure on the margin.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. So if some companies were seeing that pressure maybe as the year is progressing,
you're saying that you are not seeing any material fall off in just your Medicare margin as the year is progressing?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: That's correct. I mean, there is the trend [ph] down way (53:07) year after year on these
annual contracts, but the trend is not any greater than it was in the past, and it is as we expected.

Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I'm going to pull a little bit
further on Steve's thread here. Alex, if we think about the business and you guys talk about the EBIT margin and the
kind of continued pressure there. I guess, can you separate the payer pressure and kind of the underlying pressure on
the business versus the impact of mix, the move to 90-day, the new relationships with PBMs to take share? I guess
what I'm trying to get is a better understanding of what is actual pressure on the business? And what is the margin
change as a reflection of mix? And even digging into that further, how much of that is by the company's design versus
how much of it is the design of payers pushing down on you guys?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, I mean, I would say that, as a company, we now actively manage both these
elements; I think as George described really well in the script on the front end, we're actively managing the seasonal
categories, some historic stock, and also we're managing out of some product lines, particularly again, in the
consumables and seasonal lines which as we manage more into giving more space as appropriate over time to health
and beauty, the biggest example being creating space for 1,600 stores for extending beauty ranges. So we are actively
managing that. We're managing, again, as we said, operating margin level, maybe [indiscernible] (54:48) through a box
and to answer the question on reimbursement pressure, again, we're actively managing it.
We've spoken very clearly that we recognize and predict the trend. We start conversations much earlier and much more
strategically with payers, a big callout to Brad and the team from – Rick know this strategy, we do this very actively
now to understand how we can help them grow and help ourselves grow, and we're very confident that we can grow,
particularly when you look at adjusted operating profit within the box, taking both these parts. So I don't think we can
say any more than that, to be honest. Because obviously we keep these things tight within the business for obvious
reasons but we are actively managing it. That's what we do. That's what we're paid to do, to be honest.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. And then maybe a quick follow up, as one large payer Caremark is noticeably absent
from the deals that you guys have signed recently. I guess can you talk to us about when the current contract with them
runs through and I guess, how we should think about how you will pursue kind of the next renewal of the Caremark
payer arrangement? Thank you.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, we can't speak about the contract of any of our big payers, so we can't talk about
obviously for obvious reasons, but we'll pursue it in exactly the same way that Stefano has described. We want to
operate with everyone in the marketplace in a way that works for them and works for us.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. On the cost savings program, George, last year
you shared where you ended the year on the SG&A savings, which I believe was $775 million. I know you said you're
well on track to achieve the $1.5 billion by the end of 2017, but can you maybe just share with us where you actually
ended the year on that program in 2016? And then I guess along those lines, beyond the $1.5 billion, are there any other
major areas of further cost savings that you guys have been able to identify?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Thanks, Robert. On the program, overall, as I've said, we're very much on track
overall. The big change really from where we were a year ago has really been that we were able to deliver this for $300
million less than we previously anticipated, of which quite a portion of that will be through cash savings, so we're very

pleased that we've been able to – we're able to do this and we're very much on track to complete the program next year.
It's very much a defined program with a start and a finish. But, of course, there are always ways to drive efficiency. It's
just a way of life for us. We're looking at it every day across all aspects of our business, and we'll continue to drive to
do that. And clearly some of the investment that you're seeing in capital in some of the areas like IT will take us a little
bit of time to get some of the new systems in place, that will further enable us to both drive efficiencies and to manage
the business in an increasingly more tighter way.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And next year, of course, we will have the big task of extracting value from Rite Aid. This
would be another huge opportunity for saving costs.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: No, that's very helpful. So I guess just one other one around SG&A. You guys talked
about the beauty initiative. Can you maybe just help us frame the investment needed to achieve that roll out, just trying
to think about on the model SG&A within the retail USA segment as a percent of sales in 2017 maybe relative – on the
core business relative to what we saw in 2016, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: It's Alex here. I can't give you the specifics, but what I can say is that taking workload,
particularly out of our 8,200 drugstores is a big part of the cost program. And I said already on the call that we're very
pleased with the progress we've made on our internal measure, independent internal measure to be honest on customer
care where it has really moved forward despite the fact that we've held costs in the drugstores more or less flat this
year. So we are very confident that we can move that cost to give better advice and care, as George described in the
beauty model, and that will drive incremental sales and, of course, better margins for us as we see in the trials. So we're
very focused, as George said, on costs. But we're also very focused on reinvesting that cost back where customers
appreciate it.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Just to remind Bob, and as I said in the presentation there, our SG&A in the USA
as a percent of sales fell 0.9 percentage points and I think that's the best evidence, really, of what we're delivering. And
just to add to the question on capital, I haven't obviously given any specific guidance on capital for fiscal 2017, but in
terms of thinking, I would expect it to be a little bit higher than we've seen in fiscal 2016, which is really reflecting
some of the initiatives that we got to develop the offer that we talked about, as well as the investment in the new IT that
we're working on.
<Q - Robert Patrick Jones>: Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator
Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Thank you. So on the Rite Aid accretion number, I understand that you're not including a lot of
synergy here and that will come over time, and it looks like this is going to represent about seven months of this fiscal
year. It still looks quite low relative to the run rate of Rite Aid and what we might have thought accretion would run.
So, can you speak to, is this a fairly conservative number? I know there's a wide range of potential stores. I get that the
indication of confidence is really step one here, but any comments on that number itself?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: This is our view of it, which is why we've included our accretion. It's built on our
economics, which is the way we've built the model up. And really to emphasize a little bit on what Alex just said, the
synergy – Stefano was saying, synergies will take some time to come through. As ever when we approach a merger like
this, our focus is always on the customer first to make sure that we deliver for the customer through this period, and
we've got a very detailed plan to deliver the synergies. But as we said, this will take three to four years. The important
thing is to go in a straight line. But it does very much reflect our view on the timing and the time it will take to start to
deliver the synergies.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: If I can give you an indication, this is Stefano, normally I don't speak about this specific case,
but normally when we have done a big merger, we have started to deliver the synergies after five, six months,
something because the first months, of course, you can do something, but the first months are really needed to prepare

the plan and we cannot accelerate the plan. We cannot do the plan now. We are working on integration, but we cannot
do the plan for the synergies now, because we don't know the numbers of Rite Aid, as you know, we are not allowed to
see their numbers. And so, in reality, we cannot put together the plan.
As soon as we will know their numbers, we will have done the deal, we will start to put in place a plan, which will take
a few months, and after we will execute the plan. This is why it's still skewed, they say, at the end of the first year, the
first year of the merger, of any merger, not just this one.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Okay. So we have your best estimate there. And then for this fiscal year, I know Alex, you
mentioned earlier some of the cuts that we've seen potentially in the UK, I know there was a 6% cut that was delayed
earlier. Was your comment around that cut actually being put into place? And maybe equally important, George, is that
in the expectation for fiscal year 2017?
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: Yeah, that was my comment, and I think it has been – I'm certain as we announced this
morning, we had it this morning from the UK and George will – I can confirm also it's in the guidance, yeah.
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Absolutely, it's in our guidance. [ph] David (63:48) made the announcement just a
few hours ago, just orally, but it was very consistent with what we had been anticipating, so no surprises there.
<Q - Eric Percher>: Perfect. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thank you. Curious if, George, if you could outline at all some cornerstones of how we should
think about how the U.S. retail profit path should work going forward? Obviously you've got these new partnerships
and you've outlined how that might influence gross margin and volume in 2017. But looking over the next handful of
years, it would be just helpful to understand the walk of what the expectation might be in terms of either sales growth
or profit growth, just to have some metrics to think about in regards to that, outside of acquisitions but just within the
core business what you're envisioning and how you're – what goals you're running the business to achieve.?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Well, I think the overall goal, obviously, as we've said is to focus on our operating
income and cash flow. In terms of thinking, as we've tried to sort of shape, you should think as we develop the new
partnerships that we are able to build our pharmacy, our pharmacy volume, and as we've said, we expect that to be – the
growth to be faster in the second half of the year. And you can think then about taking that beyond as the new – as we
said, a lot of the new partnerships coming around the end of this calendar, beginning of the next calendar.
There is obviously then the function of your views on inflation and then on mix and, of course, with a very different
profile in somewhere like our central specialty versus our core pharmacy. There's an element of mix, comes through
there. And that will obviously change over time, and then on – but we will continue to see the reimbursement pressures
that are just very much a way of life.
In terms of retail, a lot of our focus has been on developing the offer, as Alex has said, both in terms of the actual offer
in store, our own brands, the leading U.S. brands, what we're doing on omni-channel. And so a lot of our focus has
been on working our way through getting ready for that. You should start to see the benefits of that coming through
over time. Focus being on the offer over time, then we believe we'll be able to grow but we're looking to grow in the
right categories, which is very important and so mix is very important, and we know mix is important way of managing
the margin, the gross margin, in the retail products part of the U.S. business.
And so we'd expect to see the benefits of that coming through over time. And then on costs, as we say, as we drive
efficiency, then we are certainly very focused on continuing to improve our cost ratios, our SG&A as a percentage of
sales is a key area of focus. And again, we would be seeking to see that progressing. So these really are the core drivers
of what should drive the profit. I'm particularly talking obviously Retail Pharmacy USA here.

<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And so within that, and I appreciate all of those core drivers and how dynamic it is, but what
we'd be curious to know is, in terms of what you're shooting for this to achieve in terms of operating profit growth from
this, is this – and again, I understand there's a lot of moving parts, but is the goal of this, this is a mid-single digit
operating profit growth or an upper single digit operating profit growth over the next three to five years not necessarily
the second half of 2017?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Our overall growth is really as we target is really is in terms of generating profit as
the goal we really talked about just this time a year ago of from our underlying activities to seek to drive by profit
around the double-digit level and assuming there are no extraneous factors.
So I mean, currency would be a good example of an extraneous factor where there's not a lot we can do on currency
translation, it can go one way one year, another way, the other year. But fundamentally that's what we're focused on is
driving profit and then from core activities and then obviously doing shareholder enhancing transactions periodically
like the Rite Aid deal. And also, at the same time, we're very focused on, I know it's a little old-fashioned, but we're
very focused on cash flow because cash flow is an engine for growth in the long term. You see we've made good
progress on working capital this year and this really lets us invest, it lets us invest over time in M&A, and it enables us
to continue to drive shareholder value.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: And we have said in our presentation, in constant currency in the last two years, we have
delivered a compound growth of more than 15% in earnings on a comparable basis. So this is independent on the
acquisition of AB because we have restated pro forma. This is independent on the number of shares. Practically, we
have not had any acquisition in the meantime, excluding AB – or an acquisition we have contributed much in the last
two years. And we have also divested some things.
So the real growth, the underlying growth of our company in the last two years has been 13%, if we consider the effect
of the devaluation of the pound sterling, more than 15% in constant currency. And we have always said that we can
deliver underlying low double-digit growth, and this is what we are doing. And this is what we are focused on.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yeah, thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of questions to clarify, in the guidance for
fiscal 2017, can you give us a sense on where we should think about a tax rate for the year? Particularly as we think
about the Rite Aid business coming on, should we expect that as a U.S. business to bring the tax rate up slightly? Also,
Alex, you talked about minimizing – or someone talked about minimizing the tobacco footprint in the stores. How
much of a headwind may have that caused in foreign sales and should we think about that type of headwind that could
cause as you continue to minimize that going forward?
<A - George Rollo Fairweather>: Okay. I'll take the tax one first and then I'll let Alex take the second one. In terms of
tax, we've obviously not given specific guidance for fiscal 2017 on tax, but in terms of thinking about it, if you strip out
the discrete items as I talked about last year, then our real underlying tax pre-Rite Aid last year was – our underlying
tax last year was 26.3% on an adjusted basis. That's obviously excluding the ABC income, because of course that gets
reported on a post-tax basis.
So it's quite – in terms of modeling, we always model and think about it the way I've just described, excluding ABC. If
you think of that 26.3%, then excluding Rite Aid, that's a fairly good proxy for what it should be going forward because
pre-Rite Aid the mix will be broadly the same.
In terms of Rite Aid, you're absolutely right. With Rite Aid, as the proportion of profit increases from the Rite Aid deal
once we're able to complete it, then we will see a higher portion of profit here in the USA, and of course here the tax
rates are higher than in most parts of Europe where the rest of the business operates, but of course, this year, given the

accretion that we've indicated, that will be a relatively modest impact.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: And Charles, it's Alex here. On the tobacco, the tobacco comments that George made
in his script, so we'll continue to obviously minimize and reduce visibility to tobacco in our drugstores, but more
importantly, we'll continue to help customers to stop smoking through the various platforms, smoking cessation
platforms and pharmacies online and with our key suppliers that we've put in place. For example, Balance Rewards for
healthy choices, that's one example. But you should expect that we'll continue to see reducing sales in tobacco category
in Walgreens going forward.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: And are you going to be able to quantity sort of what that headwind is as we think about that?
Or can you talk about how much the category in sales has been for you historically? I know CVS put out a number of a
couple of billion a few years back.
<A - Alexander W. Gourlay>: I'm sorry. Beyond the market data that's available, we can't get that number, and as I
said before, it's an effect of the market as well as effect of what we're doing. So we're just stating what we're doing and
as I said also, we'll give you more updates.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Clear. And if I could just add one follow up on Rite Aid again. In terms of the divestiture
package, obviously a lot of noise, people making comments here and there. How flexible is this package as you think
about the stores that you're looking to or willing to divest? Is this one where you have flexibility in terms of shaping the
portfolio to be able to satisfy not only FTC but potential buyers?
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Well, Stefano here. We are not able to give these details. First of all, I repeat again, we don't
know in detail all the data of Rite Aid, and it's early time for us to take these decisions. And after, of course, even if we
knew them, we could not disclose them. So, it's too early. In a few months probably we will be able to discuss about
this.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Stefano Pessina>: Thank you very much.
