Good morning, and thanks for your interest in Lowe's.
Let me start by expressing our sympathy to those impacted by the devastating storms in Oklahoma and throughout the
Midwest and Plains. Our team members stand ready to assist the affected communities in the days and weeks ahead and
as we've done in the past when natural disaster strikes, Lowe's stores around the country as well as lowes.com will

Following my remarks, Rick Damron will review our operational performance in the quarter and Bob Hull will review
our financial results in detail.
But first, one housekeeping note. For the first time, we're providing slides on our Investor Relations website to
supplement our call. We encourage you to download the slides to facilitate your review of our results and to use as a
reference document following the call.
Now for some highlights of the first quarter. Our plan assumed normal weather based on historical multi-year averages,
but as you know, temperatures were cooler and precipitation greater than normal for much of the quarter resulting in a
delayed spring selling season. As a result, comparable sales for the quarter were negative 0.7% driven by a decrease in
comp transactions.
The month of March was particularly soft with a roughly 10% comp decline but April improved significantly resulting
in positive comps of approximately 10%. We have maintained that positive comp momentum through the first few
weeks of May, and I'd like to thank our employees for their hard work and continued dedication to serving customers.
For the first quarter, 7 of 12 product categories had positive comps. As you might expect, seasonal categories, such as
lawn and garden and seasonal living, fell short of our expectations. In fact, comps for indoor products were positive
approximately 3% while comps for outdoor products declined approximately 7%.
Our West division, particularly the upper Northwest and California, delivered the strongest performance in the quarter,
but we also saw strength along the Gulf Coast. While weather was certainly more cooperative in those regions of the
country, they are also benefiting from sustained demand created by the housing recovery. We continue to benefit from
Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts in the Northeast, and our Pro Services business outperformed the company average.
Gross margin expanded 10 basis points in the first quarter. While our Value Improvement Program contributed to sales
and gross margin, the delayed spring impact impacted the full realization of the benefits we expected. We continued to
effectively control expenses in the quarter and delivered earnings per share of $0.49.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the first quarter we repurchased $1 billion of
stock and repaid $178 million in dividends.
The team continues to focus on improving our core business through cross-functional collaboration and consistent
execution, in-store and across other selling channels. One proof point is our level of preparedness for the spring selling
season, the result of a more coordinated planning effort. The organization worked together to build store-level
inventory earlier in the season to create a compelling marketing campaign from messaging to signage to promotional
events, and to ensure that staffing levels were adequate and timely. We rolled our spring plans by climatic zone in an
effort to match resources to spring's expected arrival across the country.
In addition to a more coordinated planning effort, we're diligently working on value improvement. The goal is to
enhance line designs and maintain better in-stock positions, as well as simplify deal structures that allow us to offer
competitive prices every day. We're also leveraging compelling displays and enhanced merchandising flexibility from
our product differentiation program.
Finally, in the first quarter, we made an incremental investment in store labor during peak weekday hours to increase
the proportion of selling hours relative to tasking, and began to address the weekday close rate opportunity that we've
previously identified.
Now, looking at the balance of the year from an economic perspective. The housing market continues to show
convincing signs of life. However, growth in other key indicators, particularly employment, slowed in the first quarter.
We expect growth to remain modest through mid-year as consumers adjust to higher taxes and the fiscal drag
intensifies. However, we do expect that the lagged effect of recent gains in housing will benefit home-improvement
demand as the year progresses.

The macroeconomic transition from recovery to sustainable expansion, together with our initiatives in improving
operational collaboration, give us confidence in our business outlook for 2013. Bob will share those details in a few
minutes.
Thanks again, for your interest, and I'll now turn it over to Rick.
Ricky D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. During my time, I will provide some additional product and geographic
color surrounding our results, and update you on our additional investment in weekday selling hours and our Value
Improvement program.
As Robert pointed out, our indoor products, accounting for approximately two-thirds of our first-quarter business,
comped roughly 1,000 basis points higher than our outdoor products. We performed particularly well in large-decor
products. Well-designed promotions, along with the introduction of the LG line, drove strong comps and margin-dollar
growth in kitchens and appliances. Flooring benefited from strength in hardwoods, laminates and ceramic tile, which
finished a Value Improvement reset last year, introducing trend-relevant designs including larger sizes, rectangular
formats and wood plank looks.
We also saw solid positive comps in interior products within core categories such as plumbing, millwork, paint, tools,
lumber, building materials, hardware and fashion electrical. Many products benefited from improved line designs and
deeper inventory in key items after having completed their Value Improvement resets.
Strength in these products is also consistent with strong performance in our Pro Services business, which continued to
out-comp our DIY business, especially within higher tickets, as we continue to apply a particular focus on building
stronger relationships with our largest pro customers, both in-store and through our field-based Pro Services team.
While we had solid performance from our indoor products, our outdoor products did not meet our expectations. We
were well prepared for the spring selling season, but we expected the season to be normal in terms of timing,
precipitation and temperature. We built seasonal inventories earlier and deeper in our stores, to be fully prepared
whenever spring arrived, particularly in products such as mowers, string trimmers, grills and fertilizers. We also added
seasonal labor to the stores and staged Spring Black Friday events by three climatic zones, just in advance of the
expected arrival of spring in each of these zones.
At the beginning of the quarter, we expected headwinds from the unusually warm and dry conditions experienced in
last year's first quarter. However, this year it was colder and wetter than expected throughout the Northeast, Southeast,
Midwest and Plains states, which we estimate further impacted our comps by nearly 200 basis points. In fact, in areas
where conditions were more favorable; such as the West Coast, Texas Gulf Coast and Florida; we recorded solid
positive comps.
In the Northeast, the negative impact of weather was somewhat offset by sales associated with Superstorm Sandy
recovery efforts, which aided first quarter comps by approximately 45 basis points, down from 70 basis points in the
fourth quarter, but consistent with our expectations. Approximately 27 stores have seen a prolonged surge in demand as
they meet the recovery needs of the most severely impacted communities.
Three categories, comprised mostly of outdoor products, drove our negative comps for the quarter. Lawn and garden
was double-digit negative and seasonal living; which includes grills, patio and seasonal cooling; was high single-digit
negative. Lower lawn mower sales drove low single-digit negative comps in the outdoor power equipment category.
These categories recorded strong comps in April and also thus far in May.
In the second quarter we expect to recover most of the outdoor sales we missed in the first quarter due to unfavorable
weather conditions. As you think about the types of sales we will recover, it is helpful to divide our outdoor products
into two groups. The first includes products that can only be used within a narrow window of time when weather is
favorable: pre-emergent fertilizers and spring flowers for example.

The second group includes products that customers will want to use throughout the spring and well into the summer
months. Examples include grills and patio furniture. Customers will be willing to buy these products as long as enough
time remains during the summer to enjoy them. Most of our outdoor products fall into the second category. With the
entire summer ahead of us and the improvement in weather we have seen in recent weeks, we expect to recoup a
significant amount of outdoor sales in the second quarter.
As Greg discussed last quarter, there is a gap between the percentage of customers who know what they want to
purchase when they visit our stores and our close rate. We are addressing this opportunity to improve close rate by
investing in more customer facing hours during peak weekday times and through our Value Improvement program. We
have added an average of 150 hours per week to the staffing model for nearly two-thirds of our stores, entirely apart
from our typical seasonal staffing increase. Previously weekday labor hours were heavily skewed towards tasking and
we have identified an opportunity to better serve customers and close more sales during those hours by increasing the
assistance available in our aisles.
We completed hiring of these part-time employees in the first quarter. As these employees progress up the learning
curve, we expect these hours to contribute to sales growth. We will continue to monitor the performance of this
program and make adjustments as necessary.
The value improvement program remains our most important 2013 initiative. Through this initiative we are improving
our line designs, making them more relevant to each of the markets we serve, easier for our customers to shop and
more efficient for our associates to maintain. This includes reducing duplication of features and functions within price
points and reinvesting inventory to increase in-stock levels, especially in key high velocity items customers expect us to
have on hand, including job lot quantities needed to complete large projects.
We are also working to lower unit costs by reducing funds set aside by vendors for promotional and marketing support
and by negotiating lower first costs. We continue to make progress. At the end of the first quarter we have completed
resets representing over half of our business. Examples of resets completed in the first quarter include seasonal
products like planters, patio furniture and grills and year-round products like kitchen cabinets and garage door openers.
We expect to finish the initial round of resets in 2013.
As Greg mentioned last quarter, the financial benefit of Value Improvement is greatest once we have reached
stabilization, that is when we are past clearance and selling only new assortments. We estimate that roughly 30% of our
product lines were at this stage in the first quarter. We continue to expect average mid-single-digit comps and roughly
100 basis points of margin improvement rate for product lines that have reached stabilization. From an operational
perspective, these resets are now flowing across our stores with minimal disruption.
Greg and I are committed to continuous learning and collaboration and we expect the same from our organizations. As
we monitored the execution of Value Improvement resets during the first half of last year, we identified opportunities
to minimize disruption by managing the reset process at a more granular level. We now plan the clearance of old
inventory, the arrival of new inventory, the arrival of displays and signage on a store-by-store basis versus at a regional
level.
And before we proceed with any reset, a team, including members merchandising, store operations and logistics meet
to ensure to all elements of the reset are ready. If not, we delay the reset until they are. These steps have helped us to
eliminate out of stocks and minimize disruption in our stores.
As you can see, our commitment to continuous learning and collaboration supports our focus on increasing close rates.
We expect to get better every day at meeting customers' needs through improved service and product offerings, which
is why we have added customer facing hours during peak weekday times and we continue to enhance our product
assortments through our Value Improvement program. We look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming
quarters.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's, and I will now turn it over to Bob.

Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.
Sales for the first quarter were $13.1 billion, which represents a decrease of 0.5% from last year's first quarter. Comp
sales were negative 0.7%. Comp transactions were negative 3.7%, while comp average ticket was up 3.1% to last year.
As you heard from Robert, exterior categories were negatively impacted by weather early in the quarter, but began to
rebound as spring finally reached most of the country. In planning for the quarter, we expected a 300 basis point
headwind associated with last year's great spring weather, however, we estimate that the cooler and wetter spring this
year caused comps be almost 200 basis points below our expectation. This cooler, wetter weather impacted our
seasonal business, which was the driver of the negative comp transactions in the quarter.
Gross margin for the first quarter was 34.8% of sales, a ten basis point increase over last year's first quarter. The gross
margin increase was driven by Value Improvement, which helped gross margin by approximately 25 basis points. Our
estimate of the improvement nets the clearance impact of the reset against the benefit of the stabilized line. For the
quarter, the percentage of resets completed increased from 30% to 50%, which was consistent with our plan, while the
percentage of resets that reached stabilization increased from 20% to 30%.
The progress in completing resets was greater than product lines reaching stabilization as a result of the delayed spring.
The financial benefit of value improvement is greatest once we have reached stabilization. We are comfortable that
with recent trends, the percentage of stabilized resets will improve and we will achieve the anticipated margin
expansion for the year.
This improvement was offset by our proprietary credit value proposition, which negatively impacted gross margin by
approximately 20 basis points, or about ten basis points higher than we expected. This was driven by higher sales
penetration of our proprietary credit program, which reached 24.7% of sales, a 190 basis point increase over Q1 2012.
SG&A for Q1 was 24.62% of sales, which leveraged three basis points. While the leverage was modest, there are a
number of expense lines worth discussing. Casualty insurance leveraged 31 basis points as a result of favorable
actuarial adjustment. On our fourth quarter call, I shared three cost pressures in our 2013 plan, one of which was
casualty insurance. With this favorable adjustment, we now expect this item to be essentially flat to last year versus our
prior expectation of deleveraging ten basis points for the year.
Incentive compensation leveraged 19 basis points as sales and earnings came in below expectations compared with
higher attainment levels in last year's first quarter. Last year, we recorded $17 million in expense associated with the
voluntary separation program, resulting in 13 basis points of leverage this year. As Rick noted, in addition to the
normal spring hire we added incremental hours during peak weekday periods. As a result of the additional payroll and
delayed spring, store payroll deleveraged 30 basis points.
We also experienced deleverage in store repair and reset expenses of nine and five basis points respectively. The store
repair was driven by planned repair and maintenance activity, while the reset deleverage was caused by the higher
volume of resets relative to last year.
Depreciation for the quarter was $352 million, which was 2.69% of sales and leveraged 12 basis points as compared
with last year's first quarter, as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and taxes
increased 25 basis points to 7.49% of sales. Interest expense, at $113 million for the quarter, deleveraged eight basis
points to last year, as a percentage of sales, as last year's bond deal occurred in mid-April versus a full quarter's interest
expense this year. For the quarter, total expenses were 28.17% of sales and leveraged seven basis points.
Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 6.63% of sales. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.8% versus 38% for
Q1 last year. Earnings per share of $0.49 for the quarter represents a 14% increase over last year's $0.43.
Now, to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the
quarter was $1.1 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $10.3 billion increased $488 million or 5% over Q1 last
year. The increase is primarily attributable to delayed spring selling season. Inventory turnover, calculated by taking

the trailing four quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last five quarters, was 3.57 a decrease of 11
basis points from Q1 2012. Return on assets, determined using the trailing four quarters earnings divided by average
assets for the last five quarters, increased 23 basis points to 5.68%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $7 billion represents a slight increase over
Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable is lower than the 5% increase in inventory, which relates to the timing of
purchases in the quarter versus last year. At the end of the quarter, lease adjusted debt to EBITDA was 2.17 times.
Return on invested capital; measured using a trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest, divided by
average debt and equity for the last five quarters; increased 56 basis points for the quarter to 9.53%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, cash flow from operations was $2 billion, which was down 19% from Q1
2012 due to working capital. Capital expenditures were $196 million, a $141 million reduction from last year. As a
result, first quarter free cash flow of $1.8 billion was down 16% versus last year.
In February, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $1 billion of the company's
common stock. At this point, we expect to receive about 25.9 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be
determined upon completion of the program in the second quarter. Also in the first quarter, the company repurchased
approximately 300,000 shares of its common stock for $10 million through the open market. For the quarter, we
repurchased a little more than $1 billion. We have approximately $4 billion remaining on our share repurchase
authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to share our outlook for the year. In 2013, we expect total sales increase of approximately 4%,
driven by a comp sales increase of 3.5%, and the opening of approximately ten stores. For the fiscal year, we are
anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately 60 basis points. We expect the majority of the improvement in EBIT
will come from gross margin, majority meaning more than half, but not 100% or more of the 60 basis point
improvement. The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%.
For the year, we expect earnings per share of $2.05, which represents an increase of 21% over 2012. We're forecasting
cash flows from operations to be approximately $4 billion. The reduction relative to our prior outlook is due to higher
forecasted inventory at year end. The higher inventory levels relate to investments in target service levels. Our capital
plan for 2013 is approximately $1.2 billion. This results in estimated free cash flow of $2.8 billion for 2013.
Our guidance assumes approximately $3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2013, spread roughly evenly across the four
quarters. For the year, we expect lease adjusted debt to EBITDA will be at or below 2.25 times.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to get a little more detail on the comp trend. You said it got better and
May was similar to the April number. Does that mean it was actually at the April number or better or worse? Or do you
just think the trend is such that you're going to get that acceleration for the full quarter?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Greg, this is Bob. The May trends to date are approximately the same as what we've
experienced in April.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it. And then I wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the margin side of the equation.
Clearly, it looked like there was a little bit of delay in getting the Value Improvement in, but also some hit from mix
and some of the weather issues. Could you help us understand, that seasonal product that you missed, what does that do
to the mix? Is lawn and garden higher margin because, you know, the inventory – or help us out a little bit on that side?

<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Greg, I'll start. This is Greg with – Greg Bridgeford with val prop – I mean, the Value
Improvement impact. We completed the reset of about 80 categories in Q1 and as Bob detailed, that reset process
brought us to over 50% of the categories but with the weather impacts and a slow sales environment, many of those
categories that are seasonally oriented did not reach stabilization and therefore, move through their clearance inventory
so we could appreciate the margin gains from the new sets.
And so with that delay in weather, we saw the impact of the clearance obviously hit our margin line without a benefit
of having the lines reset and the margin accretion from the new cost structures and the new category set. So we
certainly have seen that turn around as the weather turns around so that gives us some confidence that we're going to
achieve our 100 basis points improvement after stabilization in categories in the mid-single-digit comps.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: And to follow on that, Greg, so if we think about the mix of products, mix had a slight negative
impact on margin for the quarter largely driven by lumber and the inflation we're seeing in that category resulted in it
being a greater proportion of our business relative to Q1 last year. The seasonal products themselves have a margin rate
consistent with the company average so it's not really a mix impact but as you think about the slowdown in March,
clearly the delay in clearing through the clearance activity therefore delaying the sale of products at full margin after
the reset. So we estimate that a combination of Value Improvement about a 10 basis points lower than our expectation,
and the value prop is another 10 basis points resulting in gross margin coming in about 20 basis points lower than our
expectations for the quarter.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Great. That's super helpful. And, Rick, just given the initiative to put those extra labor hours
during the week, did you at least get the close rate up as expected even if you didn't have the traffic given the weather?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah, Greg, I'll answer that in two ways. One is we – as we put the incremental stacking
labor into the weekday teams, we approached that in the same way we did the spring Black Friday events by going by
climatic zones, so in the Southern markets where those hours were implement first, we were able to get the teams on
board, get them through the training required to be as efficient and effective as we like to see. We saw better results
there than we did as we moved farther north later in the quarter with finalizing the implementation of those hours in
early April in the Northern markets.
So as we progressed up the climatic zones, we did see improvement there. If you look at overall close rate, it was
basically flat to last year due to a lot of the mix issues we saw with seasonal inventory typically driving a higher close
rate in the spring selling months than our interior categories.
So while I'm looking at that, I'm very comfortable with results that we saw even though the close rate remained flat for
the quarter because of the timing of those resets or the timing of the seasonal business and the close rates that
historically come with those.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Okay. Let's put a little color, Greg, on Rick's remarks. When with seasonal business we do
find that to be more of a destination shopper for items like bedding plants, fertilizers, grass seed, soil amendments, and
so that is – you do see stronger close rates so as the weather didn't improve in some of the Northern regions, that's
where, as Rick described, we didn't see the close rate improvement but where we did see the weather improve, we're
seeing improvement.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Greg.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Two questions if I could. The first revolves around the resets
and that's just getting clarity on when you expect those lines to cross, i.e., the progress starting to outpace the
disruption. And I guess related to that on this topic, you talked about a couple categories that have been through resets

like paint and millwork and you talked about a 500 basis point delta versus the company average. I think those comped
more in line with the chain this quarter so I'm not sure if there's anything in particular that weighed on those. Now that
we have some categories done, I just want to make sure that we can align sort of the expectation with reality and make
sure that those synch up.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Matt, this is Greg. As Bob described, our expectations post-reset is 100 basis points
improvement impact by category. So what we have seen, and this is really important, is as we've seen weather improve
and we see some of these seasonal categories that were reset and completed the reset in Q1 but hadn't stabilized, we're
beginning to see the impact of that. We're seeing the basis point improvement that we expected to see and as Bob said
our expectation was 10 points higher from the impact of the stabilized categories from a margin impact.
So that's our expectation moving forward. That's a sequential increase over where we have been seeing and that's the
kind of progress that we're expecting to make as we move through to see more categories stabilize, at roughly 30%
right now and we're seeing – we expect to have all categories stabilize by the end of the year.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: So is this is sort of – you think – sorry. Go ahead.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: I would add one thing to Greg's comments as it relates to the sales aspect of the categories,
particularly in paint. I think you look at paint with the same phenomenon as you did seasonal with the mix of interior
and exterior paints making up the driver of the average performance. You see the same relationship in paint as you saw
the rest of the categories with the interior paint categories far outpacing the performance of the exterior categories due
to the unseasonable weather.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. That's very helpful. So is it like kind of third quarter or fourth quarter when you
actually start to see this being a firmer gross margin driver across the business?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yes. So we do expect gross margin to improve throughout the course of the year. As we talked
about, we're at roughly 30% stabilization. As stabilization improves, we'll see improved margins throughout the course
of the year.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yes. Matt, we expect to see the impact of a clearance inventory taper down as we move
through the third quarter into the fourth quarter.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And just a quick follow-up for Bob. We've seen a little bit of volatility on the depreciation
line and I know it's not kind of a focus on the operating front but the Q4 to Q1 move was pretty dramatic. What kind of
number would you expect see for the year that's depreciation on the P&L. Is this a good base to build off of? Or should
that number still be bouncing around little bit.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: The movement you see in depreciation is largely just timing of assets brought on board, so
depreciation from those, if you think about the shorter duration IT equipment, adding some offset and really more than
offset by assets becoming fully depreciated, if you think back to a number of years ago when we were opening up 150
stores when CapEx was north of $4 billion, we've got some of those assets becoming fully depreciated which causes
some of that quarter-to-quarter volatility. I think the run rate that we saw in Q1 or a little bit higher than that because of
the assets being added this year is probably a good number to use.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: So if last year the average through the year was something in the 375, 380 per quarter run
rate, we're at 350 this quarter, it sounds like somewhere in between those two numbers on a quarterly basis?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: I think that's right.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much.

<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys. I guess my question is regarding some of the merchandise resets. What you told us
so far is that when merchandise is being fully reset you're experiencing a mid-single-digit comp gain once all the old
merchandise is cleared out, et cetera. Can you give us an idea of what the range on these results are? I'm assuming it's
not just a steady 5% kind of level? Then related to that, has the extra labor you've been adding to the stores been
concentrated towards those areas where you've had the resets?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Scot, I'll start. This is Greg. It is quite a range and I'll tell you in some of the
categories, that the hard lines categories that we reset early on, we've seen strong response to new values, especially as
we market assort it and I guess there are categories within some of our paint departments, plumbing departments that
are seeing double-digit comp increases but included in the Value Improvement line reviews are categories like plywood
and dimensional lumber, we're not seeing double-digit comp increases because in reality those categories are open
market and you literally – if we did see those kind of increases I'd be very suspicious.
So it is a mix and it is a range and where we have the categories stabilized it does take a while depending on the traffic
hitting that category for the customer to encounter those values to encounter the new ranges and the market assorting
impacts but we are seeing the impact.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Scot, this is Rick. I'll discuss the extra payroll for a moment. The thing to keep in mind as
we talk about the incremental investment to the weekday teams was that was in addition to our normal seasonal build of
temporary labor to handle the normal seasonal ramp up. So the focus of the weekday teams is on the core categories,
which is where the predominant number of the resets have taken place thus far through the program. So the seasonal
temporary labor is still skewed to the outdoor lawn and garden departments, the seasonal departments. The weekday
teams are focused on the interior core categories which line up very well with the activity around the Value
Improvement initiative.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: So I guess my question – my final question on that is just on the labor front are you seeing any
kind of direct correlation to sales improvement when you add the extra labor?
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Scot, I think when you look at that, we talked a lot about the close rate into the first quarter
performance, the thing to keep in mind with the incremental labor I think we'll be able to provide you probably better
clarity into the performance into Q2 is the impact of weather across the country when we talk about incremental labor
investments where we are, the thing to keep in mind like I said earlier, is we rolled out that incremental labor not at one
time at the beginning of the quarter, but we staggered that reset to time better with when we thought the actual weather
would be cooperative in adding that labor throughout the country.
So we did it in three stages: in the Southern markets, the Central markets and then the Northern markets. So we tiered it
that way. The thing to keep in mind is the fact that in the Southern markets where we first rolled the labor investment
out, we have been pleased with the results that we've seen as the employees have become up to speed on training and
through our orientation processes and got acclimated to the stores and we're seeing the second-tier perform better than
the third tier.
So a lot of this has to do with the timing that we brought the incremental labor hours on, as well as timing through the
normal seasonal build process so we'll be able to give you more clarity into the exact results hopefully at the end of Q2,
but like I said earlier, we are happy and pleased with what we've seen as we progress through the timing of the
incremental hours investment.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Scot, I would just add on that, as Rick said, the weekday teams primarily are focused on the
interior of the store on core categories throughout the interior of the store. We did layer it on by climatic zone as traffic
is starting to build. If you go back to my comments I did reference that on our indoor product categories we saw a 3%
positive comp, on exterior product categories we had a 7% negative comp. Part of that is obviously due to weather but I
think obviously part of it is probably attributable to where did have the weekday teams in place. As Rick said, they
weren't there for the entire quarter and to layer on Rick's comments, once as customers are in there and they're starting
to see a greater level of service in the aisle, I think some of that will help with our close rate will pay dividends for us in

Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just in terms of 1Q, couple of markets that maybe didn't
have weather extremes, can you talk a little bit about what the performance looked like in those markets?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, Colin, this is Robert. I think we talked about – and I'll have Rick and the others
chime in, we talked about a couple things recovering markets, we also talked a little bit about the West Coast and
whether you're talking about California, whether you're talking about Florida, whether you're talking about Arizona,
whether you're talking about Nevada, we saw nice strong positive comps in the majority of stores in those markets out
there.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: And, Robert, just to maybe – I understand those are the markets that took the biggest hit during
the housing and are fully in recovery mode, but is there any market you can point to that's kind of a more normal
market that would reflect what the business looks like, not in hard-hit markets and not in weather-impacted markets?
And I'm kind of scratching my head if that's like a Tennessee or something?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, well, if you look at across our Southern tier where we had better performance – better
weather – we certainly saw much better performance, positive comps across our kind of the Deep South, Southern tier,
when weather broke and we had more opportunity to capitalize on seasonal business across those markets.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah, Colin, this is Rick. I'd just add, when you look a lot of the markets, Tennessee as an
example, [ph] was (41:17) impacted tremendously by the weather swings.
I would say the Gulf Coast is probably more reflective of a more normalized markets that performed very well as far as
the Southern markets go, in comparison to the rest of the country. That gives us confidence in what we've seen from the
Value Improvement initiatives, as well as our investments back into store labor and inventory.
As Robert said, California performed extremely well, being our highest comping state for the quarter. And then we saw
good performance across the other markets, particularly the West Coast and Florida as those markets continue to
rebound.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: And then in May – and I'm probably thinking of this because it's obvious there's a lot of
noise in the quarter, trying to understand what you're doing and how weather impacted it. But in May, how are the
indoor categories performing or the non-weather impacted markets?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Colin, this is Greg. We've not seen a fall-off in performance of the indoor categories.
They're doing well. They actually benefited from the foot traffic that's brought in from the seasonal business.
And as Rick was describing earlier, you actually see an impact. The penetration rates aren't as great, obviously, as you
move from winter months into towards summer months. But in the interior paint categories, you see all the interior
paint categories, sundry, and accessories, benefit from the foot traffic that's driven in by the exterior categories that are
now taking off, as we've seen weather turnaround from South to North.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. That's helpful. Final quick question, just on the credit proposition. 20 bips to
margin impact versus expected 10 bips. Higher penetration. Are you getting a commensurate lift in sales and benefit to
comp? And are the returns what you expect at this point?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah, we still – Colin, we still see improvement in top line. So as we think about the 190 basis
points, roughly a fourth of that would be incremental, and the balance of that would be tender shift. So we are seeing

some incrementality.
In addition, as we think about switching from other forms of tender, yes, we do have a 5% off on the proprietary credit.
That's in lieu of promotional financing that they might've taken us up on otherwise. So it's reduction in expenses for the
program. It's also a reduction of bank card fees that they might've – we might have incurred. So we are pleased with the
continued progress of the credit program.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. Good morning. You talked a lot about the labor add back and the cadence to that. I was
curious if you can give us a little bit of color on what kind of training you're putting behind the added labor? If there is
a bigger concentration on in-the-aisle training or online training?
And how you're using that additional labor? I know it's two full-time equivalents, but is it being split up across different
parts of the store, so that you get four different bodies in there at different times? Any color on that.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Sure. Dan, this is Rick. As it relates to training, I'll address that first. We have very specific
training for these individuals as they come on board, in addition to our normal orientation training programs that we put
them through. Our training is both in-aisle and online through our Lowe's learning courses that we do with the
employees.
The thing to keep in mind with these employees is the training is very concentrated. As we talked about, these
employees are focused on the interior categories. So it could be very structural training such as paint, how to mix paint,
how to engage customers in the paint aisles. Or in specific areas throughout the store that we have them assigned to.
As it relates to how they work across the store, we take and have been focused on two very particular timeframes that
the stores are allowed to use these incremental hours. And those time frames were based upon when we saw the highest
concentration of customer traffic throughout the day.
So they are scheduled either in mid-morning timeframes or in early to late afternoon timeframes to hit those peak
customer traffic times throughout the day. And we also schedule them in ways to make sure that we're taking advantage
of our sales-planning processes, understanding where the business is being dictated, where the business is coming
through, so that we're able to schedule them in accordance to where we think that we will be drawing traffic into the
store, and make sure that they're prepared and ready to engage our customers there.
So it is a very holistic approach. And the hours – they're not being just disseminated across the store. It is very focused,
very structured, which enables us to train them more in depth. And it also allows us to target them into areas where we
know the customer traffic will be more concentrated throughout the day and the week.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And as a follow up, what is the next areas for the resets in the coming season?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: What are the areas, Dan, in terms of categories?
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Yeah.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: There's – we still have, from a reset standpoint, half of our categories to go. So there's
about 100 and a half left.
So it's quite varied. I mean I think there'll be less, obviously, seasonal. As we move into summer, they'll be more
hardline-focused, and probably more focused in some of the areas of plumbing, fashion electrical. Some in millwork
that I'm aware of. But it is spread across the store.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.
When you look back at the first quarter, why do you think that either you were more impacted by the weather than the
broader home improvement category and your largest competitor? Or alternatively, maybe you didn't benefit as much
from the strength in the indoor category as much as the market?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, my understanding is I think that both of us were certainly impacted by weather, and I
think that was what they also said on their call yesterday. So I think it's not about being more or less impacted by
weather on seasonal categories.
I think part of it is one, for example, we talked about the strength in the West Coast, particularly areas like California,
where we don't have as many stores. So to the extent that you had those markets that had favorable weather, yes, we
benefited from the favorable weather. But as a percentage of our total base, obviously we don't have as many stores
there.
And then the other thing I think I would point to is we don't have as strong of a affiliation, as a percentage of our
business, with that professional customer. I think that would be something to look towards. I think if you look in the
Hurricane Sandy market, we don't have as many stores in that immediately affected area as obviously they would.
And then the last thing, Michael, I would point to would be just what we've talked about on the call today, that we still
have a lot of disruption going on, as we go through the reset process, the transition of the lines, those type things, and
selling through existing inventory.
Even though we're getting good sell-through on that inventory, and we're pleased with the margins we're getting on it,
compared to what we normally sell our non-productive inventory through at, you're still selling units at less than what
would otherwise be a full retail value obviously. You're selling a unit and that's having an impact on your top line comp
performance, as well.
So I would point to that as maybe some of the differences, not saying that weather impacted one of us more than the
other, so.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: No. That's helpful. I guess I was being a little too cute in how I was asking my question.
And, Robert, if the penetration of the Pro business is a little lower at Lowe's, how do think you can – will you be able
to fully participate as that customer segment becomes fully reengaged in the business? And what can you do to increase
your penetration there and share? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, we've got a number of initiatives, and I can have Rick speak to those as well.
But once again, as you look at where recovery is taking place, in many cases, it is in some of those – the early recovery
and rebuilding from mostly a new construction standpoint is in some of those markets, Florida, California, those places.
Arizona. Where we're so heavily hit during the economic downturn. And as once again, those are areas where we're
out-stored.

So we've got some things we're working on to try and obviously garner our share of business in those markets, but
we've got some overall initiatives that we've got working on, in those markets and across all markets, to be able to
continue to improve our relationship with the commercial customer, anything from the things like we talked about the
last year or so, adding value prop to what we offer to that commercial customer, to a lot of other things.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Michael, I'll chime in and Rick has some notes too, but it's an important opportunity
for us.
As you have heard – and this is consistent in Q1 – our sales to the Pro customer, the commercial customer outpaced our
sales to the consumer from a growth-rate standpoint, and we need to take advantage of what the market will provide us.
So two critical points. As we restructure our lines through Value Improvement, and you go into categories like
hardware, rough electrical, rough plumbing – as you address the opportunity in tools – and we've purposely made sure
that we, whether it was in particular brands and especially quantities and depth of inventory, we've reset those lines
with that in mind.
With the investment that Rick helped drive in inventory at the onset of the year, we've been able to provide much
greater on-hand depth in some of those key categories as we reset these categories through Value Improvement. And
that's crucial because with that customer, time is so important.
So we're seeing the benefit of that depth of inventory. We're seeing the benefit of lines that are structured against that
opportunity. And, Rick, you may have a few more comments.
<A - Ricky D. Damron>: Yeah, this is Rick. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things, and Robert touched on a few
of those that I think will add tremendous value to the professional customer as we continue to work towards building
stronger relationships with that group.
I think a couple things that we need to talk about, one is what we're doing to showcase value to this customer
differently than we have in the past. And as Robert mentioned, we introduced our value proposition to the customer last
year, giving this customer the 5% off for all purchases on proprietary credit through our vehicles there. And we have
seen tremendous adoption of that from a consistency point of view and what we're offering from a value perspective to
those customers, every day in every market.
Second to that is also we've talked about, last year, changes we made to our inventory investments as part of the Value
Improvement initiatives, particularly in increasing targeted service levels across all items in the stores, which really
help us build greater depth in key product categories that are relevant for our pros that shop us every single day, to
make sure that we have that inventory available in stock across the store. Particularly focused on improving our depth
of what we call job-lot items – those items that pros need in multiple quantities every single day to be able to complete
the jobs.
And we've invested greater depth of inventory into those specific items in a very targeted way to make sure that we're
able to meet the demands across the store in those areas where we know they have particular quantity needs on a
day-to-day basis to invest in that area.
The third component of this is what we talked a lot about from product differentiation and our ability to begin to show
this product differently to these customers than we ever have in the past.
One of the key items there that I'll highlight is our contractor-pack program, which offers these customers discounts for
quantity purchases on those items, whether it be electrical boxes, switches, whether it be drywall repair, whatever those
items that we've identified. We're able to present those on end caps in a collective way to the consumer in that area of
the store differently than we have in the past by freeing up those incremental end caps to be able to show these
customers different value whether it be in contractor pack quantities, or whether it be in national brands or proprietary
brands that are relevant for them. So those things I think are adding tremendous value and are leading to helping us to
have the pro customer segment out comp our DIY segment for the last several quarters since we've launched those.

The third – or the fourth component of that we introduced last year being our reorganization of our outside sales team
to focus on building those relationships with their largest customers where we know that we have a tremendous
opportunity to gain share with them and take a greater share of their spend and we're working to continue to refine that.
That organization was implemented the end of Q4, taking place in Q1, so we feel very comfortable and very good
about what we're seeing that organization being able to do long-term, so when you look at this I think it's a holistic
approach in what we're doing from showing value to how we show product to building an organization that helps us
strengthen relationships across that category.

<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thank you, Michael. Regina, we've got time for one more question.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you guys could maybe talk a little bit
longer term, once you get past some of the investment you're making in store payroll this year and the resets and repairs
and things that maybe fade away as the recovery takes hold, how would you like us to think about fixed cost leverage
or SG&A leverage with the rising comp environment in 2014 and 2015?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Dennis, this is Bob. I think the framework that we've provided in the past, which is basically 20
basis points of EBIT improvement for each 1 point of comp, still holds true. Obviously there might be some
fluctuations quarter-to-quarter but on balance kind of 2013 and beyond that's what we would expect.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: And is the inclusive of changes in D&A and gross margin as well?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: It is.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Are you assuming that's flat with that? So what would the SG&A component of that look
like?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So the majority of the movement would be in SG&A as you think about fixed cost leverage.
Similarly we get leverage on depreciation as sales improve and then once we get past the Value Improvement process,
our expectations for gross margin improvement are modest around 10 or so basis points per year. So the majority of
that is going to come from SG&A first, depreciation second, and then gross margin third.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay, great. And then separately, if we're to look at the seven categories that you flagged as
being above average, I was wondering if you could put maybe some absolute numbers behind some of those? Were
there any categories that were up, let's say, 4% or better in the quarter?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, this is Robert, Dennis. Yes, we had categories were up that much. We're not going to
go in and give you the details category by category but yes we saw that wide of a swing in categories.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. And those would be led by where you've had more stabilized resets?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Well, it was the interior categories that we said overall were up about 3% but yes I mean
those that we would've had some – we've either invested in depth of inventory or we've had some of the reset activity
certainly would have contributed to that performance.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. Thank you.
