David E. Simon
Good morning. Our results for the quarter were strong. FFO was $2.05 per share, up 12.6% from the first quarter of
2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus at quarter end by $0.05 per share. For our malls and premium outlets,
comparable property NOI growth was 4.8% and that was off a 5.7% increase in Q1 of 2012. Tenant sales were up 5.3%
to $570 – $575 per square foot; occupancy, up 110 basis points to 94.7%; base minimum rent per square foot was 3%
higher and our re-leasing spread was a positive 13.4% or $7 per square foot.
We were very active in the debt markets during the quarter, closing or locking rates on 13 new loans totaling
approximately $2 billion, of which our share was $1.3 billion. The average rate was 2.92% and a weighted average
term of a little over eight years.
Let me turn to the all-important development activity. First of all, we opened the Phoenix Premium Outlet centers in
Chandler, Arizona on April 4. The center is 100% leased, opened with an impressive collection of stores. I will not
name them; Rick will if you're interested. Several high-profile stores will be opening in the coming weeks, and the
good news is the shopper response has been very strong and many merchants report it as one of their best outlet
openings in the last couple years.
Shisui Premium Outlets opened on April 19. This is our ninth center in Japan. It's located 15 minutes from Narita
International Airport serving Greater Tokyo. The center opened with large crowds and 70 media outlets opening and
we expect this to be a terrific center serving the area visitors to Tokyo given the proximity of the airport.
Significant redevelopment projects were completed during the quarter at Apple Blossom Mall, Quaker Bridge Mall and
South Hills Village. Several significant projects are on track for completion in 2013 including expansions at Sawgrass
Mills, Dadeland Mall, Seattle Premium Outlets, Orlando Premium Outlets at Vineland, Walt Whitman Shops and the
re-grand opening of The Shops at Nanuet, and University Town Plaza in Pensacola.
Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors and big box tenants, are underway at 44
properties in the U.S., two in Asia. Our share of these costs is approximately $1 billion and the blended estimated rate
of return is approximately 11%.
We have three premium outlet centers under construction opening in the third quarter of this year: St. Louis Premium
Outlets in Chesterfield Missouri, opening August 1, which is 96% leased; Toronto Premium Outlets in Ontario,
Canada, opening August 22, which is 85% currently leased; Busan Premium Outlets in Korea opening in late August.
As we highlighted in the press release, demand for space in all of these centers has been exceptional and we expect to
be fully leased at opening. We also have at least eight additional new premium outlet projects in North America in
various stages of pre-development.
Klepierre reported its first quarter revenues this week. You can read about them so I'll be brief other than to say that
rents were up for the quarter at the total of 3.4%; reaffirmed 2013 guidance. We've now owned our stake for 13
months. Progress has been made in several aspects of the business. They have sold €760 million of assets. They've
simplified their business with the elimination of the [inaudible] (06:14) sub-brand as well as the ongoing sale of the
office portfolio.
They're focused on operations. We've added a new CEO. They're generating additional Simon brand venture-type
revenues as recently evidenced by the Coca-Cola partnership. They strengthened their balance sheet through recent
financing activities and they've opened two great malls, St. Lazare Paris and Emporia in Malmö, Sweden. And I think if
anyone has had the opportunity to visit those centers, you'll see that the company has clearly the capability to build

Today, we announced a dividend of $1.15 per share for the quarter. Over the past six quarters, we have increased the
common stock dividend each quarter as we've been playing catch-up to our taxable income. Our growth rate in our
dividend has been over 31% over the last two years. Importantly, we anticipate, subject to review and board approval,
increasing our dividend as we anticipate our taxable income continuing to grow.
Guidance today, we increased the top and the bottom line of our 2013 FFO guidance to a current range of $8.50 to
$8.60 per share. This is an increase from $0.10 from the initial guidance in February of $8.40 to $8.50 per share. Strong
operating performance is the driver of this increase. Occupancy, reasonable mall and premium occupancy costs of
11.3% and strong rent spreads give us good momentum.
Finally, 2013 is off to a good start and we're ready to answer any of your questions that you'd like to pose.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Spector of Bank of America.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Hi. It's Craig Schmidt here.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you doing?
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Real good. It sounds like you made real progress on your dispositions at Klépierre.
Maybe you should – could you give some more color on what's left to do as well as maybe some of your refurbishings
that you've done in the portfolio and any successes you've had in bringing new retailers to your Klépierre portfolio.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, first of all, they will continue to sell non-core assets as well as the office portfolio. So
they've got a couple of the office deals that are close to being signed up, including their headquarters. And then they'll
continue to sell kind of the smaller non-core assets, which frankly are very stable and solid centers, but they don't have
the extension capabilities that we're interested in pursuing. And they've done a great – a number of extensions like
Claye-Souilly in Paris, on the east side of Paris near the airport that I think represents the ability to take a smaller center
and expand it. And on the retail front, we're continuing to solidify that.
The operational side of the business is the true up side. The coordination among retail, what we do at Simon Brand
Ventures, how we operate the centers is the next chapter in the story. Obviously, that takes some time. We've had to
add to the personnel ranks. We've had to set the strategy and we're pleased with what's going on there and I think
there'll be more to come.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: And are you surprised at your ability to push rents given the general difficulty in
Europe?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I don't run this day-to-day. Some of these questions are better asked for them. We are
not the ones pushing the rents. We're providing strategic advice and helping them focus on what is important in their
business and also showing them how we run our business so they can run their business.
I'm not surprised that a number of those countries have stability in cash flow in tough economic times. I think what
you've seen here in the U.S. is that the same thing happened here for us in very tough economic times.
And the one area that where they're having the most difficulty is in Spain, and that is a focus for the company but that
continues to be something that is affecting their cash flow to some extent is because Spain continues to be under
pressure for basically all retail real estate owners that have real estate in Spain.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Great. And then maybe just a – I was impressed with your 96% leased in St. Louis. Do
you know how much will open in August?

<A - David E. Simon>: We should be in the 90s. There's always a few laggards, but that's a real number and we should
be in the 90s. I mean even though we'd love to open every center at 100% leased and operated, it does – sometimes it
does take time. Phoenix is a great example. We're 100% leased. We were in the, kind of, the low 90s to be at opening
but in the next couple of months we'll be 100% occupied; same thing will happen in St. Louis. There may be a couple
of slow people but we are 96% leased.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy of UBS.
<Q - Christine M. McElroy>: A follow up on Craig's question about the outlets. Can you disclose the expected yields
at Chandler in St. Louis for 2013 and maybe discuss some pre-leasing progress at Columbus and Charlotte?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well the – look, our yields in the outlet business continue to be attractive. These will be double
digit yields, unquestionably, and Chandler will be probably north of 10%; St. Louis will be at or above 10%. And in
addition, as many probably know, we're looking at Phase 2 now. And obviously, as we bring that on line in St. Louis,
we will – the yields will go up. But they're both north of 10%. They are both north of 10%.
Now, on your question on Columbus, let me just say this, Columbus is a very competitive market. There's a lot of folks
that have competing real estate there and sites. So we'll see. We may or may not be the victor in that competition but
we're working to continue to try and move that forward.
Charlotte is basically a go-deal. So with us and Tanger, we expect to start construction in the next two months. We're
very excited about that project. I'm not going to tell you what the yield is because I don't know what Tanger does but
it'll be very good. The retailers are very happy that we have put together our joint venture. They are very excited about
doing it and it's got to be at least over 50%, 60% pre-leased. Not that we really need it because the one thing that we
know is we have 80 premium outlets in the world, I think. So we don't – Christy, we don't really need to pre-lease like
some others that might because we kind of know whether or not we can lease it. But Charlotte's go, starting
construction here shortly. And we're racing to do a 2014 opening.
<Q - Christine M. McElroy>: Okay and then I know that you continue to do quite a bit of anchor and big box
repositioning. Can you talk a little bit about what the retailer demand is like today for mall anchor space; how you think
about getting that space back from a re-tenanting perspective? And are sale leasebacks of anchor space something that
you would consider if a major tenant came to you looking to raise capital?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Hi, Christy. It's Rick Sokolov. The demand is as good as it has ever been. And I think that
that can be referenced by the number of spaces we have available in our mall portfolio. We literally have 635
department stores and 1% of them, six or seven, are vacant; and that's the lowest it has been in as long as I can
remember.
We actively deal with every one of our malls to keep a running list of people that have demand to get in there. And we
are in a constant dialogue with our anchors that we've identified that we have the potential of getting back to try and
make them better. And if you look over the years, I think we've added almost 175 boxes and anchors over the last four
years in the portfolio, so we've been very active and it's making them a lot better. I do not believe we would really be
interested in entertaining sale leasebacks.
<Q - Christine M. McElroy>: And are you able to sort of quantify, maybe, a range of what you might pay for vacant
anchor box space, you know, a class-A mall versus class-B mall?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, each deal is very, very – depends on a lot of individual characteristics of each deal. It's
not really something that you can generalize about.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hey, guys. It's Ross Nussbaum. One final question, the 4.8% same-store NOI growth you
generated this quarter, if I think about that relative to the occupancy gains you had and the re-leasing spreads over the
last year, it kind of feels like there's something else that's helping that number. Is there a piece there that I'm not
thinking about?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean, it partly is good sales growth, partly is that we're very focused on operating to
the best of our ability. I would point out, last quarter, Q1 2012, we had 5.7% comp increase. So that 4.8% on top of
5.7% is just running the company as well as we can, but we're never satisfied. We're always trying to improve and that's
what we're all about.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Good, thanks. On your re-leasing stats, the opening number went from $53 to $59 and I guess
it's a 12-month trailing average and so, I mean how much of your – is it a disproportionate share opening in the first
quarter because I'm trying to see – just trying to kind of forecast that number out and it was a big jump given that it's a
rolling average.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes. Paul, this is Steve. Some of it is mixed. In the mall business especially, there are more
leases that are tied to traditional retailers' fiscal year end, which is January 31. And in fact, I think if you look at the
supplementals, as I recall, the remaining square footage that we have expiring in 2013 is in the 3 million to 4 million
square foot range, where over a normal year like 2014, 2015, it's 8 million to 9 million square feet. So we have dealt
with a lot of the – especially regional mall expirations that occurred January 31.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay, okay. Great, that makes sense. And then can you maybe just characterize – I mean you
provided a lot of – you've listed all your redevelopment projects and it looks like there's like 37 in there and you have
about $700 million listed in the sup, which is – I mean, it's only about $20 million per project but it looks like there's
some that are kind of adding new space and should represent I guess a more sizable chunk of that and I'm trying to see
– should we see – should we expect to see more expansions of malls given the demand and given your spreads and
resulting in some lumpier projects that pull that number up?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Are there lumpy projects in there that represent a big share of that $700 million?
<A - David E. Simon>: The lumpy projects are basically hopefully ready to start shortly. And I'm not going to list –
just from recall, I mean the lumpy ones, you'll start to see later on this year and in 2014, and they include as Roosevelt
Field, the Copley, Del Amo, Woodbury, King of Prussia, to name, Houston Galleria, to name four or five or six lumpy,
bigger, bigger chunkier ones.
You're right. A lot of what we have now is – they run the $20 million, $30 million, $40 million. But you have
something like Nanuet, which is a $150 million project and Walt Whitman is around $80 million. So you got little –
you got it all over the board. But the lumpier, bigger ones, we are essentially in our first phase of Del Amo. We will
begin our first phase of Roosevelt Field here in the fall.

Stanford, Rick, whispered to me – thank you. We're finalizing everything there to, as many of you specifically know, to
relocate Bloomingdales, build them a new store, and then we take over their existing Bloomingdales store and carve it
up for small shops. So the bigger, lumpier ones really are hopefully beginning to start second half of 2013 and 2014
will be a huge year for us, 2015 as well, as these bigger lumpier ones come on stream.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Hey, Paul, it's Steve. I would just add one thing to that because it gets lost in the sauce
sometimes, but between – David mentioned, Woodbury but he didn't mention Desert Hills, Orlando Premium, Las
Vegas North. Those are four premium outlets that all do north of $1,000 a foot in sales where we are adding significant
amount of space. And so we're – those are projects that will come on in the next year or two.
<A - David E. Simon>: As Steve said, those are – on average are about $100 million a pop.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Yes. So I mean that number could – should really double probably in a year from now.
<A - David E. Simon>: It's going to balloon and I think what we have said and – what we've said and will say again is
that this is our number one priority. This is the huge focus for the company. This is where we spend most of our time.
And the good news is we recognized this – that the world was not going to end a little bit ahead of others so we're in
the midst of doing this now.
Woodbury is going to start. Right after this – most people after the first quarter earnings take the afternoon off; right
after this, Rick and I are going to spend two hours on the final approval of Woodbury. It's a $168 million deal and it's
going to really, really be cool and it's really going to start, and we've really got the approvals and blah, blah, blah, blah.
Then in the afternoon – we do take a lunch break; Rick demands to go out to lunch. I like to eat at my desk; it's a source
of much conflict in the organization. But right after that, we're approving, I don't know, 20-some odd different mall
deals so number one priority. We're glad we're in the midst of this now and a lot of good stuff to come.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Would you think those blended stabilized returns are going to be around – I mean, you've got
9% to 14% for the premium outlets in there. Is that going to change much?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. Look, I think they'll all be very, very accretive to our company. I don't – as soon as the
project gets approved and we put in there, you'll see the return.
<Q - Paul B. Morgan>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. David, when we look at occupancy it continues to grow in your portfolio and
we're past some previous peaks; where do you think is stabilized occupancy?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, actually, I've been very impressed with our leasing team, that they've been able to
achieve these occupancy levels. So I think the focus now is it's always good to, on the margin, to continue to increase
occupancy. But Cedrik, I do believe that the focus now will be making sure that the mix is the best that it can be. But
I've actually been very pleased and impressed with our leasing team and the amount of – their ability to drive
occupancy.
Now don't tell them because then they'll take the afternoon off where Rick and I won't; but no, seriously, I've been very
pleased with the results that they've been able to produce.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: And, Cedrik, the only thing I would add is that the number that I'm thinking about is higher
than I would have told you perhaps a year ago because what has emerged in our sector now is you have a number of
very high fashion, highly-productive tenants like ZARA, H&M, Uniqlo, Top Shop, that are demanding bigger spaces.

And because they're all bigger spaces, that's going to create incremental demand for our space that could enable to us to
perhaps drive the percentage higher than what otherwise would be the case absent that demand.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. So if you look at your ability to change the mix, what can it do for your ability to push
rent in the centers?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well look, it's relatively straightforward. You know, the better the tenant does in terms of sales
per square foot, the greater they have the ability to pay rent. And so it's really that simple. So as we do that, we're
hopeful that rent will follow or be part of the initial equation.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. And turning maybe to densification, you've got – you talked about Copley earlier. It
seems that you could add non-retail users depending on the city. How many more malls do you own where you think
you could add non-retail users and densify the spots?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Cedrik, it's Rick. Right now, we're working on adding hotels at five different projects and
we're working on adding multi-family at four additional ones. We're under construction with a multi-family project at
Firewheel in Garland, Texas. So we still think there is very good demand for it.
What we have found is that when we add these hotels and multi-family or condo components in our projects, they are
yielding the higher room rates for hotels and monthly rentals for multi-family because people very much enjoy the mix
aspects of the community. So we think we bring a incremental value to those components and we're going to continue
to pursue them.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes, I just roughly put Copley aside because that's the big one. But there are at least 12 to 15
in each area that are of immediate focus. That doesn't mean it's limited to those, say, 24 to 30. But there is a list of those
12 or so in each category being hotel or and/or multi-family that we're very focused on. In fact, we're going to approve
this afternoon. South Dale more than likely.
I'm still struggling with like the returns, okay, because our returns are higher than the multi-family guys get. But – so
I'm still trying to – I'm still struggling with some of those deals. But I do think the – there is a pipeline to take
advantage of that. That's good for the real estate too, generally.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Right. And just a final question, in your annual shareholder letter, you talked about
continuing to lead the industry in promoting the malls and marketing medium. How much more can you do – how
much more income can you generate from that aspect of the business?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I think it's also just more than income in that – I could be wrong here, but I do think
we're on the verge of a technology backlash. And our focus is creating the mall environment where people – we had a
meeting on this, kind of a brainstorming meeting on this Monday. And something was said that was very clever is that
people today are looking down, they're not looking up. And what happens in the mall environment is we do give them
the opportunity to look up and around and not just down; down meaning at your mobile device and everything else.
So I do think the mall has a unique ability to be part of that maybe next wave of trying to create social responsibility,
community relations, community feel and part of a process where we'll actually look up as opposed to look down. So
it's a big focus for our company. The revenue side – obviously we love cash flow so we're cash flow junkies so we're
going to look for that too. But there's a unique ability for us to really kind of create community in our properties beyond
that and I think that's a huge mission for us to try and achieve.
It's a long term prospect, lots of ideas there; very hard to sort out exactly how we will execute it. But – and the good
news is just to segue into the e-commerce, I mean you're seeing more and more pure e-commerce companies opening
stores because they know that people, frankly, want to look up; they don't always want to look down.
So a great example is this Warby Parker, this eyeglass thing that was kind of the new hot dot-com thing and they're
opening physical stores. Now, whether they go to the malls or not, I'm not, who knows? But the fact of the matter is I
think they recognize that people want to touch, feel, look up. So our mission is to get people to look up, not look down.

Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley of Citigroup.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: It's been a while since you combined the operating statistics of the mall and the outlet
business together. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how each is performing, some of the similarities and
differences? And then as we look at the 79.6% of your NOI that comes from malls and premium outlets, could you sort
of give us a rough sense as to what the percentage is coming from outlets versus malls?
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. I'll just say this. Steve can answer the second one. The – in the real estate recession, or I
should say the – not the real estate recession because frankly, having lived through 1990 to 1993, this was child's play.
But if you look at the general economy, our outlets clearly outperformed the malls during that 2009, 2010, and 2011
period.
And now, I will say, Quentin, generally in terms of sales growth and comp growth, they're relatively close. The outlets
are still marginally better but the difference between those two has narrowed considerably. Now, with respect to the
breakout, do you...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes. And, Quentin, if you actually on – in our year-end tune that's posted on the website,
we do break it out for you. And I don't have it in front of me, but as I recall, the malls are 55% and I think the outlets
are 25% because when you put the outlets and the Mills together, essentially about 1/3 of our NOI comes from the
value side of the business.
<Q - Quentin Velleley>: Okay. And then maybe just in terms of the on-going success that you're having with
Klépierre in terms of improving operations and capital and asset sales and so forth having an influence, are you
spending a lot of time looking at a similar style of public company investment where you take a similar minority stake
and get some board representation? Is that something that's increasingly attractive to you given the success of
Klépierre?
<A - David E. Simon>: We have thought about it from time to time. It's not a big focus for us, but it could lend itself
to a situation here or there. But Klépierre was – the reason we made the investment the way we did was for all sorts of
reason, including risk management. So really, it would depend on the circumstances. It's not something that we're out
looking to do, but in the right kind of context, it's conceivable.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: David, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. How are you? It sounds like if you're really a
cash flow junkie, you should put advertising in the floors. That way you can get more money when people are looking
down.
<A - David E. Simon>: We tried that. We've done that. We did vinyl footprint. It didn't go over well. It was great for
the kids, but then when I saw the adults using it, I thought it was a little tacky.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Thinking about Klépierre, I guess we're – we've elapsed the six status for them to
effectively go private. So how should we think about your stake and how you want to evolve over time, whether you
want this to be a stub outstanding, whether you want to bring it in-house, whether you want to bring a joint venture
partner in? How should we think about how that evolves now that the, at least the REIT issue, the French REIT issue is
elapsing?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, Michael, I would love to answer that question but I respectfully won't. We are pleased
with the investment. We're making good strides. We need to make more strides. And I said the big problem with the
company today is somewhat out of their control, and that's just dealing with the Spanish economy.
But we're pleased; but I really – as much as I'd like to talk about that kind of stuff, I really can't. It is a public company.
I've got to respect that situation. So we're pleased. They're making very good strides. And I would say operationally, it
– things do take longer there than they would, say, here but we've been pleased with kind of the blocking and tackling
that the company is undertaking. Though they still need to do a lot more, they – we've been pleased with the progress
they've made to date.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: And then just going back to the rental spreads on page 19 of your sup and Steve, you
answered that the retailer calendar year end, the January 31, but I guess I'm still having a hard time with March 31,
2012, $7 million of trailing at 54 box, 49 expiring and now you're 03/31/2013, 7.4 million square feet at 59 versus 52;
and even 12/31/2012, 8 million square feet at 53/48. It just seems like there's – that the opening/closing are just much,
much higher this quarter; that whatever happened in the first quarter of 2013 was dramatically higher rents than at any
point over the trailing 12 any other quarter.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Michael, that's true. But if you also look, there were dramatically higher closing rents as
well so some of it is clearly mix driven. Some of it is clearly the fact that over the years, our portfolio continues to get
better. And so the rents that we were able to do leases at three years ago, five years ago, eight years ago were better and
those are all now rolling off. But mix is clearly an issue – or a component of it.
<A - David E. Simon>: And I would just point out that we have in our portfolio, U.S. portfolio, not including the Mills
– or actually it does include the Mills. We have 121 properties that do over $700 a foot, so...
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: 121.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: That averaged a hundred – that averaged $700 a foot.
<A - David E. Simon>: 121. So – and as Steve said, Rick said, we're really trying to make those properties better and
better in all sorts of different ways. So that's going to lead to we're more rent growth. But again, I would not overreact
to one really good looking statistic in one particular quarter. Just like I would ask for forgiveness to the extent that one
quarter we have a statistic that looks bad. I'm sure part of it's mix; we can drill down to it a little bit more. But demand
is good and we got a reasonably good portfolio.
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: And just going, I guess, sort of back to Christy's question on department stores and
just thinking about JCPenney in particular, especially if they brought in Alixpartners; your sense of – as you guys
obviously speak to them, other department stores, how much do you think that the massive Ala Moana trade has
warped department store managements in thinking what their boxes are worth? Or do you think most people are pretty
realistic in what they think their real estate is worth?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I can't speculate what Ala Moana – how that has affected the judgment of department
store or retail CEOs. I would point out, though, since Ala Moana, there just hasn't been a lot of box trades and you can
come to your own conclusion as to why; maybe because they don't want to sell or maybe there's a spread between the

bid and the ask. I don't know. But I can't speculate on how they think about that at all, Alex.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then going to Klépierre, while I know that you don't want to comment
directly on their operations, can you just give us a sense as you guys think about the growth and what Simon can bring
to their platform, the split between improving NOI versus bringing in the Simon brand venture-type revenue stream and
increasing that ancillary income. How would you think about the growth? Is more of it just going to come from NOI or
is there a big opportunity, you think, to really improve the ancillary income; that that could be a meaningful
contributor?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, again, I'm not going to quantify that. It's not something I can do. Look, we – I think the
important thing to put in perspective there, Alex, is that we don't run the company. We own a stake. We're pleased with
the stake. We can show them how we run it and then they need to apply it. And we brought in – the company has
brought in some talented people to learn from what we do, assuming we do what we do reasonably well. I mean, I'm
not telling you we do what we do is great because I always think it can get better, but assuming we do what we do is
reasonably well, we can show them how we do it and how we think about the business but they've got to do that.
There're the ones that need to do it.
And it's not easy to do when the economy there is sputtering along and in some cases, still contracting, i.e. Spain. But
they get what we're doing. They want to run the company better. They are running the company better. And I think as
kind of I said in my letter, I do think there's growth there as soon as the economy of Europe generally stabilizes and I
do think the economy of Europe will stabilize. It's not going to, despite – this is my personal view of it, it's not going to
continue to contract as it has over the last year or two. So – I mean, but it – so the long, it was long winded answer but
I'm not going to speculate exactly how much NOI growth through is but I do think there's improvement in how they run
the business. And I think they would agree. I think that's their big focus in the upcoming years.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then, just finally for Steve, in the – and thank you for the new
supplemental; on page 23, in the CapEx and development page, there's an item called conversion from accrual to cash
basis. And if you don't have this off hand, we can discuss offline. But just curious what that is.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, it's simple, Alex. We give you a CapEx number and – but there are CapEx numbers
where we have accrued obligations like we've got a construction bill but we haven't paid it yet.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: And all we're doing is giving you both the accrual number and the cash number because
some people look at it and want the accrual numbers. Some people want the cash number.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

<A - David E. Simon>: I don't worry about that at all, David. I just – REITs have been around for 60 years. It's not
going to happen. I just can't imagine it's going to happen. As you know, it's revenue neutral if in fact there was some
change. I think most politicians understand the importance that commercial real estate has in stabilizing the general
economy. The last thing in the world they would want to do is create some kind of economic uncertainty.
They've seen the fact that the downturn and what commercial real estate, how it handled itself and the amount of
liquidity that REITs brought to the table to stabilize pricing and not create kind of what happened in the early 1990s. As
I said, I have lived through that as has Rick.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Me too.
<A - David E. Simon>: You too, some others. It's not going to happen. But by the way, if it did, we would be best
positioned to take advantage of it because as you know, our cash flow was significantly above our dividend payment.
And look, I've always fantasized, I probably shouldn't say this so you're – I've always fantasized, we pay out $1.5
billion a year in dividends; $1.6 billion, what is the number now?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: $1.6 billion.
<A - David E. Simon>: $1.6 billion. Imagine if I had that amount of capital through two, three, four years. So we
would do some great stuff with it. But, David, that's an aside. It's not going to happen. REITs have performed. They've
been very important to the economy. They've been great for individual shareholders. They've helped stabilize pricing.
No way.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Okay. So no plan B planning at this point?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we don't need to. But like I said, if the sun hits the moon and hits another galaxy, we –
we'll be better positioned than anybody else.
<Q - David Bryan Harris>: Well, tax breaks on granted in perpetuity so I think the question is out there. Now, a
similar question actually related to Klépierre. I mean obviously there's been a lot of talk about tax increases and public
policy responses that may be somewhat more fluid in Europe today. Any notion at all that the tax status of a company
like Klépierre is being questioned?
<A - David E. Simon>: Not at all.

<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Oh, thank you, David.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Hi. I want to go back to the leasing spreads again, not to beat a dead horse here, but the
13%, so the 300 basis point pickup. Anyway, when I first looked at that, what went through my mind was you're
starting to roll some shorter-term, post-downturn leases and you're going to get the benefit there. I guess what I'm
trying to get at is does it feel like this increase, whether it's 200 basis points, 300, or whatever it is, is probably going to
be sticky going forward or is it just purely an anomaly where Q2 rolls around and for some reason we're back down to
10%?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: You know, Mike – it's Steve. Let me take a shot at it and Rick can weigh in or David. I
think if you look at the – we give you five quarters worth of information. And the one thing you can see from the five
quarters is that the spread has increased over each of the five quarters. The magnitude of the increase this quarter was
substantial relative to the trend that we had been seeing, but we had been going from the low-$4s to the mid-$4s to $5 a

foot.
And as I said, some of that is lumpy because of first quarter expirations. But the fact is, deal flow has been getting
better, quality of deals has been getting better. Occupancy costs have stayed relatively low. So as you want to think
about it as mark-to-market or however you want to think about it, there is – there should be an upward bias. Is the
upward bias from $5 to $7? I think that's hard to say, but the trend has been good.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. And then I guess secondly, just curious about what are the thoughts on the pace of
rolling out outlets in Brazil today compared to what you were thinking six months to a year ago?
<A - David E. Simon>: Let me answer that if I could. I think both – as you know, we've looked diligently in Brazil and
diligently in China. Both markets for us have proven to be very, very difficult to find the right project with the right
risk/reward ratio. And hence, we have nothing – I mean, we're still looking with BR Malls. We're still hopeful that
eventually we'll be able to do something there. China is proved to be a market that I continue to really question whether
or not anybody can make money investing there, especially us. And so I am hopeful that over time, we'll find the right
opportunity with BR in Brazil. But that's taken longer than we anticipated. And then China is really, really on the back
burner and I have no regrets about it being on the back burner.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Vin Chao>: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to go back to JCPenney real quick. Just
obviously given the transition at the top there, I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that move itself.
But then also, given their reserve returns and more conditional marketing tactics that they've been known for at the
ground level, have you seen any change in traffic levels, that kind of thing since the move?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me just mention we're pleased that Mike Coleman is back. I think he will – he's
obviously a very competent, seasoned, thoughtful CEO and leader and given all the turmoil that Penney was going
through, a perfect choice to help stabilize the company. And we have great respect for him and his ability.
And I would say generally, having walked a number of Penney stores with David Contis and Rick over the last month
or so, so the stores are looking better. So I think they're headed on the right track. It's very hard for me to speculate
exactly how it's all going to shake out, but the bottom line is the organization needed some stability and thoughtfulness
and I think Mike's perfectly the right guy to provide that.
<Q - Vin Chao>: Okay. Thank you. And just – I want to go back to some comments you made about the departments –
the anchor space I think is 635, only six or seven vacant so some of the lowest vacancy you've ever seen there. But then
you also kind of said that I think I heard just no interest in sale leasebacks. Just curious if you could comment on what
kind of demand is out there for additional anchor space? Obviously with the vacancy low, that's good. But I mean are
you seeing much demand for anchor space? It just seems like most people are moving to the outlet channel in terms of
the traditional anchors?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: This is Rick. There is a great deal of demand for the space and if you look at the kinds of
tenants that we're adding to the properties, we're adding Wegmans, Fresh Markets, Dick's, theaters, health clubs. There
is a substantially broader number of categories of retailers that want to take advantage of all the traffic and mass that
we are creating at these properties. So we have again more demand today than we have had historically from a broader
collection and variety of retailers than we've had in the past and all of that is helping drive, I think, the growth of our
properties and the lack of vacancy among our anchor boxes.

<Q - Vin Chao>: Okay. And I guess, do you have enough data points at this point for some of these non-traditional
anchors, anchor malls as far as how the performance of those malls compares to, historically, the traditional setup or
mix?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that all of our anchor components are part of the mix that we have at the property.
They are not going to be game-changing, but they obviously want to be at properties that are consistent with their
growth. And in some instances, it's merely a function of whether we can accommodate the physical configuration.
Wegmans needs almost four acres of land for a single-level building. Well, in a lot of instances, that can't happen.
So it's really less a function of that kind of correlation and more a function of can we continue to give our trade area
shoppers more reasons to come to our properties and that's what we're all about.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: On the bankruptcy front and the lease termination front and that sort of side of the equation,
it seems that things are pretty good. I guess, Rick, how would you characterize the outlook for lost tenants over the
next, I don't know, three to nine months?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, if you look historically, our bankruptcy numbers have been up a little in 2013 just
because of Bakers. But overall, the credit profile of our tenants has never been better. Our receivables, as Steve can
elaborate, have never been in better shape. Our bad debt is stable; so we're feeling good about the credit profile of our
tenants and more importantly the rent paying ability, which continues to be pretty strong.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes. Rich, this is Steve. Just to put numbers on kind of Rick's overall statement. I think at
the end of the third quarter, we were chasing $42 million of receivables that had been billed but not yet been paid and
that's on about a $7 billion annual base of revenue that we bill either on a consolidated or the JV properties. So you're
literally talking about less than two days' worth of revenue and the credit profile, as Rick said, is very strong right now.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Yes. I don't think my calculator decimals go out that far, Steve, so okay, good. Thanks. And
then on the outlets, I think – didn't you guys do the development of Houston and Tanger is doing Charlotte and then
how do you split up Columbus? So I guess who's driving Columbus is what I'm curious.
<A - David E. Simon>: It's, in Charlotte, we've – we actually switched the roles that we had in Texas and we're – in
Texas, we were the developer and we jointly leased and they run the center. In Charlotte, they are the developer as it
was their site. We are going to manage the center and we'll jointly lease. And then in Columbus, again, Columbus is a
competitive marketplace; but in Columbus, we're switching back to the other deal.
So it's been a – partnerships are very common in the real estate industry. All sorts of people have partnered, developers
over the years have always partnered. We have a very good relationship with Tanger and so it's just kind have been
natural to say, okay, this is the way it was here. We're going to swap there and then go back here. And then if there's
another deal to do, it would probably swap back to the way we're doing Charlotte. So long-winded, but Charlotte will
be the Charlotte Premium Outlet and then Tanger will be branding Columbus, if in fact we're the successful developer.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. Thanks. And then, David, how many more do you think of the eight that you have
going you would do with – or that you're thinking about for North America you would do with Tanger?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, in that two were in the eight, and that being – of the eight in North America, that
includes Canada by the way, and we are actually looking at another site in Mexico. And we've seen very good progress
in our outlet in Mexico City. But of the eight, two of those are Charlotte and Columbus is of the eight.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay. No more; no more planned yet with Tanger?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, sir.
<Q - Richard C. Moore>: Okay, good. Thanks. And then the last thing, Steve, the recovery ratio, I think it was pretty
much a high time this time, this quarter. I mean is it going to stay up where it is?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, I mean, Rich, I'd tell you in a weird sort of way, the recovery ratio, the way – those
of us who have been around a while and historically thought about it, it's kind of less relevant now because we're
90-plus percent converted to fixed-CAM so the CAM charge is just another fixed charge that the retailer looks at in the
calculation of the total occupancy cost that they're paying to the landlord.
Our six CAM all have individual annual escalators. And if you look at our operating costs, they've been pretty flat and
in as long as that's the case, you're going to see the recovery ratio the way developers have traditionally thought about it
continue to increase.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: But I will tell you, just in terms of our ability to drive rents, if you go back, and we've
given you some of the quarters in the K, but our occupancy cost is down over 100 basis points since 12/31/2010. So
we're still providing very good profitability and value for our retailers.

Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore Partners.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Yes. Hi, thanks. David, you made some comments last quarter that demand is picking up in
the B mall category that sales were actually okay. So three, four months into the new year, is that still the situation
generally that the B mall segment continues to perform okay?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: All right. Yes, I mean, yes it is.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. And then also maybe for Steve, based on some of your recent conversations with
lenders; are the lenders taking a more conservative approach maybe to the B mall category given, obviously, what's
happening at JCPenney?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, Ben I would just say the lenders and – I assume you're referring to the secured
lenders, generally speaking have kept a more conservative posture. Loan to values are still relatively modest.
Underwriting is still relatively conservative. And that's true regardless of the quality of the asset.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. So no significant change over the past few weeks given, obviously, the new
management team at JCPenney's, and a lot of uncertainty going on with that particular anchor. Is that a fair...?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: That's fair.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay. And then maybe switching gears, you made some comments on China just now on the
back burner; tough to find opportunities to make money. Can you just elaborate a bit on some of the challenges that you

see in China today that make you a little more cautious because I do recall that you guys did go to China a few years
ago, doing some one-on-one with anchor tenants and I'm curious what you see today that makes it so very challenging
for you guys?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, that was a very good experience and we brought 70 – look, any time you invest capital
and you only bring 70% of it back home, you learn a lesson. And I would say Ben, generally, the ability to underwrite
the product there in terms of what the tenants are going to pay, what the costs are, what the approval process is, all the
elements of the P&L and pro forma, including construction costs, land cost, permitting; it's all very -not to say that
people can't make money there, but it's all very difficult to really have a high degree of confidence.
And when you think of the risk associated there, you would hope that the returns are better, at least on the piece of
paper that you're ready to make the investment on. And frankly, they're not and that's what – that's where the big gap
exists. And so a lot of it is build it and they will come and that plays out pretty badly in real estate development. I mean
it's certainly – build it and they will come in the U.S., as Rick knows and I know, Rick's older so he knows a little bit
more than I know. Build it and they will come did not make every mall successful. There are a lot of malls that,
frankly, shouldn't have been built.
So it's just very tough to have the level of precision that we want. And if there were margin for error, i.e. returns on
investment that were higher, you would take the risk. I just don't see it in everything that we look at on a piece of paper
in China.
Brazil's a little bit different. You can pencil better returns there. But again, finding the right site and the right – and the
ability to build and so on is a little more tough – difficult but you do see a little bit of a – you do see much better returns
at least on a piece of paper.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Okay, very helpful. And maybe just one final one on China, I mean what type of returns would
make it more attractive for you to go into China given all the risks that you kind of elaborated on?
<A - David E. Simon>: You'll know it when we do it. And right now, I don't see anything on the drawing board that's
going to – and again, please, the fact of matter is somebody could be very successful and we could miss an opportunity.
But for whatever reason, whatever we're looking at, it's just not making sense for us. That's not to say others might not
be successful.
<Q - Benjamin Yang>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Patinkin of BMO.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Good morning.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: A couple of questions on Toronto Premium Outlet and the broader opportunity set for the
Premium Outlet brand in Canada. Hudson's Bay is opening their first outlet store there. Are you in the position to
announce any other merchants?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yes. We will, I don't know when we're going to do that but we normally do that – we normally
have done that throughout the process. But we're – we will. I mean, we're – this should be by all accounts a very
successful outlet center.

<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're already 85% leased and committed and we will be putting out a press release in the
next month or so. It's opening in August. So it's happening and it's gotten very good response from both
Canadian-based retailers but also the U.S. retailers that are operating in Toronto already.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Okay. So that was my next question. The American brands, I'm trying to assess their level
of interest in Canada. And are the Canadian brands that are going in there, are they developing a made-for-outlet
merchandising strategy similar to [inaudible] (01:09:56)?
<A - David E. Simon>: Some are. You know, some are. Now we – Hudson's Bay is a perfect example. We have a
wonderful relationship with the parent, which is as you know, Lord &Taylor and we picked up the phone and said this
– you're doing Lord & Taylor outlets in the U.S., a few here and there, you ought to do it with Hudson's Bay, and really
we generated that idea. They thought long and hard about it and they were very interested in doing that. So I do think
it'll start a trend there, no question about it.
And the U.S. folks are very interested assuming they have a full price presence ahead of that. And they'll – Canada
generally is very attractive to most U.S. retailers but not all are there. And some of their outlet concepts will be delayed
to the extent that – until they have the full price there, which is coming.
And for us, with Toronto Premium Outlets, the luxury brands are starting to hit Toronto. And what we think over time
as they hit their – we have the natural place for them to do the outlet. But again, that's going to take time. In the
meantime, we're going to have a terrific center. And we have a phase two there that will allow us to bring in the luxury
guys as they hit the kind of the greater Toronto market.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Okay. As you look at Canada, how many premium outlet caliber malls are there to build in
Canada do you think?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we expect in our – at least a one of the – this was great secret. Now you've got
three or four of the eight, but one in Mexico. Anyway, the – one of the eight, at least eight, is in Montreal which we
expect – again, another meeting today on it. But we're going to start construction on that in July. And so that's – we
think that's a good market, a very good market.
Now, it poses a little trickier leasing because a number of the U.S. brands won't go up to Quebec. But we think that's
offset by some of the international brands that really do like Montreal. In fact, Montreal is a great fashion city and they
have great malls there. And we think it's going to be a great long-term project. So we've got Montreal. Obviously,
Vancouver is a very interesting market as well. We're focused on those kind of bigger gateway areas up in Canada.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Isbee of Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Good morning.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: David, you've updated your FFO guidance after the first quarter for stronger operations. And just
going back to the first – or fourth quarter call, you said on that call it was going to be tough to match the 4.8%
same-store growth you did in 2012. Can you perhaps give us an update on those thoughts?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we – look, the first quarter was very good. We had a very – what's really impressive to
me is that it was off a really good first quarter in 2012. So that's pretty significant cash flow growth when you add the

5.7% plus the 4.8% – or on top of the 4.8% so...
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Agreed.
<A - David E. Simon>: So I am conservative by nature. I think the organization generally is – even though we
probably don't compliment them as much as we should, they're really doing a good job. So it would be – I would be
very, very excited if we maintained it. We are not anticipating that. We also kind of trended down through the year.
First quarter was better, so last year if you look, we kind of – I don't remember where we were overall for 2012, but...
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: 4.8%.
<A - David E. Simon>: 4.8%; so I think 2013, we're heading the right direction. I'm really not answering your question
but it's off to a good start is all I can tell you.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay. And then you talked about some of the fundamental strength in the B mall market. There
seems to be some new entrants into the B mall category, people looking to buy some of those [inaudible] (1:15:06)
assets, et cetera. What are your thoughts in terms of perhaps accelerating your sales out of that group and taking
advantage of the new entrants to that market?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, we're still going to prune the portfolio. So I mean it – I'm pleased that there are new
people coming into the market that are looking at deals. So I think that's good for us generally.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay. And then just finally on St. Louis, you have 97% spoken for at this point. Can you – now
that you're getting closer to the open, can you give us a little bit more, perhaps, the insight into the negotiations with the
retailers on what – why they chose your site over the competing? And what type of sales they're expecting to get out of
the deal?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, I can't – I really am not going to get into that, Nate, other than to say we presented to
them what we thought the center was going to be, like Cincinnati Premium Outlets. This was kind of how we
envisioned the productivity and the mix and that's been very – it's a quiet center but it's been well received by the
community and by the retailers. And that's how we sold it to the retailers.
Now, they have a lot of confidence that when we say we're going to build Cincinnati, they did – we did that. So that's
how we kind of sold it – and to them, in terms of how they should think about their productivity, the pricing was
similar to that. I mean, the – and we took it from there. I mean nothing beyond that really.
I mean, it was competitive, but at the end of the day, I think retailers have a level of confidence with us that – in terms
of the outlet product. I will say this, though, we got the – if it's pricing a new deal, there's not a – the outlet retailer,
generally, they know what they can afford to pay.
So as much as we'd like to say there's this great huge negotiation on rents, I mean, they're used to saying here's what I
pay on a new outlet center and that's what they pay. So they're in a very good position to bargain what the rental rate is.
I mean, the one thing they really wanted to do, they really don't like competing centers. They really like when there's
one site and then they all go. Because they don't – they know what they can afford to pay and that's what they pay.
So in Charlotte, as much as the market might think, boy, Charlotte looks like we're going to build that one center, the
retail community loved the fact that they didn't have to worry about a competing site. They really, really liked it. Now,
in St. Louis, I'm sure a number of them felt that way as well.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay. And I guess your success there hasn't whetted your appetite for another site, huh?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. Look, we've lost plenty of those too so – but – and I mean and – but it's – like I said, it's
not – it's common to partner and just get a deal done for the community, for the retailers and be done with it. In this
case, it didn't happen.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: All right. Thanks so much.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.
