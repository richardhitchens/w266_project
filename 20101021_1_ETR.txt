MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Entergy Corporation Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Today's
call is being recorded. At this time for openings and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Paula
Waters of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Paula Waters, Vice President, Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll begin this morning with comments from Entergy's Chairman and
CEO, Wayne Leonard; and then Leo Denault, Entergy's CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate
everyone with questions this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions. After the Q&A
session, I will close with the applicable legal statements. Wayne?
J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Paula. Good morning, everybody. With the EEI Financial Conference just over a week away, our earnings
release and our comments today will be limited to significant, recent events and 2010 financial performance. We will
provide you with an update on our longer-term financial outlook at the EEI.
Starting with the Utility, the Public Utility Commission of Texas is scheduled to discuss Entergy Texas rate case at its
next open meeting on November 10, 2010. At that meeting, the Commission will review the ALJ recommendation
regarding the competitive generation service, or CGS tariff, and the unopposed stipulation settlement agreement

addressing all other matters in the case.
To recap how we got here, in October the ALJ issued a proposal for a decision, recommending that the CGS tariff be
rejected due to the potential for a substantial shift in costs from a limited class of eligible and participating customers to
remaining customers, thus violating the basic principal of cost causation. As a reminder, legislation initially enacted in
2005 and modified in 2009 required Entergy Texas to propose a tariff that offers eligible customers the ability to
contract for competitive generation. As proposed by Entergy Texas, eligible customers would be limited to those with a
minimum of 2,500 kilowatts of demand.
In the proposed decision, the ALJ recognized that the law is clear; that Entergy Texas be made whole for program costs
and any loss of revenues from participating customers.
The decision whether to proceed with the CGS tariff, and if so, under what terms, is now before the Commission to
complete its review, as required by the Texas legislation, and then to approve, reject or modify it.
The unopposed rate case settlement filed in early August reflected a $68 million rate increase, and a 10.125% allowed
return on equity. An initial $59 million rate increase was implemented effective August 15th, subject to refund, up from
the $17.5 million increase implemented at the beginning of May. If approved, the final step-up to achieve the full $68
million increase will take effect the first billing cycle in May of 2011. As part of the unopposed settlement, the parties
also stipulated to the current level of transmission investment of $464 million that will serve as the baseline for future
annual filings for a transmission rider. That includes full return of and on additional investment above that level.
Entergy Texas expects to make its first filing to implement the transmission rider around the end of 2010 or the
beginning of 2011. The settlement agreement represents tangible progress to providing Entergy Texas a real
opportunity to earn its allowed return.
However, Entergy Texas intends to continue to work with Texas stakeholders to achieve rate recovery mechanisms that
permit full recognition of Entergy Texas cost structure and investment power needed to meet growing customer
demand. Aligning the economic interest of customers and shareholders will require efficient rate-making mechanisms,
like formula rate plans and capacity riders.
Consistent with that reality, Entergy Texas filed a petition on September 17th, which was generally supported by the
other non-ERCOT utilities, to initiate a rulemaking allowing for a purchased power capacity rider to address regulatory
lag by recovery of those costs outside continuous filings of base rate cases. The PUCT has 60 days to decide whether or
not to pursue the proposed rulemaking; and if the Commission elects to proceed, must reach a decision within six
months of publishing the rule.
In New Orleans, the city's advisors reached a settlement with Entergy New Orleans on the 2009 formula rate plan
filing, providing for an $18 million electric rate decrease retroactive to the first billing cycle of October 2010, and no
change in gas rates. This outcome resulted largely from a continued increase in the New Orleans customer base, as
rebuilding the neighborhoods in the aftermath of Katrina and return of customers continues to exceed projections. The
New Orleans City Council is expected to consider this settlement at its meeting today.
Turning to transmission, at a recent Entergy Regional State Committee meeting, Charles River Associates reported the
results of the FERC-funded independent cost/benefit study of the Entergy and Cleco regions, joining the Southwest
Power Pool RTO.
For the 10-year period starting 2013, the study projects the Entergy region, including the entities outside the Entergy
operating companies, would realize anywhere from a net cost of $438 million to a net benefit of $387 million, primarily
depending upon transmission cost allocation issues.
Various addendum cost/benefit studies, also being conducted by Charles Rivers, including the Entergy system joining
the Midwest ISO, and stand-alone studies for Entergy Arkansas joining the SPP RTO, or Midwest ISO, are expected to
be completed before the end of the first quarter 2011.

With the initial four-year term of the Independent Coordinator of Transmission arrangement expiring next month, the
utility operating companies have filed with the FERC to extend the ICT arrangement, with certain modifications, by up
to two years. This will help provide sufficient time for analysis and implementation of other alternatives to the current
structure. Entergy continues to have discussions with retail regulators to support the E-RSC's evaluation process of
post-ICT alternatives.
In other system-related matters, discussions with retail regulators continues, regarding a potential successor
arrangement to the Entergy System Agreement. This arrangement, often referred to as the Commitment, Operations and
Dispatch Agreement, or CODA, is designed to allow each participating company to realize the operational benefits of
the larger system, including energy savings from joint commitment and dispatch, and a capital savings from holding
lower overall reserve margins, while seeking to resolve the very real concerns expressed regarding the frequent historic
litigation among the parties under the current agreement. We have also committed that no Entergy operating company
will enter voluntarily into the CODA if its regulator finds it is not in the public interest.
Before leaving the discussion of recent events in the Utility business, I should address last week's announcement
regarding the civil investigative demand Entergy Corp. received from the Department of Justice. First of all, this is a
civil investigation and not a complaint. The DOJ is exploring questions and issues on a confidential basis, such as the
vertical integration of the utility and practices and policies of the Entergy utility companies related to generation
procurement, and dispatch and transmission.
The investigation is just beginning. And, of course, utilities are fully cooperating with the DOJ. At this early stage, it is
premature to speculate on when the investigation will be completed. While I cannot provide any specifics on why the
investigation was initiated, I would point out that Entergy's practices, policies and tariffs have been the subject of
thorough review and regulation by the FERC and the state regulators, and we believe our actions and decisions are
consistent with the approvals that we have received from regulators and satisfy all applicable laws and regulations. For
example, the Oasis website contains real-time information about almost anything you might ever want to know with
regard to transmission.
As noted in our announcement, Entergy became aware of the investigation during the required Hart-Scott-Rodino
review of the utility's proposed acquisition of the 580-megawatt Acadia Unit 2. The DOJ has since indicated that it
does not intend to object to the consummation of the Acadia transaction. Closing of the Acadia acquisition is targeted
for early 2011, subject to the Louisiana Public Service Commission's approval. This is the fifth plant acquisition in our
territory that the Department of Justice has reviewed without objection.
Turning to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, one of the top priorities is license renewal of existing nuclear
fleet. At Pilgrim, NRC ruling denying an intervenor's request to disqualify one of the judges on the Atomic Safety and
Licensing Board panel, cleared the way for establishing a procedural schedule to address the remaining contention
remanded for hearing. The preliminary schedule calls for a hearing by the end of the first quarter next year.
Regarding the Vermont Yankee license renewal proceeding, a New England coalition filed a brief with the ASLB
conceding that there were no further issues in dispute on the remaining matter remanded by the NRC to the ASLB.
However, the New England coalition raised a new contention on electrical cable aging management, to which Vermont
Yankee responded in mid-September.
Also during the quarter, the NRC staff issued a positive report on its audit of Vermont Yankee's license renewal
application conducted in response to the tritium leak earlier this year. The staff support raised three issues. Vermont
Yankee has addressed these three issues in an application supplement submitted to the NRC in mid-October, which was
prepared in coordination with a similar application submitted for Pilgrim.
The next milestone in the Indian Point license renewal process is the issuance by the NRC staff of the final
supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, currently expected next month. Reports released during the quarter by
the Independent System Operators in New York and New England strongly support the criticality of these units to the
system reliability in their regions.

In New York, findings in the ISO's 2010 Reliability Needs Assessment indicated the unexpected retirement of the
Indian Point units would cause an immediate violation of Reliability Standard, even considering aggressive
assumptions for energy conservation in the region. In the base case load forecast, the probability of an involuntary
interruption of load was 3.80 times higher than the Reliability Standard in 2020. The probability estimate declined from
40 times at the beginning of the planning period in the 2009 report, due to the combination of the economic slowdown
and the state's ambitious [inaudible] management targets.
However, sensitivity analysis, using what we believe are more realistic assumptions, indicated the probability of
reliability violations are much closer to the conclusion in the 2009 report, if you take out both of the Indian Point units.
Further, the New York ISO's assessment found that the New York Department of Environmental Conservation's best
available technology program, as defined under a proposed rule issued in March, creates the greatest risk for premature
retirements and for unacceptable reliability risks.
The New York ISO's President and CEO summed it up succinctly, indicating the need to carefully balance
environmental policy objectives with the reliability requirements of the electric system. Further, in early August, the
New England ISO denied Vermont Yankee's request to de-list from the 2013 to 2014 forward capacity auction, given
the studies completed to-date. In other words, without Vermont Yankee in service, there are reliability issues which
could adversely affect neighboring areas.
The ISO went on to point out that any alternative to the Vermont Yankee comes at an additional – and we might add
unnecessary – cost. Of course, reliability and safety concerns go hand-in-hand. No one takes safety more seriously than
we do.
On that subject, local concerns resurfaced in Vermont, following a recent finding of trace amounts of tritium in a water
sample taken from rock fissures beneath the plant. It's important to note that the water sample test did not indicate any
new tritium leak at Vermont Yankee. The test results confirmed the migration of the water released from the previous
leak, which was identified, sealed and repaired earlier this year within 49 days of detection.
Going forward, we remain committed to pursue greater prevention and earlier detection as part of the Exelon/Entergy
industry-leading initiatives on tritium. At the same time, we have upgraded our sampling process and our
communications with stakeholders.
Turning to our recent price hedging activity, it's clear that the commodity markets for power and natural gas have been
a tough hurdle for our non-utility business segment, and will likely continue to prove challenging for the next couple of
years.
Forward energy prices for 2011 and 2012 in New York and New England declined by an average of 10% since the end
of the second quarter, and dropped by over 25% since the 2009 EEI Financial Conference. Consistent with past
practice, we have been layering in hedges over the past year, but we have been more aggressive in accelerating this
hedging activity based on our proprietary point of view of these markets. As a result, forward energy sold is now 95%
in 2011 and 76% in 2012 at contract prices in the money by around $630 million, or EWC's nuclear portfolio.
Despite these challenging times, and with the help of near-record warm temperatures, Entergy's third quarter earnings
per share were the highest of any quarterly period in company history. For the full year, we remain on track for a sixth
consecutive year of delivering record operational earnings per share.
But we were now in a transitional period. On the one hand, we have an uncertain economic climate, challenging
commodity markets and critical nuclear license renewal activities at EWC. On the other hand, there are numerous
corporate development opportunities, including the potential acquisitions identified in the recent long-term RFP process
and alternative structures for the System Agreement and transmission operations at the utility. We also continue to
evaluate and consider available options at EWC to create and return value to our owners.
Many of you have asked if there will be a significant, strategic announcement at EEI, as has been the case at various
times in the past. Given the fact that EEI is just about 10 days away, I can tell you that we don't have any major events
ripe for announcement at this time. But we will update you on our longer-term outlook and discuss our strategies and

opportunities in more detail.
While the world's economic prospects are not as bright as they once were, or what we would hope for, we remain
grounded in the reality that it is what it is. We are committed to sound risk management, and wishful thinking about
what might have been cannot cloud our judgment and our processes.
We will not leave large positions open on the basis of look-back models, nor will we substantially increase our risk by
selling firm products that we can't back up. I can assure you we are committed to executing every day on the things we
can control, taking decisive action consistent with our proprietary point of view, maintaining financial headroom for
unexpected opportunities or threats while being ever attentive to the amount of risk and type of risks that we're
warehousing.
In closing, I am pleased to report that Entergy was named to the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for
the ninth year in a row; a distinction held by no other U.S. utility. Key areas where Entergy employees ranked best, or
among the best, were safety, environmental policy and climate change, corporate governance, and price risk
management, where we achieved the best score.
Our commitment to excellence in all these areas, as well as our over-arching financial aspiration, a top-quartile total
shareholder return remain unchanged.
And now, I will turn the call over to Leo.
Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Wayne. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover third quarter results and cash flow
performance, followed by an update of our share repurchase activity and a recap of 2010 earnings guidance. I will also
point out some highlights on financing activity over the past few months, and close with a few preliminary thoughts on
2011 drivers that we'll be discussing with you further at the upcoming EEI Conference.
Starting with our financial results on Slide 2, third quarter 2010 earnings were higher than one year ago at both the
Utility and Parent & Other, while they were lower at Nuclear. Third quarter earnings included accretion from share
repurchases from both the 2009 and 2010 programs.
Once again, this quarter as-reported results included charges associated with spin-off dis-synergies and the expenses for
outside services that are now focused on the spin unwind process. As we've previously committed, we have been
aggressively working through the process of unwinding the spin infrastructure. This unwind efforts were largely
completed in the third quarter. Excluding the special item related to the spin, operational earnings were up 15%
compared to third quarter 2009.
For factors driving quarter-on-quarter results, turn to Slide 3. First, at the utility, higher net revenue was the primary
factor driving the quarterly earnings increase. Utility sales once again increased across all customer classes, including
the effects of significantly warmer-than-normal weather throughout our service territory. Even excluding the effect of
weather, each jurisdiction had positive retail sales growth. Overall, utility retail sales grew by 8.5%, led by double-digit
performance in the residential sector. And for the third consecutive quarter, weather was a significant factor in
residential sales growth.
After a record-setting cold winter, temperatures across our service territory reached near-record levels for the second
consecutive quarter. Our regions' temperatures ranked 13th hottest of the 116 years of available data in the third
quarter. Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas temperatures were especially warm, ranking fourth, seventh and tenth,
respectively. In addition, Texas experienced record usage for four straight weeks, peaking at 65.7 gigawatts on August
30th.
Turning to the industrial sector, we continue to see the positive effects of the economic rebound and facility
expansions. Strong industrial growth continued in the third quarter at a lower level than in the second quarter,
suggesting the economic recovery may be leveling off.

In looking at specific industrial segments, the results are mixed. Chemicals, Refining and Miscellaneous Manufacturing
had been our strongest sectors, while Wood Products and Pipelines have been weak points. Primary Metals were strong
earlier in the year but softened some during the most recent quarter due to weak construction markets and lower
demand from China.
As we noted in the past few quarters, there are some tempering effects included in our industrial sales results this
quarter. The increase in net revenue from higher industrial sales volume was somewhat offset by the price effect
associated with demand charges. Recall that last year, we had the reverse situation, when the demand charges had
offset the negative impacts of lower volume. The key takeaway from all of this is that our weather-adjusted sales results
to-date align well with the assumptions we used in our full-year guidance numbers.
Regulatory actions also contributed to net revenue in the current quarter. Results reflect the rate cases at Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Texas, as well formula rate plan activity at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Louisiana. The absence of a refund reserve from the Louisiana utility companies recorded in the third quarter of 2009
also contributed.
Partially offsetting the positive effect of higher net revenue was higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense
and income tax expense. The increase in non-fuel operation and maintenance expense is due primarily to higher
compensation-related expenses and higher outage costs at generating units.
Higher income tax expense was partly due to the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments which are made across the
Entergy companies and net to zero on a consolidated basis. Other drivers at the utility were largely offsetting.
Moving on to Entergy Nuclear, this year's third quarter results declined versus 2009, primarily due to decreased net
revenue associated with lower generation attributable to both planned and unplanned outage days, and higher non-fuel
operation and maintenance expense.
The third quarter of 2010 included a portion of the scheduled refueling outage at FitzPatrick, which started on
September 12th and ended in the fourth quarter. There were no scheduled outages in the fall of 2009. There were also
approximately 21 additional unplanned outage days compared to the third quarter last year, primarily at the Indian
Point units and Palisades. Conversely, the non-utility nuclear fleet ran at a 100% capacity factor in the third quarter of
last year.
On a positive note, the realized price in the current quarter was essentially flat to the third quarter of last year. While
the average contract price decreased year-over-year, market prices on the unsold energy averaged nearly $25.00 a
megawatt hour higher, largely due to higher natural gas prices and warmer weather driving stronger demand.
Similar to the Utility business, Entergy Nuclear's third quarter non-fuel operation and maintenance expense was also
higher than a year ago. This increase was due partly to higher compensation-related expenses. Partially offsetting these
factors was a lower effective tax rate in Entergy Nuclear, driven by a reversal of the tax reserve, as well as net effects
of consolidated tax adjustments discussed earlier.
Finally, third quarter Parent & Other results were higher than a year ago, due primarily to lower income tax expense.
The income tax expense decrease resulted in part from a favorable Tax Court decision. The net effect of consolidated
tax adjustments also contributed to the income tax benefit at Parent & Other.
Moving now to Slide 4, we continue to have very strong operating cash flow performance. Third quarter 2010 OCF
was approximately $700 million higher than the third quarter of last year. Receipt of financing proceeds from Louisiana
was the primary driver. Other factors, both at the utility, include the higher net revenues, partially offset by higher
working capital requirements.
At the end of the third quarter, Entergy's consolidated gross liquidity stood at over $4.1 billion, comprised of 1.9 billion
in cash and cash equivalents, and 2.2 billion in untapped revolver capacity. One reason for this strong liquidity was the
parent notes financing completed last month. With a very favorable interest rate environment, we initiated and closed
$1 billion of permanent debt at the parent company, with approximately half due in five years and the balance in 10.

We used the proceeds to pay down a portion of the borrowings under the parent's revolving credit facility, which
expires in 2012.
We also took advantage of attractive capital markets to reduce the interest costs for our customers. In the past five
weeks, we executed more than $900 million of economic refinancings, an average coupon of 4.7%, compared to 5.6%
for the debt that was retired. We will continue to evaluate additional financing opportunities at both the utility operating
companies and the parent.
I'll now turn to the update on our share repurchase program, summarized on Slide 5. During the third quarter we
completed roughly $528 million of share repurchases, buying 6.8 million shares at an average price of $78 a share. Of
the repurchases during the quarter, 466 million were made through the existing $750 million board authorization
program. The balance was repurchased to offset the dilutive effects of stock option exercises.
As we've noted previously, we expect to complete repurchases under the current $750 million program by year-end.
Execution is subject to our ongoing evaluation of business and financial conditions and our point of view on our stock
price.
Slide 6 details our current 2010 earnings guidance, which ranges from 5.95 to 6.80 per share on an as-reported basis,
and 6.40 to 7.20 per share on an operational basis. The as-reported and operational guidance ranges remain unchanged
from the numbers we shared with you on our second quarter earnings call. As we assess our earnings performance
to-date, we believe we are well positioned relative to our full-year guidance range.
With $0.55 per share of weather on a year-to-date basis, I know many of you are wondering why we did not revise our
guidance range. It is simply due to our guidance practice to maintain the range unless factors move us out of that range.
We instead provide insight on how the major drivers are performing relative to the original guidance assumptions. It is
not meant as an indication of significant risk to our guidance range that we've not discussed with you. In fact, at this
point in the year, we will note, indications are that we will end up above the midpoint of 6.80 of operational earnings
per share.
In closing, as Wayne said, we plan to update our long-term outlook at the upcoming EEI Conference which starts on
October 31st. At that time, we plan to initiate 2011 guidance, with all the typical details on key drivers you're used to
receiving. We also plan to provide the usual preliminary roll-forward of our three-year capital plan for 2011 through
2013 as well as an update of our long-term financial outlook.
In advance of that, turning to Slide 7, we wanted to provide a few preliminary thoughts on 2011 earnings drivers. For
example, we know that the utility's 2010 sales growth has been very strong and includes significantly positive effects
from weather and economic recovery. On the other hand, we also know that we've already achieved positive results in
the regulatory arena which will benefit next year.
For Entergy Nuclear, we have observed declining price trends. However, we have only three refueling outages planned
for 2011 compared to four for 2010. We also have the $750 million share repurchase program that we expect to
complete by year-end, with the full share effect realized in 2011.
We are looking forward to seeing you at EEI to fill in more details of our financial outlook, strategies and
opportunities.
And now Entergy's senior team is available for your questions.

<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: When you look at the new hedges that you added, it appears on the surface that the pricing of
those new hedges was quite low versus where market is, even considering you had a contingent hedging. And the only
thing I can think that could explain that would be maybe a hedge mainly in your low-priced regions, like upstate New
York. Does that explain it or are we just calculating it wrong?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay, Leo.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Steve, that – I don't really want to get
into plant-by-plant where we're hedging out, but certainly there's some significant differences between zones, there's
some significant difference between plants, just as you mentioned. And so obviously the average price of those sales
are going to be driven by where we did the hedging as well as what type of hedging we've done.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. So it's possible that – is there any other...
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's possible.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Other possible explanation why the hedging would be below market?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I guess I'd just say that the hedging isn't

<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: There's a real – I mean, you're – I guess
I'm saying that you're pretty close in your estimation of why.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then the other question I have is just from the drivers for 2011. You mentioned the
benefits of the current buyback flowing through. Is there anything we should read in terms of there on – in terms of
whether you would do an additional buyback or not? Or would that just be something you'd update at EEI either way?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. We'll update that at EEI. We have a lot of
internal discussion to take place before that time period. We have a board meeting next week, and we'll review all of
our financials with them first. So we're not prepared to make any predictions about that at this time.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. Thanks. That's my two.

And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: My question, also just on hedging. You mentioned that your hedging in the quarter had to do
with point of view. Can I – did it also have something to do with the new EWC structure and the kind of re-think
around the whole commercial organization you talked about on the last quarterly call? Or is that still a sort of work in
progress?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Go ahead, Leo.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: John, as far as the hedging goes, it's
primarily driven by point of view. As it relates to organizational structure, the – certainly the kinds of things we do are
what change. And so in large part, our activity, you won't notice a big change, as I've mentioned before, due to the
organizational shift. But it's around the way we approach things, the analytics we have, all of that's going to be

certainly, it's point of view based.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. Then if I could, just on a second topic, you had – we're looking at the
quarterly cash flow statement. There was this estimated losses in reserves, inflow of the best part of 300 million. Can
you shed some light onto what that might have been?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry. Could you say that again?
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: So on the quarterly cash flow statement, the third quarter '10, 289 million of inflow from
provision – for provisions for estimated losses in reserves, was that something, or a collection of items that you could
shed some light onto what's in there?

And we'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning, guys.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi. Couple things. The uprate write-off, what was causing that? And what was the reason for
that? I'm sorry if I missed that.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We had planned a – or we had been
working on a potential uprate at one of our non-utility nuclear plants. And just with conditions where they are in the
markets and things like that, it just isn't something that we think we're going to pursue at this time.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And how much was that, I guess?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I don't know that we disclosed it.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I was just wondering. So, I mean, it was – it's market-based though?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Pardon me?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: It's market based? Is that what it basically – because the power prices just don't support it, it
does...
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's why we didn't do it. It's about $10
million, about $0.03 a share.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And the longer-term outlook and stuff, is that going to be provided at EEI? Is that why
we don't see it this time in the release?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. That's right.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And just finally, the FERC NOPR for DR, demand response, any thoughts about what
we might be seeing in terms of the impact on pricing, if that's approved as it was filed and, I guess, is being discussed, I
guess, is for full locational marginal price? Any thoughts about how that might impact markets? Or do you see any
effect of that potentially happening already or...?

We will take our next question from Vedula Murti with CDP US.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Good morning.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: Couple of things, and I apologize if you addressed this, Wayne, in your earlier comments. I
came in towards the tail end. One, can you – in terms of strategic initiatives or possibilities, can you talk at all about
any interest you may have in the UniStar situation with EDF, and what's going on with the Calvert Cliffs and
Constellation, whether there's part of Entergy Nuclear's efforts there? And then I have a second unrelated question.
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're not really going to comment on
specific transactions. Certainly, we're aware of various things that are going on in the industry. But we need to stick
with our – historical policy is really not to comment on things of that nature.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: All right. And secondarily, can you update us all in terms of – and, again, I apologize if I missed
this – in terms of the System Agreement issues with Arkansas and Louisiana and companies wanting to – or leaving the
agreement? And what types of financial consequences at this point you're seeing?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Go ahead, Gary.
<A - Gary Taylor>: Good morning. When you look at it, what we were preparing for is under the – where we are
today is Entergy Arkansas gave their notice, and as of December 2013, they would leave the System Agreement, as
well as Mississippi following up in 2015. We've done several things, and the first being is most recently, we have laid
out a structure – Wayne talked about it in his comments, called a CODA, which would give us an opportunity to
propose some changes. And we are sharing that with each of the regulators. But they also, for that specific – have a
decision to make, whether or not, if they're in agreement with it; and if they are not, we would not pursue that.
In addition to that, we have to be prepared for Entergy Arkansas to be in a stand-alone position, and several things are
dealing with that. We're basically in the process of looking at what it is actually going to take to put that into a
stand-alone condition, as we are for Mississippi. And we're looking from a transmission point of view. There's a couple
of activities. One is, where will they get transmission services from. And there's some studies that are being done. One
is whether or not they join an RTO like SPT, or whether or not they join an RTO like MISO.
Part of that study has come out just this week. And Wayne talked about it because we're also looking at it from a
system perspective under a FERC study, which basically has a range of possibility, depending on benefits, from
negative to positive, depending on transmission allocation. So pretty much we're pursuing both paths. The first to be –
to give an alternative that preserves the value of a system; and the second, then, also to be prepared for Entergy
Arkansas and subsequently Entergy Mississippi to leave the System Agreement.
<Q - Vedula Murti>: And I guess my last follow-up there, if I recall properly of the operating companies, the one that
– in terms of the imbalances or the perceived imbalances, the one that benefits the most right now, that would then have
to fill in the gap, would be Louisiana. So is there a possibility, then, that there would have to be a material cost increase
to Louisiana as part of the reshuffle here?

<A - Gary Taylor>: As we look forward to it, no, I don't see that at this point. But clearly, we've been planning for the
system, and you see that through the RFP that we've put out as far as assets that we're bringing in to meet those needs
as the system changes. But in a low gas market benefit, it's a little bit different today than it was when there was high
imbalances between the systems between Arkansas and Mississippi. So as long as we continue to see those low gas
prices, that imbalance is not anywhere near. And I think you can see that in the RPC payment. This past year it was
around $41 million from Arkansas, as opposed to the $390 million it was the previous year.

Our next question comes from Marc de Croisset with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Marc de Croisset>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Just two very quick questions. The first is very specific on
your production cost per megawatt hour. And I see that they've trended up – is it about 23% quarter-to-quarter from,
say, 22 to 28 or so. It looks like you're kind of within guidance here to-date. But can you give us any color on what's
impacting that?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Leo?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Sure. That's driven by a number of
things. Part of it's refueling outage amortization, part of it's fuel cost. And then the production costs would also include
that charge that we talked about for the uprate. That flows through O&M as well as the compensation-related expenses.
<Q - Marc de Croisset>: Great. And a quick second question. I didn't see a CapEx schedule in the press release.
Maybe I missed it. Is this something that you're updating at EEI? Is it now in a state of flux?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. We'll be updating that at EEI, the
roll-forward of the three-year CapEx.

We'll take our next question from Rudy Tolentino with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Rud Tolentino>: Hi. I know you've referred to the ISF purchases under the 2009 RFP. Can you just give me an
update about where those stand and what kind of a timeline you have for implementing those?
<A - Gary Taylor>: Yeah. I mean, right now, it's being pursued as far as looking at what deal we can negotiate with
the people that respond to that RFP. And we would expect, probably the latter part of this quarter, to really – probably
more likely the first part of next quarter, to be able to announce those. And then once we do that, then we will go to the
regulatory process that comes as a result of that, either through interim PPAs and tolling agreements and for ultimate
purchase of assets. As well as, then, there's a Nine Mile self-build that's being pursued, and that's like – I think it's like
third quarter of 2014.
<Q - Rud Tolentino>: And how long will the regulatory process take once you announce the transaction?
<A - Gary Taylor>: Typically, if you look in the past, we have been somewhere between one to two years, in that kind
of timeframe, depending on the complexity, though.
<Q - Rud Tolentino>: Okay. And then you also – and Jonathan asked about the EWC structures, and you mentioned
that you're going to do different kinds of things under that structure. Can you just kind of give a little bit more color of
what kind of things that you're going to be doing different? I mean, are you going to offer – you talk about data, but are

answer that?
<A - Richard Smith>: Yeah. I mean, we're looking at all those different things, Rudy. But, I mean, really, right now,
our objective is kind of protect the assets we got. We look at assets that come on the market, and we're always kind of
looking out for new assets. And we have been, as you can kind of see in the sold-forward table, been offering a little
different product in the market with our commodity sales. So we'll continue to kind of plow that ground over the next

Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Good morning.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Can I just go over – you said the guidance for a – just looking at what's happened the first nine
months; the weather was up like $0.55 or so. So that would kind of like put you above your top end of your range.
What were the negative factors? I guess one is the nuclear pricing. But is there other negative factors which have
happened in the nine months why you wouldn't be like at the top end of the range or surpassing it?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. There is a number of things.
There's the financing that we've done at the parent versus what we were paying for the revolver. It's kind of a long-term
versus short-term decision in terms of where we would go with that. We also had some of the O&M issues that I talked
about that are driving more of a – some of those are more nonrecurring type of things; the payroll-related expenses,
we've got the write-off of the uprate that we talked about, we've had some pressures from pension costs because of
discount rates, those sorts of things that have rolled through as well. So all of that goes to kind of – this again, we're
going to – right now, we'd be indicating we're above the midpoint, but not outside the range.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. And then if I can just – based on the data that you've provided, I guess this year the pricing
is going to come up – the factors that you've kind of mentioned, the pricing for this year is going to be like somewhere
in the 59 average on the nuclear. And based on hedges that you've provided, I guess it's 55. So what we are looking for
is really like a $4 decrement, is that correct? But we will have – it will be offset somewhat with an extra terrawatt hour
of generation? Is that the right way to look at it from the data that you've provided?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: For next year?
<Q - Ashar Khan>: For next year.
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. I mean, we're going to end up
with a little more generation. But certainly the prices – market prices have changed, and hints why we've hedged out so
much.

We'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Hi. Could you just give an update on the PPA discussions in Vermont and where those stand?
<A - J. Wayne Leonard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Rick?
<A - Richard Smith>: They're still progressing. And, I mean, it's a slow process with them. I mean, we're – a lot of
terms and conditions that we're going back and forth on. And like I said at some of the investor conferences, I expect
that we'll get that wrapped up by the end of the year.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: And then could you just – you had a $0.30 swing at parent. Can you kind of parse out the bigger
pieces of that?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, the biggest piece of that has to do
with taxes and a favorable Tax Court ruling that we had associated with – just in the scheme of how these things play
themselves through – a 1998 issue.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Can you quantify that?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: That's about $0.25.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Well, then just on the 2011 early look, can you – how much was – how much floating is going to
be, or has been swapped into fixed?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: I'm sorry. What are you referring to?
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: As your 2011 early look, you've mentioned financing costs...
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Okay.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Of getting out of the revolver. Just how much notional is that?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We've got $1 billion of term debt.
<Q - Paul Ridzon>: Is there more coming?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: It's possible. We're looking at – given
today's interest rate environment, we're looking at – again, we did over $900 million at the utilities as well. So we're
looking at both the utilities and the parent for more opportunities there.

<Q - Tom O'Neil>: Good morning. It's actually Tom O'Neil. How you doing?
<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Hi, Tom.
<Q - Tom O'Neil>: Just had a quick question for you on the revolver. In the past, that's had limitations on the buyback,
I think, for the debt-to-cap ratio. And just curious how you're thinking about that and what limitations you're facing
with regard to the debt as you're terming it out.

<A - Leo Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: As far as it relates to the revolver or
anything that we would have with covenants, I mean, those – that may or may not be an issue; certainly not an issue at
the moment. As far as – with the revolver, comes due in 2012. We continue to look at what's the right timing and
structure for that going forward. As far as it relates to buybacks, it's really more of an overall issue. It's not related
specifically to the revolver in any way, Tom. It's more related to a combination of business mix, of cash flow
production and credit ratings are all mixed into one; making sure we have the right liquidity profile, et cetera. So it's not
specifically related to the revolver in terms of what we may or may not do with repurchases.
I will say that as it relates to the financing that we've done – currently, the longer-term financing, we did have some
longer-term debt that was in place between 2002-2005 timeframe that matured during the pendency of the spin. And as
that matured, rather than replace it, we were looking at a re-capitalization coming out of the spin, so we didn't take
advantage of anything at that point in time. So really, the billion – there was about a 1.4 billion of that debt at the
current level at that time.
So we've got $1 billion of longer-term debt now. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's anything different than where we
stood before we started the spin-off process. Not really terming out the revolver; it's just really re-capitalizing the way
we were already beforehand. And at this point, we don't have any plans that any incremental debt that we would do at
the parent or any more financing we would do at the parent, we wouldn't intend that currently to be incremental debt.
Again, that's all a function of our liquidity profile, the cash flow metrics and what's going on in the non-utility business,
and what our credit ratings are. They're all part and parcel to that decision.
