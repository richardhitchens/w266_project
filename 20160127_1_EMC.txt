Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony. I would like to begin by welcoming everyone to our Q4 earnings call. Thank you for joining us. This
morning I will focus my formal remarks on three areas: trends in the macro environment and IT spending; a review of
our businesses; and lastly, an update on the progress on our deal with Dell.
From my perspective, our results in Q4 were mixed. While I am pleased to report non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, I was
disappointed that we fell a bit short on revenue, which was $7.01 billion, essentially flat year on year. However, I
would like to point out that it follows 24 consecutive quarters of reporting year-on-year top line growth. That's an
accomplishment that very few of our technology peers matched.
I am proud of the more than 70,000 talented and dedicated people across the EMC family of companies. Despite all the
distractions caused by the announced merger with Dell and a volatile global economy, they worked diligently along
with our valued partners and focused intently on our customers and their needs. My deepest thanks to all of you.
Let me now turn and comment on several macro trends we are seeing in the global economy and in information
technology and how they are playing out and affecting our customers and the IT industry. Looking back on 2015, it was
quite a tumultuous year. In 2015 we experienced a sharp decline in revenues in a significant number of the emerging
market countries we serve as these economies came under pressure. We experienced business declines in Russia and
parts of the Middle East on the back of geopolitical unrest there. We experienced declines in our business in China as
the country faced issues with their equity and housing markets that lead to a lowering of IT imports. And we
experienced significant currency fluctuations and a strong dollar.
At the same time in 2015, we experienced an acceleration of three-plus broad secular IT trends, which we have been
maniacally focused on for quite a while. The first trend was led by the billions of smartphones and connected devices in
use, which generate massive amounts of valuable data. The second trend is that more and more companies are
embarking on a digital transformation journey to capture and exploit this massive data trove to become more intimate
with their customers, more connected with their supply chains, and more in tune with their employees and partners. The
third trend is that enterprises are accelerating their move to hybrid cloud computing. In other words, our customers are
deploying cloud computing architectures across their private clouds, managed clouds, and public clouds to help
increase speed, agility, and ease of use at lower price points. And lastly in 2015, on the back of these three macular IT
shifts, we saw a heightened need for a new wave of cybersecurity oriented towards addressing increasingly pervasive
advanced threats.

As companies transform their businesses, we see them changing their traditional operational models and buying
patterns. To fund these new initiatives, customers are reducing costs in their traditional applications and infrastructures.
As a result, this is one of the most disruptive periods in the history of IT for vendors as they manage customer
transitions from the old to the new, but these shifts also create enormous opportunities.
EMC recognized these trends early, and we began shifting our strategy several years ago to assure we were
well-positioned to manage through the disruptive portions of these secular trends, and more importantly to be
positioned to capture the massive growth opportunities these shifts will avail. Today, we have a broad portfolio of
innovative offerings in each of the major growth areas. Let me give you a quick update in each of our businesses,
starting with Pivotal.
Pivotal continued its strong customer momentum and growth, as is highlighted by their work with Mercedes-Benz,
helping the automaker design and bring to life its first-ever connected car application, a great sign that Pivotal is
disrupting traditional middleware players and is emerging alongside Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud platform
as a leader in the modern cloud era. Pivotal now works with three of the top five global automotive manufacturers on
their most important new digital transformation initiatives.
Beyond automotive, Pivotal is working with some of the leading players in the financial services, insurance, retail, and
telecommunications industries. Pivotal has the right software subscription-based business model, the right modern
cloud platform and analytics solutions, and the right software development services, all working in concert. In short,
Pivotal is uniquely qualified to help the world's largest enterprises successfully transform into great software
companies.
VMware had a solid quarter with 10% revenue growth. They exited 2015 with over $6.6 billion in total revenues. Their
high-growth emerging businesses, including areas like virtual networking, end user computing, and Virtual SAN, did
especially well last quarter. As Pat [Gelsinger] told you yesterday, VMware's end user computing business joined both
compute and management as $1 billion-plus businesses. And NSX is on fire, with 100% year-over-year growth and
exiting 2015 with a $600 million run rate. VMware is one of those rare technology companies that has maintained
growth as they managed the transition from a maturing core platform and vSphere to their new growth engines.
In cloud, I am especially encouraged by VMware's new multi-cloud multi-device strategy. They will provide customers
with the ability to run, connect, and securely manage their applications across private clouds, the managed clouds
provided by their cadre of DCAM [Data Center Automation Manager] partners, and across the mega-cloud providers.
Again, this is a compelling value proposition for customers, one that VMware can uniquely deliver.
Finally, as we announced earlier, Zane Rowe will be taking over for Jonathan Chadwick as CFO of VMware. I want to
thank Jonathan for his service these past few years, and I am extremely excited that Zane remain in the family and
bring his considerable leadership skills to VMware. I know he will do an outstanding job.
I am also pleased that Denis Cashman, a 28-year veteran at EMC and currently our Chief Accounting Officer and the
CFO of EMC II, will take over as EMC's CFO. I have worked closely with Denis for 16 years. I have tremendous
confidence in his capabilities.
Turning to EMC II, we believe that three technology trends are dramatically changing the storage and data center
landscape, namely flash, software-defined technologies, and converged infrastructure. We understood early on how
these three technologies would improve cost, performance, and agility for our customers, and we invested heavily in
these three areas.
In flash technology, EMC II pioneered the introduction of flash into all of its arrays as a performance accelerator. They
also acquired XtremIO and introduced a truly innovative all-flash scale-out array into the storage market. And since its
introduction, XtremIO has experienced explosive growth and is the clear market leader by a wide margin.
EMC II has also embarked on an important initiative to rearchitect their VMAX and VNX product families to use the
next generation of flash technology optimally. These efforts take time. And as a result, we saw declines in these
products in Q4 as customers anticipated these new product introductions. The really good news, as you will hear from

David Goulden, is that both VMAX and VNX are planning major enhancements and refreshes that will make these
systems extremely competitive in the primary all-flash storage market. This is incredibly exciting to us.
In the area of software-defined storage, EMC II invested heavily and early, and the majority of this investment was
through organic R&D. EMC II engineered innovative products like Elastic Cloud Storage for objects in the Hadoop file
system, like ViPR, our heterogeneous storage management, and acquired ScaleIO for block storage targeting
cloud-scale mission-critical applications. VMware also invested organically in software-defined storage and is
delivering rapidly-growing leading products like Virtual Volumes and VSAN. No other company is anywhere close to
having the software-defined storage assets we have between EMC II and VMware. We are the clear leader. And the
best news is that there is more to come.
Finally, converged infrastructure is another area that continues to grow rapidly. VCE had a terrific quarter. And as I
said previously, we remain very committed to our strategic partnership with Cisco. David will talk more about our CI
strategy and the fast-paced product roadmap in his remarks.
Virtustream, our newest Federation company, has fortified the EMC hybrid cloud portfolio. It ended Q4 with the
strongest bookings quarter in its history. Since our last earnings call, we've evolved our approach relative to the
integration of Virtustream. Importantly, we wanted to better leverage VMware's enhanced multi-cloud, multi-device
strategy and ensure that Virtustream continues to be a premier DCAM partner embracing VMware's technology suite.
We have decided to focus Virtustream on two key high-growth cloud opportunities. The first area is Virtustream's
heritage, namely to run complex mission-critical business applications on its modern cloud architecture, which features
Virtustream's internally development xStream software technology, a true differentiator. EMC's strength is highly
complementary here, as its infrastructure principality supports mission-critical applications across its vast global
customer base.
The second cloud area in which Virtustream will focus leverages EMC's most trusted position, the enterprise storage
arena, by offering a portfolio of cloud-based solutions for tiered data storage, archiving, backup, and disaster recovery.
To help accelerate the second cloud storage thrust, we moved EMC II's cloud-based commercial object storage service
and its managed services business into Virtustream earlier this month. Collectively, the new Virtustream will start out
life with nearly $100 million in quarterly revenue. As I've said before, we are expecting very high growth in this area.
Both Michael Dell and I are very excited about the prospects of our Virtustream business and feel that our combined
synergies will drive even higher growth rates for this business in 2016 and beyond.
Let me now turn and update you on our merger with Dell. As I said before, the coming together of Dell and EMC is a
game-changer. It creates a powerhouse in the technology industry with approximately $80 billion in revenue. Our
combined assets are better positioned to navigate the major changes in our industry and lead in the new world.
Customers have been overwhelmingly positive about this combination. They see that we will be a strategic partner with
more heft and breadth, with leading technologies that are critical to their success, technologies around digital
transformation, software-defined data centers, hybrid cloud, converged infrastructure, mobile, and security. And very
importantly, the people of EMC and Dell are embracing the combination. They understand that together we are better
positioned in the market and that this will create new and more opportunities for them over the long run.
I am pleased to report that progress on closing the transaction remains on track under the original terms and timeline.
We have filed a preliminary proxy statement and prospectus, and we are working to finalize it. We have submitted
requests for regulatory approval globally. And most importantly, our teams are working together seamlessly on
integration planning so that we are ready to go day one.
On the VMware side, Michael and I are both incredibly excited by the prospects for this great company, and I firmly
believe that Michael will be an outstanding steward for this franchise. Subsequent to the closing of the transaction,
Michael will be VMware's largest shareholder. I know he will be laser-focused on increasing the value of VMware for
all stakeholders and will ensure that VMware has the right resources and people to fully realize its potential.
Thank you again for being with us today. I'd now like to turn it over to Zane to take you through the quarter.

Zane C. Rowe
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our consolidated results and provide some
additional detail on Pivotal, VMware, and EMC Information Infrastructure. First I'd like to add my thanks to the
extended team across our organization for all their efforts and focus this quarter.
Our Q4 consolidated revenue totaled $7 billion, flat year over year and up 3% on a constant currency basis. EPS was
$0.65.
Our regional results were heavily impacted by currency fluctuations and the economies of a few countries.
Consolidated revenue in North America was flat year over year. EMEA was down 1% as reported and up 7% on a
constant currency basis. APJ was flat year over year as reported and up 4% in constant currency. The region continues
to be significantly impacted by softness in China. Latin America was down 16% as reported and down 5% in constant
currency. Brazil continues to be a challenging market in this geo.
For the full year 2015, consolidated revenue was $24.8 billion, up 1% year over year and up 5% on a constant currency
basis. EPS was $1.82.
Looking at the quarterly results for the three major businesses, Pivotal grew revenue 25% year over year. As we've
previously mentioned, Annual Recurring Return, or ARR, is another way of measuring Pivotal's progress as they have
been transitioning from a license to a subscription model. In Q4, total ARR was over $100 million, up 40%
sequentially, with strong performance in all geographies and product areas.
Pivotal had tremendous customer momentum during Q4, highlighted by Ford Motor Company's announcing a
three-year strategic collaboration with them. Beyond automotive, in the fourth quarter Pivotal booked the largest cloud
foundry deal in history with a Fortune 50 retailer. Pivotal continues to expand its customer base across many industries,
including automotive, financial services, insurance, retail, and telecommunications.
VMware revenue was up 10% year over year and up 13% in constant currency. There were a number of highlights this
quarter, in particular with the emerging parts of the business. In Q4, end user computing license bookings, including
AirWatch, grew over 20% year over year on a constant currency basis. EUC is now at over $1.2 billion total bookings
annual run rate. VMware has greater than 62,000 EUC customers across the desktop, mobile, identity, and content
collaboration solutions. We believe it continues to gain share against the competition in both desktop and mobile.
There was also continued strength with VMware's NSX network virtualization solution. NSX Q4 bookings were up
over 100% versus last year, with an annual bookings run rate of over $600 million.
VMware also had the largest enterprise agreement quarter in the company's history. Forty-two percent of the bookings
in the fourth quarter came from enterprise agreements, with more customers taking advantage of the expanded solution
offerings.
EMC Information Infrastructure revenue was $5.1 billion, down 4% year over year and down 1% in constant currency.
The storage business within EMC II was also down 4% year over year and flat in constant currency.
As Joe mentioned, while the spending environment remains challenging, the major trends in IT remain intact. We're
encouraged by the discussions we are having with customers regarding how EMC and eventually the combination of
Dell and EMC can help them with their digital transformation. In addition, we have an exciting lineup of new and
refreshed products coming this year, which will offer customers compelling functionality and value. David will provide
more details on our Information Infrastructure business in a few minutes.
Taking a look at gross margin trends for the quarter and the year, the results were significantly impacted by the change
in VCE accounting and FX. For Q4 gross margin was 63.6%, down 180 basis points as reported. However, adjusting
for the impact of VCE accounting and FX changes, gross margins were up 40 basis points year over year. In 2015 the
reported gross margins were 62.4%, down 160 basis points as reported. And adjusting for VCE and FX, gross margins
improved by 50 basis points year over year. In Q4 gross profit was up 1% versus last year, excluding the impact of
VCE accounting and FX changes. On a reported basis, gross profit was down 3% year over year, with a net impact to

EPS of $0.05.
Operating expense was up 3% excluding the impact of VCE accounting and the benefit from FX. Operating expense
was up 5% year over year as reported.
Within EMC II, excluding the impact of VCE accounting and the benefit from FX, operating expense was down 2%
year over year due to good expense control by the team. On a reported basis, operating expense impacted EPS by
$0.05.
Other income improved year over year. The largest portion of this benefit was once again the elimination of the VCE
expense from this line last year. The net benefit to year-over-year EPS was $0.04. Lower share count helped EPS by
$0.03 versus last year.
We ended the quarter with $14.8 billion in total cash and investments and $1.2 billion in EMC domestic cash excluding
VMware. We returned $229 million to shareholders via a quarterly cash dividend, and we did not repurchase any shares
in Q4. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion for the quarter. We generated $3.9 billion in free cash flow for the year, which is
close to the forecast we shared with you in July.
We're on track with the $850 million cost reduction and business transformation plans we announced last year. In Q4
we achieved our initial $50 million in expense reduction target. Most of the aggregate cost reductions are coming from
our non-head count related initiatives. And we're making significant progress in numerous areas, including direct
materials and manufacturing, process simplification and integration, and third-party spend. We're making great
progress in and expect to exceed our cost reduction goals. And I want to thank the teams for all their efforts towards
achieving these targets.
We are confident in the combined strength and future of Pivotal, VMware, EMC II, and now Virtustream. These
companies offer an unparalleled portfolio of industry-leading products and solutions. Combined with Dell, we will
build one of the world's premier IT powerhouses, which will further benefit our stakeholders and customers. Together,
we will seize the opportunity to capture synergies across this enhanced portfolio. The combined business will have
significant free cash flow generating capability and a powerful balance sheet. The financial strength of this combination
will enable us to grow and lead the IT industry.
On a personal note, I look forward to staying in the family, and I'm excited about joining the VMware team to help
drive long-term growth and shareholder value. I couldn't be more pleased to welcome Denis Cashman to his new role.
He will do a great job.
With that, I will now turn the call over to David to discuss the EMC Information Infrastructure business. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Zane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I would also like to thank the entire EMC
II team for their hard work and focus to ensure that EMC continues as the industry leader as our industry goes through
one of the biggest transformations in its history.
As we look at the external environment, customers continue to be in either transactional or transformational spending
mode, and in some cases both at the same time. Customers in a transactional spending mode are buying just enough and
just in time for their traditional environments, and we saw this in our strong maintenance renewal bookings throughout
last year.
Customers in transformational mode are either transforming their existing IT systems towards a hybrid cloud or
building and deploying new digital applications to transform their business. In either of these scenarios, they need a
modern data center infrastructure based on flash, scale-out, software-defined, cloud-enabled, and trusted technologies.
Against this market backdrop, our storage business performed broadly in line with our recent expectations for the year
and grew 3% in constant currency for the full year. In Q4, we saw a little more pressure in our high-end and mid-tier

business related to product cycles, and we're addressing those very early this year.
Within storage, our emerging storage did very well and became our second largest product-related bucket in Q4. I want
to clearly point out that we've been actively investing in innovation and transforming our storage portfolio well ahead
of our peers to position us where IT budgets are moving and to accelerate our leading position in the next wave of IT.
Our market share in the emerging category is higher in most cases than our share in traditional storage, which is a good
indicator for the future.
In flash, XtremIO, our all-flash array, extended its market lead. Bookings for 2015 were well over $1 billion. We also
achieved over $1 billion in revenue in 2015 as well. Another way of looking at this, XtremIO's Q4 revenue exceeded
the cumulative revenue for the last four quarters of our closest public competitor in this space.
As well as outselling the competition, we continue to out-innovate them with unique capabilities like our recently
introduced Integrated Copy Data Management, or ICDM. ICDM allows administrators and application owners of
critical enterprise applications like Oracle and SAP to make and automate the management of instantaneous and
space-efficient virtual copies of their production data.
Flash is not about a single product. It's a key technology across our portfolio. And later this quarter, we'll take another
quantum leap in flash with the launch and GA of DSSD. DSSD will change the game for flash in the enterprise,
delivering mind-blowing performance, bandwidth, and latency for high-performance business applications like Hadoop
analytics and ultra-high-performance databases. We believe that DSSD is unique and highly differentiated in the
marketplace.
This quarter we will also introduce a new flash-optimized all-flash VMAX that will significantly change the way flash
is deployed in high-end primary storage. And in Q2, we'll introduce a new flash-optimized mid-tier storage family,
which will change the use cases for flash in the mid-tier.
Converged infrastructure continues to grow considerably faster than the infrastructure market in general. And in 2016,
we expect that over 20% of all external storage will be purchased as part of a CI system. EMC continues to lead in
converged infrastructure. VCE had a very good year and exited the year with an annualized demand run rate of over $3
billion. Multiple customers are spending more than $10 million annually with VCE. And our largest customer, who is
also a new customer, spent over $70 million with us, highlighting that customers are shifting towards buy versus build,
and as a result are seeing better TCO, faster outcomes, and a more agile business.
After successfully integrating VCE with EMC II this past year, we look forward to a continued strong partnership with
Cisco for extending our lead in Vblocks and for networking systems across our CI portfolio.
As a recognized leader in the integrated infrastructure systems or what we call the block category of CI, according to
both Gartner and IDC, we are now expanding our CI portfolio to include blocks, racks, and appliances to create the
most comprehensive converged platforms lineup in the industry. In Q4, we introduced our new rack-scale,
hyper-converged platform, VxRack. We are encouraged by our early wins and growing pipeline for VxRack.
An important focus for us in 2016 is the nascent, rapidly growing hyper-converged appliance market segments. For the
last several months, EMC and VMware have partnered very closely to develop a new next-generation, hyper-converged
appliance family that uniquely leverages technology from EMC, VMware, and VCE, and will change the game in this
part of the converged infrastructure space. Stay tuned for an exciting joint EMC-VMware announcement in a few
weeks' time.
In the software-defined storage space, ViPR, ECS, and ScaleIO had a good year with both service provider customers
and with large enterprises that are in transformational mode. We also released software-only versions of the VNX and
Isilon this past year, and we will continue to strengthen our SDS portfolio with new releases coming this year,
including a virtual edition of Data Domain.
While our products provide the modern data center infrastructure building blocks for our customers, the truly
transformative business opportunities for EMC come from our Federation solutions such as the enterprise hybrid cloud
[EHC], the native hybrid cloud, and the business data lake to help customers accelerate time-to-value for their

transformational initiatives. For example, when one of the largest Fortune 100 healthcare organizations was looking to
transform their current IT systems, they selected our Federation EHC solution to help modernize and automate their
current data centers. And for the next phase in their IT transformation, they're working with Pivotal Labs to embrace
agile programming and deploying Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data suites to build their next-generation
apps and data fabrics.
Now turning over to our security business, RSA continues to make progress to transition the mix and momentum in
their business towards their growth areas. And for the year, its growth portfolio was up double digits. And our
enterprise content management business grew its license bookings whilst also improving profitability for the full year.
In closing, I'm very excited about our position in 2016. We have significant new announcements in the first half of this
year to further expand our storage and converged infrastructure portfolio. Our entire storage and converged
infrastructure portfolio is built on the architectural pillars of the modern data center. These pillars are flash, scale-out,
software-defined, cloud-enabled, and trusted technologies.
At EMC II, we are uniquely positioned to help our customers modernize and automate their data center infrastructures
to set the foundation for their IT and business transformations. Furthermore, as the EMC Federation, we can help drive
our customers' full IT and business transformation initiatives as well. Finally, our combination with Dell promises to
change the enterprise IT landscape forever by creating an IT powerhouse with an unmatched portfolio, scale, and reach.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for Q&A. Tony?

Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you try and limit yourself to one
question including clarifications. This will enable us take as many questions as possible. We thank you all for your
cooperation in this matter.
Tori, can we have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mr. Steve Milunovich with UBS. Sir, your
line is now open. You may ask your question.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you very much. Joe, I wanted to get your sense on a couple trends in the industry
that you alluded to. On the flash side, I think a study that you funded suggests that through compression and so forth
you could take 18 terabytes and put them into three terabytes. So it appears flash could be extremely deflationary on
storage industry revenues. I was curious what your thoughts are on that.
And then also, do you believe that standalone storage companies can survive in the future given the importance of the
converged platform and obviously your merging with Dell?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Steve, I'll let David start. He's one step closer. Obviously, as I said, flash is one of the
mega-trends that's changing the infrastructure business forever, the infrastructure hardware business and software
business forever, and I'll let David comment. And you're right, I do think that. I do believe that as you get to a certain
size – and certainly we're there and many others are there – playing in storage alone is not a good strategy for the
future. David told you 20% of storage will be sold as part of converged infrastructure. That number is growing
incredibly rapidly. So obviously, that's not where you want to be in life, and that's part of where we've been moving the
company over the years, and it's also part of, in my heart, of what we're doing in this merger with Dell.

<A - David I. Goulden>: So, Steve, on the technology side, obviously flash has moved a long way. And we, in my
comment, referred to a number of announcements we're going to be making this quarter. Without revealing too much of
them, you'll certainly hear us talk about 2016 being the year where we really believe that all-flash systems should be
the standard for primary storage. So that will be a big shift from where the market was. And so talking more in hybrid
terms, we really think that the technology has advanced to the stage that with the latest 3D NAND technology and
things like 3.8-terabyte drives, which of course you need to architect your system to optimize to use something that big
and that fast, which is why we talked about the rearchitecting. We can really come to market with a complete family of
VNX, VMAX, XtremIO, DSSD, leveraging this latest technology and basically use all-flash all the time for primary
storage.
Now when it comes to the kind of data compression technology you were talking about, that really is application
dependent. One of the things that makes these systems price competitive, in fact, maybe even more so than a hybrid
system, is the fact that using flash you can use compression, dedupe, and other data efficiency technologies. Those
bring the effective price per gigabyte down to about the same or maybe a little bit less than the hybrid. So depending
upon your application, with the compression, you can get maybe a 2X factor. With dedupe, you can get a little higher.
And of course, you could also do instant snap copies and things which you can't do as effectively with disk.
So it's really bringing systems down to the same effective price. It's not massively deflationary because they're still
much more expensive raw media. But you can do more things with that media and basically produce a flash system
which is effectively the same price per effective terabyte as a hybrid but gives you much more performance.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Steve, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Steve Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. You may ask
your question.
<Q - Steven Fox>: Thanks, good morning. Just along the similar lines but maybe a bigger picture question, as you look
at your whole emerging storage platform and how end users are changing their storage use cases, can you talk about
how that plays into your portfolio in 2016? What is accelerating maybe a little bit more than maybe you thought just 90
days or 180 days ago? And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Steve, sure. This is David. Let me take that. Obviously, just to ground ourselves on where we
were, we were very pleased with how the emerging storage portfolio came and grew during the year. And as we
predicted all the way back in January, we actually did get to a situation in Q4 where it became the largest
product-related bucket (sic) [second-largest product-related bucket] out of those three which we've historically given.
Whilst we're not giving you any overall detail for 2016, we expect to see continued strong growth in that area. If you
think of the key technologies in there, things like Isilon, things like XtremIO, our software-defined storage, those are all
being driven by some of the secular trends that Joe talked about.
I think the other thing is relating back to our prior answer, we do expect in our mid-tier and in our high end this shift to
all-flash all the time to really give us some revised growth opportunities in those markets as well. So I think the
portfolio going into 2016 is just in great shape.
<Q - Steven Fox>: Great. And then just real quick, the 20% number you talked about for CI, how does that change
during the course of the year?
<A - David I. Goulden>: This is an interesting data point. It's a little bit we're trying to intersect two market trends.
One, how big is CI? How fast is it growing, and how much of the total storage marketplace is consumed in the form of
CI? When we talk about 2016 being a little over 20%, we think it's probably three or four points more than it was in
2015, which shows a pretty big increase in adoption when you think of how large the overall storage marketplace is,
and the CI is becoming an increasingly important piece of it.

<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: And don't think of it as only from – a lot of questions come I think from a hardware
perspective. But think of why we did VMware and the value now in the software-defined data center, software-defined
networking, software-defined storage, software-defined compute. Think of it in terms of CI, which David talked about.
Think of it in terms of cloud. This is one of the reasons we're taking so many assets out of VMware CI and putting
them into Virtustream to make sure that we get those cloud services offerings. And so there's a great opportunity in
what we are doing. And of course, doing more with Dell we think will bring us to the next level and make this
company a real winner long term.
<Q - Steven Fox>: That's very helpful.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. You may ask your
question.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thank you. Joe, you said you were confident in the deal closing on the terms of the Dell
deal. There's obviously a lot of concern that Dell may have difficulty raising the funds for the transaction given the
markets. And the stock is actually – your stock has been trading below the cash offer on the deal at certain points in
time. So any specifics you can share on what gives you that confidence in the deal closure and on the original terms?
And are there any backup plans that you or the board are considering? And if you could give us a timeline of key dates,
I think that would be extremely helpful. Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Let me start here because you gave us about five questions embedded in that one. This is a
really big deal, and there's a lot of noise in the system, and there's a lot of – a lot of people have a lot of opinions. A lot
of them are not based on a lot of fact. But there is an increased – and certainly as we're doing this, there's a
tremendously increased market volatility, and I think it's really fair to say this environment has not been kind to any
security.
So what gives us strength is we have a binding, solid merger agreement in place. We are highly confident on the
contractual terms we have in place that we will meet those contractual terms. There are significant penalties in place
both ways if this doesn't happen. The banks are fully committed. And again, you asked, what does that mean? It means
that the banks have told us that they can raise the money. We're split-rated. There are things we can do to even improve
that rating that you've got to speak to Dell about. So this gives us confidence.
If you look at our progress, if you look at our cash flow, we are right on target. If you look at how we're performing
against peers, these are all important metrics. How we're performing against our peers, we're performing better than our
peers. That's why I pointed out that as reported – forget about currency – we've had 25 quarters now in a row, the last
one being flat and the previous 24 growing year on year. There are very few companies that are really our peers that
weren't born in the cloud era, so to speak, that can say that. So basically we're going to perform.
And then of course, you asked about the timing. We've said that the S-4 is filed. When it becomes effective, we'll be
more aggressive out there with you. But the timeline for this deal closing is still between May and October, and that
will be probably dependent on a couple of the foreign regulatory – or foreign antitrust approvals. So we're confident.
We know what we're doing. And again, focus on cash flow, our cash flow is really good.

<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess I wanted to maybe drill into the macro commentary
you started off with, Joe, a little bit. And, Zane, if you've got stuff to add to this, I'd be interested as well. The North
American growth rate was relatively flat in Q4, I think year over year about 0.8%. We also saw deterioration in LatAm.
I guess I'm curious on a couple of fronts. One, I'd like to get a little bit more color on what you think trajectory looks
like regionally.
And then, Joe, maybe if you could, comment a little bit on where you think we are in the enterprise budget setting
process, particularly in the U.S. right now. Is there a lot of visibility on where enterprises are going to reset budgets, or
is that coming later? Just what do you think the outlook is this year for enterprise IT spending? Thanks.
<A - Zane C. Rowe>: Hey, Rod. This is Zane. I'll start, and then Joe can give you an update. As I discussed, when
look on a constant currency basis, I actually thought that things came in, I would say, as expected were it not for a
number of key countries within those economies. Obviously, we've seen softness in China all year, and that had a
meaningful impact on our APJ results, which would have been positive were it not for the Chinese impact. And then
even EMEA was impacted by Russia, which was down significantly. And then of course, Latin America, we're seeing
probably more widespread pressure in Latin America, but of course that was heavily influenced by Brazil as well.
As far as we're not getting into guidance into the year, but I would say we generally are expecting things to continue as
they are. We're not expecting dramatic shifts as we look at the future in any of those economies around the world.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I think two comments. When you look at the U.S., a lot of that was on the back of what David
pointed out. I've been very forthcoming in saying the majority of what's happening in IT is on the back of these huge
secular trends that we've talked about many times. But that doesn't mean there are not cyclical effects. And you saw the
bigger stall in the U.S. because the U.S. is probably better in tune with the product cycles that we're having in products
like VMAX and VNX. In this world, nothing is kept a secret. So I think these two new refreshes and systems that
David's talking about are huge to us, and I think that was an effect. So we did have a product cycle effect here for sure,
and most of that showed up in the U.S. first, as it always does.
In spending trends at our customers, I don't think any customer in the world is holding back now on what they're
willing to spend on security, especially security around protecting against advanced threats, not inside the firewall, not
mode protection. They're really picking it up in that area, and David said we're seeing that. They're also spending
significantly and big on digital transformation. And of course, they are spending some money and saving some money
on basically how do I modernize my private cloud and use and get the benefit of using public cloud. So this cloud
strategy is both a positive and a negative. And that's why we think things like VMware's new multi-cloud, multi-device
strategy is important, things like Virtustream are important, things like our software-defined storage is important. So
we think we're well positioned there. And again, I'll go back to our track record versus others, which is really a key
metric in this deal. It's very solid.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, next question, please?

Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.
<Q - Jayson A. Noland>: Okay, great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the all-flash array market, Joe. It looks like
you'll have four different products on the market, XtremIO, VMAX, VNX, and DSSD coming here pretty soon. It
sounds like there are specific parts of the market that have different needs. And then the competitive dynamics, there
are lots of different players. Who do you see the most often? Do you expect the legacy players to have a big play in
all-flash also?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Why don't I let David and then I'll make a couple of comments. Before David goes, maybe I'll
start a little bit. There's no one answer to your question. The beauty about being us is we're probably the only one that
our competitors see everywhere. We see different competitors in different tiers, and we're introducing I think what's
going to be an incredibly exciting DSSS product, which you know is way above where storage sits today. It's probably

more high-end flash pricing but more memory kind of DRAM kind of performance. So basically, if you look at the
strata, we're saying there's DRAM, there's the DSSD tier, there's high-performance primary storage, so we're basically
using flash up and down the line.
And with that, I'll turn it over. And so we're the only ones I know that are playing with software-defined. We're the
only ones I know that are playing flash as broadly and as significantly as – I don't know of any company. I can't think
of any competitors doing what we're doing. Go ahead, David.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Jayson, I'd just pick up on Joe's comments. I think we've demonstrated successfully we can
manage the portfolio. And our strength really with our big customers is the fact that we have this best-of-breed
portfolio because there's no such thing as one platform that fits all workloads. So as Joe talks about, DSSD is going to
address a whole new class of workloads. XtremIO and VMAX are playing in broadly similar markets but with different
attributes, and the new mid-tier line fits underneath that. So we really have the market exceptionally well covered, and
of course leading with an all-flash agenda in primary storage again giving away a little bit about what you're going to
hear in terms of the launch.
I think last but not least, we have key technologies like ViPR and SRM that cloak all that and make it basically very
transparent for our customers. They just see virtual ones. They don't necessarily have to know what online storage
system it's on, but we mask all that from them. So we give them the combination of this complete portfolio of products
that they can provide for different workloads and also a very consistent experience from the infrastructure system up to
the application, which has really been the power of our portfolio.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
<Q - James Kisner>: Thanks. So I was hoping you'd comment on the competitive environment in storage. Some your
smaller competitors have indicated that companies like EMC have increased their discounting recently. Is that the case?
And are you seeing the competitive environment in storage intensify, or is it really just more of the same? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure, this is David. Let me take that. Clearly in a market that certain segments of the market
have matured and the overall growth rates have slowed down a little bit, obviously it's a more competitive environment.
We've been facing into that. I can give you a couple of data points that might help you. One of the things that we've
been looking at very much all year is what does our gross margin look like in storage on a normalized basis? What I
mean by that, taking out the impacts of FX, taking out the impacts of VCE, so look at those on an apples-to-apples
basis.
And, yes, there has been an increasingly competitive environment, but our mix shift has moved positively such that the
way I look at either Q4 or the full year, our gross margin on a normalized basis is basically flat with 2015, which we
think is great given the technology shifts and the competitive pressures in the industry. So, yes, we have seen more
competitive intensity. And yes, we've been responding to that, but we've also been seeing a positive mix shift towards
some of our higher growth and richer margin products that have kept the overall profile of the business in good shape.

Thank you. Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. You may ask your
question.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Yes, thank you. Have you seen any impact on sales cycles and just overall demand as
it relates to the announced transaction, and any plans to provide transparency on which products survive under the new
parent company?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Let me comment on the first. You didn't hear us bring this up because we don't believe in
using excuses. We tell you like it is. But that said, obviously, even personally I could tell you that a deal of this size
causes angst, and you do have to take an extra lap around the track to go explain. But the good news is once you
explain to customers, once you explain to your people, both those are the important audiences, your customers and your
people, because you can't approach customers without people.
Once you get them understanding what we could create here, we do get a positive effect. But it does, as I said, cost you
another lap around the track, so it does cause angst in the system. And certainly that was some of the miss, but we
didn't allude to it at all because we think this merger is in the best interest of all parties, right from our shareholders
through our people through with customers, and we work that every day. But as we get into it more and more, it's
becoming more and more better understood. So, David, do you want to take the second part of that?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes, Katy, sure. First of all, we know very broadly there's not a lot of overlap between the
portfolios. They're quite complementary. Where there is some overlap, we're going to make sure all our customers are
looked after and everybody has a roadmap going forward with their technology platform. Now that might mean that
some platforms get merged in a common code base and things like that, but we've been very careful to make sure that
all our customers buying products right now from either company have a clear go-forward path into the future based
upon those investments.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. You may
ask your question.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. My question is for David. On the information storage business, we've seen
multiple years, since actually 2012 gross margins gradually come down. I know that there has probably an effect from
the VCE consolidation. But are we at the point at which the gross margin level in percentage terms may have troughed,
or what's been going on there? And what do you think about the various mix drivers going forward? Many thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: So, Kulbinder, I think your question was on gross margin. You broke up just a little bit there.
But I pointed out that this year was a very important year for us and that the gross margins normalized again taking out
the impact of VCE, where we did bring some additional lower-margin products into our income statement as opposed
to in other income. When you back that out and you normalize for FX, our gross margins in storage normalize. We're
basically flat for the year, and they were flat for Q4 as well.
I think that's a good sign going forward because we've been able to mix shift a lot. Obviously, over the last two to three
years, if you go back to what's happened, in fact, our gross margin normalized were relatively flat in 2014 over 2013 as
well. So you look at how much mix shift has occurred in the business over the last couple years, people thought that
obviously when the mix went away from the higher end to some of the newer segments, that would be a problem for
gross margin. On a normalized basis, it is not. I think that's a really good sign that as the mix is shifting we've been able
to hold those gross margins. And of course, in that environment, it has also become more competitive than it was a

Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is now open. You may
ask your question.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to talk a little bit about XIO [XtremIO] and
the all-flash VMAX and VNX products you guys are going to launch. Could you talk about what workloads, what
applications would each one fit into? And then very specifically, XIO I think has always been known very well for its
inline deduplication and compression capabilities. Is that something you can actually port into behind VMAX or VNX
all-flash solutions to leverage that as well?
<A - David I. Goulden>: So, Amit, this is David. I would love to answer that question, but I'm going to wait a little bit
more until we get to the product launches because if answer too much that question, I'm going to be giving away. Let
me just put it this way. The product launches are a quantum leap. What we'll talk about in the new VMAX is not just
putting a whole bunch of flash drives in an existing VMAX system. We've done a lot of rearchitecting the way that the
software works, the firmware works, the hardware works to truly take advantage of these new low write per day 3D
NAND technologies at scale, which is a lot of work. So I'd like to have that conversation in context of the product
launch. Clearly, we've thought this through. We think there's great positioning between the portfolios. They're very
complementary. And we're going to add to that with obviously what we'll do in the second quarter with the new
midrange system. But net-net, we're very excited. I don't think there's any problem here. This is all good-sized. This is
all good opportunity. But I'll get into more details when we do the launch.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, next question, please?

Thank you. Our next question is from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi, thank you very much. You talked a lot about new products on the roadmap for the
next couple of quarters. What are some of the changes in your go-to-market or in your competitive posture that you
think you can implement by being private and part of Dell that you couldn't have done as a standalone public company?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Simona, sure. That's a great question. There's all sorts of things we can do when we're with
Dell. Of course, we have to be a little bit careful about how far we go down that pathway. If you just think about it from
a very high-level point of view, EMC has a lot of strength in the enterprise market, in the global accounts. Dell plays
there. But obviously, we can provide a lot of value with those relationships and our technology footprint. Dell has
incredible strength in the mid-marketplace, in local government, in education. If you go back just a few years when
EMC and Dell had a partnership, that was worth almost $2 billion a year of revenue for EMC alone. At that point in
time, we were half the size the company that we are right now. So just the complementary nature of the go-to-market is
very, very strong.
And then the complementary nature of the products is also beneficial because we talked about the fact that storage and
service are in some ways reconverging around converged infrastructure and around software-defined running on
service. And the ability to go to our customers both large and small with a complete enterprise infrastructure portfolio
also gives us a ton of benefit. So again, it's a very area that we're very enthused about, and we've got teams looking at
how we can best optimize after we close.

<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Simona. That's all the time we have for questions. We have a few
concluding comments from Joe.
Joseph M. Tucci
First of all, thank you all for being with us today. We really appreciate it. Look, we believe in our strategy and our
ability to execute. We continue to believe that the merger with Dell is the best strategic option for our shareholders, our
customers, our partners, and our people. We believe we will close this transaction under the original terms, in the
original timeframe. Once the S-4 goes effective, we will pick up our communication with you. We'll be out there with
you. And we value you, our investors, so much. Thank you for being with us, and we will see you soon.
Operator
Thank you, speakers. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.
