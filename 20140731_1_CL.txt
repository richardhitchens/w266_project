Now, for the opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Bina
Thompson. Please go ahead, Bina.
Bina H. Thompson
And thank you, Angela. Good morning. And welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me
this morning are Ian Cook, President, Chairman, and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan, Corporate Controller;
and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.
We're happy to report another quarter of good organic sales growth, with every division participating. Consistent with
other companies in our industry, we are facing increased macroeconomic pressure in certain areas of the world.
Category growth has slowed somewhat in geographies such as Asia, a factor which we actually referenced last quarter.
On the other hand, we see some encouraging signs of slow recovery in some European markets. Competition remains
healthy, and promotional battles continue. However, our new product pipeline is as full as ever, and our commercial
investment behind our launches has increased worldwide, a careful balance between media spending and in-store
activity. And this has resulted in solid market shares growing in many categories and geographies and showing positive
trends in the most recent periods.
Our Global Growth and Efficiency Program is on track, and savings from that are supplementing our ongoing Funding
the Growth initiatives, which are as healthy as ever. Both of these contributed to our 20 basis point increase in gross
margin. Offsetting these savings were increases in raw and packaging material costs, as well as continued foreign
currency transaction pressure. Our three business service centers around the world are now up and running in Warsaw,
Mexico City, and Mumbai. The hubbing activities are complete in Europe and are well under way elsewhere in the
world, which will make us even more nimble and effective winning on the ground. And, of course, our balance sheet is
strong and cash generation solid.
So let's turn to the divisions, starting with North America. Organic sales growth in North America was modest. The
volume growth of 2.5% was, of course, on top of a very robust increase in the year-ago quarter of 6%, reflecting the
initial launch of Colgate Total mouthwash. We have an exciting innovation launching as we speak, which I'll discuss in
a moment. Pleasingly, versus the second quarter of 2013, our 2014 second quarter shares increased in toothpaste,
toothbrushes, deodorant, body wash, and fabric conditioners, and our mouthwash share held steady at about 6.5%. Trial
and repeat numbers for Colgate Total mouthwash are above previous recent competitive launches, and the product has
been instrumental in driving overall category growth. Our recent launch of Suavitel Fast Dry fabric conditioner has also
met with success. Our quarterly national share is at a record 18.6%, up 170 basis points versus the second quarter of
2013. And this is a product which is largely sold in Hispanic markets, where it holds a 36.2% share on a year-to-date
basis, fast closing the gap between us and the leading competitor.
So, looking ahead, our latest toothpaste innovation here in the U.S. is Colgate Enamel Health toothpaste. The
enamel-strengthening segment is the fastest growing in the toothpaste category, with 54% of consumers concerned
about enamel. This new product replenishes natural calcium and other minerals back into weakened enamel, filling in
rough spots while at the same time polishing the enamel service so germs are less likely to stick on the teeth. The
formula has an active fluoride system, along with gentle-on-enamel silica, and the product comes in two variants,
Whitening and Sensitivity Relief. In addition, the impactful packaging is interactive, with a touch and feel demo
showing acid-softened rough enamel and healthy, smooth enamel. So, as you would imagine, we have a very robust
integrated marketing campaign planned, including television, print, public relations, professional, digital, social,
mobile, and in-store activities.
Turning to Europe/South Pacific. We're very encouraged with our progress in Europe and are cautiously optimistic that
some of the macroeconomic headwinds we have been facing are beginning to die down. Our organic sales growth of
2.5% reflects the balance between volume and price where we have had strong promotional activities across the region

to support new product launches. And this has paid off in terms of market share. Our Oral Care shares are strong across
the category and showing good momentum. In toothpaste, our year-to-date market share is at 35.2%, up 70 basis points
from the year-ago period, with the most recent share at 35.4%. And of particular note is the UK, where despite an
ongoing competitive battle, our year-to-date share is just shy of 50%, up a full point, with the most recent read over
51%, a record high. In manual toothbrushes, our year-to-date regional share is up 90 basis points to 23.5%, with the
most recent read at 24%, consolidating our number one position. And this was in part fueled by excellent progress in
the UK, where we've achieved a record 37.5% share year to date. And in mouthwash, our share is up 10 basis points to
16.4% on a year-to-date basis, with the most recent read at 16.9%.
We're very excited about the launch of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with (sic) [plus] (7:45) Sugar Acid
Neutralizer across Europe and the South Pacific. First quarter launches in Australia and Norway have achieved 3.7%
and 3.5% shares respectively in the most recent period. We've only just launched in the UK, where as I mentioned we
are reaching record market share levels. And we'll introduce the product across the rest of Europe in the balance of the
year. In Germany, where our share is up 140 basis points to 41.2% on a year-to-date basis, we've launched it under the
Elmex brand.
More new products are planned for the second half of this year as well. We'll continue the rollout of Colgate Max
White One Optic. Whitening is the second-biggest segment in toothpaste in Europe, and we hold the number one
position. Similarly, in manual toothbrushes, we will continue the rollout of Colgate Slim Soft Charcoal Toothbrush, a
product which, as you know, was developed in Asia but has met with great success in other parts of the world. An
innovation in the mouthwash category is Colgate Plax Deep Clean mouthwash, which provides a deep, effective clean,
even in hard-to-reach areas. The product contains two natural ingredients, eucalyptol and propolis, that are well known
to the consumer. Eucalyptol is known for cooling and antibacterial properties, and propolis for its protective properties.
Turning then to Latin America, we're very pleased with the continued strong organic sales growth in this region. This
growth was broadly based. One exception was Brazil, where consumers were glued to their televisions during the
World Cup and not spending time in stores, a temporary condition, which we expect should reverse itself in the second
half of this year. Market shares continue to climb. In the press release, we cited record toothpaste shares in a number of
countries. Our year-to-date manual toothbrush shares also achieved record highs in Brazil, Chile, Peru, Puerto Rico,
and Uruguay. In Brazil, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with (sic) [plus] (9:46) Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste
has achieved a 2.3% share year to date, lifting our overall share to a record 71.9%.
In Mexico, our toothpaste share has been over 80% for the last three months. And while we don't have readings yet in
national Nielsen shares, Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with (sic) [plus] (10:04) Sugar Acid Neutralizer
toothpaste in Mexico has registered a 3-point share in Scantrack. As in other regions around the world, the launch of
Colgate's Slim Soft toothbrush has met with success in Latin America. In Brazil, our share is up 80 basis points to
82.8% year to date on the strength of both Colgate 360 and Colgate Slim Soft, both of which are super-premium priced,
helping to increase margins. In Mexico, our manual toothbrush leadership share climbed to a record 44.9% in the most
recent period. And our mouthwash share across the region is up 30 basis points to 36.3%, while our principal
competitor is down almost a full point to 38.8%.
In the Personal Care category, we've increased our underarm share in Mexico as a result of new products, such as men's
and ladies' Speed Stick Stress. We're now the leader in bar soaps across Latin America, with Protex and Palmolive
holding the number one and two positions, respectively. And in fabric conditioners, our regional share is up over 2
points to 50.8% year to date, with the most recent read at 51%.
And more innovation is planned for the second half. During the third quarter, we will be launching Colgate Total
Professional Breath Health toothpaste. Dentists advise their patients that bad breath can be caused not just by food
odors but also by the accumulation of bacteria in the mouth. This breath-freshening toothpaste formula with
breakthrough neutral odor technology is scientifically proven to fight and neutralize bad breath causing bacteria. Next
month we're introducing Colgate Luminous White Instant toothpaste. Its exclusive formula with optic brighteners
activates while you brush for a visibly whiter smile instantly. And in the Personal Care category this month, we're
launching ladies' Speed Stick Aclarado Perfecto with vitamin E. Its formula, with vitamin E and pearl extract, was

perceived in a consumer test to help restore the skin's natural tone while also providing sweat protection for up to 48
hours.
Turning then to Asia. While organic sales growth in this region slowed from the first quarter pace, this quarter was
compared to the strongest quarter of last year, which saw organic sales growth at a very strong 13%. Macroeconomic
factors in China affected our results. And we told you on our last call about some categories slowing, and in fact that
did happen. However, as referenced in the press release, we continued to see strong growth in our other countries in the
region, such as India.
And innovation continues to help drive market share increases. In toothpaste, our market share in India is up 70 basis
points on a year-to-date basis to 54.8%, with the most recent period at 55.1%, and this in the face of recent competitive
entries. The revitalization of Colgate Active Salt, a toothpaste with a unique salt formula that gives deep clean feeling
and helps fight germs for strong teeth and healthy gums, helped drive these results. In Malaysia, our share increased 50
basis points to 73.5% year to date, with the most recent read at 74.5%. This was our first Asian market to launch
Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection with (sic) [plus] (13:27) Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste, and in just six
months, it's achieved almost a 4% share of the market.
Our toothbrush share across the division is up to 30.6% year to date, fueled by increases in India, Thailand, Philippines,
Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. In India, new products such as Colgate Super Flexi have resulted in an increase of
240 basis points to 43.5% year to date, with the most recent read at 43.7%. Our mouthwash business is solid as well,
with a regional share year to date of 21.8%, up 110 basis points. Colgate Plax Jasmine Tea, a mouthwash which
provides long-lasting fresh breath with a pleasant jasmine tea flavor, has contributed to very good results in Thailand
and the Philippines, where total mouthwash shares are up year over year 170 basis points and 380 basis points,
respectively. Colgate Plax Herbal Salt mouthwash, which was launched in Malaysia and Singapore and contributed 80
basis points and 250 basis points, respectively, in the initial read, will launch in India as Colgate Plax Active Salt
during the fourth quarter. As you may know, the Indian consumer habit is to rinse one's mouth with saltwater, so this
innovation should resonate well in this market.
Of course more innovation is planned for the second half of this year. We will continue to roll out Colgate Maximum
Cavity Protection with (sic) [plus] (14:58) Sugar Acid Neutralizer toothpaste. In China, we'll be launching Colgate Tea
Health toothpaste, which provides refreshing breath with a pleasant Longjing tea flavor. Longjing is a popular and
premium type of tea in China, which is associated with multiple types of benefits, including healthy teeth and
refreshing breath. We will also be launching the Colgate [ph] HD1 toothbrush with seven-way cleaning with (15:21)
the following benefits: cleans teeth's surface, removes bacteria, is gentle on gums, cleans in between the teeth, absorbs
brushing pressure, and is easy to maneuver. And in Thailand, we will be launching Colgate Plax Tartar Control
mouthwash, an exciting addition to our strong mouthwash portfolio in that country. This mouthwash provides the dual
benefit of tartar control and breath freshening all at once.
Turning then to Africa/Eurasia. We're encouraged with the continued solid organic sales growth in this region. Of
particular note was Russia, where, despite an uncertain political and macroeconomic environment, new products such
as Colgate Altai Herbs toothpaste, Colgate Total Interdental toothpaste, and Colgate Optic White Instant toothpaste
helped drive strong growth. Toothpaste and toothbrush shares remained solid across the region. Innovation in the
mouthwash category has delivered good share results in Russia. We told you last quarter about Colgate Altai Herbs
mouthwash, which contains an ingredient well known to the local consumer, a companion product to the previously
mentioned toothpaste. Our mouthwash share in Russia is up year to date 170 basis points to 27.5%.
In Turkey, our newly launched Colgate Plax Green mouthwash has resulted in a market share increase of 120 basis
points to 20.5% year to date. And we're also very pleased with the continued success in our shower gel business across
the region, where we hold a leadership position of 22%, up almost 2 full points year over year. Palmolive Gourmet Spa
has driven increases of 220 basis points and 400 basis points in Russia and Turkey, respectively. And the recent launch
of Palmolive's Thermal Skin Renewal (sic) [Thermal Spa Skin Renewal] (17:12) resulted in an increase of 5 points in
South Africa.

More innovation is planned. In the Eurasian markets, we are introducing Colgate Total Pro Whitening toothpaste, and
here as elsewhere, the premium-priced whitening segment is very important to the overall toothpaste category. In
Russia, consumers believe in the power of natural ingredients and traditional recipes to improve oral health.
Accordingly, we're launching the Colgate Natural Extracts toothbrush containing pine tree bristles with premium
differentiated and impactful packaging designed to stand out on shelf. As I mentioned earlier, our Palmolive Gourmet
Spa line of shower gels has been very successful, and we hope to build on that success with two new variants to be
added to the existing Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry. The new Creamy Coffee and Peach Sorbet variants are
infused with natural extracts, and their creamy formulas smooth the skin. As you would expect, we will have a very
strong integrated marketing campaign to support this launch.
Then turning to Hill's. Hill's business continues to be solid. General softness in the pet superstores has been affecting
us, and others as well, here in the U.S. However, we're encouraged by our continued stream of innovation, which we
expect to drive growth going forward. Our rollout of Hill's Ideal Balance continues to meet with success. Here in the
U.S., our share of the naturals category continues to grow. And in addition to the regular Ideal Balance, we launched
Ideal Balance Slim & Healthy in the second quarter for both dogs and cats. Support activities included features in
coupon brochure handouts, brand ambassador coupons, and nutritional consultant coupons. In Europe, we launched in
the UK and Germany in April and May, respectively, and so far we've seen very good trade acceptance, with listing in
the major accounts supported by promotional activities as well as secondary placements. In the store, we activated with
branded gondola ends, demonstrators in key accounts, and indoor and outdoor posters and point-of-sale materials. And
in addition, we featured the product at consumer pet shows and through testimonial campaigns.
On the therapeutic side of the business, our 2013 launch of Prescription Diet Metabolic continues to do well both here
and abroad. In the U.S., our sales are exceeding our expectations. Our commercial support includes before and after
imagery, along with videos online. And this quarter, we've globally launched an antioxidant upgrade to the product. In
greater Europe, we've widen the gap between our nearest competitor from 2 points to 8, establishing a clear leadership
share of 47% year to date in the weight category. Another important therapeutic category is feline urinary, a category
where we were underrepresented until the launch of Prescription Diet c/d. New platforms, such as efficacy, stress,
ocean fish, and stew, were added in the second quarter here in the U.S., all supported with in-clinic sampling and
messaging at professional conferences. Similar activities in Europe have resulted in a 130 basis point increase in our
share of the category to almost 30% year to date. Looking forward, this quarter we will continue the rollout of Ideal
Balance Slim & Healthy and Science Diet Perfect Weight, our new wellness – weight-loss product, in markets outside
the U.S. And for the fourth quarter, we have more exciting news, which we will share with you soon.
So in summary, we're pleased that we continue to drive organic sales around the world, with good bottom line growth.
Our new-product pipeline is as full as ever, and our market shares are healthy and growing in many regions. Colgate
people everywhere are working hard to keep us winning on the ground. We look forward to sharing our results with
you as we go forward through the balance of the year. And now, before we turn it over to Q&A, Ian would like to make
a few remarks. Ian?
Ian M. Cook
Thanks, Bina. Many of you may remember that on the first quarter call, as we began the Q&A, I took the time to make
some preliminary remarks on the shape of this year, and it seems appropriate to open by doing the same in this quarter.
Clearly, we saw a slowdown in the top line pace of the company in the second quarter, and that really began towards
the very end of the quarter. And as you break that down, one contributing factor is further emerging market weakness
in our categories, as we see the macroeconomic weaknesses finally come more sharply to our categories. You will
recall on the first quarter call that we revised the category growth rates for the emerging markets down to a 5% to 7%
range from the previous 6% to 8%, and based on what we saw in the second quarter, we see for the balance of the year
those emerging markets still posting good growth, but at the lower end of that range.

In the developed markets, for the Colgate businesses, category growth continues at 1% to 2%, with some growing
optimism, I would say, in Europe. Hill's, as you heard, experienced channel-specific slowdown here in the U.S., which
we are already seeing recover as this quarter begins. As you heard very clearly from Bina, our market shares around the
world continue to be strong, and accelerating in Mexico and the U.S., two particular geographies that we were focusing
on since the beginning of the year. And our innovation pipeline is deep and rich, not just for the balance of 2014, but
into 2015 as well.
We continue to feel that the strategy we have been deploying for several years, a strategy that focuses on building
brands with our consumers, creating innovation that drives growth, maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness that
funds that growth, and developing a cadre of leadership to continue to manage the company, continue to be the right
strategy, as does our execution on the fundamentals of our business around the world. We believe both remain correct,
and that is what we are redoubling our focus on for the balance of this year.
So with that as a backdrop, while we continue to expect organic growth for the company this year to be in that 5% to
7% range, albeit towards the lower end of that range given the current world environment.
On the material cost side, we have seen further increases in material costs, including tropical oils and several of the
agricultural commodities that affect the Hill's business, and of course the continued transaction headwinds due to
foreign exchange. And, because of that, we now see gross margin expectations for the year move to a 30 to 50 basis
point range, with Funding the Growth maintained at historically strong levels, as you will see when I go through the
gross margin roll-forward, and of course more pricing across the balance of the year. Behind that strong innovation
stream, advertising and the increasingly important commercial investment of in-store work will both be up. The
restructuring program remains on track, and we continue to expect after-tax savings of between $90 million and $110
million. And our that tax rate, as you would expect, remains in the 31% to 32% range. As you saw in the press release,
we remain comfortable with our 4% to 5% dollar EPS range, and you may recall the walk-through that we provided on
our first quarter call, which guided to the middle of that range, guidance that I would reiterate.
So, in summary, we believe the strategy that we are deploying and the focus on the fundamentals that we have remain
the right ones. Our market shares are strong, our innovation is robust, and I think we can continue to demonstrate the
agility and the flexibility to react to the volatile world that we are all doing business in. So with those as introductory
remarks, Angela, perhaps we could now open the lines to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will now go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. I guess a couple things. There's a lot there, Ian, in your final comments, but in terms
of the macro slowdown, I think you commented that it happened very late in the second quarter, and I guess that
concerns me because outside of Brazil, every region saw, I think, a deceleration in organic sales growth and at least
came in below my expectations, and I have a hard time believing that that all happened very late in the quarter. And in
terms of kind of going forward from here, how quickly do you expect a pickup? How quickly do you expect a
reacceleration? I guess, specifically with regard to pricing and what you mentioned about commodity inflation, how
quickly can you put some pricing in place so that even that tempered top line growth outlook is achievable at this
point? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, obviously, Wendy, that is why I tried to make the introductory remarks, because
clearly from the early notes, those are exactly the questions on people's minds. If you track through the organic and
focus on the emerging markets, we were actually quite pleased with the organic growth that we sustained in Latin
America. The big variation, of course, is in Asia. And clearly the world macros out there have been volatile and weak
in some cases for a time. But beyond the adjustment we made in the first quarter, we had not seen that come through to
our categories. And it did so in the second quarter, and it did late in the second quarter.

The other factor, as I mentioned, was related to Hill's, and as I just said in my remarks, we've already seen that Hill's
bounced back. The important point to make is that the underlying category growths are in that mid-single digit range.
As I said, what you get from a volume point of view is that in large geographies, like a China, for example, with a very
complex distribution system, you get an inventory reaction that works its way through the system that has a short-term
impact. That was the impact we felt in the second quarter. As we look forward at the consumption rates – in other
words, the consumer purchase rates – with them in the mid-single digits area and the pricing plans we have clearly in
place for the second half of the year, we feel comfortable with that more tempered organic volume growth for the entire
company at the lower end of that 5% to 7% range. So it's the underlying consumer purchasing that gives us confidence.
Operator
And we will now go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Sure.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Ian, you're now expecting sales at the low end of where you were, gross margins moving a
little bit lower. Maybe you can just walk us through a couple of the offsets that help you keep EPS sort of the midpoint
of where you were still intact.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, we obviously have the restructuring program, which we have under way. I talked about
advertising for the year. As I said, the total commercial spend will be up and the advertising will be up on the year. On
a ratio basis, it will be more in line with the strong levels of last year. And when you work all of that through, with the
guidance we provided in the first quarter on the EPS, that brings in the year.
Operator
And we will now go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So, I mean, I think it's unusual for you to do one of these prepared remarks. So I'm just
trying to figure out the severity of things. Was it really that bad of a slowdown in the emerging markets? And, even if it
is, you've historically been relatively immune to slowdowns we've seen in the past. So I wanted to know if you think
that's changed for your business, or it's that much worse. And in that context, secondarily, if you could talk about the
double-digit constant currency earnings target for this year. It sounds like you're not going to make that, so I just want
confirmation of that. And if it changes your view, given what you're seeing in the emerging markets right now, about
this company being a double-digit earnings company over the next few years?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay. So to answer your second question, the growth this year is not double digit, so I confirm
that, in a constant-currency basis. But it does not change our strategic view that for the longer term this is a double-digit
earnings company.
As far as your comment on the prepared remarks and the slowdown on the top line, frankly, the only reason we elected
to do it this way was because, otherwise, what you do is you usurp somebody's question in order to make some opening
comments, which seemed unfair. So we simply thought it was cleaner to do it this way. So I apologize if trying to be
proper in the presentation created a sense that things were somehow bad, which we do not believe they are.
We do see a volatile world. We have tried consistently in that volatile world to deliver the agility and the flexibility
necessary to keep driving our business ahead of the market growth, which is why Bina spent so much time on the
market shares, because our market shares are strong and growing in key markets. So this is us just reacting to a
deceleration in our marketplaces in order to outperform what we see now as the probably growth rates in our categories
for the balance of this year. And we just want you to be as clear as possible about that.

And we will now go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Ian, can you discuss your market share performance so far for the SAC anti-cavity
toothpaste, where it's been launched, and incrementally to your business? And then also, on a related note, given the
healthy innovation pipeline you've pointed to, do you think you're investing enough in marketing here, or will you
temper the marketing a bit given the top line dynamics out there?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, I think Bina went through quite a few – in fact, almost all the market shares we have so far
on Superior Anti-Cavity. And indeed it has been predominantly incremental in the marketplaces we have gone to. So
you're seeing share performance, I would say, in broad terms, depending on when the markets were entered, between
1.5% and 5%. Turkey, 1.5%. Brazil as Bina quoted. Malaysia, 4%. Australia, 4%. New Zealand approaching 5%.
Greece over 2%. Norway, 3.5%, as Bina said. And Mexico 3%, albeit that that is Scantrack data. And you heard that
the Mexico shares are back up over 80% and the Brazil share is at an all-time high of 72%.
So the more important reading for us on Superior Anti-Cavity, frankly, is that the trial rate is building very, very nicely.
We have now six-month data in, and it is significantly ahead of the category average, and the repeat rates are dead in
line with premium category entries in the category. So we're seeing it in the share, but more importantly, we're seeing it
in the consumer behavior.
And on the support behind the new products, no. The levels of advertising spend – and I'm now talking the traditional
below-the-line advertising are at, compared to our history, elevated levels. They're in line with the strong levels we had
last year. They are clearly focused behind the innovation in terms of building awareness, getting recommendation. And
we keep trying to stress this point, but it sometimes is difficult, I guess, to make the impression, that part of our
investment to build brands with consumers and generate trial of new products comes in activity that we do at the store
level, and that activity is captured in trade spending. So it doesn't go into the traditional advertising line, but when you
think of consumer purchasing behavior and the techniques available to you today at retail, it's an enormously important
part of building brand and provoking trial purchase.
So we're managing very carefully between those two investment buckets, the traditional advertising and the overall
commercial spending, to make sure, the example I just gave on Superior Anti-Cavity, that we're generating trial above
category norms so that the repeat multiplies on a higher-than-normal trial base. So the answer is we continue to believe
we have a very well-balanced plan behind the innovation for the year.

And we will now go to Alice Longley with Buckingham Research Brokerage.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Alice.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: [indiscernible] (38:58) With your guidance for the year that organic sales growth will be at
the lower end of 5% to 7%, it looks like you have to get some acceleration from the 4% in the second quarter to get
there. And you already talked about Hill's. Where else might we see some improvement? Maybe Latin America,
because people won't be so glued to their TV sets, and maybe the U.S. on innovation, but if you could just tell us more
where we get improvement in the second half versus the second quarter, that would be good.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, first, Alice, I would say that the prevailing rate you have to get to in the second half is
pretty much what you would have delivered in the first half. So, yes, there is the second quarter 4%, and as we look at

the balance of the year, given the underlying consumption rate that I mentioned in the emerging markets and
particularly in Asia, that would clearly be a business area where we would expect the organic growth to come back.
And as I commented on the Hill's business, with the specific channel issue in the second quarter, which we're already
seeing come back, we would expect to see that in Hill's as well. So if you were pointing to two particular areas, it
would be those areas. And who knows? We may get wild optimism in Europe.

And we will now go to Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, Ian. I guess the question is how does your new view on the category growth dynamic
affect your decisions on pricing, if at all, right? Because I know at least one of your major global competitors has said
that competitive levels in the markets are affecting their ability to price for currency. You've said that you expect more
pricing in the back half. But how does that work for you guys? Would you now take less pricing than you would have
[ph] thought then before (41:11)?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, remember, Chris, when you think about pricing, what you're actually trying to do is to get
the average selling price up. So there are many ways of doing that. List price is clearly part of it, but there are many
other techniques that we deploy strategically and tactically to elevate ASP: premiumization, changes in your
promotional activity. So there are many techniques that we deploy, and the reason we made the comment about the
market shares in Mexico and the U.S. is we got 1.5% pricing on the quarter, and we have those market shares moving
in the right direction. Bina went through a whole host of other market shares that are moving in the right direction, and
we think we have the ability to continue to take pricing, create pricing, in the second half of the year without impinging
on that mid-single digit organic growth rate. And innovation is an important part of that.

And we'll now go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Ian, just kind of talking about capital allocation and looking with where the stock is today
and going forward, I mean, is the – the EPS guidance, I assume, just assumes only the kind of $3 million a quarter
share repurchase, but would you look at deploying more in this environment, or are there other things out there that
you're looking that have a better return at this point?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, that's a very broad question, Bill. I guess the way we have thought about capital allocation
over the years, obviously one pays a dividend. Obviously one has internal capital expenditure programs, which deliver
– consistently in our case – beyond a 33% hurdle rate of return. And, of course, that capital investment is elevated in
periods when we go through a restructuring. So right now we're deploying a little bit more in capital expenditure than
we have done historically, quite purposely. And then, of course, we buy back shares, as we have done, and I would say
our target is still in that $1.5 billion gross range for this year. And obviously, should an acquisition candidate present
itself or should we find one in various parts of the world, then we would prefer to allocate the capital in that direction.
And I don't think, at least so far, our thinking has changed in that regard.

And we will now go to Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, good morning, Ian.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, I don't know – probably a tough question to answer. But have you figured out what is the
source of the volume shortfall? I mean, is it people buying less? Is it fewer people in a category? Is it sort of the mix
mechanisms you've used in the past aren't working as effectively? Is there any way to kind of triangulate those three?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, it's difficult, Bill. As we have over time got under the hood of that, you see what people do
is they exhaust their own personal pantries. They literally try and squeeze the tube and make it last a little bit longer so
that they can extend the time between purchase cycles. And as we have seen, sometimes for cash outlay reasons,
instead of buying a bigger tube at a certain channel of trade, they will go and buy a smaller tube in a different channel
outlet. So in terms of the consumer purchase, that is what we have historically seen has been the behaviors they adopt.
The direct correlation to volume and the point I was trying to make specific to Asia on this quarter is from a selling in
volume point of view, you then have the dislocation that that slowdown brings to a very complicated and interrelated
distribution network, which sees some inventory adjustment, which is a short-term effect, as everybody readjusts to the
now-lower consumer purchasing rate. So you see it more sharply on the company volume in the short term, even
though the underlying purchase that you will go back to, as I said, is still in that mid-single digit range.

And we will now go to John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, John.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. Good morning, Ian. A little bit of a follow-up on Chris' question. If we look at your
pricing in Latin America, and it's a lot lower than what we're seeing from a lot of these other companies, I'm not asking
to you comment on their pricing as much, but can you talk about sort of how you're viewing sort of real pricing in Latin
America as we look forward? And is this something where you're just not going to move as much relative to some of
the FX pieces? And then sort of further delving down into Venezuela on this, we have seen some companies talk about
the margin caps, et cetera. Can you talk about sort of where you feel you are from a margin standpoint in Venezuela as
we look to map that out ourselves? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, let me start with Venezuela. We've read all of the transcripts on the pricing caps,
obviously, in Venezuela. In our situation, virtually all of our business is capped, if you will, by the government's 2012
policy that prevents us from taking pricing in the marketplace. And, therefore, because of that, the pricing cap doesn't
really apply to us – margin cap, I mean. So that would be the simple summary on Venezuela.
You probably saw, or you will see, that we posted a modest profit this quarter and indeed for the half, which we had not
done last quarter, which is pleasing. And we continue to manage that business with the diligence that you would expect.
And there have been quite a few press reports, and indeed we are in very constructive discussion with the government
about the opportunity for us to realize pricing on products as we continue forward in this year. And we'll have to see
where that ends up, but we do spend a lot of constructive time in discussion.
In terms of pricing in Latin America, actually we're quite pleased with the pricing balance that we have been taking in
Latin America at this time, remembering that there is no pricing in Venezuela. So the overall pricing we're taking, we
think, is both consistent – you look at the first and the second quarters, 6% and 5%. And, of course, that will continue
in the back half of the year. And, of course, for our gross margin to improve across the year, we will have to see a like
gross margin improvement in divisions including in Latin America, so that is very much in our plan. And I think the
market shares talk to the fact that I think we're finding the right balance between the two.

And we will now go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks. You talked a lot about increased in-store activity, but obviously volume was a little bit
light of expectations. So do your analytics suggest that consumers are just not as responsive to in-store activity as they
used to be, or was it effective and volume would have been worse if not for the promotional activity? And then also, it
sounds like you're quite pleased with Funding the Growth and cost save progress overall. So what drove overhead up
this quarter? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Okay, a couple of answers, then. In terms of in-store activity, again, as I tried to example, I think
you have to try to separate out, depending on the part of the world you're talking about, the slowdown in overall
consumption and the short-term impact that has on company volume. So, as I described before, you can have a situation
where as the consumer consumption slows overall, you're still connecting with that consumer. Let's pick the emerging
market mid-single digit growth rate now that we are talking about, but behind that, given the distribution system, as the
volume readjusts to that lower level, you see company volumes slow in a shorter timeframe. The consumer is just as
responsive at the purchasing end to the in-store trial activity. So the in-store activity continues to be effective from a
consumption point of view.
And in terms of the overhead increase, it largely relates to distribution decisions we have taken in various parts of the
world, either to take our products to market directly and not through a distributor or to extend our distribution debt and
therefore incur more logistic cost in order to get that distribution debt. Both of those things being good in terms of
building our brands over the medium term. So very conscious choices. The underlying overhead is actually flat.

And we will now go to Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning, Ian.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Can I ask you a question, just a follow-up question, on the Latin American margin, please? It
was down over 20 basis points in the quarter. Given your comments on sort of the temporary effect on Brazil volumes
in the quarter but also pricing, do you expect to be able to reverse that in the second half? At least partially?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes, I mean, as I was trying to explain a little bit before, obviously when you look at the impact in
the second quarter, part of it is Venezuela and part of it is the lead-lag between the very sharp increase in transaction
impact on product costs and the ability to keep feathering pricing into the marketplace. So, as I tried to answer with the
earlier question, we do have more pricing planned for the balance of the year. And, as we look at our gross margin
ambitions for the company, that will see gross margins expand in our divisions, including in Latin America. So, to your
point, we will indeed see improvement in gross margin as the year unfolds in Latin America. As indeed we saw
improvement second quarter to first.

And we'll take our next question from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. I know it's a small market for you, but this morning there are headlines
that Argentina is defaulting. What impact would that have on you?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, don't cry for me, Argentina, eh?
Argentina, as you may know, Connie, is less than 1% of the company's sales. We manage these geographies as if they
are hyperinflationary. So we do all the things – even though we don't book it as hyper because it has not yet crossed the
100%. So we hold little cash. We have de minimis cash in Argentina. We don't have any debt outstanding, and we don't
believe we have a need for any external funding. We make most of our product locally. So as a direct impact of the
default, no impact for us. Now, of course, what the knock-on effects are in terms of inflation and foreign exchange,
we'll have to see how it unfolds and react accordingly. But I come back to the first point that it is less than 1% of our
sales.

And we will now go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Hello. Just two quick things. One was just following up on 60 to 90 days for how long
the destocking usually lasts. You said some of the weakness popped up at the end of the quarter. Should I interpret that
as there's still a little bit more to go in 3Q, or that you continued to see that in July but you would expect as you get into
August, September things start to improve?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: That would be a correct assessment.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Okay, great. And then the final thing would just be if you could run through the gross
margin bridge for us, that would be great.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I thought you'd never ask. So in terms of gross profit, prior-year gross profit was 58.6%. With the
pricing we took, we got 50 basis points from that between our Funding the Growth savings and a modest contribution,
as in the first quarter, from restructuring. Our total Funding the Growth and restructuring was 220 basis points, actually
slightly ahead of the 210 we got in the prior year. Material prices were a headwind of 250 basis points, and with so with
the pricing and the Funding the Growth, that's what leads you to the 58.8% or a 20 basis point increase year on year.

resolved, but I just curious if you can tell us what happened there. And then on pricing again, shall we expect pricing to
improve in emerging markets, or it's just a reduction of promotional activity in Europe given the strong volumes?

Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: To answer your latter point first, Javier, no, it is not a reduction in promotion in Europe which
drives that. It is pricing and it is pricing across the world, with a heavy emphasis on the emerging markets and
continued emphasis on Hill's. And, in terms of Hill's, I'm sorry if I made it sound like some sort of untoward event.
They had a traffic slowdown in their stores, and as we have come into this quarter with our innovation and with the
activity we have behind our innovation, that for us has gone away, and we have kicked off to a nice start in the third
quarter. So just a temporary blip.

And we will now go to Steve Powers with UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Yes. Hey, Ian, I was wondering if you could break apart the drivers of the change in your
gross margin outlook between January and July, or really I guess between April and July. How much of the reduction
has been driven by a decision to move demand-building dollars from ad spend to trade spend versus some of the other
factors you mentioned, like FX, commodity inflation, the general slowdown that you've experienced, et cetera. That
would help. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, I don't really want to get into that sort of level of detail, and I would say in terms of
rebuilding our gross margin, it's basically between the materials and the transaction, so that's where our focus is.
Operator
And we will now go to Alec Patterson with AGI.
<Q - Alec Patterson>: Ian, sorry. I need to follow up on that last question. Just trying to understand. You're saying that
material costs – or the material – it's the main change versus where you were in April? Or is it more a function of
promo spending that's up to offset, I presume, increased pressure on the categories, especially in emerging markets?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, clearly, when you do the investment at store, that investment at store brings pressure on
gross margin. We have had that thinking in our plan. So the new aspect is an increase in material prices and a, shall we
say, heightened impact from transaction.
Operator
And we will take our final question from Mark Astrachan from Stifel.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah, thanks. And good afternoon now. I'm curious on your thoughts on Hill's given the
slowdown you talked about in the specialty stores. And do you think there's an opportunity to expand distribution? And
is there even a benefit in doing so beyond just that channel? And then just more broadly, curious your thoughts on
growth rates in that business or in Pet Nutrition sort of broadly in Europe, U.S., and sort of your views on longer-term
opportunity in developing markets as something that eventually will be bigger than it is today.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, the answer to the distribution question, which has been asked many times, is given the
model we have for that business, we do not believe that that would be too advantage. That rather the recommendation
we cultivate with veterinary professionals is best maintained in a controlled environment, whether it's a pet store, a
PetSmart or a Petco where the assistants can advise or, indeed, directly with the vet. That is part of the connection that
brand has with the consumer. If you were then to liberalize that and take it more broadly into, if you will, a grab-and-go
environment, you lose that connection.
To your second point, you are absolutely right. Hill's today is predominantly a developed-world business. We have a
very clear focus on a handful of emerging markets where we are seeing most immediate potential for that growth. But,
