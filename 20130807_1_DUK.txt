MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Please standby. Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy's Second Quarterly Earnings Call. Today's conference is
being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bob Drennan. Please go ahead, sir.
Bob Drennan
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2013 earnings review and
business update. Leading our call this morning is Lynn Good, Duke Energy's President and CEO.
Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two
presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. You should also refer to the
information in our 2012 10-K and other SEC filings concerning factors that could cause future results to differ from
this forward-looking information. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at
www.duke-energy.com and in today's materials.
Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to
help you analyze the company's performance. Today, Lynn will provide an in-depth review of the second quarter
results and also perspectives on our expectations for the rest of the year. She will also take your questions following her
prepared remarks.
This morning we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.87 compared to a $1.02 for
the same quarter a year ago. Principal drivers of the lower quarter-over-quarter adjusted results were less favorable
weather at our utilities compared to last year, reduced contributions from our Midwest coal and gas commercial
operations and lower contribution from international operations, primarily due to an extended maintenance outage at

our National Methanol investment.
These drivers were partly offset by positive revenue contributions from recently approved rate cases in North Carolina
and Ohio. Also this morning, we are reaffirming Duke Energy's previously announced adjusted earnings guidance
range for 2013 of $4.20 to $4.45 per share.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Thank you, Bob, and good morning. I want to thank all of you for joining our call today. I'm pleased to be joining you
as the President and CEO of Duke Energy. As many of you know, Jim Rogers, who led Duke or one of its predecessor
companies for nearly 25 years, will remain Chairman through the end of this year. I'm grateful to Jim for his
encouragement and support over the years and I am deeply honored by the confidence the board has placed in me. As
well, I wanted to thank you for your support in the past and for the messages I have received since this announcement.
Also, yesterday, I announced Steve Young as Duke Energy's new Chief Financial Officer. Steve most recently served
as the Company's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and previously served as the CFO of Duke Power. In his
previous role, Steve has worked closely with the utility commissions in North Carolina and South Carolina as well as
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He has a deep understanding of our company and industry, and will
maintain a sharp focus on our financial objectives. Steve complements our especially deep and talented leadership
team, and I look forward to introducing Steve to many of you over the coming months.
Now, let me turn to our discussion of the quarter's results, expectations for the remainder of 2013, and our near-term
strategic priorities. July 2 marks the one-year anniversary of closing the Duke-Progress merger. Thanks to the diligence
and hard work of our employees and leadership team, we've accomplished a great deal over the past 12 months. Slide
four outlines our near-term priorities and our progress towards resolving them.
Let me provide a brief update on these priorities. First, we continue to make progress on our regulatory calendar in
2013. I'm very pleased with the constructive orders we have received in the Duke Energy Progress and Ohio Electric
T&D cases.
Additionally, we have reached a balanced settlement with interveners in the Duke Energy Carolinas and Ohio Gas
cases and await Commission decisions in the third quarter. I will discuss these rate cases in more detail in a moment.
Turning to Edwardsport, in early June we placed the IGCC plant into service. This is a major milestone for the
company and for our Indiana customers. Over the next several months, our focus remains on plant performance,
including ongoing performance testing, completing GE as a new product introduction testing protocol, and resolving
remaining punch list items from construction.
As with any new plant, we expect to encounter issues in the early phases of operation. Our approach is to identify root
causes and resolve issues, as they occur. To-date, we have not identified any issues that will impact the long-term
performance of the plant.
Next, Crystal River. Last week, we announced a comprehensive settlement with parties in Florida, including the Office
of Public Counsel. This settlement provides long-term clarity for Florida customers, the companies and other key
stakeholders. As I will discuss in a moment, the settlement addresses the pending Crystal River 3 regulatory
proceedings, the proposed Levy nuclear project, the Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units and future generation needs in
Florida.
Merger integration also remains a key priority. Significant work continues to integrate financial, work management and
human resource systems. We are on track to achieve our targeted nonfuel O&M savings of between 5% to 7% in 2014.
We also continue to deliver customer savings through our fuel savings and joint dispatch commitment. Over the last 12
months, we exceeded our original forecast by achieving cumulative savings of approximately $120 million. We expect

to continue this progress into 2014 and beyond.
Finally, let me update you on our nuclear fleet performance improvement efforts. Both the Oconee and Catawba sites in
the Carolinas operated at record capacity factors for the first six months of the year. Additionally, our focus on the
single unit Robinson Nuclear Station has resulted in an improved performance in several key performance indicators,
including capacity factors and the INPO Index, an independent view of our overall performance.
Over the remainder of 2013, we have four planned nuclear refueling outages and are performing the necessary
preparation work to ensure their successful execution. As we discussed with you in February, we will continue to focus
on achieving top quartile performance across the entire nuclear fleet. We are pleased with the improvements we are
seeing and our focus remains on maintaining a standard of excellence throughout the nuclear fleet.
Slide five reaffirms our principal financial objectives, achieving growth in earnings per share and the dividend while
also maintaining the strength of the balance sheet. These objectives have remained consistent over time and will
continue as the centerpiece of our investors' value proposition. We are reaffirming our previously announced earnings
guidance range for 2013 of $4.20 to $4.45 per share. Our results for the year will largely depend on the following:
resolution of our pending rate cases and outcome in Ohio, and our cost base capacity requests, our cost control efforts
including merger integration, and our third quarter results, historically our most significant quarter of the year.
We continue to target a long-term growth rate of 4% to 6% and adjusted diluted earnings per share through 2015. We
remain focused on growing the dividend on an annual basis and continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 65% to
70%, based on adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Consistent with this objective, in June, our board announced an approximate 2% increase in the quarterly dividend
payable in September. Additionally, we remain focused on the strength of the balance sheet, supported by our liquidity
and credit metrics. In fact, the credit rating agencies recently acknowledged the significant progress we have made in
resolving our near-term priorities. Moody's placed Duke on review for possible upgrades and Standard & Poor's revised
its credit outlook on the company from negative to stable. Our financial plans do not call for any new equity issuances
through the end of 2015.
Next, I'll provide a more detailed look at our financial performance for the quarter. As we discussed during our first
quarter earnings call, we expected relatively weaker results in the first half of 2013, compared to 2012, as a result of the
issuance of incremental shares in connection with the merger, low PJM capacity prices, Progress Holding Company
interest expense and unfavorable foreign exchange rates and results in Brazil.
Consistent with these expectations and impacted further by milder weather in the second quarter, and an extended
outage at National Methanol, our second quarter adjusted results were $0.15 lower than the prior-year quarter. The
quarterly drivers are outlined on slide six.
Our GAAP reported earnings per share for the quarter of $0.48 as compared to the prior-year quarter results of $0.99.
These reported results for the quarter include special items such as the Crystal River 3 impairment, the cost to achieve
merger savings, and others. The special items are outlined in the reconciliation table in today's press release materials.
Let me begin now with a business segment overview of our second quarter adjusted earnings results. Our regulated
U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas segment recognized quarterly adjusted segment earnings in the quarter that were
$0.36 per share higher than the prior-year quarter. This increase was primarily due to the addition of the former
Progress Energy utility operations. These results were partially offset by milder weather.
In the second quarter of 2012, we experienced above normal weather, while we faced below normal weather during this
year's quarter. In fact, a significant amount of rainfall during the quarter contributed to below normal cooling degree
days in the Carolinas. In North Carolina, we experienced the second highest level of rainfall from April to June that we
had during the last 100 years. This mild summer weather has continued into July. High temperatures in Charlotte
reached above 90 degrees only two days during the month of July.
Let's now turn to International, which had segment earnings $0.03 per share lower than the prior- year quarter.
International's results were impacted by lower volumes at our National Methanol investment primarily due to an

extended planned maintenance outage. Although reservoirs in Brazil continued to remain slightly below historical
levels, results during the quarter were consistent with our expectations. We continue to monitor developments in Brazil.
Turning to our non-regulated Commercial Power segment, adjusted segment income was $0.05 per share lower than the
prior-year's quarter in line with our expectations. These results are attributed to lower PJM capacity revenues and lower
generation volumes for our Midwest generation fleet, and the prior-year recovery of a Lehman Brothers receivable that
had been previously written off. In Other, we incurred additional interest expense associated with the Progress Energy
holding company debt, and higher debt levels at Duke Energy holding company.
Turning to slide seven, let me spend a few minutes discussing our progress toward achieving our 2013 earnings
guidance range. As I previously highlighted, we remain on track to achieve between $4.20 and $4.45 per share of
adjusted earnings for the full year. As demonstrated on this slide, we expect the second half of the year to be relatively
stronger than the first half, primarily as a result of three items.
First, constructive rate case outcomes including nuclear outage levelization, which I will discuss further in a minute;
second, additional merger synergies, and third, increased contributions from our regulated wholesale operations.
The impact of the Duke Energy Carolinas rate case, the Ohio cost-based capacity case, and the deferral of nuclear
outage costs will be most significant in the fourth quarter. The recent rate case order for Duke Energy Progress and
pending settlement for Duke Energy Carolinas, in both North and South Carolina, provide for accounting recognition of
nuclear outage expenses over the refueling cycle. For example, 18 or 24 months rather than when the outage occurs.
This deferral of nuclear outage costs, known as nuclear outage levelization, is expected to add between $0.07 and $0.09
per share to our results for the remainder of the year up to approximately $0.04 for Duke Energy Progress and $0.05 for
Duke Energy Carolinas. Approvals of the Duke Energy Carolinas cases are still pending. The appendix material to
today's presentation contained an overview of how nuclear outage levelization works.
For the year, we expect Franchised Electric & Gas to exceed its target while International is expected to fall slightly
short of its annual target. Commercial Power's results will largely depend on the outcome of the phosphate capacity
filing pending in Ohio, which we expect in the fourth quarter. We will provide additional updates to our annual
guidance range after we complete the third quarter, which is historically our most significant one.
Slide eight contains our quarterly volume trends by customer class in total, based on calculations that exclude weather
impact. For the second quarter, our overall weather-normal volumes were around 0.4% higher than the prior-year
period, driven primarily by growth in the Commercial and Industrial sectors.
Under a year-to-date basis, weather-normal volumes were also around 0.4% higher, excluding the impact of the 2012
leap year. In the Industrial class, quarterly weather-normalized volumes were 1.2% higher. We continue to experience
strength in automotives in the Carolinas and the Midwest.
However, lower activity in the primary and fabricated metal sectors in the Midwest reflect a softening of global
demand. On the positive side, the continued housing market recovery has also supported related industrial activity
throughout our service territories. Weather-normalized volumes for our Commercial customers were approximately
0.5% higher than the prior-year quarter, continuing the recent trend of modest growth.
Finally, residential volumes were 0.4% lower for the quarter. We continued to experience growth in the average
number of residential customers as they have increased by 49,000 or 0.8% since the prior-year quarter. However, usage
per customer continues to trend slightly lower due to the challenging economy and increased energy efficiency
penetration. In particular, we continue to see weakness in Florida due to the number of low usage customers and higher
vacancy rates.
Consistent with our outflows during the first quarter earnings call, we remain cautious on the overall economic
recovery. We expect fairly stable economic outlook and activity in the back half of the year as household income
growth is projected to remain flat. As a result, weather-normalized load for the full year 2013 is expected to be slightly
below our previous assumptions of around .5% growth.

Next, I'd like to briefly address the revised settlement agreement we reached with intervening parties in Florida as
outlined on slide nine. This revised settlement agreement addresses issues related to Crystal River 3 that are pending
before the Florida Commission including our acceptance of the mediator's proposal related to NEIL insurance
coverage. It also addresses the termination of the engineering procurement and construction agreement or EPC and
related cost recovery at the Levy nuclear project, recovery costs related to a potential retirement of the Crystal River 1
and 2 coal units and regulatory framework for the addition of new generation. As you know, resolving issues related to
Crystal River 3 has been a priority since the closing of the merger. This agreement is an important step and provides a
balance between moderating rate impact to our customers, providing clarity on cost recovery and providing a
framework to meet future capacity needs.
Let me highlight some of the key provisions of the agreement. First, Crystal River. The settlement clarifies cost
recovery and cash investments at the Crystal River 3 site. Excluding the extended power upgrade investment and the
future dry cask storage facility, which are separately recoverable, we have agreed to cap the recoverability of our
remaining costs related to the site at $1.466 billion. Cost under the cap are recoverable in base rates over a 20-year
period, beginning no later than 2017. Note that our current cost estimates are within the cost cap.
We have also agreed to accelerate the cash recovery of around $135 million from retail customers between 2014 and
2016. And in order to mitigate the impact of Crystal River 3 investments to retail customers, we reduced the carrying
investments to be recovered by $295 million.
Next, let me discuss the Levy Nuclear Project. In 2008, we announced a plan to construct two new Westinghouse
AP1000 nuclear units in Levy County, Florida. Our EPC for Levy was based on the ability to obtain the combined
construction and operating license, or COL, from the NRC by January 1, 2014. As a result of delays by the NRC in
issuing COLs for new nuclear plants as well as increased uncertainty and cost recovery caused by recent legislative
changes in Florida, we are terminating Levy's EPC contract. Despite this decision, we continue to regard the Levy site
as a valuable option for future nuclear generation, and will continue to pursue the COL. We now expect to receive the
COL in late 2014 or early 2015.
We will continue to recover the Levy investments including the contract termination costs through the nuclear cost
recovery clause. We can seek recovery of additional costs to obtain the COL in the future proceedings upon the
in-service date of any new nuclear unit.
Next, I will discuss Crystal River 1 and 2, approximately 875 megawatts of unscrubbed coal generation in Florida.
These units are being evaluated for retirement due to compliance with the MATS and other environmental regulations.
In the event, we are required to retire these units early, this settlement permits us to continue recovering normal annual
depreciation expense through the end of 2020 and recover any remaining net book value in 2021.
To continue to meet the future energy needs of our customers in Florida, the agreement also gives us the ability to
construct, acquire or upgrade up to 1,150 megawatts of capacity prior to the end of 2017 and place the investments in
rate without a general rate case. We have an outstanding solicitation to address short-term capacity needs. We will
evaluate these proposals along with the construction of peaking units, operate a potential capacity acquisition. Our
capital plan will be updated to address these requirements as decisions are made.
We also project the need for additional generating capacity in Florida during 2018. We expected issue an RFP for this
capacity this year ,which will include a self-build option. If the self-build option is the most cost effective alternative
and if the Commission grants us the determination we need for this generation, we will be able to establish a generation
base rate adjustment for up to 1,800 megawatts of new combined cycle gas-fired generation. Prudent costs associated
with these new generation investments will be recovered in customer rates without a general rate case upon the
in-service date based upon a10.5% ROE.
Finally, we will agree to stay out of the general rate case proceedings until the end of 2018, an additional two-year
period to our current four-year base rate freeze. However, if Duke Energy Florida's return on equity falls below 9.5%
during this period, we will be allowed to seek base rate relief.

Overall, this settlement has minimal adjusted earnings and cash flow impact. In the second quarter, we have recognized
a $295 million pre-tax write-off of the Crystal River 3 investment balance as well as the $65 million pre-tax write-off
related to the wholesale allocations of Levy investments. These write-offs are special items, and therefore, have been
excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter.
This settlement is a balanced agreement, providing longer-term clarity to both our Florida customers, and the company.
The agreement is still subject to the review and approval by the Florida Commission, which we expect by the end of the
year.
Before I move to our pending regulatory calendar, I want to highlight that we are continuing negotiations with certain
of our joint owners of the Crystal River 3 site to resolve any remaining issues they have related to the initial outage and
our decision to retire the unit. As you will recall, these joint owners hold an approximate 8% interest in the nuclear unit.
We will provide updates as these negotiations progress.
Next, let me move on to our regulatory calendar on slide 10. 2013 is an important year with a number of regulatory
proceedings to position the company for the future. We operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions and have five
approved or pending settlements with annual revenue increases of around $600 million.
First, we resolved the Duke Energy Progress case in North Carolina, with revised rates that became effective in June.
We also have constructive and balanced settlement agreements pending Commission approval for Duke Energy
Carolinas in both North and South Carolina. These rate increases will likely go into effect next month.
All of these cases are based upon a 10.2% ROE and a 53% equity component of the capital structure. They each
contain rate mitigation mechanisms, which minimize the initial impact of increased rates to our customers.
Additionally, we have a final order from the Ohio Commission on our Electric T&D case, and await a decision on our
Gas T&D request. Finally, we anticipate an order from the Ohio Commission on our cost-based capacity request in the
fourth quarter of this year. Clarity on this filing will help us form our long term strategic plan for the Midwest
generation fleet.
Other than a potential filing by Progress, Duke Energy Progress, in South Carolina later this year, we do not forecast
the need for additional rate cases in the next few years. This will result in less regulatory risk to the company, as well as
more rate certainty for our customers. These constructive regulatory outcomes position the company for the future,
establishing timely rate recovery of over $9 billion of modernization investment.
As we look ahead, we will continue to harvest merger synergies, drive additional costs out of our business through
continuous improvement efforts, grow our wholesale business and deploy capital in our jurisdictions, including new
generation in Florida and the Carolinas.
Our Commercial businesses will also complement our growth. With our focus on near-term priorities and constructive
regulatory outcomes, we have positioned Duke for low risk primarily regulated growth through 2015. We will provide
details around our 2014 financial guidance and strategic priorities early next year.
Before closing, let me provide some perspective on my transition and current focus. I've had the opportunity over the
last month to meet with employees and key stakeholders and I'm very encouraged by these conversations. Our work
matters to the customers and communities that we serve and our employees are passionate and proud of what they do.
We have built a lot of momentum over the last year resolving our near-term priorities and integrating two great
companies.
My focus is in three areas, continuing to deliver on our commitments, strengthening our relationships with all of our
stakeholders and positioning the company for long-term success. Let me briefly discuss each one. You can expect us to
continue and deliver – to continue delivering on our commitments. We will build on our track record of delivering safe,
reliable service to our customers, operating our assets with excellence and meeting our financial objectives. Achieving
our merger synergies and ongoing cost discipline will be an important part of this mission.

Effective capital deployment for the benefit of our customers and constructive regulatory outcomes will also play a key
role. We will also focus on strengthening stakeholder relationships. We play an important role in the success of our
customers and communities, having strong constructive relationships with our customers, regulators, and community
leaders is based on trust, respect and transparency. Their success is vital to our success.
And finally, the Duke Energy leadership team will focus on positioning the company for long-term success. The
Electric industry is changing, low load growth, new technologies, new regulations and ongoing cost pressures are just
some of the forces that require new thinking and action.
As we position the company and the industry for the future, we must innovate in every part of our business to address
these challenges for the long-term benefit of our customers and our stakeholders. This includes innovation and
technology deployment, continuous improvement, and regulatory mechanism. We must also engage and lead in public
policy discussions that will impact our customers and our business. The scale and portfolio of businesses we have,
position us well to successfully navigate the road ahead.
In closing, I want to thank Jim and the board for building a strong company with talented leaders, dedicated employees
and a performance-based culture. We've met many important milestones over the course of the year, and are focused on
finishing the year strong, achieving our objectives and setting the stage for success in 2014 and beyond.
Throughout the remainder of the year, I will update you on our progress. And at this point, I'd like to open the phone
lines for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Greg Gordon from ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And congratulations.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I just want to go over the general guidance you've given for the balance of the year, maybe
review it. You said you're still on track to meet your overall guidance expectation with the regulated utilities being
better than forecast, international being slightly below and generation, being sort of uncertain depending on the
outcome of Ohio. Is that a fair recap?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No, I think the success of Commercial, Greg, will depend on where Ohio comes out, but we also
have the third quarter in front of us for Commercial and just seasonally you can expect more earnings from the base
operations in the third quarter.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, and but a big piece of the change in the utility, I'm looking in the appendix which your
referenced during your comments, page 22, is a potential second half impact of the change in accounting for nuclear
outage levelization, but it looks like the – one of the outages already happened. So I presume if that decision goes in
your favor that, that would in fact be retroactive?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So Greg, if I could refer you to slide 7, I think you've got a comprehensive list of drivers for the
second quarter and let me just talk for a moment about nuclear outage levelization. For the Duke Energy Carolinas
plants, that accounting method will be adopted prospectively. So you'll see the benefits in the fourth quarter of the
outages in the Duke Carolina fleet. The Duke Progress adoption of levelization was retroactive to January. So you see a
couple of cents in Progress' results in the second quarter on levelization and you'll see another $0.04 in the back half of
the year for the Progress piece of the levelization.

<Q - Greg Gordon>: Perfect, that's exactly what I needed and then prospectively, if you think about our forecasting,
that means that there will be much less volatility in underlying O&M, such that it actually will be sort of less of, all
things equal, less of a benefit in years where you have fewer outages.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: And less of a [indiscernible] (31:17) in years that we have more. So, I think [indiscernible]
(31:24) that stabilization is helpful. So yeah, that's right, you got it.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: But it won't change the cash flow – obviously the ongoing cash expense profile of the company;
in years where you have outages, you'll be booking those cash expenses?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's right. The next rate case, if we think back beyond 2015, rates will be set in the future

Moving on, we'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd from MSSB.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning and congratulations.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning. Thank you.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I just wanted to talk broadly, Lynn, you mentioned the third of the strategic priorities,
positioning the company for long-term success. And the International business, we have seen volatility in the
performance of the business over time, and as you think about the long-term vision for the company, how might we
think about that volatility in the long-term, ways to address that to reduce that to be more in line with the U.S. core
utility business?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Stephen, I think that's a good question. There is natural volatility in international around foreign
exchange rates and to some extent, the National Methanol entity is impacted by oil prices or other commodity
influences. And you know that volatility, as you know, has been in our favor in recent years as the U.S. dollar has
weakened. Now, the U.S. dollar is strengthening, it's going the other direction.
We continue to look at ways to position the International business and address that volatility. I don't have any specific
plans that I can share with you at this point, but positioning International to complement the growth of the company is a
priority.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Understood. And just on the overall O&M position of the company, you're obviously making
great progress in looking at your cost structure. Should we be thinking about substantial – sort of continual review of
that or as you look out at the cost structure of the company, do you see further opportunities that are as yet untapped or
areas that you would want to focus more on down the road or – or is it more likely be relatively stable from here?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Stephen, I think focusing on cost structure has become a way of life, and will continue to be
such. If you think about the merger integration plans that we developed, a lot of that work was in 2010 and early 2011.
The business is continuing to change, and we continue to look for ways to deploy continuous improvement, look for
ways to optimize labor and contract labor, to continue to drive cost savings. And I think you're hearing that throughout
the industry as we grapple with a low load growth environment, and we are very keenly focused on improving our cost
structure.

Okay. Now we'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza from Citigroup.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Shar.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Just on Ohio, assuming you don't get the Ohio capacity to cost-based approach that you're
seeking, how soon could we see a more defined plan on strategic options with the Ohio – the Midwest assets?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Shar, we are expecting an order probably in late September or October, I guess it could slip into
November – we don't have a specific procedural schedule. We will take our time to analyze that order, understand what
it says about the plan, understand what it says about the position the Commission is taking, and then we'll analyze and
make a decision, as it makes sense to do so. So I would say – I can't say it would be by the end of the year, necessarily,
but, I would think, by the end of the first quarter next year, we would have finalized our thinking.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. And then if you – looking at the second half of this year, how much
would the capacity case impact your 2H outlook, especially if you don't get an order until potentially late or mid fourth
quarter?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Shar, I think that'll depend on what the order says. So you may recall that when we filed the
request, we actually asked for retroactive treatment back to August of 2012. So I think we're going to have to see how
the Commission addresses that and at what point, the recovery is granted. So what I would point to is our plan for
Commercial is roughly $90 million of net income. We've delivered roughly $3 million through the second half, so that
gives you a range of what the second half could include from a balanced target.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: All right. Got it. And then just lastly, shifting to Florida as far as the new potential new addition
of gas assets in 2017 and 2018, when could we start seeing builds occur, assuming you decide and you win the RFP
process for 2017 power?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I'm going to ask – I have Alex Glenn with me, the President of Florida, to jump in and give us an
update on that.
<A - R. Alexander Glenn>: Sure, Shar. On the 2018 combined cycle, our timing on that would be to go out for RFP
this year and file a need case next year, so that we would get, if we select the self-build option, approval from the
Commission. And then that would be an in-service date before the summer peak of 2018; that's on the larger combined
cycle. On the 2014 to 2017 timeframe, we're really looking at capacity needs in the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. So we
could be looking at new capacity, whether it's purchase, build or acquiring existing facilities in that 2015 – 2014, 2015,
2016 timeframe.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Terrific. Thank you very much.

<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Yeah, hi, Lynn. Good morning. Just on – could you give us a sense of earned ROEs at the
utilities either, I guess, trailing or in your forecast for this year?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah, that's a good question. Steve, we have so many pending regulatory proceedings you're
asking us at an interesting time, why don't we take that offline because I think what we want to do is to reflect the
benefit of the rate cases for the partial year and probably give you a sense of what 2013 could look like. We do file
surveillance reports in North and South Carolina but both of those calculations have some unique characteristics to
them though I don't think it's really indicative of what we're earning. So I'll ask Bill and Bob to follow up with you on
that.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Great. And just to clarify your comment on rate cases, so after this round of cases is
complete you don't have any intention to file, did you say next year or for the next few years?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Next few years. The one case we're evaluating, Steve, is Duke Energy Progress in South
Carolina. And that would be the only one.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. And I think I had one more. Oh, just where are you on any potential interest in the
Summer plant?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We're continuing to look at that, Steve. We've been in negotiations for some time with Santee
Cooper. As we've said before, we believe in regional nuclear. We think that we still believe in diversification. We think
that's going to be important to the company long term. But we have not yet reached agreement and don't have any
further update at this point.

Moving on, we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So perhaps just to follow up on Steve's question, what are the various considerations
for timing on a South Carolina case as it goes?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Lloyd Yates is with me. I'll ask Lloyd to step in on timing.
<A - Lloyd M. Yates>: So, in terms of timing, we're looking at filing – if we file that case, we're looking at filing that
case sometime late in the fourth quarter of this year.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Any considerations as far as whether or not you would, anything need to happen or
not happen, shall we say?
<A - Lloyd M. Yates>: I don't understand your question.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, we analyze rate cases based on the returns that we're earning, based on what we see in
terms of cost structure, O&M and also maintenance addition. And so, Duke Energy Progress has the same capital as the
North Carolina jurisdiction. So it's Sutton [ph] and Umini (41:09) and the Smith complex – and so we're looking very
closely at it. Just have not made a final decision and therefore haven't notified the case and all the things that would go
with that.
<A - Lloyd M. Yates>: Yeah. In terms of the numbers, if you think about Duke Energy Progress South Carolina, it's
about 20% of the entire utility. Duke Energy North Carolina is 80%; Duke Energy South Carolina is about 20% of the

utility. So, think about it that way in terms of volume.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great, excellent. And then turning back to Ohio if you will quickly, as some of your
peers have talked about driving costs out of that business specifically given the transition to restructured markets, any
comments there, I mean, any kind of reevaluation as you think about that business's future?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, we have been focused on cost in the Midwest fleet, really dating back to 2010 and that
team has been very aggressive in driving cost out. I think as you know with where capacity prices are in this year, in
particular, you're not going to solve the economics by driving cost out in 2013, but we do have a very keen focus on
running as efficiently as we can.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Very fair. And then perhaps lastly as it relates to Florida if you could just walk
through quickly, the interim capacity needs prior to 2018, is it more likely to think of that as sort of a temporary need
more than a permanent self-build opportunity, I mean, how do you think about that just given this being more of a
transitionary opportunity?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I'll ask Alex to step in, Julien.
<A - R. Alexander Glenn>: Yeah, Julien, we look at it is more of a permanent need, I mean, we've got, we're retiring
roughly 1,700 megawatts, 1,800 megawatts of capacity in the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. We've got real needs to fill
capacity in 2016, 2017, 2018 that doesn't go away over the long-term. So, we're looking at the 2016, 2017, 2018 as
needs for additional generation, whether it be purchase power or peaking units or possibly upgrading some plants and
then really possible acquisitions out there, plants that are exiting in the market. So that's both a short and longer term
need.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. So in total, you're really looking at 3 gigs in aggregate of permanent needs, if
you will, roughly.
<A - R. Alexander Glenn>: Up to, I would say up to that.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks, Julien.

Moving on, we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Just first of all, Lynn and Steve congratulations. Congratulations to both of you
especially Steve with your announcement this week. I want to focus a little bit on cash flow. I would love if you could
just talk about things like significant items like pension contribution needs over the next year or so. Any change, how
the potential change in cash that's outside of the U.S. – how the change in that tax law could potentially impact Duke,
whether you could bring back more cash from Latin America as well as bonus depreciation?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Sure. So, I'll take pension first, Michael. We are forecasting a $350 million contribution in 2013
which is comparable with what we did in 2012 and it'll be a combination of the Duke Energy Progress plans as well as
the Duke plan. The International front, we've got about $1.5 billion overseas. We've talked a little bit in the past about
two things, one being a structured transaction that we can pursue to bring some cash home, that's still under evaluation.
And then the second option would be flat out, just repatriation, we can do it with or without a tax holiday, but you've
got basically $1.5 billion offshore. And, oh, bonus depreciation, the bonus depreciation in 2013 is about $1.2 billion.
We are in an NOL position, so the cash associated with that bonus is really going to be realized out in the 2015, 2016
timeframe.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Meaning, you're not expecting to be a significant cash tax payer in 2013 or 2014 as well?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's correct.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. One other question, when you closed the Progress Energy merger, there was a
significant amount, almost $4 billion of holding company debt at the Progress Energy level at interest rates that are a
little bit above kind of current first mortgage bond or senior secured debt. What are your plans for the Progress Energy
holding company level debt and does that present a refinancing opportunity for you that could be a positive tailwind for
earnings?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We've done a little bit of that, Michael. I believe we took the QUIPS instruments out earlier this
year, and continue to look at the economics of refinancing to see if that makes sense, but I would not say that's a huge
driver.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Lynn. And once again, congrats, guys.

Moving on, we will take our next question from Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Good morning. My questions have to do with a couple of the items that are
excluded from adjusted earnings. The nuclear development charge of $87 million, I take it that's related to the
cancellation of the EPC contract at Levy?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's primarily Levy, and also, Harris, you may recall that we suspended the commercial
operating license [indiscernible] (47:12) on the Harris plant and took a charge for the wholesale allocation of the cost as
well, Hugh.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Okay. But for the Florida nuke costs, those are recoverable under the nuclear clause
in that state. Is that right?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It's the [indiscernible] (47:26) clause, just to remind you. So that's the wholesale allocation of
Levy, and under the wholesale terms of this contract, Hugh, we do not have an ability to recover them, and as a result,
we bear that cost. You may recall that these were identified back in the 2012 settlement in Florida as being amortizable,
in the same way as [ph] COR (47:47) , but in connection with the 2013 settlement, that provision of the 2012 settlement
was set aside, and we made a decision to take the impairment at that point.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Okay. And then the litigation reserve of $50 million I believe that's in connection
with Crescent. I don't know if you could perhaps give us some background there?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It is, Hugh. We have made a settlement offer to certain creditors that are involved in the Crescent
bankruptcy litigation, really dating back to the Crescent transaction in 2007. The terms of this offer are confidential, the
litigation is ongoing, and at this point, I can't comment any further on that litigation. We, of course, continue to believe
that the claims are without merit, but we're working through this litigation.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Great. And then finally if I could, could you just brief us on the
post-commissioning outages at Edwardsport and what, if anything, they portend for the plant's capacity factor over the
next year, year-and-a-half?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We've made good progress on Edwardsport, Hugh. The focus over the placed-in-service period
over the first few months is really consistent with the early operations of a new power plant. We've been focused on
system testing. We've been focused on tuning. So all of the major technology systems, the power block, the gasifier has
been captive, the plant is running on both gasifiers, as we speak. And as we've identified issues, we dispatched a team
to do a root cause analysis and help resolve them. And at this point, do not see anything that has developed of a
long-term nature. And you can expect us to continue to address issues as they arise over the next several months until
we get the plant to the point of its full capacity and potential.

Moving on, we'll take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Capital.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Thanks. I'll add my congratulations to Lynn and Steve.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: A couple of questions, Lynn. I believe you spoke about sales growth being slightly disappointing
compared with your expectations?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Kit, what I would say is we're 0.4% against an aspiration of 0.5%. We've seen good growth in
Industrial in certain segments, but a weakness in others, like [ph] I can (50:31) point to primary metals. Probably the
weakness that concerns us a little bit about the back half is really in Florida, where we've continued to see static low
usage customers and not really the rebound that we had hoped when we were forecasting the 0.5% and that's probably
the area I would point to that gives us lack of complete confidence on a 0.5% growth rate. But we'll continue to update
this in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but we just remain cautious about the outlook.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And is there anything that you see developing on the sales growth that would have implications
for your 4% to 6% EPS growth over the next couple of years?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No. I think we have been very conservative with our low growth assumptions. So we're looking
at kind of 1% type range and we are adding customers at roughly that percentage right now and so I don't see a
significant risk to the growth rate given the way we forecast it [ph] at this point. (51:41)
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay. And one other area, if I could. You mentioned, in positioning for long-term success, one of
your goals is to advocate for new regulatory mechanisms. Anything in particular you have in mind there?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I guess I would point back to something that we successfully partnered with other utilities on in
Indiana, the Senate Bill 560 [SB560], that gives us an opportunity to modernize the grid, for example, under a
multi-year plan to bring those costs into rates in a way that is more smoother for customers and more consistent with
the deployment of capital. That would be an example, if we could achieve things like that in other jurisdictions.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay, very good. Thank you.

Moving on, we'll take our next question from Kamal Patel from Wells Fargo.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<Q - Kamal B. Patel>: Good Morning. Had two quick questions, hopefully. With regard to Indiana and the
Edwardsport start-up issues, is there any cost-sharing requirement with rate payers or will you be passing those costs
through to them. How does that work?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We are operating under a cap in Indiana and the costs that we have incurred are under the cap.
So we do not have positive risk in Indiana at this point.
<Q - Kamal B. Patel>: Okay. And then this is probably better answered offline, but the Florida settlement I just
wanted to get an idea of the various remaining balances that there might be for recovery related to Crystal River 3 and

Levy, or is everything basically getting flushed out as part of this settlement?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We asked for a recognition of $295 million impairment. The remaining investment in Crystal
River should be recoverable under the various provisions. So we've got roughly $1.2 billion at the end of June on the
Crystal River plant, approximately $300 million on the upgrade investment. And then the Levy investment is probably
around $250 million.
