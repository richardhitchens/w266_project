Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.
As we reported, 2015 was an outstanding year for Celgene. We appreciate the opportunity to review with you these
exceptional results, important strategic developments, and our near- and longer-term outlook. Our operating momentum
and advancement of high-potential programs have us well-positioned to produce market-leading growth in 2016 and
beyond.
Very importantly, during 2015, we advanced a number of key strategic initiatives that will drive significant growth
over the next decade. We enhanced and provided greater clarity on the potential of REVLIMID. We firmly established
the value proposition of OTEZLA while significantly expanding our I&I franchise. We strengthened the long-term
growth potential of our Hematology & Oncology franchise through strategic immuno-oncology collaborations and by
advancing important late-stage clinical programs. And we broadened and deepened our research and development
pipeline as the investments we've made in internal and integrated collaborative research programs advanced. These
significant accomplishments, combined with our strong finish to the year, generates excellent momentum in our
businesses as we head into 2016.
Later in the call, Peter, Jackie, and Scott will more fully review the outstanding results of the year and the strong
commercial momentum across geographies and products that have us well-positioned to achieve four products with
sales over $1 billion, each expected to grow by double-digit percentages in 2016. Mark will conclude with his
perspective on strategic initiatives and upcoming milestones. These milestones position us to sustain high growth for
the long term. And, as I hope you can tell, this is an incredibly exciting time at Celgene, and our people are critical to
maximizing our enormous potential.
Earlier this month, we announced management changes that leverage the talents and experience of our exceptional
leaders while expanding and strengthening our team. These changes provide Mark, Jackie, Scott, Peter, and Rupert, all
outstanding leaders, the opportunity to have an even greater impact on our organization. Since announcing these
changes, our teams across the globe are energized and even more focused and committed to producing exceptional
results. I could not be more excited about the future of Celgene. Together with Mark, our entire leadership team, and all
of our employees around the globe, we look forward to continuing to deliver exceptional results and turning the great
promise of Celgene into reality.
Thank you. Let me now turn the call over to Peter.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. 2015 was another great year for Celgene. Our teams around the globe
delivered robust financial results while also advancing and acquiring further next-generation growth drivers. In fact,
2015 was an exceptional year of significant strategic investments. We've strengthened our portfolio in several key focus
areas, including immuno-oncology and epigenetics, in addition to laying the foundation to be a future leader in
inflammatory bowel diseases. While delivering strong commercial results, we made critical investments now so that we
are set up to deliver sustainable, high-growth performance well into the next decade.

Now let's discuss the financial results for the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter, total net product sales grew 24%.
Our four key products, REVLIMID, POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA, grew 28%, driven by continued
momentum in core indications, label expansions, and global launches.
Now, while Jackie and Scott will provide more color on the underlying market dynamics for these products later in the
call, I would like to highlight just two items. First, full-year product sales grew 21% and were supported by greater
diversification. Now, as you've seen, REVLIMID continues growing 14% to 16% per year, and it now represents 63%
of product sales versus 67% in 2013. We expect this performance, as well as diversification trend, will continue right
through 2020 and beyond.
Secondly, U.S. ABRAXANE sales and international REVLIMID sales were positively impacted during the quarter by
buying patterns. For ABRAXANE, contract optimization led to a customary buy-in during Q4, as we've seen before,
and that is often followed by a sell-through during Q1. And as we mentioned on our Q3 conference call, 2015 was the
first year of REVLIMID sales in Russia via a tender. These occurred in Q2 and in Q4, and we now expect a similar
buying pattern going forward.
Product sales growth for the quarter and the year remain volume-driven. The foreign exchange markets remained
volatile throughout the year, resulting in an unfavorable net forex impact of $16 million to revenue during Q4 and $109
million for the year. Now, our treasury team really did an excellent job mitigating this headwind. And, just as reference
and just for perspective, if we did not have the benefit of our hedging program, the forex impact would have been
approximately $100 million during Q4 alone and approximately $450 million for the year. So you can see that forex is
a large factor that has been well-managed in 2015.
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.18, which includes a $0.07 per share impact from a milestone to our partner
OncoMed that we announced earlier. As a reminder, after entering into a collaboration, we include milestone payments
and other collaboration expenses within our adjusted financial measures. Now, of course we are pleased with how our
partner programs are progressing and the potential contributions they could have on our longer-term outlook. That's
good news.
For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $4.71, a strong 27% increase over the prior year, and even more
impressive, considering that it includes a $0.17 per share dilutive impact related to business development activities.
And of course that includes the $0.14 per share dilutive impact related to the Receptos acquisition this past summer.
As we discussed on the Q3 call, we expected a significant ramp in R&D spend during the fourth quarter, and in fact this
happened and resulted in 25% of Q4 sales being reinvested in R&D. This is due to increased clinical trial activity for
our important, high-potential, late-stage programs, and the collaboration-related milestone expense that we just
discussed. And please note Q4 was the first full quarter with Receptos' operations as part of our organization. All these
investments are critical to creating our long-term growth profile that extends well into the next decade. On the other
hand, as we also discussed last quarter, after investing in our global commercial capabilities over the past few years to
support the global launches for ABRAXANE, POMALYST, and OTEZLA, we are now achieving meaningful leverage
on the SG&A line.
Our earnings quality remains exceptional, with growth for the quarter and the year driven primarily by adjusted
operating income, further underscoring the momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we experienced
the full impact of last year's $8 billion debt offering, which adds an incremental $310 million of interest expense per
year. Accordingly, on an annual basis, we continue to expect total net interest expense will be between $480 million
and $500 million per year going forward.
We ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, and throughout the year, we
assertively utilized our balance sheet and cash flow to invest in next-generation growth drivers while simultaneously
repurchasing approximately $3.3 billion of Celgene's shares. This is the largest annual level of repurchase in the history
of Celgene, an impressive fact given the numerous other key strategic investments made during 2015. And it reflects
our continued confidence in the company's future and our continued support of shareholders' interests.

Now, earlier this month, we provided 2016 guidance that calls for continued strong top-line performance and a
leveraged bottom-line outlook. This positions us to continue as a leader in growth among large biotechs. We expect
total net product sales between $10.5 billion and $11 billion, a 17% increase from 2015. This range incorporates an
approximately $120 million net forex impact that predominantly affects international REVLIMID sales. While we do
not provide total revenue guidance, I would just like to highlight the royalty-bearing sales of Ritalin and Focalin by
Novartis have decreased significantly over the past few years due to generic competition in certain markets, and we
expect that trend to accelerate further in 2016.
Turning to the adjusted operating margin, we expect a 150 basis point improvement, driven by meaningful leverage in
SG&A and a slight improvement in the product gross margin due to mix. Of course we'll continue to invest in the
commercial launches of our key products, just to maximize their global potential and in particular, as we build out our
I&I commercial capabilities in Europe to further capitalize on the growing momentum of OTEZLA. We also expect to
increase our level of R&D investment as we initiate 50 new clinical trials across the pipeline and expand the number of
phase III programs. Included in adjusted research and development expense are milestone payments to partners. These
are projected to range between $130 million and $140 million for the year.
Moving to the bottom line and for the full year, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $5.50 and $5.70, a 19%
increase from 2015. Now, we are off to a very strong start this year, and we anticipate Q1 adjusted earnings per share
between $1.27 and $1.30. This is a 20% year-over-year growth, and this represents earning 23% of our full-year EPS
guidance, a better start versus historical Q1 performance as a percentage of the full year than we've seen. Now, this
guidance does include two items in the quarter. First, as you know, during Q1 we typically have higher gross-to-net
adjustments with REVLIMID and POMALYST due to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments, in
addition to the potential sell-through of inventory for ABRAXANE in the U.S. We expect these same patterns in 2016.
And, second, we now expect several potential partner milestones to be achieved in the first quarter, resulting in
between $50 million and $75 million in milestones to partners.
Building on this great 2015, we look forward to another strong year in 2016, as our operating momentum continues and
we advance the next generation of growth drivers that have the potential to maintain our growth profile into the next
decade. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to my colleague Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. Our Hematology & Oncology teams around the world and across all of our
activities delivered another excellent quarter to finish 2015 with strong momentum. The franchise grew 18% year over
year in Q4 and 16% for the full year, to reach just under $8.7 billion of product revenues, a record year. And our strong
growth trajectory will continue in 2016 and beyond.
In 2016, we will see the first full year of revenues following launches for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma in
the U.S., Germany, Spain, and other countries, and we expect reimbursement approvals and launches in France, Italy,
Japan, and others. We will see the first full year of revenues for POMALYST in Japan following the June 2015 launch
there. In addition, demand is being fueled by increasing durations of treatment across all lines of therapy in myeloma.
ABRAXANE growth outside the U.S. is very solid, with nice momentum post-launch in pancreatic cancer.
2016 will also be a year that kicks off a steady, multiyear flow of clinical data across a number of our late-stage
programs, with the first readout from our phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program coming in the middle of the year
for the REMARC diffuse large B-cell lymphoma trial. We continue to build our hematology pipeline, with programs
currently enrolling for the novel compounds luspatercept, AG-221, and durvalumab. And the program for AG-120 is
advancing. Finally, a number of trials are ongoing for new indications for ABRAXANE, as well as for ABRAXANE in
immuno-oncology combination therapies.
REVLIMID's year-over-year growth accelerated in Q4, with 18% growth for the quarter, including negative foreign
exchange of about 1 percentage point. REVLIMID's full-year growth reached 16.5%, including 2 percentage points of
negative foreign exchange. This growth is primarily volume driven. The ongoing launches of the newly diagnosed

myeloma indication in the U.S. and across several markets in Europe are in the early stages and are fueling volume
growth. REVLIMID is the market leader in first-line myeloma in the U.S., and in Q4 we hit another new all-time high
for number of unique patients treated. REVLIMID's share in second-line myeloma in the U.S. was stable throughout
2015.
European overall non-stem-cell transplant newly diagnosed myeloma share reached around 15% at the end of 2015,
with Germany at over 20%. Across Europe, REVLIMID held or gained second-line share. Duration of treatment trends
are positive across all geographies, supported by an ever-growing body of clinical data in favor of continuous treatment
with REVLIMID. With the momentum of the newly diagnosed myeloma launch in Europe and reimbursement in
Russia, our REVLIMID European region year-over-year volume growth accelerated and reached 26% in Q4 and 19%
for the full year. That excellent volume growth was somewhat offset by negative price and foreign exchange impacts.
The future growth outlook is strong, as 2016 will include the first full year of revenues post the newly diagnosed
myeloma launch for REVLIMID in a number of markets, including the U.S., across Europe, and Japan, and we expect
to continue to obtain reimbursement approvals in more countries in 2016. And REVLIMID's future looks bright for a
long time to come. In the U.S., the NCCN guidelines were recently updated and now include the RVd triplet regimen as
a category 1 preferred treatment for first-line myeloma patients in both the stem cell transplant and non-stem cell
transplant settings. In 2016, we will see the readout of the REMARC trial in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and our
overall program for REVLIMID in lymphoma will continue to advance. Finally, within the FUSION program under
our collaboration with AstraZeneca/MedImmune, the REVLIMID/durvalumab combination for newly diagnosed
myeloma will begin enrollment in a phase I proof-of-concept trial that will inform next steps for advancing durvalumab
in newly diagnosed myeloma combination therapy.
POMALYST/IMNOVID achieved strong sequential and year-over-year growth to finish 2015 up 45% for both Q4 and
the full year, and 95% of POMALYST/IMNOVID's 2015 growth came from volume. POMALYST's third line and
greater share in the U.S. showed an upward trend in the second half of 2015, and duration of treatment increased.
IMNOVID overall EU market share in both third and fourth line myeloma has now reached about one-third, and
durations of treatment are increasing in Europe as well. We look forward to the first full year of POMALYST revenues
in Japan during 2016 after a strong launch in June of 2015 and strong demand uptake.
Emerging data for POMALYST/IMNOVID triplet combinations support longer durations of treatment, and a number
of combination trials with POMALYST/IMNOVID and novel agents are ongoing, including immuno-oncology
combinations where phase I data presented at ASH were highly encouraging for relapsed refractory myeloma patients
with higher overall response rates versus today's standard-of-care therapies. Our POMALYST/durvalumab
combination trial for relapsed refractory myeloma has initiated and recently enrolled its first patient.
ABRAXANE had a very good quarter in Q4 and finished 2015 strong, with 15% year-over-year growth for the quarter
and 14% for the full year. Importantly, volume growth was 18% and 16% respectively and was achieved despite a
highly competitive landscape in some indications and geographies. The ABRAXANE/gemcitabine combination
continues to hold a standard of care position for pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and is moving to that position in Europe,
with strong uptake and ongoing launches in various markets. During the second half of 2015, ABRAXANE U.S. shares
in lung and breast were stable, and the launch of the lung indication in Europe is in its early stages.
Emerging data is providing signs that ABRAXANE's future in immuno-oncology combination therapies will be
exciting. We have now seen promising early data for both lung and breast, and we expect significant data flow
beginning in 2017, with two phase III readouts in lung and then triple-negative breast readouts to follow in 2018. Other
programs for ABRAXANE also continue to advance across adjuvant and locally advanced pancreas, both
triple-negative and early-stage breast, and a number of patient segments in non-small lung cancer. We're optimistic
about ABRAXANE's future growth prospects and the potential of the product in immuno-oncology combinations.
Building on the strong momentum created by our teams during 2015, we look forward to another year of both excellent
sales growth and advancement of our clinical programs in 2016. We expect REVLIMID sales to grow to $6.6 billion to
$6.7 billion, up 15% at the midpoint of the range and driven by volume again this year. POMALYST/IMNOVID and
ABRAXANE are both expected to officially reach blockbuster drug status by each surpassing the $1 billion revenue

mark this year, and volumes will also contribute the majority of their growth.
Our regulatory and clinical teams have very full agendas this year. On the submission side, we expect to submit
REVLIMID for post-stem cell transplant maintenance in both the U.S. and EU, POMALYST/IMNOVID updated label
with renal impairment data in both the U.S. and EU, and ABRAXANE for early-stage breast cancer in the EU.
On the clinical side, we expect data from the REMARC, CONTINUUM, ETNA, and tnAcity trials. In addition, we
expect proof-of-concept data for CC-122 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and for the VentiRx TLR8 agonist in solid
tumors. Furthermore, we are advancing a number of clinical programs, including the phase III trials for luspatercept,
AG-221, and AG-120; our broad program across multiple hematological indications for durvalumab; and our novel
BCMA program for myeloma. We're excited about both our short-term growth outlook and near-term clinical and
regulatory catalysts, as well as the significant promise of the mid to long term based on a number of key milestones to
come.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott A. Smith
Thank you, Jackie, and good morning. 2015 was a great year, a year full of accomplishment and advancement for
Celgene I&I. In 2015, we saw revenues accelerating throughout the year in the U.S. We had approvals in the EU for
both psoriasis and PsA and launched in the early EU reimbursement countries. We also significantly advanced the
development pipeline for Celgene I&I with the acquisition of Receptos and lead molecule, ozanimod, as well as taking
major steps forward in the GED-301 development program.
If we now look at global sales, we can see 2015 Q4 net sales were $183 million, leading to full-year sales of $472
million. The majority of revenues in 2015 were from the U.S., but we are seeing very encouraging metrics in the early
launch countries in the EU, as well as Canada. Overall, we are pleased with how the global launch was executed in
2015, the first full year of commercialization for OTEZLA, and we believe it provides a tremendous base as we move
into 2016 and beyond.
Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness,
patient requests, and trialists. The launch of the DTC campaign in late Q2 corresponded with an inflection of the
OTEZLA TRx trajectory. It is important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies new to brand share
with approximately 40% in both psoriasis and PsA. Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis
market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 21% of the total branded market.
Now turning to Europe, we received regulatory approval for OTEZLA early in 2015 and have already launched in
Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and Scotland. We look to launch in the remainder of the
significant European markets in 2016. As I stated earlier, we are seeing very encouraging trends in all the early launch
markets and are particularly pleased with our progress in Germany.
In 2016, we should see continuing flow of data for OTEZLA. As mentioned earlier in the year at the JPMorgan
conference, we recently received the two-year radiographic data from the phase III ankylosing spondylitis study.
Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, we are very encouraged by these data, which show a lack of
progression of disease for a majority of patients. In addition to seeing these data at a major medical meeting in 2016,
we also hope to get data from the phase II proof-of-concept studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, as well as
data to support our QD formulation.
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-301 and ozanimod. Specifically looking at
GED-301, in 2015, we initiated the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease, as well as the large pivotal phase III
Crohn's disease trial CD-002 and the phase II proof-of-concept study in UC. During 2015, we also acquired Receptos
with its lead molecule, ozanimod, a potential best-in-class, next-generation S1P receptor modulator. Post-acquisition
we were able to work closely with the talented people at Receptos to accelerate both the MS and the UC programs.

The RADIANCE and SUNBEAM phase III MS clinical trials are now fully enrolled and ahead of schedule. We expect
to file for MS in the second half of 2017. We have also initiated the pivotal phase III UC trial TRUE NORTH and a
phase II proof-of-concept study of ozanimod in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
2015 was a year of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put it in a position
to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio in 2016 and beyond. We also moved all major development
programs ahead through significant milestones in 2015. These programs should help drive strong growth through 2020
and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we
move into 2016.
Thank you for your attention, and I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thank you, Scott, and thank you to all my colleagues for their commitment to patients we seek to serve and for
delivering another year of outstanding results. As we transition to 2016, the clarity of our mission, the continuity of our
leadership team, and our focus on advancing key strategic imperatives continues to energize and unify us. Our robust
2016 guidance and 2020 outlook are built on a strong foundation of global commercial, clinical, regulatory, and
research operating excellence. The competitive advantages our products and teams have achieved provide us with
considerable optionality and multiple strategic drivers to meet and exceed our near-term financial targets.
Longer term, we expect significant additional revenue from new data and new indications for our existing commercial
portfolio, plus the introduction of several products currently in late-stage development, to sustain our sales base through
the loss of exclusivity for key products. Our long focus on internal research and external collaborations has generated a
pipeline of approximately 50 unique molecules, many with transformative, first-in-class clinical profiles, and with the
potential to be developed for more than 100 indications. These products are expected to fuel innovation and to create
significant growth opportunities over the next 10 to 15 years. Moreover, we expect our consistently strong cash flow to
provide additional opportunities to fortify our pipeline and enhance our outlook.
Nearer-term catalysts for growth include the availability of data from at least 18 different phase III trials beginning in
the middle of this year and continuing through mid-2018. Strategically, these studies also represent the opportunity to
expand our hematology franchise to include lymphomas; to advance our immuno-oncology programs in multiple solid
tumors and blood cancers; and, with GED-301, ozanimod, and OTEZLA, to establish clear global leadership in the
treatment of serious inflammatory bowel diseases. Other ongoing pivotal programs for AG-221, CC-486, and
luspatercept may provide additional opportunities for near-term growth. And over the next 12 to 24 months, we expect
a steady stream of midstage and proof-of-concept data to begin to establish the clinical profiles of a number of
molecules generated from distributed and integrated research and drug development model. Importantly, these products

<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Oh, congrats on all the continued progress. Maybe a question for Peter. I haven't heard Celgene
refer to the 2017 guidance in a while. I think the last update was $13 billion to $14 billion top line, about $7.25 in
non-GAAP EPS. Is that still intact?
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hey, Eric. It's Peter. Thanks for the question. So overall, as you can see from our performance
and the discussions today, we are feeling very good about the business performance. And in fact on a constant currency
basis, we are on track, driven by our multiple myeloma portfolio, REV, POM, and all the data that's been generated,
and all the great things you're hearing about OTEZLA and the launch and the outlook. So on a constant currency basis,
we're on track. Maybe the mix is a little different than we originally thought, but feeling really good.
That said, forex has been volatile since the time that guidance was issued in January 2013. And actually if you went
from that time to today, we're probably seeing, net of hedges, about an $800 million impact on the top line. So we are
kind of calibrating on that, and we do intend to provide an update as we get closer to 2017 based on where these forex
rates really look like they're going to land in 2017. So thanks for the question.
I would also add just for what it's worth, we also added obviously, in the beginning of 2015, our guidance out to 2020,
and clearly we are making a lot of investments to drive towards that. And we feel very good. Now, we updated it last
summer after the Receptos and the AstraZeneca deal, and we reaffirmed it earlier this month. And it remains entirely
on track despite the implied forex impact. I mean, clearly forex has been affecting that outlook, too, but our operating
performance in that timeframe, we think, will overcome that. So – and just for perspective, from the time that we gave
that guidance to 2020, there's about a $700 million, $800 million headwind as well, but we're good to cover that. We'll
feel very good about that.
And then obviously on the bottom line, we're making significant investments in R&D. We have to see how those
develop and so forth and as well as some of the milestones that come through. So our feeling is, in total, we really kind
of got our organization headed towards hitting these 2016 numbers, driving towards 2020, and we'll be updating that
2017 as we get closer to the year when it's sort of like the next year ahead of us. Thanks.
<Q - Eric Schmidt>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congratulations on the progress
over the past couple years. I just wanted to switch a little bit and talk about OTEZLA and maybe just understand some
of the different European dynamics related with the launch, kind of country by country as you start to get
reimbursement there.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thank you for the question. So where we are, approval was in early 2015, February, and we
then launched immediately in Germany, and then there was a series of other launches, mainly in smaller countries as
we went through the year in 2015, where we were able to attain early reimbursement, including Switzerland and
Austria, some Scandinavian countries, Scotland. And so sort of a partial launch. We should see some very significant
countries come online in Europe in 2016. We should see the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, and some other – some
mid-markets in Europe. So I think we're – I look at it we're at the very early start, really, with one of the major
countries launched. And 2016 will be the real true launch year for OTEZLA in Europe. And the early metrics, as I said
in the prepared remarks, have been very strong in the early launch countries, so we're excited about being able to
expand the presence in Europe.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Are there any particular dynamics around like how patients are treated versus the U.S. in some
of these countries in Europe that kind of would change the speed or rate of uptake in the particular countries that we
should focus on, though?

Page 9 of 17
<A - Scott A. Smith>: The only country where I think – two dynamics. One dynamic applies to all of Europe. There's
a little bit less utilization of biologic therapies in Europe than you see on a per patient basis in North America, in the
U.S. and Canada. So the biologic market is a little bit smaller. There's been less use, more use of earlier therapy. So I
think that bodes well for our market presence. There is one market in Germany that does have a substantial oral market
already with the fumaric acid ester products. And so there is a substantial market there. So that looks a little bit
different than the U.S.
But we think we have a really nice opportunity in Europe because of the relative lack of use of biologics relative to the
U.S. in Europe. The demographic patient numbers are very similar when you take a look at psoriasis and psoriatic
arthritis, so that's a market which has been even less penetrated, so we're very excited about [ph] folding out (35:15)
over the course of time in Europe. And then hopefully filing in Japan early this year and launching in Japan in 2017,
which is a very underserved market. So we've got a lot of nice growth coming in the future.
<Q - Alethia Young>: Great, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on POMALYST,
which seemed to have a nice beat this quarter. Wonder if there's anything different about 4Q relative to the prior ones?
And then maybe more so how you're thinking about how CD38 antibodies potentially fit into the myeloma treatment
paradigm. I assume this is something you see as complementary to your established IMiD backbone. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Cory. It's Jackie. Thanks for the question. So I think mostly what we're seeing with the
POM performance in Q4 is the ongoing impact of penetration in Europe. You probably heard what I said in my
prepared remarks, where the product now in the third and fourth lines in Europe has reached about a third, and that's
happened over a period of time. Also, we had the launch of POM that started in Japan in June, and we've seen very,
very nice uptake in Japan in the first six or seven months of being on the market there. I also think that the treatment
landscape is starting to maybe settle out a little bit, although you've got dara coming in just now and just now starting to
ramp up.
Within this landscape, the POM/dex regimen is very competitively positioned, as it's the only regimen that has proven
survival after REVLIMID relapse and exposure to a proteasome inhibitor. So we're seeing early uptake for dara right in
that fourth line and greater setting, and we're seeing the rest of the landscape start to play out as we've got the other
combinations that have been approved. I think it's a bit early to call trends on triplet adoption broadly in relapsed
refractory myeloma, but with the sequencing patterns, we're going to see more of that, and we think POM is very
well-positioned to compete there.
You're also probably getting a little bit of an impact of carfilzomib moving into second line there. Relative share gains
were greater in second line than any other line of therapy, as you would expect, and I think that creates even potentially
more room in the third line and greater setting for these other therapies to take their places.
<Q - Cory W. Kasimov>: All right. Thanks, Jackie.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
<Q>: Hi, guys. This is actually [ph] John Miller (38:11) on for Mark. Congrats to Mark and Jackie for the new
positions. Mark sends his regards. He couldn't join the call. He's out shopping for a new wig to wear on tomorrow's
video. I just had a quick question about the REMARC trial. Do you need OS data for reimbursements, and will you
have it this year?

<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: So our position on that, at the time of the readout of the trial – and first of all I'm not going
to make any comments about what type of wig I think Mark may show up in, but we'll just see how that one goes.
With the trial, what we would expect to see with the readout would be obviously the PFS result and then a trend in OS.
I think we believe that if there's a positive trend in OS – and it will depend on the strength of the trend – that that would
be something that the regulators could view favorably with respect to the submission. Obviously, if you had a
statistically significant OS trend right out of the gate, that would be extremely positive, and that's not our base-case
assumption. But we think with a positive PFS readout and some trend on OS, that that would put us in a very good
position with the regulators. As you know, it's a high unmet medical need. You've got a significant relapse rate in
diffuse large B-cell, and most of it occurs within two years. The patient prognosis is quite bad on relapse. There's no
currently accepted maintenance therapies. There's no data to support maintenance therapies right now, and so positive
readout on this trial would put us in quite a good position in diffuse large B-cell.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden from UBS.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Great job on diversifying this pipeline away from
REVLIMID. That said, I do have a REVLIMID question on maybe one of the bigger readouts of the REMARC study.
So this is a maintenance study following response to R-CHOP upfront in DLBCL. If you think down the road a little
bit, if the front-line R-CHOP standard of care shifts to include ibrutinib, then to what extent would you see that shift as
potentially impacting the REVLIMID opportunity here? I'm just trying to get a sense for whether or not this could wind
up being split by GCB subtype, because it seems like the non-GCB subtype addressed by ibrutinib might be the smaller
subset in DLBCL? Just trying to connect the dots for us for this opportunity if you would. Thanks very much.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, Matt. Well, let's see how it goes, and let's remember that across the program, we
have data coming from the RELEVANCE trial. We have AUGMENT. We have MAGNIFY. We have the ROBUST
trial as well, where we have that GCB, non-GCB and ABC subtype subset. So I think in the first instance, a positive
readout on the REMARC trial gives us a nice opportunity. In diffuse large B-cell, again, you've got high unmet medical
need and probably room for multiple therapies, should others that come along and give positive result.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: But I guess the REMARC study includes both subtypes. Is that right?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yes.
<Q - Matt M. Roden>: Okay, great. Thanks very much for taking the question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, everybody. Can you just maybe
take a moment – and I know in your prepared remarks you've commented on this somewhat – but talk to us a little bit
about specific trends and duration that you're seeing, how you're seeing that play out in Europe versus maybe
lengthening duration in the U.S. obviously for REVLIMID. And then the impact that you're seeing from some of the
new triplets that are coming on the market or even the potential for the antibody combinations, and just your
expectation around how you're thinking about substantial changes to duration, either this year or over the next couple
years. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks. Well, I think everything that we've seen and that you've seen is supportive for
continued positive trends in duration of treatment across all lines of therapy, and that includes the data that we've seen
read out so far with the triplet regimens and in particular the RVd data, which as we know was the first triplet regimen

to read out for newly diagnosed, and really quite impressive PFS results. So what we're seeing in the market, both in
the U.S. and Europe, are increasing duration trends for both REVLIMID and POMALYST. Those are continuing to go
very nicely. Europe is still somewhat behind the U.S. I think we've talked about first exposure durations in the U.S.
now being somewhere over 17 months, total exposure now over 22 months, continues to trend in a positive direction.
The range across Europe is somewhere now in the 12 to 14 months, so you can see a ways to go for Europe to catch up.
And now with the newly diagnosed approval, we should now see that trajectory maybe steepen a little bit and continue.
We're also seeing nice duration gains for POMALYST as well, and I think we'll see those across Europe over time and
we'll see them in Japan. So the body of clinical data that continues to evolve is supportive for early and continuous
treatment of myeloma with REVLIMID and then a strong role for the IMiDs in backbone therapy across any of the
triplets that we've seen so far, including in combination with the monoclonal antibodies.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: And, Jackie, are you willing to just make a comment around how long you think it
might take for Europe to start looking like the U.S. or if you expect it to ever be as good as the U.S. and just maybe
slightly less?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Well, I mean, medically, there's no reason why it should be different. We've started in a
different place, so it will take a little bit of time to get there, but the trends are very good. And I think that we'll see that
happen over a period of time. These numbers that we give you are always averages across a big portfolio of patients, so
you can't expect that an average data point is just going to jump up from one day to the next, and it will be a cumulative
thing. So every time we get a newly diagnosed patient on drug and then that newly diagnosed patient is staying on drug
for a longer period of time, there's a cumulative effect of that in the portfolio, and that average starts going up. And that
average data point, of course, is applied to all the patients in the whole portfolio, and it becomes a pretty big number, is
what we saw in the U.S.
If we go back to the ASH data that came out – I think it was in 2009 – and you started to see more move towards this
continuous treatment paradigm is over time, after a few years, duration became the larger driver of growth in the U.S.
And at some point that will happen in Europe, but that'll play out over a few years. So I think the great news is there's
multiple drivers, particularly in Europe, and then in Japan you've got a relatively higher impact from market share gains
in newly diagnosed early on, the duration then starts to kick in, and then that plays out over time. And so you've got
multiple factors driving growth, and they'll do so for a long, long period of time.
<Q - Matthew K. Harrison>: Great. Thank you very much for the color.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Thanks. Just sort of following along on some of the prior questions about duration, et cetera. I
know there was growing, increasing confidence about duration, partly from the ASPIRE data and the AbbVie data, as
well as obviously the RVd data, but yet the 2020 guidance wasn't changed. I know there's been a lot of dynamics
moving around, particularly FX. Should I come away and take away the message that duration continues to get a lot
better, but the FX was really a key issue in 2020? Maybe just walk us through how the duration confidence is, but yet
2020 wasn't really changed, and things of that nature. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Michael, thanks for the question, and I'll let Peter jump in after – maybe I'll just start. I
mean we've just seen the SWOG data presented at ASH in December. We've now got the triplet regimens approved in
the relapse setting, and this is going to play out over a period of time. We feel highly confident in our long-term growth
prospects and what we think duration trends are going to be. We also have been pleased with the reimbursement
discussions for newly diagnosed label expansion for REVLIMID in Europe, and now that we've got those countries on
board and we'll have the remaining large ones in 2016, we go forward from that in a very good position with respect to
having already negotiated REVLIMID's price. So as other therapies come to market – and all the clinical data supports
longer duration of treatment, so we feel really good about that.

Have we fully updated our financial forecast to reflect what the full opportunity of that could be? We have not, because
we want to give this a little bit of time to just settle in, see what physicians are saying now with all of the new
treatments that have come to market, [ph] socialized (48:29) a bit more of that SWOG data, and other things. And we
also are in the situation, as Peter mentioned, with the FX headwind, we got puts and takes in the financial model that
makes it such that we already gave an update on 2020 in the middle of the summer, and we increased it despite the big
FX numbers that Peter put out there.
So I think that all of these trends and where we are in the market also set us up very well in terms of how we think
about the development of our next generation of novel agents and molecules, and a bit of this also could relate to the
evolving non-Hodgkin's landscape as well, but when you look at the CC-122, CC-2220, the BCMA, durvalumab, and
the things that we are moving along, I think we're in an excellent position to not only continue to evolve the treatment
paradigms for patients but to see those result in a very robust portfolio of products that's going to allow us to deliver
strong growth for a long time to come.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Well said. The only thing I'd add is that, just to be clear, in my comments earlier, I
highlighted that in fact the foreign exchange rates have moved to create a little bit of headwind by 2020, but we've got
that covered. In other words, right now, some of the strength in our business, all things that Jackie talked about, as well
as some of strength you're seeing in the I&I portfolio, makes us feel very comfortable with 2020. So when we
reconfirm that 2020 guidance, we are recognizing the forex impact, and we're fine. And in fact sometimes I'm asked
when I talk with investors, if the rates reversed, if the dollar weakens a bit, does that help us? And the answer would
clearly be yes. So it works both ways. But at this point we feel great about the guidance we gave in 2020. 2015, what
we've seen in the last year, both commercially as well as in the pipeline, just is very encouraging for that timeframe, so
we feel great about it.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay. Thank you for clarifying that.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I got a couple on ABRAXANE. So I wanted to
get a sense for the nearer term, what if any changes have you seen in the number of cycles, either pancreatic or lung?
And then, two, longer term, what you guys view as the biggest driver. Is it I/O combinations? Is it pancreatic
adjuvants? Is it just executing on the OUS launch, et cetera? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So in terms of number of cycles, I mean, I think we're
roughly in line with what we would've expected. That's not a big driver. As you know, we've had headwinds,
particularly in the U.S., with the launches of the checkpoint inhibitors. In the second half of 2015, it actually felt like
that that stabilized a little bit. You get very rapid uptake when something new comes to market, so we saw a little bit
more stable shares in the second half of 2015, which I take as a good sign.
Outside the U.S., growth is quite solid, mostly driven by the pancreatic ongoing launches, where it's still pretty early
days in some countries. We still don't have reimbursement in all of the top five countries in Europe. So that's going
extremely well, and there's still room from a share gain standpoint for us to establish ABRAXANE/gem as standard of
care in Europe, and it take essentially the same place that it's taken in the U.S. The lung launch in Europe is in very
early days. So in the near term that stronger growth outside the U.S. is going to contribute to putting us in a solid
position with respect to overall global growth while the rest of these things play out.
So just with respect to the couple of things that you highlighted, I think pretty obviously, assuming that the I/O
combination data is positive, you've got the potential for ABRAXANE to be at the backbone chemotherapy in multiple
indications in I/O combination regimens, so that would longer term be the more significant upside. At the same time,
the adjuvant pancreas trial is our trial, so that's fully within our management, and as you probably know that indication
could double or potentially more than double the size of the pancreas opportunity for ABRAXANE versus the one that

we have today. So those are a couple things that we are pretty optimistic about. And then for the next year or so until
we see some of that phase III I/O data in 2017, we're holding our own and doing really pretty well.
<Q - Geoffrey Meacham>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On a high level, you guys have now more
than 18 phase III trials ongoing. Also just recently settled with the Allergan on the IP of REVLIMID. Shall we expect
similar pace of business development activity in 2016? And then maybe [ph] a few (54:02) questions for Jackie. Can
you talk about the contribution from pricing and also volume increase in 4Q 2015 sales for REVLIMID in the U.S.
market? Thank you.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Hey, good morning. We're going to break these questions up, and I'll take the first one on the
pace of BD and obviously the IP settlement. So you're right. 2015 was a very big year for us. We got a lot
accomplished when you think about the deal we did with AstraZeneca to get into the checkpoint inhibitors space, with
Juno and then obviously Receptos and then other deals that are equally important. It was a very full agenda for the year.
And quite frankly, we aren't in any way slowing down or backing down at all on that. It's really a question of what
opportunities we see, though, and it's really a question of as they come along and do the right opportunities present
ourselves.
But we remain very focused on building the next generation of great assets. We are scanning constantly what the next
generation of technologies will be, and we find that – we happen to be very fortunately working between our
Hematology & Oncology space and the I&I area in scientific areas where science is really opening up, and there's a lot
of great technology coming through. So we want to make sure we're positioned against that, but we don't really work
with a pace necessarily or any one budget. We just make sure that we're availing ourselves of what's out there. Clearly
from a financial perspective we have the financial strength to work with everybody, and I think we've got a very nice
track record of designing these relationships with other companies in ways that work for each company, and we're very
comfortable with that.
I'll pass it then to Jackie for her part.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah. So just on the price question, I mean, what – we see an environment within the U.S.
where we are for the moment able to continue to take reasonable price increases on, notably, REVLIMID and
POMALYST. We are quite conscious of linking those to the value proposition of the drugs. And we think that we have
a very good case to make in that regard. For the long-term forecasts, we have somewhat more moderate assumptions
about the level of price increases that we would take in the U.S. over a period of time. What we've seen this year is that
outside of the U.S. – and notably as we made our way through the newly diagnosed label expansion negotiations in
Europe – we had price decreases across the portfolio that were pretty much in line with where we expected them to be,
but versus a year ago they were a little bit more this year as we made our way through those negotiations.
So globally, when you add all of those things together – and Peter showed some numbers on one his slides for the
overall portfolio – that we had a little bit of a positive impact on the overall portfolio this year, but that includes mix as
well and the ongoing growth in the IMiDs, OTEZLA coming into the portfolio. If you strip that out, the global impact
of price altogether is relatively modest.

you guys have an option on their CD19 program that might trigger sometime in first half. So could you help us
understand what efficacy threshold you need to see in order to exercise that option? And then a quick one for Peter. I
noticed that the gross margins were a bit higher than expected. Could you maybe give us some color there how we
should model it going forward? Thanks.

actually the gross margin going forward – and I'm talking about 2016 – you should see a slight margin improvement in
gross margin again, and it's all mix related. I mean the guys in our operations space do a fantastic job, so they're always
very productive, but also we get some benefit from mix. So I did highlight that as you go forward into 2016 we will get
the basis points I talked about at the bottom line. That'd be driven primarily first by SG&A leverage there, but also by
improved mix continuing to occur up at the gross margin line.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Thanks, Peter. So just on the Juno opt-in, as you know CD19 was the first program to
come up for opt-in under that collaboration. The totality of what we will see and want to see and under the contract are
able to see to allow us to make that opt-in decision includes a whole package of information that Juno will be providing
us, and then we'll have the opportunity to evaluate that for some period of time before we make the opt-in decision.
And as we do that and as the programs move along, I'm sure we'll find the right way to talk a little bit more about all of
the things that we're seeing around that that help us evaluate the program.
<Q - Yatin Suneja>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond from Raymond James.
<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Hey. Thanks. Just a question on OTEZLA, and maybe a follow-up question as well if
you don't mind. But on OTEZLA, I think you guys have acknowledged that a key barrier as you've launched in the U.S.
has been access. We've got some checks that sort of suggest that's kind of enduring. Can you sort of talk about where
you are in the cycle here for improving that dynamic? What's sort of changed? And maybe talk a little bit about the
details about where in the chain that the biggest barriers might exist. Is it sort of at the PBM level or at the actual payer
level? And maybe contrast that to what you might expect in Europe, because you've obviously got sort of a different
sort of payer situation there. And then on the biz dev front, how much of a priority is it for you to use ex-U.S. cash
going forward? It's been an element I think in deals before. But just wondering how much you think about that going
forward. Thanks.
<A - Scott A. Smith>: Thanks, Chris, for the questions. This is Scott. We were very excited about the first-year launch
that we had for OTEZLA. As a matter of fact, it's the highest revenue first full year launch in I&I ever, so really, really
tremendous first-year momentum that we generated in the U.S. That was, as I stated in the prepared remarks, of the
$472 million, the vast majority of that was U.S. We're really launching in Europe this year and Japan the year after.
And so we were able to, I think, very successfully penetrate the market. Access is a barrier in this marketplace. It's a
highly managed category, there's no question. But we've continued to chip away at that access environment, and I think
the important thing to note is that payers have implemented exceptions to the two biologic step rule, those that have it,
because they want to be able to encourage patients to be able to get on alternate therapy if the biologic therapy is not
appropriate.
And so the interesting thing, the sort of the proof, is really in the data. When I take a look at the data, more than 80% of
patients in the psoriasis market that are coming on OTEZLA are not coming from a biologic. So the access things are
there, but there are exceptions to be able to get around that, and we have not found access to be a significant burden on
the ability to drive demand. We would like to evolve that access and maybe be in a preferred position as we go forward,
but the critical thing for navigating the access environment is driving demand, driving volume, and as I said earlier the
most successful first-year revenue launch in the I&I space ever, so were very pleased with where we're at.

<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And, Chris, it's Bob Hugin. Just on the business development issue, I think we've been
incredibly sensitive and strategic for a very long time in terms of managing our intellectual property assets, our tax
positioning so that we have the financial flexibility to execute any business development deal that we think is
appropriate and promising for our long-term outlook, and that's been the history and the track record. And, as a part of
that, our teams have been incredibly successful in terms of using offshore cash extensively on multiple transactions for
a relatively long period of time. And I think that strategy is one that's proven to be effective. We've never seen
ourselves to be in a situation where we've had some kind of financial restriction that didn't allow us to do the kind of
things we want to do. And our plan going forward anticipates that same kind of positioning, and I think Peter's team is
doing a great job in managing that.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Yeah, thanks, Bob. And the other thing I'd highlight is we really are not in a position where
we're constrained in any particular manner in the U.S. In fact, as you saw, and I mentioned in my remarks, during 2015
we spent $3.3 billion on share repurchase. And where the market is today and where it's been recently, it's a great
opportunity going forward. So we would continue to see ourselves being particularly forceful in the share repurchase
area, because we are in great shape on cash, and we see the stock in this sector right now – great value.
<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Birchenough from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Nick Abbott>: Good morning, it's Nick on the line for Jim this morning. I'd just like to go back to REMARC and
a couple of questions there. And what is the hurdle you're looking for on the ClinicalTrials.gov listing? There's a
16-month improvement in PFS, which seems very aggressive for a relatively small trial. So is that a hurdle? And then,
in the statistical analysis plan, does that include analysis of the data by cell of origin? Thank you.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, we don't – there's a lot of details of our statistical analysis plans that we don't give
out. So without going into that detail, what I would say is in the setting that we described earlier about the high unmet
medical need in the diffuse large B-cell, we believe that with the trial design – and when we have that data readout and
then present the details of it, you'll have significantly more information, obviously – but we believe within this
landscape that a positive REMARC trial would imply clinically relevant benefit for patients from REVLIMID as
maintenance therapy post R-CHOP and would put us in a very good position with respect to regulatory submission and
with respect to reimbursement negotiations.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: So, operator, we're a little bit past 10 o'clock now; we apologize and appreciate all the
questions. Why don't we take two more questions if there are still some in the queue, and then we will wrap up?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Jefferies.
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Question on the long-term opportunity for
ABRAXANE in the neoadjuvant breast setting. You mentioned the ETNA study; wondering if you could talk a little bit
about the design there – what we should be looking for when that reads out this year, how that potentially fits into your
regulatory plans for that indication alongside GeparSepto? And maybe just from a bigger-picture standpoint, how we
should be thinking about that overall market opportunity just given what seem like very high patient numbers but
maybe an unclear standard of care with paclitaxel not necessarily used across the board there? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah. I mean, we think it's a nice incremental opportunity. There are other opportunities
for ABRAXANE that would be more significant. Let me just put the ETNA study into context first. So our discussions
with the healthcare authorities so far have been based on the GeparSepto trial and getting feedback from them with
respect to what they would want to see for a regulatory submission in the neoadjuvant setting. So the GeparSepto trial

data would be the data to focus on for that. It could be that the ETNA study, should it be supportive, because they are
different trial designs, would be something that we potentially could consider – again, if supportive – but not necessary.
And we've had enough feedback in, particularly we feel like the path is clear in Europe, and we have said that our plan
is to submit based on the GeparSepto data in Europe by the fourth quarter of this year. We need a little bit more
clarification from FDA about some of the data that they would want to see before we make a decision about timing in
the U.S.
So do we want to go through the trial design for ETNA? I mean, you can pull it up on ClinTrials.gov. It's a slightly
different patient population. It's a HER2-negative high-risk population, again, potentially complementary to the
GeparSepto data but not necessary from a submission standpoint.
<Q - Brian Abrahams>: Got it. Thanks very much, Jackie.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert Baird.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Just a quick question. You put up an
interesting slide at ASH showing the breakdown in first-line myeloma share in the non-transplant setting in the U.S.
where about 30% of the market is the Velcade based without REVLIMID. I guess just your thoughts on given the
efficacy of RVd, what you guys see as the primary roadblock to converting that share over. Is it just an education
component, or is there a cost component? And maybe should we be thinking of the entrance of generic Velcade next
year as a driver there?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: So I guess the point that we were trying to make – and believe me, we do everything we
can from an education standpoint to make sure that the clinical data is properly disseminated and well understood.
When you look at shares, the point is that given the strength of that RVd data and the current share position, there is
room for more adoption of the RVd triplet. And we think that even in the current environment, the PFS data supports
that greater adoption. You've also potentially seen the mSMART guidelines, just as one example, get updated where
RVd has replaced the CyborD for newly diagnosed under those guidelines. So you can already see a positive reception
to that data just based on the strength of the data.
On a go-forward basis, I think that Velcade going generic, given the strength of the efficacy data for that RVd regimen,
is going to put the regimen in a very good position in a number of geographies with respect to adoption, and I think it's
going to be a highly competitive regimen. And when you think about the other triplets coming along, they're all going
to have to have find a way to show their value proposition in that landscape.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Great. Thank you.
Robert J. Hugin
So thank you for all the questions this afternoon. We apologize for running a little bit past 10. We are very excited
about – obviously proud of 2015. The organization did a great job, and very excited to get going in 2016. We're off to a
good start in Q1, and I think there's going to be a lot of interesting pipeline news flows as well as great launch,
continued success with OTEZLA, and expansion of the Hem-Onc franchise around the world. So looking forward to a
very good year in 2016. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the
program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day.
