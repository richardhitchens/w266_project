Dion J. Weisler
Thank you, Diana. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.
I'm pleased to announce another quarter of solid progress in both innovation and execution. As we wrap up our first
fiscal year as HP, Inc., we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, and I'm proud of the progress we are
making in our core growth and future framework.
In quarter four, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, within our outlook range. And we
achieved net revenue growth normally and in constant currency. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net
earnings per share of $1.60 within the original outlook range provided at the start of the year. We exceeded
expectations for free cash flow delivering $2.8 billion and returned over $2 billion to shareholders, at the high-end of
our 50% to 75% target range.
This time last year, we faced industrywide headwinds and difficult market conditions. But as I said to you then, we
believe change equals opportunity and that we would reinvent ourselves and our business to drive long-term success.
We accelerated restructuring activities and adjusted our tactics to deliver on our commitments with operational
discipline. What's notable is, we did this while maintaining key investments in innovation to help us drive long-term
profitable growth.
And what you have seen during the course of the year are perhaps the most competitive and disruptive products ever.
While the road ahead will continue to be challenged, we exited Fiscal 2016 with momentum and confidence in our
ability to execute. Before we provide our view on Q1 of 2017, I want to spend a few minutes on some of this quarter's
highlights and achievements in Personal Systems, Printing and 3D Printing.
Personal Systems delivered the trifecta once again with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth, market share
gains and increased operating profit. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated component shortages and took actions that
positioned us well to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities.
We have a robust innovation engine producing an incredibly strong portfolio across consumer, commercial, notebooks,
desktops, workstations and services. Each delivered top line growth, despite an overall tough and competitive market.
Through discipline and focus, we achieved share gains across all three regions yielding a record high position of 21.4%
market share worldwide. We are outperforming both the market as a whole and the competition. In line with our core
strategy, we focused on highly segmented profitable opportunities, where we chose to play.
We continued momentum in the Consumer premium and gaming segments enabling us to beat Consumer notebooks
market growth by more than 10 points. In Commercial, we achieved another record high share position of 24.8% with
accelerated growth in higher margin offerings including Care Pack's and other commercial services.
We continue to play our own game in Personal Systems and are seeing traction as we deliver differentiated experiences
with amaze. One of the product highlights for the quarter was the delivery of our high-end OMEN X gaming platform
for those who crave a truly immersive experience. We also introduced the world's first notebook with an integrated

privacy screen to combat visual hacking and extend our leadership in security. We also launched the Pavilion Wave
and Elite Slice PCs, these systems combine engineering excellence and truly inventive desktop design.
We are setting the standards for highly innovative and beautiful devices taking profitable market share and forcing our
competitors to raise their bar if they want to compete for the hearts and minds of premium customers.
Shifting to Printing. For the first time in several quarters, print hardware revenue grew year over year with units up 1%
as compared to declines of 20% in quarter one, 16% in quarter two and 10% in quarter three. In addition, we improved
ASPs both year over year and sequentially. Towards the end of quarter four, we saw some pockets of improved
competitive dynamics that we associate with the strength of the yen.
We will continue to be disciplined in our hardware unit pricing with a focus on shifting the sales mix toward units that
deliver higher value over their lifetime. In quarter four, we continued to execute the Supplies sales model change that
we announced in quarter three, which is helping us to achieve more consistent global pricing.
As a result of these actions, we exited the second half with a significant reduction in Supplies channel inventory in line
with our outlook. We are now well-positioned as we enter fiscal 2017 and will continue to increase marketing spend to
drive HP Original supplies brand awareness and end-user demand. We remain confident that shifting to a
replenishment channel fulfillment model is a much more efficient way to run our global go-to-market strategy for
supplies in the new omni-channel reality.
While we continue to work on improvements in the core print business, we also achieved progress in our growth
initiatives. Graphics delivered a record revenue quarter coming off a successful drupa show, with constant currency
growth for the 13th consecutive quarter. In fact, in quarter four, we delivered more than 300 HP Indigo digital presses
following our robust order pipeline. Companies like Shutterfly and Cimpress are now taking full advantage of the
benefits of digital over analog as well as the quality and productivity breakthroughs enabled by our presses to address
peak holiday season demand.
Managed Print Services had another excellent quarter with double-digit new total contract value growth. This is an area
where we significantly outperform the market. And similarly, I'm pleased with the adoption of Instant Ink, a consumer
subscription service, which continued to increase with a record quarter of new enrollees.
Earlier this quarter, at our annual Global Partner Conference, we announced our acquisition of Samsung's printer
business, which will help us accelerate the disruption of the $55 billion A3 copier segment. We expect the transaction
to close in the second half of 2017. In parallel to our announcement, we launched a breakthrough portfolio of A3
multifunction printers and services, which will begin to ship in the second quarter. These announcements are symbolic
of delivering on the growth portion of our strategy and highlight our commitment to disrupt markets where we can
grow profitably.
In support of our more than 250,000 channel partners, we also introduced Partner First Program updates that we expect
will radically simplify and enhance partner engagement. And in line with the market shift to contractual sales, we
introduced Device-as-a-Service partner specialization to drive services-led sales transformation.
As part of our channel strategy and partner-centric approach, we were honored recently by Canalys, who named HP
number one in EMEA channel satisfaction. This is the first time a large company has ever been number one. This is
unprecedented and tells me we're on the right track and investing in our partners to help grow our mutual businesses.
In support of our future strategy in 3D Printing materialize a leader in additive manufacturing and 3D Printing is adding
HP's Jet Fusion 3D Printer to its broad suite of technologies. Several HP co-development partners, including
Materialise, Jabil, and Shapeways, will receive their first installations of the Jet Fusion 3D Printer in the next two
weeks.
Along with product installations, HP materials innovation is gaining momentum with leaders like BASF, who has
announced a commitment to the HP Open Materials program, and Evonik Industries, who will introduce what they
expect to be the first certified material to emerge from our platform in 2017.

While I've highlighted the achievements of the quarter, our core markets are still in flux, and we believe the change will
only accelerate. The macroeconomic and financial market conditions are uncertain. The U.S. dollar has been
strengthening, and this trend creates pressures for U.S.-based multinational companies like HP with over 60% of
revenue outside of the U.S.
We know how to operate in up and down markets, and we are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make
the right decisions for the company for the long term. We have the right strategy entering fiscal 2017 and continue to
show we can deliver financial results and momentum on all parts of our business. We are setting this company up for
long-term success, and I'm convinced our best years are ahead of us.
I will now ask Cathie to provide incremental detail on the financials as well as our outlook for fiscal Q1 of 2017.
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Dion.
Overall, I'm pleased with our strong finish to the fiscal year. We delivered net revenue of $12.5 billion, up 2% year
over year as reported or up 4% in constant currency. We expected revenue declines would moderate in the back half of
the year, and in Q4 we saw revenue growth in EMEA and APJ, both sequentially and year over year.
Gross margin of 18.3% was down 1 point year over year, due primarily to business segment mix, partially offset by
Personal Systems rate improvement. Gross margin was flat sequentially, with print rate improvements offsetting
unfavorable segment mix.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 8% year over year, driven by reductions in SG&A, primarily
due to corporate governance and other overhead costs related to Hewlett-Packard Company included in the prior-year
period combined with non-revenue-generating cost savings. These reductions in SG&A were only partially offset by a
deliberate 13% increase in R&D, supporting incremental investments in A3 and 3D Printing. For the year, we achieved
productivity and restructuring savings which well exceeded $1 billion.
With a net expense of $88 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5%, and a diluted share count of approximately
1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36.
Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes net-of-tax defined benefit plan settlement expense of
$117 million and restructuring and other charges of $36 million, partially offset by net tax indemnification credits of
$38 million and non-operating retirement related credits of $19 million. As we noted on the last two earnings calls, the
tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect
that certain tax matters and their related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be
excluded from non-GAAP results.
In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30, above the previously provided
outlook range due to lower than expected restructuring charges and the net tax indemnification credits.
Turning to the segments, Personal Systems delivered solid performance across all metrics. Net revenue was $8 billion,
up 4% year over year as reported or up 5% in constant currency. Units were up 5% year over year with growth in
notebooks, desktops and workstations. Performance was also balanced across the customer segments with Consumer
and Commercial revenue growth of 7% and 3% year over year respectively.
As Dion said, we outperformed the market and key competitors in the third calendar quarter. I'm pleased not only with
the top line strength, but also with the focus on profitable share gains. Personal Systems operating profit was 4.3%, up
0.6 points year over year due to scale, operational cost savings and a focus on higher margin units. Much like last
quarter, we saw continued revenue momentum in strategic areas, including consumer premium, gaming, commercial
mobility and services.

On a year-over-year basis, Personal System ASPs were down slightly due to an increase in low-end mix and
competitive pricing in Commercial, partially offset by a favorable pricing in Consumer. Sequentially, ASPs were down
due to normal seasonality associated with consumer holiday selling, partially offset by better mix within Commercial
and strong attach.
Now, turning to Printing, while revenue declines continued, we saw progress in all areas of focus. Net revenue was
$4.6 billion, down 8% year over year as reported or down 6% in constant currency. Starting with Hardware, units were
up 1% year over year, a continued improvement in the trajectory as we've seen throughout the year. We achieved
sequential share gains of 0.4 points in laser and one point in ink hardware as the progress we made on our cost structure
is creating incremental positive NPV units.
We continued to improve the quality of our installed base with Commercial units up 10% year over year. ASPs were up
year over year and sequentially driven by both mix and pricing discipline.
In Q4, Supplies revenue was down 12% year over year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. The Supplies
sales model change contributed about 7 points of the year-over-year decline, similar to the impacting Q3. The Four Box
Model drivers caused a 3 to 4-point year-over-year decline in revenue in constant currency.
Supplies revenue mix was 62%, down 3 points year over year. About 2 points of the decline can be attributed to the
Supplies model change that we executed during the quarter. As a result of this Supplies model transition, we exited the
second half, where we expected to be with a significant reduction in both weeks and dollars of the channel inventory.
Operating profit for Printing was 14%, down 2.9 points year over year related primarily due to reduction in Supplies
revenue. Unlike Q3, we did not have material gains from the sale of software assets to offset the reduction of channel
inventory associated with our Supplies model change.
We had an unfavorable mix of Supplies combined with incremental R&D spend to support A3 and 3D Printing, which
remain key long-term growth drivers. These investments were partially offset by strong operational improvements
across the business.
And in restructuring, we achieved our accelerated plan as announced at the start of the fiscal year and with lower
charges than expected.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, cash flow from operations was $698 million, and free cash flow was $558
million. The cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, flat sequentially and down 10 days year over year.
On a sequential basis, days of inventory were up two days, offset by a two-day improvement in accounts payable as a
result of the strategic use of our balance sheet, including increased sea shipments and component purchases for the
assurance of supply given the tight supply environment that we talked about last quarter.
During the quarter, we had total capital return of $214 million, primarily through cash dividends. For the full year, we
returned 72% of free cash flow to shareholders at the high-end of our original 50% to 75% target range.
Looking ahead, we've assumed the following in our financial outlook. In Personal Systems, we anticipate component
shortages to continue and have an impact on profitability in the short-term. Supplies revenue growth in constant
currency is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017, but the trajectory will not be linear given the unit placement
trajectory in fiscal 2016.
In Q1, we expect the four boxes in our model to drive a mid-single digit decline pressuring total company revenue
growth and profits. For the full year, we've assumed we will deliver on our additional productivity initiatives and
restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the
year.
And more broadly, we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact market sizing and competitive
dynamics, especially related to unfavorable currency moves. A significant deterioration could have a material impact
on revenue and profit, especially in Supplies given its tight correlation to gross domestic product growth. Note also that

our outlook assumes currency rates as of the end of October.
With all that in mind, our Q1 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.35 to $0.38. Q1 2017
GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, is in the range of $0.33 to $0.36. Our full year fiscal
2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, and our full year fiscal 2017
GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations remains in the range of $1.47 to $1.57.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim Suva at Citi.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much. You did very well in the PC segment, and previously you made some
comments about you were using your balance sheet to procure components. And it turns out that that ended up being a
very wise decision. Can you help us understand two things? First of all is, are you continuing to do so? And if so, how
long do you think you'll continue to do so or have the need to? And second of all, with the shortages of supply, and you
were able to get the components, how come your operating margins for PCs were not stronger quarter over quarter, as
the revenues grew considerably quarter over quarter, but operating margins didn't? Did you like reinvest some of the
money or how should we think about why more of the PC didn't flow through? Thank you.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks, Jim. Let me say, broadly speaking, that the basket of components
that make up a PC, there's some components in there that are in ready supply. There's other components in there that
are in tighter supply, as we alluded to on the last call, and indeed we did say we would leverage the balance sheet to go
off and ensure that we procured. That is one of the changes that I've often talked about and a common theme that we
have in the business, to take that change and turn it into opportunity.
I think the team executed really well in the course of quarter four against that backdrop. I think the team did traffic the
square last quarter. They grew revenue margin and share, and they did it again this quarter. And I was pleased with
their performance, specifically on the margin rates. I will let Cathie chime in.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. Thanks, Jim. In terms of the margin rates, it was competitive pricing on a sequential
basis, but also normal seasonality, because we're really talking about the kind of the sell-in for the holiday period of
time, and that tends to have a higher consumer mix. We did see ASPs basically up in Commercial on a sequential basis,
but again normal seasonality drove ASPs down for Consumer, and overall down.
Operator
Next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Just a clarification from me. On the Supplies side, Cathie, you said it's not going
to be linear, which you said before I think. But when I look at this quarter, if you back out the 7-point hit on growth in
Supplies and the inventory drawdown, and then there's probably some currency impact in there as well, the Supplies
business is probably down quite low-single digits. You're quite close to getting back to stability. Is there a reason why
that's in the first half of the year that could get worse before it gets better? If you can explain some of those dynamics,
maybe it's comps, maybe it's how you are placing units right now, anything along those lines, how to think about the
next few quarters before you hit the more stable point by the end of 2017 would be helpful? Thanks.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure, Kulbinder. In terms of what we are now coining the Four Box drivers, the Four Box
drivers actually had a decline in constant currency for the quarter in minus 3% to minus 4%. So when you make all of
the adjustments that you need to make to get to that, and that's pretty consistent with the last three quarters, okay? So I

think that's the way to think about it.
I think it's also important if I could add a point here, and that's just that we use the model to determine what we think is
going to happen in the quarter, as well as what we think is going to happen over time. And we were operating pretty
much in line with what we had expected. So the quarter came in, in line.
For next quarter, we are calling for a mid-single digit decline, and that's really due to how we were placing units. If you
go back to last year, in Q1 we were down 20% in terms of unit placements. In Q2, we were down 16%. Q2 to Q3 and
Q3 to Q4, we started to grow sequentially. And in fact, from Q3 to Q4 we grew sequentially units about 10% this
quarter. And so we're starting to get an improvement, frankly, in the absolute level of the installed base. And so that's
one of the boxes in the Four Box Model, and that's putting some pressure early on in FY 2017. And so it's really more
the back half.
But the way I think about how you all can get comfortable believing and having confidence that we're going to stabilize
the Supplies revenue by the end of 2017 in constant currency is really because we're reporting out what the model said
we would do at the beginning of the quarter, and we're reporting out how well we did relative to that. So far, the model
has been pretty predictive, and certainly over a longer history it has been very predictive. And so we feel good about
the progress that we're making.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kathryn Lynn Huberty>: Thank you. How does the return to growth in printer units impact the Four Box Model
and your confidence exiting the year with flat supplies?
And then just to follow up, you had talked at the Analyst Day about potentially reducing printer hardware channel
inventory during fiscal 2017. Is that something you still expect to happen, and is the impact baked into guidance?
Thank you.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Okay, so in terms of the units, Katy, what we talked about almost this time last year was the
fact that we expected the overall environment to continue to be challenging. As a result of that, we would need to
consider this the new normal when we went to work on taking costs out of the business, so that we could turn negative
NPV units into positive NPV units and expand the TAM. And through the course of the year, that bridge that Cathie
just walked you through, negative 20% in quarter one, negative 16% in quarter two, negative 10% in quarter three, plus
1% in quarter four was a plan that we began executing after the Q1 earnings call. And so we have built that into our
model, and our model is therefore predicting that we will indeed return to stabilization by the end of 2017 in constant
currency.
So it's running according to plan, but it's not just the units as we have often talked about, Katy, it's the quality of the
units. Our Managed Print Services had another very strong quarter from a TCB perspective, as did our Graphics
business, 13th consecutive growth quarter in constant currency for the Graphics business. Instant Ink, which is an
important initiative for the home-based business, had strong enrollees yet again. And so many of the dimensions that
we've talked about, not just the unit placement, but the quality of the units is operating according to our outlook.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And, Katy, to the second part of your question about whether or not we have made a
change to the sales model for hardware as we have done for the supplies within print, the answer is that our outlook
today as is the same at SAM does not include a change in that go-to-market model. We are still analyzing whether or
not we want to do that and what it would take to do that.

The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein.
<Q - Antonio M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I'm wondering if you could comment on the planned marketing
investments and demand stimulization investments that you were planning for Q4 and whether you made them at the
level that you thought and whether you got the acceleration in units that you thought. The reason I ask is it looks like
printer hardware improved with normal seasonality in Q4, and certainly the way you talked about last quarter was that
your demand stimulation efforts would yield something significantly higher than that. So I'm wondering if you can
comment. Did you invest what you expected to invest, and did you get the kind of demand stimulation that you
thought?
And then I'm still struggling with how you can be looking at Supplies growth being so weak in Q1, given that your
comparison is so easy and your Supplies is a function of your last three to six years worth of sales, and so you shipped
$100 million less in each of Q1 and Q2 in hardware. I don't know how that can mathematically translate into a
deceleration against an extra comp on Supplies growth going forward. Is there anything else there in terms of your
planning to take down further inventory or anything else happening in the channel that might explain that because the
math doesn't seem to work?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So let me start with the first question around marketing. So yes, we did execute on our
marketing plans in Q4. And just to be clear, our marketing plans related to the Supplies change that we were making is
really not about stimulating demand at the hardware level. It's really about stimulating demand for HP branded
supplies. So it's about building awareness and brand preference and print relevance, so helping people understand why
they should want to print, and we did execute on that. The unit acceleration was actually ahead of what is normal
seasonality for us. So sequentially we grew units 10%. and our normal sequential is 7% to 8%. So we're feeling good
about the progress that we made, and we did get acceleration on the hardware side.
In terms of your second question around Supplies growth, why is it that weak in Q1? At this point in time, Toni, when
we put through all of the different variables and all of the assumptions that we've got within our model, we are calling
for a mid-single-digit decline in Supplies in constant currency on a year-over-year basis in Q1. And even with that, the
model is still basically supporting the forecast that Supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of
2017.

The next question is from Rod Hall at JPMorgan.
<Q - Rod B. Hall>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the Printing business and the
margins. The margins dropped off more than we thought that they would in the quarter, and we see this unit number
stabilization or a little better than we thought it would be. So I'm just curious how you would expect that margin to
track through the beginning of the year, especially given the yen strength. Because it seems like if you guys want to
achieve your goals in Supplies, you need to keep placing these units. If the yen weakness. If the yen continues to
weaken, then you may find that more difficult to do. So I just wanted to check that in light of the currency movements?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. There are actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them.
The first one in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was in fact very much in line with what we had expected and
what we talked about on the Q3 Earnings Call. And the reason it is significantly off of Q3, which was 20.4%, is really
the result of the last stage, the last quarter of the Supplies sales model transition that we were going through without
having the compensating software divestiture gains. Those all showed up in Q3, at the same time that roughly half of
the plan for Supplies transition was going through.
So, if you actually normalize over the year, the OP rate for print was in line with what we've seen in the past, mid-teens
at 17%. So, I don't think there's any big surprises there. And that 14% obviously consistent with what we said on the Q3
Earnings Call. So, we had in our own forecast the fact that we were going to place these incremental units already.

In terms of your question kind of the Japanese competitors and the foreign exchange environment, I have to tell you it's
a little bit hard to answer that one with clarity, and let me explain why. First, I think it's a very uncertain kind of
macroeconomic environment, and it's hard to know what's going to happen on a go-forward basis, like from the U.S.
administration, what kind of policies are going to be put in place and what the impact that's going to have on
currencies.
And then, it's even more complicated, because in many ways we didn't see broad-based kind of relaxation on
aggressive pricing from the Japanese competitors when the yen was stronger. So now that it's weakened a bit in the last
few weeks, it's unclear whether or not they're going to be more aggressive or this is just an opportunity for them to hold
the pricing that they've had all along.
It's just not clear. What is clear to us is that in our outlook for FY 2017, we have assumed no change in the pricing
environment. So we haven't assumed that even though the yen is a bit stronger kind of relative to 2016, we have not
assumed that the Japanese ease up on pricing nor have we assumed that they get more aggressive.

The next question is from Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi. Thanks. I was hoping to get a little more detail on the strength in the PC business, the
linearity in the quarter. And also how sustainable is that strength into next quarter as well as further out? Thanks.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Thanks, Sherri. So I would say that the PC market is operating as we expected it to. I still think
there's uncertainty in the market. The market as a whole hasn't returned to growth. At the beginning of the year, we
anticipated that we expected the declines would moderate through the course of 2016, and they did. And we were able
to adjust to that market I think much more quickly than many of our competitors. As a benefit of being a separated
company, the speed, flexibility, focus of the organization was able to react to these market conditions, and as a result of
that we've performed significantly better than the market, and taking a solid premium to the market.
I think longer term, the business will continue to evolve and develop, there's a very large continuum of devices,
everything from a smartphone all the way up to a workstation. Some of that market we participate in, not all of that
market, but the lines are blurring between the different categories within that spectrum. And indeed categories are
being created, and the Elite X3 is a great example of a device that bridges from sort of a phablet all the way through to
a PC and a laptop.
So I would characterize that the market is changing. We're ahead of that curve. We're scaling towards where we believe
the puck is going and investing in the heat of the market that we find particularly attractive. I think the team did a great
job in our gaming platform, in the premium segment, in commercial mobility whether it'd be Elite X2 or Elite X3, and
where unlocking part of the market that we are still attracted by.
Let's remember it's a $320 billion TAM, and about half of that are things like services, displays, accessories that we
have lower market share and we're looking to expand our business, and the team is expanding our business there.
So we still think there is great opportunity within the Personal Systems environment. It's a changing market landscape.
It has improved from the beginning of last year, and we don't broadly disagree with the outlook from the analysts, but I
think what you can expect us to do is continue to deliver ahead of the market.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And let me just – you also asked a question about linearity in the quarter. The linearity in
the quarter was normal, so there was nothing particular to call out, it was normal, historical linearity.

<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Dion, can you talk a bit about what you're thinking with regard to
A3. You've announced the Samsung acquisition a couple of months, had some time to digest it, so I'm curious as to
what you're hearing from your channel partners, if there's been any change to how you're thinking about the approach,
relationships with Canon, what you're planning on with Samsung's printers. If you could give us a bit more color?
Thank you.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Sure. I would say, Shannon, the acquisition and the integration is running according to our
timeline. We expect it to close within the 9 to 12 months from the original announcement date. The team is on the
ground working very closely with the Samsung counterparts to get this done.
We continue to be incredibly impressed with the quality and caliber of the people as well as the technology. Of course,
Samsung represents more than 10% of South Korea's total GDP and attract the very best talent in the entire country,
and having that group of very high caliber engineering and other folks join our company is very impressive.
The 6,500 patents are very high-quality patents as we continue to work through that, and that gives us all the
opportunity to disrupt this $55 billion market.
So that's on the Samsung side. We've been running a separate track really through the course of the entire 2016 as we
were looking to really aggressively enter the A3 market on the go-to-market side of things, and I have traveled all
around the world, met with the largest A3 channel partners, many of which are not channel partners for HP today, some
of which are. The Venn diagram is not mutually exclusive here. And I think we've made tremendous progress.
We've shared with them the value proposition of working with HP and our disruption in this space, and we have an
incredible amount of interest right across the globe from these go-to-market partners as we begin to unlock and even
begin quoting on opportunities that we expect to deliver on as we launch the products in the April timeframe.

The next question comes from Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you. Cathie, I think you've began to touch on this, but I would love to hear
more of your takeaways on the potential implications of the U.S. election in particular, as it pertains to the potential
changes to the tax code as well as tariffs?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Simona, it's really too early to have a strong opinion on all of the different proposals that
are out there, because there are so many. And so it's unclear at this point in time exactly what the situation is going to
be and how it might impact HP and what actions HP might take as a result of those policy changes.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I would add that we obviously support comprehensive tax reform that makes us more globally
competitive. We support multinationals having fair access to overseas markets and the flexibility to operate global
supply chains. But I think Cathie is quite right, it's very early days. We operate in 170 countries around the world, and
our mission here is to deliver experiences that amaze, and we want to be able to do that in an appropriate tax
environment and in an appropriate global environment.

<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. Just to clarify, can you clarify whether your guidance includes any real estate sale
gains from your San Diego campus?
And then for the question, can you just talk about PC channel inventory out there and whether you think there's a risk
of greater than seasonal decline into the calendar first quarter given the relative strength we've been seeing? Thanks.

<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sorry, I didn't catch that last one. You were talking about PC channel inventory levels?
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Right, PC channel inventory and whether you thought there was greater risk going into Q1
given the relative strength we've been seeing recently?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: So I think PC channel inventory from our perspective, from a HP perspective is well under
control and well within our ranges. Of course, you all know my view on the profile of the inventory is not just the
absolute amount of inventory, but the aged element of the inventory is also very well under control. This is a situation
that I think is incredibly important to maintain the momentum inside this business we're well under control. Given
we're operating now in a different environment than we have been for many years where we've had an oversupply,
we're in an environment now where there is more of an under-supply. And so as a result of that, I think overall channel
inventory levels across the broad landscape are lower than they have been, let's say this time last year.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And in terms of your question about the San Diego sale, we don't typically go into that
level of detail. If at any time a transaction is material enough, then we will call it out.

The next question is from Steve Milunovich at UBS.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. I just wondered relative to the Analyst Day if there are any material
changes in either the EPS or free cash flow bridges that you provided. And in particular, I wanted to ask about the
productivity improvements, which I think were tagged at $0.43 to $0.47 for fiscal 2017. Could you be a bit specific
about where those are coming from and your confidence level on achieving those?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. In terms of the EPS bridge and the cash flow bridge, the answer is no. There's no
material change to them. If you want more follow-up on that, I'll let you give me a follow-up in a minute.
On the productivity side of the house, there is not a single silver bullet for us or a lever to pull, it's really going to be
across a number of dimensions, and it's all the things that we've been talking about in 2016 that frankly have
opportunity in 2017 as well, simplification of our portfolio, really focusing on the bond costs, and making sure that
every interconnector is exactly what we need that interconnector. And every piece of metal is we need metal, we can't
use plastic, really reengineering constantly the new products at the same time we're simplifying our portfolio.
We're also doing process reengineering, and we're doing process reengineering in finance, we're doing it in sales ops,
we're doing it in legal, we're doing it everywhere in the company, and technology enables us to take new processes and
automate pieces of those processes. And so we're looking at that basically across the company. And my view is that's
probably never done. There's always new technology coming out that helps you improve a process from an efficiency
perspective.
And then also just broadly staying completely focused on reducing non-revenue generating costs everywhere we need
to do that. I think there are opportunities in warranty we've seen. There are opportunities in making sure that the
discounts that we're giving are giving us the appropriate return. It's just all of these items, and they're probably the same
list of items that I would have given you a year ago. There's just more to do, and there are always more costs that we
need to stay focused on taking out.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: That's great. Maybe I would ask what PSG and printer operating margins are implied by
your full-year EPS guidance?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So, we don't break them out specifically, but the way we think about the Personal
Systems business is that it's roughly a 3% to 4% operating margin business. Now there are quarters in which it's higher
than that and there are quarters when it's a little bit lower than that. But that's kind of how we think about the rate of the
business.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: We also think about absolute dollars, more importantly.

<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I was going to add that. In the big scheme of things, what we're really focused on is
operating profit dollars. So if there are some low-end SKUs where we can scrape out some gross margin dollars but it
will dilute the rate, we still do it. We're focused on profitable growth, and profitable growth is designed to be basically
dropping dollars to the bottom line. And so we think about it as 3% – 4%.
On the print side of the house, we've seen in 2016 mid-teens. If you go back a few years, it's generally been in the
mid-teens space, and we would expect that that would be true in 2017 as well.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: And from an entire business perspective, we've always said for the long-term expect us to be in
the 8% to 10% range.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And I will also, just if I can put a plug in here for the print business, if there's an
opportunity, because of the cost structure actions that we've taken that we actually create a significantly bigger pool of
NPV positive units that we can go after, the team knows that we will drop below the mid-teens. What's important to
setting up, making the right investments every day in that business and setting this business up to maximize the area
under the curve. Right now, our range is kind of mid-teens.

The next question is from Amit Daryanani at RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Irvin Liu>: Hi. This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. As it relates to your supply channel inventory actions, I
know it's still early, but can you talk about if you have seen these actions contribute to progress toward a more
stabilized Supplies pricing environment? And if so, how does that compare with your internal expectations?
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I would say broadly speaking, the shift from push to pull is operating according to our
expectations. I think we have much less product on promotion than we had in the past, and that's seeing more stabilized
pricing environment in an omni-channel world that is incredibly sensitive to large fluctuations in user pricing. So that
was the desired effect. I think we're seeing significantly lower grade marketing from region to region. That was also
one of the key design points. So, still very early days, but the signals are the right signals and the model is operating
according to how we expected it to operate.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I would say that it's – add to that, we feel like we've really successfully executed over the
last couple of quarters, and that we are now making changes to operational metrics and how we drive that business,
because of the new environment. We specifically have reduced our channel inventory target ranges and narrowed them,
and we exited Q4. If we had applied those same ranges in Q4 of 2016, we would be within those ranges. So we feel
really good about that – the progress there.
And then the other thing is that, we are really hearing from our channel partners that they believe this was the right
thing to do, that given the omni-channel realities that they have to deal with and we have to deal with, these actions
were the right things to do.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Yes, completely unquestioned support from the channel partners.

The last question is from James Kisner at Jefferies.
<Q - James Kisner>: Thank you for taking my questions. I'm going to drill down on the desktop unit strength. I don't
think we talked about this in the call, but this is the first unit growth quarter we've seen in eight quarters. Just
wondering what the dynamics are there, were there specific promotions happening there? Are you seeing a turn in
desktop marketing? Any particular models driving that? Just any color on that would be helpful? Thanks.

<A - Dion J. Weisler>: Look, we're really pleased. I mean of course, notebooks had another really strong quarter of
growth; units up 9%. But it was great to see desktop revenue grow 2%; units up 1% year over year. No magic here.
Really hard work. The team went to work at the beginning of – actually middle – midway through 2015; began
redesigning the entire supply chain to take costs out of that; redesigning the entire lineup. I think we've got some
incredibly innovative products here that are really resonating with customers. They're now in the right price function
value equation. And when you get that right, when you do the segmentation and you get the cost right and there is
value, then you end up with a better result. And that's what we're seeing with the performance of the desktop business.
<Q - James Kisner>: Do you think the market is also doing better? Is it really just you outperforming, are we seeing
an inflection in the market also? Thanks.
<A - Dion J. Weisler>: I'd say broadly speaking, the – it depends what your relative point is. If you look at this time
last year, the market is doing a lot better than it was a year ago. And it was, I think, if I recall correctly, it was
double-digit negative, it was like negative 12%. And we're in sort of mid-single digits now. We're executing better than
the market at a significant premium and we're getting upside as a result of that.
Dion J. Weisler
So thank you for those questions. I know it is late on the eve, before many of you are going to take off here for
Thanksgiving. I do want to close off with saying I was really proud of what the team did in quarter four and how we
rounded out the year. I think we enter FY 2017 on an upward momentum trajectory, and that's a very different position
to what we were in this time last year, as you will recall. I think there's a lot of change going on within the industry,
within the macroeconomic environment. But we're adapting to that change and we're turning it to our opportunity.
We know how to operate in both up and down markets. We believe that this was going to be the new normal, and we
set ourselves up from a cost position to be leaner athletes as we enter this environment. And I think through the course
of last year, we were able to demonstrate quarter after quarter that we would do what we said we would do, and I feel
proud about that.
I think we're entering 2017 with the right strategy, executing on core growth and future and leading in the market where
we choose to play, not chasing share for share's sake, but profitable growth is very important to us, and stabilizing
supplies by the end of 2017 in constant currency is also incredibly important to us and overall of our investors as well.
I have great confidence in HP, and I'm really convinced that the best years lie ahead of us. Thank you for taking the
time. Happy Thanksgiving.
