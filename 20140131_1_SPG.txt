David E. Simon
Okay. Thanks, Liz. Good morning. We had strong results to wrap up 2013, which also was our 20th year as a public
company. First, let me talk about the quarter, strong performance given the growth in our core business, we continue to
see a positive impact on our growth strategy, which basically is comprised of investing in our existing assets, to expand
them, to meet the retailer demand, enhance productivity, continue to develop new outlets and make smart, thoughtful
accretive acquisitions.
FFO was $2.47 per share, up 7.9% for the fourth quarter compared to 2012. Our FFO exceeded the first call consensus
again by $0.05 per share. For our Mall and Premium Outlets, comparable property NOI growth was 5.5% for the
quarter, driven by base minimum rent increase, occupancy up 80 basis points to 96.1%, and the continuation of positive
sales from 2012. Our releasing spread continues to grow, was a positive 16.8% or $8.94 per square foot, with much of
the improvement driven by better leasing execution in the Malls, while Premium Outlet spread continues to be robust.
Mills' comparable NOI was up 11% for the quarter, 10.8% for the year, driven by all the other factors I just went
through. For the year, our FFO in total was $3.2 billion, an increase of $321 million from 2012. This resulted in a per
share FFO growth of 10.9% to $8.85 per share. This was $0.46 above where the consensus started in early 2013 at
$8.39. Our performance was driven by thoughtful capital allocation and I'm proud of the execution of the team. We
opened five new Premium Outlets this year, three in North America and two in Asia. We invested in total $942 million
in new and redevelopment projects in response to retailer demand and customer needs. These projects are all off to very
good starts. And we'll increase the productivity of our assets.
We completed $1.05 billion of acquisitions, including the expansion of our European presence with the investment in
McArthurGlen's Designer Outlet assets and the management development company. We also, in January, acquired our
joint venture partner's remaining interest in Kravco Simon which owns 10 assets. We now own 100% of King of
Prussia Mall, which is an iconic asset with a major expansion in the works.
We also disposed 14 non-core retail assets as well as announced our spin-off transaction which we'll talk about it in a
moment. We see strength across our portfolio in platforms. Occupancy continues to rise, which is a sign of retailer
demand. The majority of our existing leases are under market. Ongoing NOI growth is supported by our ability to
replace underperforming retailers.
And as a final note on the operations, our operating profit margin grew by 60 basis points to 71.7% in 2013. In the
quarter, the fourth quarter that is, we broke ground on Premium Outlets in Montreal in early October and construction
is underway. It's cold up there but we're still working. Construction also continues on new developments in Vancouver,
Minneapolis and Charlotte, less cold, and our pipeline includes six additional new outlets expected to start construction
in 2014, 2015.
Redevelopment expansions are ongoing at 25 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico. We opened two in the fourth
quarter The Shops at Nanuet, Walt Whitman in Long Island, please go visit. Well-executed, thank you to the team.

Also open expansion on a number of other properties in the fourth quarter including Orlando Premium Outlets at
Vineland, and Johor Premium Outlets in Malaysia. Construction is ongoing to expand and enhance some of our most
productive properties, which please do not lose sight of: Roosevelt Field, Woodbury Common, Houston Galleria,
Lenox Square, Del Amo and Desert Hills, just to name a few.
Overall, our multi-year pipeline of new development or redevelopment expansion projects will continue to drive
growth, NOI and in the future, and our pipeline continues to – we expect to invest approximately $1 billion annually
through 2016.
To give you a quick international update, Klépierre will report next week. But I'm proud of the fact that the company,
with our help has implemented a very thoughtful strategy. We strengthened the balance sheet, we've improved
operations and focused on cash flow growth. We have now signed and we were instrumental in the deal with Carrefour
to sell smaller assets in order to focus on larger and more productive centers.
We're exiting the office business. That will be completed shortly, including selling the headquarter building. We
strengthened management with the hiring of [indiscernible] (7:58) as COO. And we're focused on capital allocation
among their different markets and continue to work on leasing and marketing opportunities. Together, the European
retail recovery is stable and continuing.
And then just to finally mention that we did close McArthurGlen. I was actually there at both places this week, a day
with McArthurGlen, two days with Klépierre. The opportunities with McArthurGlen are there. We've got development
and expansion projects to consider and continue to be impressed with where Klépierre is headed.
Now just to talk briefly about SpinCo, as you know, we won't go into much detail today about it. But we plan to spin
off our strip center business and 44 smaller enclosed malls. We believe this will create additional value for Simon
Property Group shareholders and be a good investment vehicle for SpinCo. We have yet to name the names. SpinCo is
not the name, okay? SpinCo is not the name. And we're open to any ideas out there for any names. Please send them to
us.
We expect the transaction to be effective in the second quarter of 2014. We'll provide further updates as available, but
everything is moving absolutely according to plan there. Fourth quarter capital market activity, we were busy. We
closed or locked rates on 10 new secured loans totaling approximately $2.2 billion. Our share of that is roughly $1
billion including in the fourth quarter activity is the $1.2 billion refinance at Aventura Mall at a rate of 3.75%.
In January, as you know, we announced and closed the debt offering of $1.2 billion of senior notes with a combined
weighted average duration of 7.5 years, and the average coupon rate of just under 3%. Demand was very robust for
these bonds. We're using the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to repay debt, including the un-encumbering
of $820 million mortgage on Sawgrass Mills.
The dividend, we increased the dividend again in the first quarter, $1 to $1.25. That's a year-over-year increase of
8.7%. SPG, which not including SpinCo, will now pay, as you know, at least $5 in 2014.
Now, let me just take a moment to talk about something and then I'll turn to 2014. I'd like to make an announcement
regarding our management team. Steve Sterrett, our long-term CFO will be retiring in March of 2015. So he'll be
staying on board through another full fiscal year [ph] on audit (11:10) process. It's hard to overstate the contributions
that Steve has made to our company. And I know I speak for everyone when I say we will be sorry to see him go.
As many of you know, Steve has been with the company for 20 years during the period of extraordinary growth.
Throughout it all, Steve's contributions have been immeasurable. We will conduct a search during the next few months
for Steve's replacement, expect to consider both internal and external candidates. And having Steve available for the
rest of 2014 in the audit cycle will be helpful and ensure a smooth transition. And he will still not be able to beat me on
a consistent basis in golf.
Now, let me just talk about 2014. I'm sure he will have a response to that by the way. But let's talk about 2014.
Guidance is in a range of $9.50 to $9.60. This represents at the midpoint growth rate of 8%. This is based on
comparable NOI growth of at least 4% for combined Mall and Outlet portfolio. This FFO guidance is on a comparable

basis for 2013 and ignores any potential impact of SpinCo. When SpinCo is effective, we'll provide updated and adjust
the range for SPG, as well as provide a range for SpinCo.
And now, let me conclude, we had a great year, great fourth quarter. We continue to prioritize the creation of the value
for our properties, our retailers and our shareholders. We believe we have very great prospects for 2014.
And we're now ready for any questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Please
proceed.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I'm here with [ph] Jeremy (13:35).
<A - David E. Simon>: Can you speak up?
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Yeah. Sure. I'll try to yell, if that's any better.
<A - David E. Simon>: Much better.
<A - Elizabeth A. Zale>: Better.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Good. Can you break out the terms for the Kravco purchase as well as for Oyster Bay and
Arizona Mills, how you broke out the consideration for those?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, the Kravco purchase was a – basically, we had a put and a call at a combined cap rate
of...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: A little bit over 8%.
<A - David E. Simon>: ...a little over 8%.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: And it was $113 million.
<A - David E. Simon>: $113 million, and what was your next question?
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: On Oyster Bay and Arizona Mills, how did the consideration break out between those
assets?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, that was a private negotiation and we will not be going through that.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Okay. And then lastly, when can we expect an update on SpinCo management? Can you
talk a little bit about that?
<A - David E. Simon>: We got initial comments from the SEC, so we're in that process. We have identified both an
internal and external candidate that we're having serious discussions with and we would hope to conclude that over the
next few weeks. And as soon as we do, I'm sure it will be part of our filing. The board is pretty much set and it's going
according to plan.
<Q - Ross T. Nussbaum>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Hi. Good morning. The portfolio continues to perform very well, but there's clearly a lot of
questions swirling around, shopper traffic, shopper habits, et cetera. Could you maybe comment on what you're seeing?
Are we seeing a sea change in retail as characterized by Starbucks last week and what do you think this impact could
have on your business over the next few years?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, look, we've been doing this for quite some time. And I think we have to put the fourth
quarter sales into perspective. First of all, and these are just some thoughts off the top of my head. We are absolutely
believers that our business will continue to grow. But let me just talk about the fourth quarter because I do think we're
at the point of a little bit of overreaction.
Clearly, in 2013, there was a move toward durable goods, which happens in certain cycles. And as the second half of
the year came about, I do think the consumer was relatively cautious. We had a short season. There was obviously lots
of weather issues for certain parts of the country and I don't think what's put in perspective, which I listen to the pundits
on TV and elsewhere, not just on TV, but elsewhere. But between the confusion of Obamacare, and taxes did raise
pretty materially for the consumer. You had what I'll call a, I don't know if it was a perfect storm, but you had a lot of
this stuff all come together that basically resulted in the consumer being very cautious.
The pundits, I've heard this stuff about malls and the Internet, obviously, having the right retailers, the right customer
service, the right look and feel of the properties, we'll continue to hold our own in that space without question.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay. So you're not seeing anything at the ground level that indicates shopper traffic has dropped
off by 50% over the last three years or anything like that?
<A - David E. Simon>: 50%?
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Well, that's what ShopperTrak says.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, let me talk about – I'm not going to name names. But we don't use them and we don't
how reliable a lot of those traffic numbers are. And we'll leave it at that. The answer is...
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: All I can tell you, Nate, is look at our results. That's all I can tell you, is look at our results. I
think you know at this point, doing this for 20 years and continuing to beat everybody's expectations about the
profitability of what this company can produce. I would suggest to you that things are not what others say they are. And
I'll leave it at that.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Okay. I mean, over the last few years, you have discussed various initiatives of helping and
embracing online and developing something at the Simon level. Any update on that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, it would take 30 minutes on this call, but we're happy to go through that in great detail.
We have a significant amount of initiatives that we're embarking upon to improve the consumer experience, whether
pre-mall or during mall visit. And we are absolutely embracing technology and how it can be used effectively to make
the consumer more satisfied during their visit or as they come to the mall. The retailers feel the absolute same way and
there's probably 20-plus things that are ongoing in this company individually, collectively with the mall industry, as
well as in conjunction with retailers that we're working on. But there's so many that I can't do it at this call, but we're
happy to share those as they get rolled out.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Josh Patinkin of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Hi, good morning. I'm trying to get a better sense of what the opportunity to consolidate
McArthurGlen managed fund looks like. So it's obviously not programmatic, but can you give us a general sense for
the total size of the enterprise and what could come up in the next few years?
<A - David E. Simon>: They're a leader in that industry. I think we'll have opportunities to grow that business through
new development and extensions of existing assets, as well as acquisitions of assets that either they manage and own a
small piece of and/or others that do. But it's really – I'm not in a position to give you a specific number.
But as you know, we've taken our platforms over the years and grown them significantly. Reminds me of the Outlet
business when we entered into it in 2004. If I could put the numbers correctly, we have increased the cash flow of that
business roughly 4x, and needless to say, you take the 4x plus the reduction in cap rate, and you see the value created
there, I think it's harder to develop in Asia, but a great team, good people, and we'll just take it a step at a time.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Okay. And then more globally on Outlets, you've built a lot of centers last decade and so
is there a big sea change in the leasing conversation as you approach 10-year rollovers? And you think higher
occupancy costs will become more acceptable to merchants in that business?
<A - David E. Simon>: I'll turn it to Rick because [indiscernible] (22:33).
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Absolutely, we are seeing an ability to increase our rents. We have significant demand in
the outlet sector if you listen to the retailers. There are many retailers that are entering the sector for the first time as an
additional prong of their growth strategy. And where you have a lot of demand, you're able to drive rates. Our
properties are very productive, we're making them better and that does give us pricing power.
<Q - Joshua M. Patinkin>: Very good. Thank you very much.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Hi, good morning, everyone.
<A - David E. Simon>: How are you?
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: I wanted to go back to Nate's question and maybe asking a little bit...
<A - David E. Simon>: First of all, is Bilerman treating you appropriately?
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: Bilerman is on the phone.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's why I'm asking the question.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Okay. So I wanted to go back to Nate's question, ask it a little bit in a different way more
from a leasing perspective.
As we sort of hear more from retailers about the integration of their bricks and mortar business with their e-commerce
business, so I'm thinking about the longer term omni-channel initiatives. I'm wondering if you could give us some
perspective on how the changes are impacting sort of the leasing process and how you would expect it to evolve over
time? So first in terms of how the retailers are thinking about occupancy costs, you adjusted a little bit in terms of the
Outlet...
<A - David E. Simon>: Well...

<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: [indiscernible] (24:05). Just thinking about the sales within the four walls of the store
versus sort of the value of that location to the overall...?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think the good news for small owners is I expect them to drive traffic and distribute through
their store. So what it means, I believe, over time is that store location will become more valuable because instead of
building a bunch of distribution centers or trying to figure out how to get various online purchases to the consumer, the
most effective and perhaps cost-effective way for them to do it is by using their existing store.
Now, that means that they're going to have to have a better handle on store and create algorithms in terms of what can
be distributed out of store or not. But I think what it's going to ultimately mean is that they're going to drive sales
through those stores which as far as we're concerned and what's in our leases and will continue to be is those sales will
be generated from that store. So I don't – now, if they have a store that's losing money, they're not going to keep it
open, but that's been that way for 30 years, 40 years. But that's what I anticipate.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The only other thing I would add and I think it's a very significant advantage to our
retailers, and then David in my discussions with them, they're very focused on it, is the ability to fulfill their orders
online out of their stores and reorient it to whatever store has the appropriate inventory. That's going to have, in their
opinion, significant margin enhancement possibilities because they won't be able to have less markdowns by selling at
full price goods that might otherwise have to be discounted in various locations. And they're all spending a great deal of
time getting that backbone in place to effectuate that.
<A - David E. Simon>: The one thing that people have questioned is whether they're going to turn these stores into
showrooms. And the fact of the matter is, I talked to a very prominent retailer CEO about this issue. They lose sales
when they do that, okay, especially when it becomes apparel. So I don't believe that if they want – if this retailer
continues to have an viable bricks and mortar strategy that they are going to get in the point where it's a showroom
because people continue to want to make sure that the size looks right on and all that other stuff, okay?
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: So as it becomes more of a supply demand of that location issue versus an occupancy
cost when negotiating the rent, and how do you attribute as they further integrate their business with e-commerce, how
do you attribute the specific sales of that store when reporting up to you?
<A - David E. Simon>: It's easy. They have to keep track of it. That's simple. That goes through their POS and it's
going to have to, if the store is in the – if the inventory is in the store. That's a simple exercise.
<Q - Christy M. McElroy>: Okay.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We have audit system and...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, we have audit raids. Okay?
<Q - Michael Jason Bilerman>: David, I have one quick question. just in terms of – and I recognize the deal with the
Taubmans, it's a private transaction. But there certainly was a time where they didn't want to take your stock pretty
forcefully. So I'm just curious how that transaction came about and what your plans are now that you own both parcels
of land in terms of the timing of potentially doing something on that site?
<A - David E. Simon>: Look, even though we obviously have had issues over the years with Taubman, we've always
had a, what I'd call a, good professional relationship certainly as the dust has settled from several years ago. So again, I
can't really comment on that other than – let me talk about the property.
We're very excited about it. We are very interested in working with the Town of Oyster Bay and our partner, Castagna
Realty. We're going to work with the residents, come up with a development plan, also with the property that we own
with Castagna Realty. Together we think there is an absolute way to create a win-win for the community and for us and
our partner. And it's great real estate. So, how we got there is really not important. I'm convinced it's in the best interest
of our shareholders and I'm convinced that Taubman feels the same way. So that actually can happen where you can
have a win-win for both companies.

Thank you. And your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Thank you. Good morning. And, Steve, congrats. It sounds like the stakes per hole just
went up between you and David.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Thanks. He talks a good game.
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: I would just check to make sure his ball is truly in bounds when he drives. Just two
questions here. The first is the other big story apart from the Internet this past season was the Penney closure. And if
you look at the 33 stores they closed, you could say, okay, they went through the whole thing and they could only find
33 stores. And Sears for all the years they've been talking of rationalizing, the Sears are still open. So, should we read
this as the various department stores have done these big reviews and these are all the stores that they've closed or your
sense is, this is the start of a wave and over the next several years, we're going to see a lot more of these big type
announcements?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean, I think it's a function of what the retailer ultimately is able to do. But the store
closures for us is a kind of a normal standard operating procedure that we deal with. We've had retailers clearly not
necessarily the scale of a couple that you mentioned. But we've had retailers coming out of business for years. And so,
again, yeah, it does add to the workload, but we find a way to get the job done. And I think you're right though, Alex, is
that they went through the portfolio generally.
And what we understand, which I'm not sure is for us to say, but we understand that that was the list that was actually
generating negative cash flow. So I think you're right in the sense that a number of these retailers continue to have
profitability and even in stores that are not as overly productive because for whatever reason.
So, as an example, and I don't know – maybe we'll have this, but people talked about small malls, B malls, the Internet.
But our comp, in the fourth quarter of our comp, NOI increase for the SpinCo malls was 4%. So that speaks to the
ability to continue to move the needle forward despite all the noise. Now, look, the fourth quarter sales, I gave you that.
I do think a lot happened all in the fourth quarter.
But the consumer between the uncertainty of Obamacare, the increase in taxes, wage growth continues to be anemic,
they spend on durable goods. They slowed down in the third and fourth quarter across the board, I mean, whether there
was high-end, the middle-end, or the lower-end consumer. And that happens, don't panic. We'll deal with that. So, at
the end of the day, I can't speak for the future of those two that you mentioned in terms of store closings, but what we
understand is it that's the analysis that led to the 33. But I'm not 100% certain on that, okay?
<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. And then the second question is regarding SpinCo. I mean, Simon is going to be
the platform for the initial, I believe, two years. The Simon brand ventures, the income that's generated from that, is
that something that SpinCo will have access to beyond that or is the understanding that SpinCo is going to sort of have
to try and replicate that NOI stream if in fact it ends the relationships with Simon as the supporting mall platform?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, all of those revenues are at the property level, so they'll continue. Now, ultimately,
remember, just to give you the SpinCo, the strip center business will be in SpinCo. SPG will do some back office
activity for the strip center business. SPG will act as third-party property manager for SpinCo malls. And all of that
revenue that group generates goes to their property.
So ultimately, it will be the decision for that team to decide whether or not they want to continue after the two-year
period to continue to use SPG as a property manager. But there's no reason in my mind that they couldn't, if they chose
not to do that, and that'll be up to the team and the board there that they could replicate the vast majority of that income.

<Q - Alexander D. Goldfarb>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Good morning. David, maybe I think you should name SpinCo Sterrett, in honor of Steve's
service to you.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah. That rolls right off the tongue.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: It does. It does. Hey, actually David, did I hear you...
<A - David E. Simon>: Honestly, I probably shouldn't say this publicly, but I'll go ahead and you know. Sometimes I
get into that box. But the hardest thing about SpinCo is coming up with the appropriate name, so...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah. So if you have any suggestion, please send them our way.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: I don't have any good ones. But actually, did I hear you correctly that you said NOI growth at
SpinCo was 4% in Q4 and are you able to share other operating metrics like leasing spreads and occupancy as well?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. That'll be in the final filing. But the fourth quarter, we thought you might ask that, so we
had that number for the fourth quarter. But that kind of stuff will all be in the filing.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And I guess maybe building on Alex's question about the Penney's and Sears' closure risk,
when you look at those two situations, I mean, I think people are trying to ultimately handicap, I'll call it, ultimate
exposure. Do you guys have a sense of what percentage of those stores that you have might not be, I'll call it, cost
effectively re-tenanted?
<A - David E. Simon>: I didn't catch your last part.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: What percentage of those stores we think may not be cost effectively re-tenanted if they
closed. I would tell you that we're spending a considerable amount of time and as we've said before on these calls, we
have our plans in place. We have identified replacement tenants; for example, we have one tenant already lined up to
occupy one of the Penney closures yet this year at a positive economic impact on that property and a positive sales
impact.
So, we are as prepared as one can be to take advantage of any opportunities that present themselves through the
activities of the department stores when they decide they don't want to do it. Over the years we've dealt with over 80 of
these things. So as David said, this is not new to us. We'll just keep doing what we've been doing historically.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: And maybe I can stick with you, Rick, and sort of following-up on Christy's earlier question,
historically, retailers kind of wanted the landlord to stay out of their way as it relates to retail sales. Are you seeing
retailers become more receptive to working with their landlord around their e-commerce and retail sales platform? I
mean, is that part of the leasing discussion or even specifically addressed in the lease or is the role that's sort of a
separate conversation, sort of an add-on, if you will?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Well, two parts to that. In our lease negotiations, we're incredibly mindful of the role that
our stores play in the distribution of their goods whether online or store-based. And frankly, if that store is any part of
the distribution channel for that sale, it's going to count in our sale.
The retailers understand that. And the retailers are emphasizing the convenience and location of their stores as a
significant advantage in their ability to maximize their contacts with the customers and their sales. So they very much
view their stores as an integral part of their business going forward and they are working with us in a cooperative way

to try and maximize.
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I would just say, Jeff, simply that we have both mobile and desktop, et cetera. We have a
system called Retailer Showcase that basically presents offers from the retailers to our consumers. They can get it in
mall, they can go on our website or whatever. We do that – I think the last number that I saw, probably 50,000 offers
over the year that we present to our consumers. We get those offer. We don't make them up. We get them from the
retailers. So absolutely, there is a significant amount of coordination, as you would expect, between us and the retailer
to improve and enhance their business. I believe we're just at the scratching of that surface. That is part of our job to
facilitate more productivity for the retailers' stores. And at the same time, trying to do that and increase rent, I mean, it's
not the easiest thing, but they know that we want them to be very productive. We work hand-in-hand with them and I
think technology generally will be a wonderful opportunity to make that relationship easier to execute.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Just one last question. I'm curious internally when you guys are handicapping, I'll call it,
exposure to anchor closures. What are the metrics that you guys look at internally? Is it four wall profit, is it some store
format, or market size, or approximated or distribution centers? I mean is there, I guess, a better methodology than
maybe just sort of overall sales productivity that you find in forecasting that?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, sure, because you don't know how many – how they cover. Historically, the department
stores advertise in a market, they allocate that advertising certain ways. So you've got to have a handle on that. But
again, on a specific store, we're going to have a sense as to where that is based upon lots of discussions over lots of
years.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: Corporately and where they're headed, we have some insights, but it's no different than people
that follow them and cover them. I mean we're not necessarily privy to all that's going on and what they're doing and
we have obviously good relationships with our major anchors. But, we're not privy to anything that's probably not
common knowledge, but we have a sense over years and years of dealing with them how they feel about certain stores.
<Q - Jeff J. Donnelly>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Just a couple of questions, David and Rick. As you kind of look at the rent spreads, those
dramatically improved over the course of 2013. And as you look at the rollover for the next really three years, your
ending-base rents are just a shade under $40 and when you add in the CAM, you're probably close to that $53. So, it
would seem that you're releasing spreads ought to continue to accelerate. Is there anything that would, outside of a sales
decline, which just doesn't seem to be happening, is there anything to suggest that leasing spreads wouldn't continue to
tick higher from here?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We certainly anticipate that we'll be able to continue to grow our rents as we have
historically. The other thing I would tell you is that we're spending a lot of money making these properties better. And
so, when you look at a very gross sales number that's made up of a whole lot of individual stories, and as we renovate
our properties, bring in better tenants, our tenants, we believe are more productive in our properties and that gives us
some incremental ability to drive rents. So, we don't envision that slowing down.

<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. And maybe sticking with you, Rick, just kind of on the tenants and how you're thinking
about repositioning the properties. I don't know if you have a specific number. But as you look at the mix of tenants in
the mall today, what percentage is apparel and what percentage do you think that will be three years from now?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: At this point, I think our apparel percentage is going to remain fairly stable. Now, the
tenants that make up that apparel percentage could change dramatically. We have some tenants that are reducing the
size of their stores and we have entrants coming in like Zara, H&M, UNIQLO that are in slightly bigger formats. But
there's not going to be a sense of a significant decline in the amount of space allocated to apparel.
We are allocating space differently. Look, last year, we opened 36 restaurants across the portfolio. That's a major focus
to be able to extend the stay in our properties, give the consumers a wider range of dining alternatives, and just make
the properties more experiential, which is obviously a focus of our retailers and us. So the mix may change, but I think
apparel is going to stay fairly stable, while the components may change.
<A - David E. Simon>: And let me probably – I probably shouldn't say this, but it's interesting as I've traveled the
world that understand probably not as much as I should do. But the occupancy cost that we have in the U.S. is
relatively benign compared to when you see it elsewhere in the world. So it's an interesting thing for us to pause to
think about what the opportunities to continue to grow that rent are.
But we've got to be absolutely sensitive to the retailer in making sure they profit in their environment as well. So – but,
our occupancy costs generally in comparison to kind of where the other shopping centers owners have in the world are
relatively below at least what those would indicate the rents are. So, we'll see how that evolves over time.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And they have been relatively stable for the last three years even though we've been able to
drive our rents.
<Q - Steve Sakwa>: Okay. Well, let me ask, I guess, one last question for maybe the newest member of the senior
store, Steve. Hopefully, you'll get your qualifying card here and get something new going. I went to the balance sheet
and kind of debt refinancings; obviously it's been very favorable. Just how are you thinking about kind of the balance
of debt maturing this year and then to 2015 and kind of what's your thought in terms of kind of laddering and kind of
where you want to be on the debt curve?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Well, Steve, it's pretty well-laddered already. As you know, as part of the SpinCo
announcement, we did state that we expect to raise $1 billion of debt through SpinCo with those proceeds coming to
Simon before the effective date. So, if you couple that with our bond deal in January, that's the majority of our capital
raise in terms of dealing with bond expirations.
We also unencumbered Sawgrass Mills as part of the use of those proceeds. So, we're in really good shape for 2014.
We've accomplished most of the capital plan. And then 2015, we're ordinary course of business. We have bonds
coming due every year. You should expect us to be a regular issuer in that market. But obviously, the secured debt
market is also important to us as well, so you'll see us in both.
<A - David E. Simon>: Okay. Hello?
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Thank you. And Steve, thanks for all your help over the years. Given to some of the clouds around
fourth quarter consumer activity in the mall, I know you guys don't typically do this, but would you be able to provide a
pure fourth quarter 2013 over fourth quarter 2012 tenant sales trend?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yes, it was flat.

<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up, I know you mentioned this thing called same store
NOI, but from a tenant sales perspective, how does that look like when you split out the outlets, A Malls and B Malls?
It doesn't have to be fourth quarter, but maybe the year-over-year – the total trailing 12 months.
<A - David E. Simon>: I'm sorry?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: I didn't really understand the question, Ki Bin.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. So, the trend in your tenant sales of 2.5% year-over-year trailing 12 months, how does that
look like, like if you had to stratify it between outlets, A malls and B malls?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean, we shared some of that with you when we announced SpinCo. That gives you a
general direction for that answer. And as you'll see, once when SpinCo is done and effective, you'll have the SpinCo
data and you'll have the SPG data. So that will all be there, but that gives you a sense of directionally of where it is.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. And just the last point, should we expect negative sales at all for SpinCo in the fourth
quarter?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. I mean, we gave you that at – whenever it was, December.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah. We showed you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Several years of history.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. It was up.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: I can't remember the exact number. But it's right there. It's public document. It's on our – I
assume it's on our Investor website. It's all there.
<A - Elizabeth A. Zale>: Yeah.
<Q - Ki Bin Kim>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Good morning, everyone. Just want to go back to the retail side here for a second. A lot of talk
about the sales trends, but obviously, profitability is very important and just given the number of pre-announcements
that we've heard this season. I'm just curious if you think we should be expecting a higher level of seasonal occupancy
decline in the first quarter here than we've seen over maybe the last few years where perhaps the plans were a little bit
more conservative?
<A - David E. Simon>: We don't see that at this moment. Things change over the year, but we don't see that
necessarily. Obviously we have a good handle on that. The only thing we don't have a handle that could change that is
bankruptcies. But based upon our existing status of where we are with our discussion with retailers, we don't see that.
Obviously, a bankruptcy here or there may be able to impact that on a faster basis.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thanks. And then going back to the discussion around e-commerce, we hear a lot about
Macy's and Nordstrom and companies like that, that are very forward-thinking about their strategies. I'm just

wondering how you think the smaller retailers that maybe don't have the same scale or infrastructure can evolve in a
new environment to be able to kind of compete with e-commerce?
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Well, I mean, the fact of the matter is and you can see it in technology companies'
results is that it is relatively a lot less expensive to create because of the cloud and the way apps work and so on. It's
relatively less expensive to create the combination, become more technology-oriented than it has in the past.
Lots of ability to share services in the cloud that you wouldn't otherwise have to invest in. So I think, maybe the
mom-and-pop has a harder time. But generally, any retailer that has a kind of a reasonable store base can compete very
effectively because the cost of technology is – you don't need routers. You don't need servers. You don't need a bunch
of software guys cranking that stuff out like you used to.
You know a fact, is if we had done MerchantWired today with different technology, we'd probably be successful, but
we overpaid for the hardware. So, I think, as long as they have a reasonable store base, they're going to be able to create
the appropriate coordination between their bricks-and-mortar stores and how they want to deal with online shopping.
A – [05F1ZC-E Rick Sokolov]>: And frankly, there is no retailer that we meet with that is not very focused on doing
precisely that. Some of them are further along in their implementation of those strategies, but every one of them is
focused on more effectively integrating their online with their stores.
<Q - Vincent Chao>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance of Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Thank you. Just staying on this line of questions, have you seen retailers expand their
footprint in order to better distribute goods that they would be selling online? So, I'm talking about, of course, your
footprint in the malls.
<A - David E. Simon>: It's a good point. What I have seen them do is think about their stores as a distribution – point
of distribution along with the – as a store. So, whether they're now looking at stores just for the sake of having a store
and a distribution, I don't – I wouldn't say that that thinking is there yet. But clearly, existing stores are being thought as
a way to distribute in kind of the e-commerce platform. So I do think that thinking – and that's at a different level for
many different retailers, but I actually do think they're thinking about it very seriously.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: So how many such distribution centers if you will would a retailer need in a large metro
area?
<A - David E. Simon>: That – you know, I – it depends.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It depends on the retailer.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. I can't – I'm not in a position to say that, but it depends on the retailer.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: And the funny thing is, they're not talking about using drones to ship their goods.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Yeah, I'm sure that's – it's going to be an interesting transition. Just going back on the
dispositions of 14 non-core assets, can you give us a little bit more details in terms of which property type and cap
rates?
<A - David E. Simon>: There – I don't have it in front of me, but a few smaller shopping centers, a couple of outlets.
So, we'll continue to do that as well.

<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Were any of those considered to be spun out into SpinCo?
<A - David E. Simon>: The answer is none of those are in – were in the SpinCo because we already had contracts.
There is a couple of strip centers that may or may not be sold before SpinCo is done. So, if that's the case, we'll just –
we're going to just amend – we're going to ultimately – the portfolios we've said to you in December when we
announced it will change a little bit, part of that will be because of a couple of sales here and there, and a couple of
them will be because we may or may not get a consent. So – but that could still happen.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. And maybe a final question on the relationship with anchors. So, a couple of weeks
ago, I think, Sears announced that they would be leasing space to Dick's Sporting Goods at King of Prussia. That's
obviously by far the best mall in the Philly area. When you think about your ability to recapture stores from Sears and
Penney, in particular, versus the decision that they may ultimately make to lease to what is effectively a power center
tenant into what is by far the best mall in particular metro, how do you think about what is the right price for you to pay
to recapture that box and what can you do to influence their decision on the retailer that will come into their center or
into their box?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, I mean, the simple answer is it depends. Each case is different to be honest with you. So
in that case, we cooperate with Sears given the location of that store and what our plans were on the future
redevelopment, we thought it was a win-win for us. We're happy to have Dick's in there and it was a good transaction
for Sears. In some cases, because of the location of the stores, we may want to do the development on ourselves – by
ourselves. In some cases, we'll let them do it. If in fact, we may – in most cases, we have approval rights. So each case
is very different.
Believe me, we have understanding of each one to a great level. But in that case, we just saw it as a way to be
cooperative with Sears, a way to help the mall, great for the consumer, and as you know, we think Dick's is great. We
do a lot of business with them. So, in that case, we said, perfect. Let's go. We'll help you. We'll cooperate.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: So you didn't try to acquire the box back from Sears?
<A - David E. Simon>: No, we did not. And Sears will continue to operate there as well. So, it's – Dick's is taking the
upper level, and Sears is going to actually – we understand going to create the Store of the Future, so to speak in the
lower level. So, that's great. And we'll continue to work with anchors like that as well. And there's lot of little tactical
things that are going on with all of our anchors about getting rights to put restaurants in some of the Frontage or – just
to bring up an example in Briarwood, we're putting a couple restaurants, and we do that all the time like in front of
Macy's. So all of that stuff is out there to do, some cases, we facilitate them if they want to do a lease.
So the simple goal is let's make the property better for the consumer. And it will take all sorts of different forms. We
wouldn't rule out partnering with somebody on a redevelopment of their box, if that circumstance made sense for both
parties.
<Q - Cedrik Lachance>: Okay. That's great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator

<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Hi. Congratulation, Steve, first of all.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Thank you.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Yeah. And I guess going to The Mills for a second, I was wondering, can you give us a
little more color on the 11% comp NOI growth? I mean, was it a handful of assets, was it broad-based, and what was
really driving those numbers?

<A - David E. Simon>: Look, they have a – they're in major markets, it's 16 assets. As you know, the focus on value
for them, value-oriented retailers, has been tremendously successful. You've got The Outlets at Orange, that conversion
from more of an entertainment center to an outlet center has been terrific. Ontario is on fire. Sawgrass, needless to say,
is – continues to be behemoth. Potomac Mills, we brought a couple of restaurants in. Opry, though that's not in the
comp.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: It's not in the comp.
<A - David E. Simon>: Opry has been fantastic.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Casino at Arundel.
<A - David E. Simon>: The Casino at Arundel. So, lots of things go there. Just a lot of things have to be there to make
the portfolio. We added Macy's at Gurnee Mills as an example. So...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: But Mike, this is Steve. It is rent. It's re-leasing, it's higher occupancy, it's growing rents.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay, so it sounds like if we're thinking about 2014, 2015, you're probably still getting
above average growth out of that part of the portfolio?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think, it'll be good. I'm not going to do 10%, we're not going to do 10.8% for the year. So,
don't put that in your numbers.
<Q - Michael W. Mueller>: Okay, that was it. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.

Thank you, and your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Hi, good morning. Steve, also let me add my congratulations. It looks like you really have
one year left to finally go shoe shopping before you lose your steady paycheck?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Tayo, if I'm going to go shoe shopping, I'm going to go with you. That's for sure.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Sounds good. Two quick questions. First of all, [indiscernible] (1:04:31) around
commentary of a lot of retailers saying Christmas was weak. I know David made a couple of comments about what
could change your initial outlook for 2014, would it be potential for more bankruptcies or things of that nature. But I
just – then for everything you've seen right now, are you seeing kind on-the-fringe tenants talking like that about
potentially closing shops or things like that just based of the tough holiday season?
<A - David E. Simon>: Not really. This is always the general time where you may see a few of these pop up. But no
one – in fact, there's a few that have been in the edge for a number of years and actually turned their business around,
even last year.
Look, I think the consumer – I read something yesterday on the plane back from Europe that the consumer is still under
a pretty decent amount of pressure; higher taxes, more regulation, uncertainty of Obamacare. So spending on durable
goods a little bit in the first half of the year, higher rates potentially they were thinking. They took it easy in the third
and fourth quarter, as you've seen across the board.
So, we are still in a tepid recovery. The fascinating thing I read, last year – forget the federal government – in the state
and local governments, there were 40,000 new rules and regulations in the United States of America. So, that is going
to slow the growth of America; 40,000 new regulations throughout this country at a state and local level. That's going
to slow us down. So, we have a tepid recovery even though some of the broad-based numbers look better, the fact is it's
still a very cautious environment, but we're producing terrific results in that environment. And that's the facts, we

produced great results in the Great Recession. We had cash flow that was flat. So, despite all of that noise out there, we
can only do what we're capable of doing. We can't control the outcome of an anchor business plan or not. We can just
be ready to go to work if, in fact, these things are thrown in our way.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Got it. That's helpful. And then the second thing is we also heard that Matt Lentz had also
kind of left the company, just wondering if that role was going to be a replacement for him or if there are going to be
any changes around the CIO position.
<A - David E. Simon>: The answer is we brought someone in to help me internationally, where Matt was helping.
Stanley Shashoua, who's been terrific. Stanley is great, speaks five languages, maybe six. Unlike the team here, he can
actually speak English. But he's great and he's helping me. And in a sense, he really took Matt's role on our
international business.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Got it. Could you talk a little bit more about just Stanley's overall background, and what he
has kind of done in the past?
<A - David E. Simon>: He worked for both real estate and investment banking companies. So, he's been a young guy
compared to me probably, but he's been – he's got great experience and he was instrumental with the McArthurGlen
deal. I had to put him on that deal because of the complexity and he really helped us get there, with another kind of
great guy here, who actually came from The Mills, but moved to Indianapolis when we did that deal, Brian McDade.
The two of them grabbed that along with our General Counsel grabbed that deal and took it to the finish line. And so,
we – the good thing about the – we have kind of the what I'll call younger folks that are really taking a lot more
responsibility in the organization and doing a great job.
<Q - Tayo T. Okusanya>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions on the
SpinCo. So, several of the SpinCo's properties are incumbent with CMBS debts that has near-term maturities: West
Ridge Mall in Topeka, Chesapeake Square in Chesapeake Virginia and...
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. Those are all being refinanced...
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: As we speak.
<A - David E. Simon>: – as we speak.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay.
<A - David E. Simon>: So that is your question?
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Well, I was getting to it, right? So, there's four or five in that list with near-term debt
maturities. So should we assume that all five that are in that list are being refinanced or are they candidates for
disposition?
<A - David E. Simon>: No. They're all going to be refinanced, absent one may – one may not be – one is further out
there. I don't know – yeah, but they'll be refinanced.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Okay. And yeah, you've quietly gone about pruning your U.S. portfolio in recent years.
I'm trying to get a sense how that process slows down post-SpinCo. How do you think about your U.S. portfolio or
disposition strategy after the spin-off with SpinCo?

<A - David E. Simon>: Well, for SPG, we'll continue to cull properties like we have for year-after-year. SpinCo, I
think – again, I'm not going to be in charge there. But I think I would expect SpinCo to sell a couple assets here and
there. And I think, it's – that's business as usual. I mean, we'll always continue to sell assets at both companies. I can't
necessarily, as a director, I'll have certainly my point of view on capital allocation and reallocation, but I would expect
both companies to continue to sell assets like we have in the past.
<Q - Haendel E. St. Juste>: Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Thanks very much. I was wondering, I guess, there's been enough questions about some
seasonal trends here with normally season closings in the first quarter. But I guess on the other side of that, at over 96%
occupancy here, you likely have some sort of backlog in terms of retailers wanting to get in. I'm just wondering if you
can comment a bit in terms of conversations with retailers looking ahead in terms of Del Amo as that opens up next
year and just others, just how you think about that in terms of demand in terms of just if there were to be any vacancies,
in terms of some backfilling or adding there?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We still have very strong demand and in fact, the response to the Del Amo has been
terrific. We are going to be able to move that up significantly in price point and with the quality retailers; and retailers
still want to expand. Retailers still want to have great real estate that will help their brand and we're seeing no real
slowdown in that conversation. And in fact, and we've said this in other calls, a great amount of the time that David and
I spend are basically dealing with retailers that we cannot accommodate in the size they want or in the space that they
want at our properties. So demand remains high.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Dan, this is Steve. I'll just add one point. We tend not to get into the 27 different variables
that go into our forecast for the year, but I will say that our plan in 2014 is that occupancy year-over-year will be up at
the end of 2014.
<Q - Dan M. Oppenheim>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Yang of Evercore. Please proceed, Ben.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Hi. Great. Thanks. David, you've talked in the past about the disconnect between sales and NOI
that for one, you can replace the underperforming tenants. So I was just hoping, I mean, Steve made the comment about
occupancy being up in 2014. Would you guys consider at all just disclosing what the same-store NOI growth is, in
providing your 2014 guidance because just seems like it could help alleviate some of the concerns surrounding core
growth in spite of point of sale, [indiscernible] (01:14:21).
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, let me interrupt you there. We did actually.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: How did you?
<A - David E. Simon>: I must have bored you by the time I got to that. It's quite all right. I understand that our
opening comments may in fact bore some. We are projecting for 2014 to have comp NOI up 4% or above. So I...
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: 4%?

<A - David E. Simon>: Does that answer your question? 4%.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Got it. Sorry I missed that.
<A - David E. Simon>: That's all right. I am not offended in any stretch of the imagination.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Maybe I missed this one also. Did you disclose the cap rate for the Arizona Mills transaction?
<A - David E. Simon>: We, in fact, we said we would not. And we did do – we did say that earlier, but that's okay.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Okay. I missed that one too. And maybe a final question, maybe going back to Cedrik's comments
on Sears, do you think that anchor subleasing dynamic will accelerate in the coming years? And also, is this a model
that only works at the A malls, or do you think we could see this type of activity ramp up at the B malls?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: I think that there is going to be a concerted effort by Sears. They've done it historically
over the last few years and they're continuing to be focused on it to try and get their stores to where they are most
efficient. That doesn't – and I think that is frankly not specifically limited to any particular quality spectrum of their
stores.
And as David said, where we think it's in our best interest, we'll cooperate if we think it is not in our best interest, to the
mall's best interest, to the consumers' best interest, we'll try and influence a different direction in Sears' part. But I don't
think their efforts are being focused on any particular quality type.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Got it. And are you in current negotiations to do this in any other of your malls with Sears or
maybe even a Penney's currently?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: We're having a constant dialog with both companies about all the real estate. And frankly,
as David said earlier, we hopefully – for that provides us a lot of insights into what they're thinking strategically with
respect to the stores. And we're trying to work with them to come up with positive outcomes.
<Q - Ben J. Yang>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thanks. Just given Steve's retirement date, I'm wondering if that's a good indicator
when he thinks that the debt markets are going to get tougher?
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: You know, I don't know. I see the 10-year coming back down. So, Craig, I will say that the
debt markets are in really good shape right now for us. Now, I always caution that by, I think, about the little
commercials, your results may not be the same, but for us, the bond market is wide open, the mortgage market is very
good, the bank market is wide open, so – and having already put away now quite a bit of our 2014 maturities, we can
start to tackle the 2015 stuff and feel good about the opportunity to continue to roll down our weighted average
borrowing costs, while increasing our duration. I think, it is interesting in a debt portfolio, the $28 billion, $29 billion,
we've lowered our borrowing cost 23 basis points in each of the last two years. And that's a pretty meaningful
contribution to profitability.
<A - David E. Simon>: With no reliance on floating rate debt.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Yeah, it was almost no floating rate debt.
<A - David E. Simon>: I mean, that's the important part. I mean, we – if we wanted to juice our earnings growth, we
would have 20%, 30% of floating rate debt. We basically have virtually nil.

<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thanks. And I just – one other thought on the cost of occupancy, I know this has been
touched on, but 11.5% still seems low even when considering it's premium outlets combined with malls. Where do you
think – and unrelated to moving target, but where do you think that could normalize out your cost of occupancy or do
you think it's going to remain sort of in the mid-11%s?
<A - David E. Simon>: Well, this is the $64,000 question. Like I said earlier, I mean, it is interesting to me that
occupancy costs outside of the U.S. are much, much higher. And so the answer is I don't know other than it does give
us some very good feeling that we still have a ways to continue to grow our NOI, because essentially the biggest
opportunity we have is to marking our leases to market and being able to replace underperforming retailers with better
ones. So besides the – obviously, and I know Craig you've been out seeing a bunch of properties. And I appreciate that
you have because you'll get a good sense of what's going on here which I do think because of the size of the company
sometimes people lose focus, but – of all that's going on, but that's going to drive our business. But it's – I can't put a
number on it, and – but – and we're here to create the right partnership with our retailers, because look we believe in
repeat business with them, but it gives us confidence that we still have the ability to execute even with a tepid consumer
comp NOI growth.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Yeah, I would just say in the properties I've visited I've been very impressed and you
sort of forget sometimes that there really is a skill to managing these assets. And some of the things I've seen in the last
couple weeks have been very impressive.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah, look – I mean, I know you went to Del Amo, right? And I'm sure you didn't really
believe we're redoing Del Amo, I would guess. I know you've been asking about this for – I'm sure you asked The Mills
pre-acquisition for years, and I know once we bought The Mills, it took us a few years, and one great recession to
overcome, but it's going to be a great, great mall.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: No, I think, what you're doing and just bringing in Nordstrom could be a real game
changer, because there's clearly an unserved audience there.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah.
<Q - Craig Richard Schmidt>: Thanks.
<A - David E. Simon>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Good morning. Just as a follow-up to Craig's question, I guess, when you're sitting down with
tenants and negotiating new leases, I mean, is there a target occupancy cost?
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: The answer is that we're very focused on the maximizing of rents and it's less about a
target occupancy cost because it takes into account the size of the space, the use of the tenant, the quality of the mall,
where's the space located in the mall, what's the sales projection for that tenant, and all of that goes into setting the rate
that we think is appropriate. And believe me, the process is granular and we spend a great deal of time on the nickels,
making sure that we try and get it right. But we don't go into any given space saying we want 12.5% of sales from this
space and 18% from this space. All those factors go into how we set the rent.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. Thanks. That helps. And then, Rick, I guess, a – I know there's been a lot of discussion
on jcpenney's here, but just one thing I was thinking about when I was going through the supp on anchor big box
openings, it was interesting when you look at the list. Compared to, let's say, years ago when we saw a number of
department store closings, I mean do you feel better today there's more options? I mean, I really haven't heard yet great
evidence if some of these anchors are definitely a benefit to the mall, but I would imagine, it just seems like a pretty
good list, including like, I noticed Wegmans at Montgomery Mall.

Page 20 of 21
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: Yeah. Well, look we have a whole dedicated team and, frankly, David and I've been
pushing all of our people to go out and cast as broad a net as possible, so we have as many options identified as
possible to make things work. And, frankly, Wegmans in Montgomery Mall has been terrific. Fairway Market at
Nanuet has been great. The Fresh Market at The Falls, but that's just one category.
David mentioned Dick's earlier, Arhaus Furniture. We just have a lot of different users than, as we've said earlier, we've
gone through our portfolio and have these users identified so that if an opportunity presents itself with an anchor box,
we can move efficiently and quickly and effectively to get it filled.
<A - David E. Simon>: Yeah. And the difference, Jeff, also is that when we had a significant turmoil in the department
store business, say, in the late 1980s, early 1990s, I mean there's been episodes of a lot of turnover. There was also a lot
new stuff that was being brought to the market.
In today's market, you essentially have no new – I mean, of a significant quantity, no new development, whether it's
strip centers or malls. They have a little bit in the outlet business, as we all know. But you have no new product coming
on the market. And, it's – yeah, I know, there are a few, but in the real sense of stuff. So – and you also have
obsolescence occurring, which is – by the way, we've been telling folks for several years that we expected
obsolescence. When you put together the inventory type, and sure there'll be some headaches associated with that, but
that's a better spot to be in, if in fact there is significant anchor turmoil than say in the early 1990s and a couple other,
the episodes that Rick and I have had to deal with.
<A - Richard S. Sokolov>: And then the last thing I'll say on that is, that frankly success breeds successes. So once
we're able to get one of these new anchors in our properties, they open the store, what invariably we have found is
they've been more successful that they thought they'd be and that makes the next conversation for the next opportunity
much more easy to have and finalize.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Thanks. And then I just want to clarify. I know at the beginning of the call, David, you were
talking about traffic counts. I think, it's important to clarify. I think, you used the word you don't participate with the
company mentioned. When you say that – are you saying, just to confirm, Simon does not provide data to these
companies. Is that correct?
<A - David E. Simon>: They are – yeah. They – first of all, we don't use them. We rely primarily on parking counts.
We do not use them. I think, they're – I'm not sure about their sample base. You'll have to ask them. I think it's narrow,
and I don't – the retailers that use them, I think, it's a small subset. But, I mean, look, there are lots of people that make
pronouncements and tell you this, tell you that. All we can do is just report quarter-after-quarter what the results of our
business produced.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. And then my last question. I know you may not be able to answer it, but in the
discussions with Taubman, I guess did anything – was there any discussions on the two different St. Louis outlet
centers?
<A - David E. Simon>: I think, Jeff, everything I've told you about our deal has been disclosed.
<Q - Jeff A. Spector>: Okay. Thanks, and congratulations, Steve.
<A - Stephen E. Sterrett>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Nathan Isbee of Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Nathan Isbee>: Yeah. Just a quick follow-up, a technical question. You mentioned that online sales fulfilled at
your malls will count towards sales. On the flip side, if somebody buys six pairs of shoes online and returns five of
them at your malls, is that a net deduction to sales?

Okay. Thank you. Sorry the call dragged on that long. Steve has been a great part of the group. We've got another year
to torment him, so I'm sure you'll see him around. And we'll make sure that he'll undergo the extra torment for the next
year. So anyway, thank you. Have a good one.
