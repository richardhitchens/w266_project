Jon Roberts, President of Caremark; and Mark Cosby, President of CVS Pharmacy, are also with us today and will
participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks.
During the Q&A, please limit yourself to one or two questions, so we can provide more analysts and investors a chance
to ask their questions. Please note that we posted a slide presentation on our website this morning and it summarizes the
information on this call as well as key facts and figures around our operating performance and guidance. So, I
recommend that you take a look at that. Additionally, note that we plan to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K later
this month and it will be available through our website at that time.
During this call, we'll discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our company's performance, mainly
free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS.
In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of the non-GAAP items, I mentioned, as well as the
reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today's
call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.
Now before we begin, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor Statement. During this presentation, we'll
make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially.
Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking
statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become
familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors session of our most recently filed
Annual Report on Form 10-K and that you review the section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Statements in our most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Well, thanks, Nancy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, obviously we're very pleased
with the strong results we posted in the fourth quarter and full year 2012 with solid performance across the enterprise.
Now, if you exclude the one-time cost of $0.17 per share, related to the early extinguishment of debt, adjusted earnings
per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year were $1.14 and $3.43 respectively,
demonstrating very healthy underlying growth of 28% for the quarter, 23% for the year.
Now you'll recall that in December, we retired some long-term debt, replacing it with debt at lower interest rates and
that refinancing and the associated one-time cost was not included in our guidance. So, our fourth quarter results reflect
strong performances at the high-end of our expectations in both the Retail and PBM segments.
In addition, below-the-line benefits from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares than expected, drove the
out-performance with the quarter exceeding the high-end of our guidance by $0.03 per share. We also generated $1.1
billion in free cash flow in the quarter, bringing the 2012 total to $5.2 billion, which also exceeded our goal for the
year.
Now in addition to posting better-than-expected 2012 results; this morning, we're raising our guidance for 2013, taking
into account the anticipated accretion from the debt refinancing. We now expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share
for 2013 in the range of $3.86 to $4.00. And that's up $0.02 from our previous range of $3.84 to $3.98. And Dave will
provide the details of our guidance during his financial review.
So with that let me provide a brief business update and I'll start with our PBM. Since our Analyst Day in
mid-December, there has been no material change in the 2013 selling season. And with nearly 85% of our client
renewals completed to-date, our retention rate stands at 96%. Now, on Analyst Day, we reported net new business wins
for 2013 of about $400 million. And while we've had some additional wins since Analyst Day, we expect the impact of

the recent CMS sanction, which I'll speak about shortly, to basically offset those recent wins. So, again our net new
business for 2013 stands at about $400 million.
Now, it's obviously very early in the 2014 selling season, but efforts are well underway. And our differentiated
offerings continue to gain attention in the marketplace. Client interest in our unique Maintenance Choice offerings
continues to be robust. And we now have about 15.8 million lives covered by more than 1,100 plans that have
implemented or committed to implement our Maintenance Choice offerings, and that number is up from 14.5 million
lives at our last update. And looking forward, we see the potential to increase the number of lives to an even-higher
level.
We are enrolling new lives into both of our Maintenance Choice offerings with some clients opting for the 1.0 offering
and others opting for the new 2.0 design. Most of the lives are coming from plans that previously had voluntary mail
plan designs. So, these clients can now begin to experience the cost savings Maintenance Choice offers.
Pharmacy Advisor, our flagship clinical offering, has also made strong advances. Five new disease states have been
successfully implemented as of January 1, including asthma, COPD, depression, osteoporosis and breast cancer. And as
we said on Analyst Day, we expect to have about 900 clients with about 16 million members enrolled in all or some of
our available programs. And we have seen a very positive response from clients to the newly expanded offerings.
We also began offering Pharmacy Advisor to our Medicare clients on January 1, and we're excited about future
opportunities to support these clients as they strive to improve their Star ratings. And I think these are two great
examples of how we're capitalizing on our integrated assets, and these programs are helping to lower healthcare costs,
while improving the health of those we serve.
Now let me talk more about the recent CMS sanction on our Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. The sanction
means that we cannot enroll new individual SilverScript members or market our SilverScript plan to potential
individual members until the sanction is lifted. However, current SilverScript members are not affected by this action,
including our EGWPs along with the new individual members that enrolled at the beginning of this plan year. Our
clients' EGWP plans and their members are also not affected by the sanction. This sanction relates only to our
SilverScript plan and does not affect Medicare Part D plans offered by our health plan clients.
Now that said let me acknowledge my disappointment in these circumstances. Our goal is to execute flawlessly across
the organization every day. And in consolidating the Medicare Part D enrollment systems for SilverScript, we did not
deliver on that goal. So, we're working to resolve these issues as expeditiously as possible. The sanction should be
lifted when CMS is satisfied that the issues are fixed and not likely to recur. Now, let me assure you that we are highly
focused on working with CMS to bring these issues to resolution as soon as possible.
So with that, I'll turn to three important PBM growth drivers: the fast growing specialty pharmacy business; our
streamlining initiative; and the Aetna relationship. Now the specialty pharmacy business continued on pace with
revenues increasing more than 31% versus the same quarter of last year. And this specialty growth was driven by new
PBM clients, new product launches along with drug price inflation, and given that specialty costs are growing rapidly,
our clients are looking for help to better manage this trend. And our specialty guideline management program continues
to garner a great deal of interest with some significant new clients adopting the program late last year.
We're also seeing a lot of interest in our specialty medical benefit management program, especially among our health
plan customers. And we have multiple pilots underway, and we expect to close and implement several other customers
during the 2013 year. So, specialty pharmacy will continue to be a key area of focus for us going forward.
As for the streamlining initiative, we are on track with our efforts to reorganize PBM operations, to improve
productivity, rationalize capacity and consolidate our adjudication platforms to one destination platform with enhanced
capabilities. We now have about two-thirds of our business on the destination platform, and we expect to increase that
to 85% by the end of this year.
As for the other transformation activities, we anticipate being more than 95% complete by the end of April. So, we're
on track to deliver significant cost savings from the streamlining efforts, and we expect to hit the full run rate of annual

savings, that being $225 million to $275 million, beginning in 2014.
And then as for the Aetna relationship, the client systems conversion continues to proceed successfully. We have
further migrations scheduled throughout this year. And once a client's migration is complete, we can then begin to offer
our differentiated products and services.
We have had a successful selling season, as Aetna has added more than 1 million pharmacy lives to their book. And we
have seen interest within the Aetna client base to implement Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor. And we
believe this has further enhanced Aetna's competitive position in the marketplace. So, we're very optimistic as to what
lies ahead as we continue to work with the Aetna team to drive cost savings for their clients.
So with that, let me turn to our Retail business. We had a very strong quarter with same-store sales increasing 4%.
Pharmacy comps also increased 4% in the quarter with front-store comps increasing 3.9%.
New generics had a negative impact of about 1,100 basis points on Pharmacy comps. And you may recall that's up
from about 900 basis points in the third quarter. Script comps increased 11% on a 30-day supply basis and 9% when
counting 90-day supplies as one script. We had a slight benefit in the quarter from flu-related scripts and flu shots
increasing during December. In addition, our retention of scripts gained during the Walgreens-Express impasse was
also a factor.
As expected, we retained at least 60% of the scripts gained during the impasse. And we estimate the impact added
about 340 basis points to our script comp, equating to about 5.5 million to 6 million scripts. And we remain confident
that we will continue to retain at least 60% of the scripts in 2013.
Now as for the front-store business, both customer traffic and the average front-store ticket increased notably in the
quarter. I'm sure you're not surprised to hear that we saw particular strength in cough and cold, allergy and flu-related
sales. Private label sales represented 18.1% of front-store sales in the quarter, that's up about 20 basis points
year-over-year. And we also continued to see solid sales and share growth in the beauty category, driven by skincare
and cosmetics.
In addition, we estimate that the Walgreens-Express impasse positively impacted our front store comp by about 150
basis points in the quarter. And as for the Christmas season, seasonal sales came in close to, but just below our
expectations.
Now when you look at market share, the latest data shows that CVS has gained front-store share versus a year ago. Our
share growth in the drug channel was 226 basis points, and against multi-outlet competitors, 17 basis points.
Now let me touch on our ExtraCare program, because it continues to be a key differentiator for us, with the scale of our
program increasing dramatically in 2012, even with competitive activity in the loyalty space.
Now, both front-store and pharmacy transactions with the ExtraCare card increased. We issued more personalized
offers, and we saw 19% growth in the number of offers redeemed, with many now coming from the ExtraCare Coupon
Centers.
In addition, increased engagement of our ExtraCare members is driving meaningful results. As an example, we have
doubled our e-mail program to more than 15 million active participants. They have received over 60 million
personalized e-mail offers, that's up 69% versus the prior year.
Beauty Club participation grew by 21% to 11 million customers, affording targeted promotion and profitable sales
growth. And just last week, we launched an enhanced ExtraCare program for Pharmacy & Health rewards. Now, this is
an opt-in program, and individual enrollment versus household participation allows for more personalized
communication. And we can offer members a wider range of rewards for healthy behaviors that can result in improved
adherence. So this program will be a great tool for driving prescription adherence, script consolidation and customer
retention.

And while ExtraCare has been in the marketplace for 15 years, I think these are examples of how we're not sitting still.
These enhanced programs are geared to our higher-value customers. And it enables us to focus and tailor our rewards,
along with enhancing the productivity of our investments.
With that, let me turn to our Real Estate program. We opened 45 new or relocated stores. We closed 2, resulting in 35
net new stores in the quarter. And for the year, we opened 150 new or relocated stores, closed 19, resulting in 131 net
new stores with 2.1% retail square footage growth.
Now, before turning to MinuteClinic, I want to touch on a recent transaction. Late last week, we closed on the
acquisition of Drogaria Onofre, a privately-held retail drugstore chain in Sao Paulo, Brazil, with 44 stores. This
transaction is not financially material to our company. However, it is our first foray into the international drugstore
space and we wanted to provide a little color this morning.
As you know, we have been exploring opportunities for possible international expansion, and we've said many times
that our approach would be measured and that we would exercise financial discipline. And we believe this acquisition
is a great example of that strategy in action. Onofre has a strong reputation in the marketplace; they do a great job in
tailoring their stores to market to different customer segments. And we view Brazil as an attractive market, given that
healthcare and pharmacy are expected to grow double-digits for the next decade. And while chains are prevalent, it is
still a highly fragmented market. So, we see nice opportunities to grow the business over time. And as we've said, we
will continue to take a measured approach to our international growth plan.
So with that, let me turn to MinuteClinic, which recorded very strong revenue growth in the quarter. On a comparable
basis, sales were up more than 38%, versus the same quarter last year. And as we headed into January with a strong flu
season, our patient visits at MinuteClinic reached unprecedented daily levels. In addition to treating acute visit patients
in the quarter, we continued to work on wellness programs, along with programs aimed at treating chronic conditions.
For example, we've developed a provider education program with the American Heart Association to support our
hypertension evaluation visits. And we're also piloting enhanced smoking cessation and weight management programs.
And the strong growth we've experienced in MinuteClinic's non-acute services is helping us to reduce the seasonality of
the business. We opened 31 net new clinics in the quarter and we ended 2012 with 640 clinics in 25 states in the
District of Columbia. And as Andy Sussman noted on Analyst Day, we're ramping up our expansion plans and we
expect to open another 150 clinics this year, ending 2013 with just under 800 clinics.
MinuteClinic is also expanding its affiliations with many of the nation's leading health systems. And it's also increasing
its collaboration with our PBM clients. And through all of these efforts, we will help to transform the delivery of
primary care in the U.S. as our healthcare system continues to evolve.
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.
David M. Denton
Good morning. Thank you, Larry. Today, I'll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter 2012 results and review
our 2013 guidance. But let me begin with a wrap up of last year's capital allocation program and how we're using our
strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, we finalized the accelerated share repurchase program that we began in September. And we also
repurchased approximately 7.1 million shares for approximately $329 million in the open market. So for all of 2012,
we repurchased approximately 95 million shares for $4.3 billion, averaging $45.58 per share.
Additionally, we paid approximately $202 million in dividends in the fourth quarter alone, bringing our total for the
year to $829 million. We've finished the year with a payout ratio of 21.3%. And our strong earnings outlook this year,
combined with a 38% increase in the dividend we announced at our Analyst Day, puts us on track to achieve our
targeted payout ratio of 25% by the end of 2013, two years ahead of our schedule.

So between dividends and share repurchases, we've returned more than $5.1 billion to our shareholders just in 2012.
And our expectation is that between dividends and share repurchases, we will return approximately $5 billion again to
our shareholders in 2013.
We generated $5.2 billion of free cash in 2012 and $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter alone, up $419 million from the
same period of LY. This was driven by our earnings out-performance, as well as improved receivables and payables
management and the timing of certain payments.
Regarding the balance sheet, over the course of 2012, we continued to make great strides in improving our cash cycle,
especially within the Retail segment. Inventory days within Retail improved by more than 3.5 days in 2012, and we
reduced our Retail cash cycle by more than five days throughout the year. The Retail team was able to reduce
inventories by approximately $450 million through process improvements. And while just short of our $500 million
goal, we are – we remain committed to further inventory reductions as we move forward.
In the fourth quarter, gross capital expenditures of 17 – $716 million were offset by $102 million of sale-leaseback
activity. For the year, our net capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, which included $2 billion of gross CapEx, offset
by $529 million in sale-leaseback proceeds.
As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.14 per share,
approximately $0.03 above the high-end of our guidance, after you adjust for the impact of the debt refinancing.
GAAP diluted EPS was $0.90 per share. And as Larry said, the EPS beat was driven primarily by better-than-expected
below-the-line performance. But both the PBM and Retail segments performed at or above the high-end of expectations
as well. So, let me quickly walk down the P&L statement.
On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 10.9% to $31.4 billion. Within the segments, net
revenues increased 17.4% in the PBM to $18.6 billion. The significant number of new client starts in 2012 drove
substantial growth over last year, while Medicare Part D was also a key growth driver.
Acquisitions such as Universal American and Health Net, as well as organic member growth are responsible for the
volume increases in Medicare Part D. And we continue to see some drug price inflation, particularly in our specialty
business, which helped to grow revenues over last year. These positive revenue drivers were partially offset by the
growth in the PBM' generic dispensing rate, which increased 500 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 80%.
In our Retail business, revenues increased 5.1% in the quarter to $16.3 billion, driven primarily by strong same-store
sales growth.
Turning to gross margin, we reported 20.1% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately
45 basis points compared to Q4 of 2011.
Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased by 75 basis points versus Q4 of 2011 to 7.2%, while gross profit
dollars increased 16% year-over-year. The increase year-over-year was primarily driven by the big increase in GDR,
higher volumes and better acquisition cost economics. These positive margin drivers were partially offset by client
price compression.
Gross margin in the Retail segment was 31.3%, up 155 basis points over last year. This improvement was again driven
primarily by the 400 basis point increase in Retail GDR to 79.9%. Additionally, we saw a private-label sales as a
percent of front-store volume increase by 20 basis points to 18.1%.
Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues were essentially flat to Q4 of 2011, at 12.7%. The PBM segment's
SG&A rate improved approximately 25 basis points to 1.6%. This was primarily driven by strong revenue growth as
well as improvements derived from the streamlining effort.
In the Retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased by approximately 125 basis points to 21.6%, while
expenses grew by 11.6%. As expected, this was mainly due to the de-leveraging effect of the growth in generics as well
as the fact that we're comparing against disproportionately lower spending in Q4 of last year.

Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $30 million to $182 million. And given all that,
operating margin for the total enterprise improved 40 basis points to 7.3%. Operating margin in the PBM improved
approximately 100 basis points to 5.6%, while operating margin at Retail improved by about 35 basis points to 9.7%.
For the quarter, we beat our growth estimates for operating profit in both the Retail and PBM segments. Retail
operating profit increased a solid 8.9%, exceeding expectations by approximately 90 basis points. PBM operating profit
grew a very healthy 42.9%, some 185 basis points above our guidance range. Both segments benefited from the
positive impact of generics and the increase in GDRs. Additionally, the PBM also benefited from the increasing
profitability as we move through the year in the Medicare Part D business as well as the increasing benefits derived
from the streamlining effort.
Now, going below-the-line on the consolidated income statement; net interest expense in the quarter increased
approximately $12 million from last year to $159. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 37.1%, lower than expected
relating to a non-recurring item. Our weighted average share count was 1.25 billion shares, approximately 12 million
shares lower than anticipated due to our opportunistic repurchase of additional shares in the open market, once the ASR
completed. The tax rate and share count explain the overwhelming majority of our EPS beat.
This, of course, excludes the impact from the debt refinancing. We booked a one-time loss on the early extinguishment
of debt of $348 million or approximately $0.17 per share. This action provides an ongoing benefit in terms of lower
interest expense going forward.
Now let me update you on our guidance, which remains essentially unchanged from Analyst Day, except for the
anticipated $0.02 per share, full year benefit from lower interest expense, again, resulting from the debt refinancing.
And you can find the details of our guidance in slide presentation we posted on our website, but I'll focus on just a few
highlights here.
We currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS in 2013, in the range of $3.80 (sic) [$3.86] to $4.00 per share, reflecting
very healthy year-over-year growth of 12.25% to 16.5%, after removing the impact in 2012 related to the early
extinguishment of debt.
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $3.61 to $3.75 per share. We continue
to expect consolidate net revenue growth of 0.75% to 2%. This guidance reflects solid underlying growth across the
enterprise. And it's important to keep in mind, the comparison we have to the substantial share gains for the
Walgreens-Express Scripts impasse last year, as well as the impact from the continued strong growth in generic
utilization.
As you know, increased generic utilization has a negative impact on revenues, but a positive impact on profitability.
Also keep in mind that our estimate includes one less day in 2013 versus 2012 for leap year.
Guidance for operating profit growth in our Retail and PBM segments remain unchanged. We still expect Retail
operating profit to increase 5% to 6.75% year-over-year, and PBM operating profit to increase 10% to 14%.
We anticipate a significant benefit from the debt refinancing and are now expecting net interest expense for the year of
between $475 million and $485 million, a reduction of approximately $45 million from our prior guidance.
The first quarter guidance remains unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.80 per share,
reflecting growth of 18% to 23% versus the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continued operations is
expected to be in the range of $0.71 to $0.74 per share in the first quarter.
Within the Retail segment, we continue to expect revenues to decline 1% to 2.5% year-over-year, driven by the strong
growth in generic utilization. However, given the strong flu season we saw in January, we are trending closer to the
higher end of our guidance rather than lower end. Operating profit in the Retail segment still is expected to grow 9.5%
to 11.5% during the first quarter, while operating profit in the PBM segment is still expected to grow 24% to 31%.
Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $4.8 to $5.1 billion. And I am very
pleased with our significant cash flow generation capabilities, which continue to play an important role in driving

shareholder value, now and well into the future.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thanks, Dave. And as I said, we're very pleased with our solid enterprise-wide results along with our outlook for
the future. And I think as we've communicated in past meetings, CVS Caremark's purpose is to help people on their
path to better health. It's a very strong motivator across our organization, and with the healthcare environment changing
rapidly, we think that presents many opportunities for our company. Our distinctive model and the strategic growth
framework that we laid out on Analyst Day should enable us to address the changing needs of our customers, clients,
health plans and providers, while capitalizing on our unique assets to enhance shareholder value.
So in short, we'll continue to develop innovative solutions that strengthen our healthcare offering. And we'll continue to
align our business initiatives with our purpose, along with the needs of our growing customer groups. And we think
that will be our formula for long-term success.
So with that, we would be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Thank you very much for taking my questions. And congrats on a great quarter. When we think
about the coming year, I know it's early to really start thinking about the 2014 PBM selling season, I'm just kind of
curious with where you've gotten into the PBM streamlining initiative along with the additional conversions to the
destination platform. Fundamentally, how would you compare going into this year and the capacity for the organization
to take on new business versus where you were last year, heading into April?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Dane. We – I'll start and then, Jon can jump in here. We see no barriers and no
limitations around that. Keep in mind that I had mentioned that about two-thirds of our business is already on the
destination platform. And any new business automatically goes on to that platform. So, there's no conversion activity
associated with that.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: And this is Jon. The other thing I would add is we have a separate team that is working
on the conversion process, totally separate than the teams that implement new business. And we've implemented $24
billion of net new business over the last three years. So, we think we're very well positioned to continue to add new
business and grow as we move forward.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Great. And then one additional question on the SilverScript resolution with CMS. Could you add
any additional color on specific steps that need to be taken or a specific timeline when that could be resolved?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, well, as Larry talked about, we had to consolidate our enrollment systems from
two acquisitions, which was Universal American PDP, Health Net and SilverScript, on the one system, which
unfortunately led to issues with SilverScript's enrollment and claims processing in the January timeframe and an
unanticipated increase in call volumes.
So this sanction is focused on SilverScript's enrollment process. Our remediation plan was submitted to CMS on
January 23 and work is underway to implement the appropriate corrective action.

We have successfully operated these enrollment systems since the inception of Medicare Part D and continue to expect
to do so now that the system consolidation is complete. And we're very focused on working with CMS to correct the
issues and to have the sanction lifted as soon as possible, and we are confident in our ability to address these issues
quickly.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Plead proceed with
your question.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Hi, Larry and Dave. Any change in philosophy on Retail store openings in the U.S.?
What are your targets there? And just comment briefly what, if any, synergies you expect to derive from Brazil from a
cost standpoint.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Rob, in terms – your first question, in terms of our Retail growth strategy, we have no
change in our strategy there. We've talked the last several years about 2% to 3% square footage growth and our pipeline
falls within those boundaries, and we continue to see opportunities for Retail growth here in the U.S.
As far as synergies go it will be very minimal. As we – as I mentioned in my remarks, this transaction is not financially
material. We're talking about 44 stores, and I think it'll be a great learning opportunity for the organization.
Operator
Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Next question?
Operator
Our next question coming from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, you mentioned that you obviously retained at least
60% of the Rx from Walgreens in the fourth quarter. Obviously that's the guidance for 2013 as well. So I guess
whatever the actual rate is, I think you mentioned previously you expected it to stay about the same in early 2013 as it
was exiting 2012 and that the rollover to calendar year wouldn't really change anything or trigger anything that changed
the run rate. So, I'm just curious now, without giving any specific numbers is that indeed the case now to have probably
some read on January? Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Steve, I mean I think as we've talked about this over the last several months. We had
talked about the fact that we didn't see this as being a 12 to 18 month event. That – we believe that we would reach a
steady state run rate towards the end of the year, I think we had acknowledged it. It could trickle into the first quarter
this year. And quite frankly, our retention is – it's actually performing as we had outlined. So, we don't see any change
to the comments that we've made in the past.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Steve.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. On the Retail side of the business, the SG&A growth increased or accelerated a
bit in 4Q versus the prior couple of quarters. I'm interested if you can give a little bit of color on that and then
strategically what you're doing with the drugstore with the Retail business to sustain good performance and further
improve market share in 2013, if you're doing anything different for marketing or for merchandising and promotional
perspective?
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, Eric. This is Dave, maybe I'll address the SG&A question, and then I'll flip it to Larry
or Mark on the broader question on Retail. Really the growth in SG&A in Retail for Q4 was driven by our comparisons
in Q4 of last year. So, if you look at Q4 of 2011, the growth in SG&A was very modest. We're bumping up against
some tough comparisons, so we knew that was going to be the case as we cycled into Q4 of 2012. And so it performed
as we expected, so, no – nothing really new there. And with that, maybe I'll turn it to Mark to talk a bit about the Retail
business.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: Well, the biggest headlines that we talked about at the Analyst Day was around personalization,
and that was really the headline for the quarter, and it's really the headline as we go into 2013, so our whole goal is to
move away from the mass approach and to customize our approach to each individual customer. We're doing that
through how we are clustering our stores, which means personalizing the assortment within each store that was played
out through our urban initiatives over the last couple of years. We have a number of initiatives coming up into 2013 to
take that to a new level, which we talked about a little bit at the Analyst Day.
The other big play coming out of personalization is obviously through our ExtraCare program. As Larry outlined in his
comments, that has been a strength for us for many years, 15 years, and we have a very engaged customer set as
evidenced by the 68% of our transactions and 85% of our sales going through the program.
We ramped that up in a big way in the fourth quarter, and we're taking that into 2013. Larry threw out a couple of
numbers earlier and I think they're indicative of that improved engagement, first the fact that we increased the number
of offers redeemed by 19% over the course of the quarter. That also led – was driven by a big increase in the number of
offers that came through from our e-mail program. We've more than doubled that program to 15 million and increased
the number of offers that went through our e-mail program at 69% to over 600 million offers.
We also had some advancements on the Beauty Club front which rolled out a year ago, but that's dramatically
improved with some new features that we rolled out. We increased that by 21% to 11 million. And as Larry mentioned
in his comments, significant amount of work going through our differentiated ExtraCare center, where we're able to
deliver customized, personalized messages to our customers. And that will play out as we go into 2013 with an
initiative that we call conversion, which allows our customers to shop broadly across the store.
Just most recently, you probably read a little bit; we just introduced this Pharmacy & Health Rewards program, which
we've had in place. Just a little fact, we've had a reward in place for our Pharmacy customers for the last several years
as part of our ExtraCare program, where we had $1 for every two prescriptions. But this most recent program is really
different in the fact that it customizes the message to individuals as opposed to households.
We came up with this program over a year ago. It was tested in five markets and just launched this past week. The big
difference, as I mentioned, it's tied to individuals not to households. We can then trigger the messages directly to
customers and customize the message as such.
We have also slightly modified the program, 10 prescriptions equals five ExtraBucks. And we have many different
ways for our customers to earn those ExtraBucks just beyond the rewards themselves.
So, the big advantage from our customers is more value communicated directly to them. We also believe it will help
their adherence. It's also a great way for us to communicate and retain our most important Pharmacy heavy user
customers.

So ExtraCare, the answer to your question, would be personalization through our conversion programs, through our
clustering programs as well as through our taking ExtraCare to a new level.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. And then if I could just follow-up, the Retail comp in 4Q was quite solid. What you've
talked about for 2013 would be a moderation from that. Can you just sort of square those two facts?
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, keep in mind as you cycle into 2013, you've got a couple of things happening. First and
foremost, you have continued generic GDR expansion, number one. And number two is, you're comping against some
share gains – high share gains as we move into 2013 versus what we gained in 2012. And then finally, you have one
less day in 2013 than you have in 2012, due to leap year.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Okay.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Two quick ones. First of all, just following up on the changes to ExtraCare as
related to the inclusion or the change in the inclusion of prescriptions; can you talk about what the breakeven is or some
sense thereof for the share gains you need to generate, because presumably some of the ExtraCare bucks that are going
to be rewarded are for customers that you're already doing business with. So, what kind of share gain would you expect
you need to generate for this to start to deliver the kind of financial outcome you're looking for?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Matt, I think if you go back to some of the comments that I had made in my prepared
remarks and combine that with what Mark just talked about, through this effort of personalization we're able to get
more granular in terms of where do we make the investments on a customer-by-customer basis.
And so, quite frankly, the breakeven point is very, very low, okay? And it's – you can think of it as reallocating the
investment to where it's going to matter the most, okay? So, it makes the investment very productive from a
profitability point of view.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. That's very helpful. And then secondly, kind of a modeling question, as we think
about the impact of inter-segment eliminations on EBIT, that was a number that increased quite sharply over the course
of 2012. How should we think about – you gave us pretty firm guidance on the revenue impact for 2013. How should
we think directionally about the impact on operating income for 2013?
<A - David M. Denton>: Good question. Clearly, the inter-company eliminations will be driven by the successful
Maintenance Choice program, so the more adoption of that program drives additional eliminations for the company.
Secondly is the growth in the eliminations is also driven strongly by the generic penetration in 2012. As you know,
Lipitor is a very large maintenance drug and that drug was used extensively within the mail order centers. So therefore,
it's a drug that's used heavily within the Maintenance Choice product. And so that disproportionately drove the
eliminations in 2012.
I would not expect to see the same type of growth as you cycle into 2013. But I think if you take our – what we said
from a guidance perspective and walk your way back with – back, you can come up with an estimate of what that
inter-company segment elimination might be.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Fair enough. But you would expect the EBIT – because this year EBIT – the EBIT impact
more than doubled. The revenue half was 19%. You'd expect those two numbers to be closer in sync directionally? And
of course, we'll go back and do the math as pure guidance?

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Greg Hessler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. As I look at the balance sheet, leverage at year end was just
below 2.5 times, which is below your 2.7 times target. And then based on 2013 guidance, this number should continue
to come down next year as well. So, my question is, has anything changed from a financial policy or capital allocation
standpoint?
<A - David M. Denton>: No. It has not. I think we've been very clear from a capital allocation standpoint of how we're
going to use our free cash flow. One, to drive value for our shareholders in really three ways: one, investing in our
business with the appropriate return on invested capital targets and hurdles; two, increasing our dividends; and three,
doing share repurchases that are value enhancing.
And we've all – we've said, we're going to do that within the context of maintaining an adjusted debt to EBITDA
capital structure of 2.7 times. And while that's our target, we know at times we fluctuate higher or lower to that, we'll
stay within that range. It'd be our expectation that we would continue to focus to have our balance sheet and our capital
structure within those tolerance levels as we go forward.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Okay. And then, just in terms of the rating, are you guys – are you still committed to the high
BBB credit rating as well in conjunction with those goals?
<A - David M. Denton>: Very much so. We think it's important for us to maintain our high BBB rating both as we
think about financing the company long-term. But also from a short-term basis, we access the commercial paper market
on – typically on a daily basis. And that's a very efficient means for us to finance the company's working capital. And I
think having a BBB rating is important for that. And also as we think about sale-leaseback activities, I think BBB is
also important for that function as well. So, we're very much committed to that and it certainly is our target.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: You're welcome.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you.

<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Thank you. Good morning. Larry, I know you said.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: I know you said it's early to talk about the 2014 selling season. But can either you or Jon maybe
just one, size – what you have up for renewal; and two, maybe just characterize that the 2014 selling season would you
call it a normal selling season? And the discussions that you're having, I mean obviously reform is coming in 2014. We
have exchanges coming in 2014. What are your current clients thinking around both reform and exchanges as we start
to think about 2014?

Page 13 of 20
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Lisa, maybe I'll start and then I ask Jon to jump in here. But I mean, your first – as it
relates to the 2014 selling season, the amount of business that we have up for renewal is similar to prior years. We've
had about $11 billion to $12 billion up for renewal. And as we've already acknowledged, it is early. I'll let Jon touch on
what his sense of the market is and what he's hearing from clients around the exchanges and how they're thinking about
their employee base.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, so Lisa, when I – and I'll – I have to separate my response in two segments. When
I talk to employers and how they're thinking about the exchanges, I think most of them are in a wait-and-see attitudes
particularly the large employers which we deal with. So, I don't – I think they're going to wait-and-see how these public
exchanges shake out, the private exchanges are seeing some activity primarily in the retiree space.
When we talk to our heath plan clients, they're obviously gearing up to participate in the exchanges, so they're
interested in our assistance around formulary, they like our CVS Retail stores and the ability to market their brand to
consumers.
And then all of our differentiated offerings that we have, Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor, the ability to do
preferred or even restricted networks. So, a lot more discussion around health plans as they gear up to compete in the
space, and that's where you're going to see most of the growth is with the health plans.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Do you think competitive – competitively, Jon, does that help you to win health plan business and
do you see any large pieces of health plan business that are up for renewal for others in 2014 that you say, you know,
this is something I'm going to target because we think we have something differentiated that we can go to them as they
are building out their exchanges?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, I mean we're seeing a lot of interest from health plans where we're the PBM and
we're also seeing interest from health plans where we're not the PBM, because of all of our assets. A little early to talk
about what we're seeing from specific health plans come into marketplace and looking for bids. And there may be some
activity where health plans have a particular PBM, but maybe looking for a different partners as they evolve their
exchange strategy. So, you could see some activity there.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: And then I just had an accounting question, Dave, if I look at the potential impact for Medicare
MLR regulation to the PDP in 2014, how will that impact your PDP business?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, Lisa that's a great question. Quite frankly, it's probably a little early to be able to
answer that. Some of the regulations aren't quite solid yet. I would say that at the end of the day, we'll watch it closely
and we'll update as we see that regulation evolve at this point.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Hi. A couple. Dave, as you think about your 2013 PBM margin comparisons to 2012 what's
the impact on say the ramp of the Aetna contract versus say the streamlining efforts and how should we think about
that?
<A - David M. Denton>: That's a tough question. I think in general listen, we know that both from an Aetna
perspective and from a streamlining perspective, we're very focused on enhancing our performance in both of those
areas as we think over time.

Certainly from a streamlining effort, we continue to make nice progress on improving the SG&A structure of the
organization and aligning from a service perspective the metrics in the organization to deliver day-in and day-out on the
service commitments that we have.
Also I guess from an Aetna perspective, Aetna as it cycles into 2013, they are a net share gainer in adding additional
lives, which will drive additional economics for us. So, at the end of the day, as they are successful in the marketplace
working with us, that is really the opportunity that we have to broaden our partnership and drive value for them and for
us and for the customers that they serve.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: Maybe another way of asking about it. I remember you provided some initial accretion
targets when you signed that big contract, are those still in the ballpark? Are they better? Or are they worse?
<A - David M. Denton>: Those are stale. We said quite some time ago that those were stale in that, there was a lot of
moving parts back then. So, those are not good numbers at this point. We're very focused and very pleased with our
relationship with Aetna and how it's progressing, but you can't look at that.
<Q - John W. Ransom>: I didn't think so. And then the other question, just looking at your front end on the Retail
side, pretty big delta between your large public customers. What's the impact, do you think, of getting 24 million scripts
from ESI? Do you think there has been some bleed over from those customers? And will some of that wane this year?
Or do you think it's disconnected from that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, John, we acknowledged that earlier, that in the fourth quarter, we believe it positively
impacted the front-end comps by about 150 basis points and that was consistent with what we had seen in prior quarters
as well.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, guys a couple of things on Maintenance Choice. Of the 15.8 million lives, how does
that breakdown between 1.0 and 2.0? I know 2.0 is new, so is 2.0 less than 10% of that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, John, we're not going to break that out going forward. I mean, we'll continue to report on
how we continue to grow the Maintenance Choice population, but we're not going to delineate between 1.0 and 2.0.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Well, do you think 2.0 at least near-term, does that generate the bulk of the growth in
Maintenance Choice or no?
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, John, I think as we had outlined, I think at the Analyst Meeting a year ago, we saw 2.0
as being a key factor in our ability at the time to triple the number of lives that would be appropriate for a Maintenance
Choice type program. And...
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Right.
<A - David M. Denton>: ...I think over the past year, we have seen our lives grow by about 5 million from 2011 to
2012, and now we're sitting here saying that we still believe we can double the number of lives that we have, okay?
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And...
<A - David M. Denton>: And it's going to be a combination of the various designs that we have out there.

<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And if somebody signs up for 2.0, how quickly do you think they migrate to 1.0? They
don't have to wait for the next contract?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, I mean they can migrate to 1.0 really at any time. And we've seen some of that
activity and we think that as people get experience with Maintenance Choice 2.0, they actually have an opportunity to
deliver or to generate more savings by moving up to 1.0 as they move more of their maintenance volume into the
Maintenance Choice channel. So, we think 2.0 is a good entrée point for where we are particularly with health plans,
where we've had pretty low penetration of Maintenance Choice, they traditionally have liked open access. We think this
really will play well with the health plans.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly Jon, given that there are now very distinct models out there in
the PBM side, and two of your bigger competitors are still sort of involved in integrations. Are you more optimistic
about 2014 selling season than you might have been a year ago or no, that's reading too much into it?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, listen it's – we're focused on obviously, ensuring when we're going to the
marketplace, we're talking about our differentiated offerings. We think they're resonating in the market. You look at our
success over the last three years, $24 billion in net new business, but it still remains a very competitive market and
we're seeing pricing is – continues to be very competitive. No real change over the last few years but still rational. So,
we'll see how it goes.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Larry, I just wanted to confirm one thing and then ask you my real question. On the Express
Scripts loss of customers, has the pace of the customer loss diminished over the last couple of months or has it been
steady? I'm just trying to clarify something you mentioned earlier?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ed, I think, as you know, as I had acknowledged earlier, it has – the migration that we
have seen has been pretty much in line with what we've expected. And you see more attrition in markets where we
don't have the concentration of stores, okay, where – which we were talking about that six months ago that would likely
be the case, when an agreement was reached. So, we're seeing those dynamics. And as I mentioned, it's pretty much on
target with how we've thought about it and modeled it.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And then my question for you is really related to Brazil. I know it's small and I
certainly appreciate the measured approach to international, but it's a big opportunity, I guess. So, can you sort of walk
us through why you chose this country over others for your first initiative overseas? How is this market different than
U.S.? And if you're successful here, how do you grow? Is this an organic opportunity? Is it further M&A?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ed, as I had acknowledged earlier that it's a maturing marketplace. It has – it's expected to
have continued strong growth for the foreseeable future. As people move up the economic ladder, they are spending
more on healthcare as well as education and with increased access to healthcare and pharmacy, both are expected to
grow over the next several years.
I think one of the other keys for us is the market is receptive to chain pharmacy. Chains are pretty prevalent in the
Brazil market; but at the same time, it's still fragmented. I think the largest player has about a 9% share. So, we see the
opportunity for growth. And Onofre has an organic growth plan that we will certainly be looking to execute on and
there may be other opportunities, acquisition-wise as we move down the road.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Thanks. As you look at sort of where you've been with Walgreens retention over the last two
months or so, I mean, as you look at the places where you've done better versus worse, is it geographically dispersed?
Is there a percentage where if someone signs up for an Extra card, they're much more likely to stay in the store? I'm just
trying to get a sense for kind of where you feel like you've sort of outperformed and areas where you've sort of
exceeded maybe more share and what the key drivers of that have been?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ross, I don't – I'm probably a little redundant now with these comments, but I think you
kind of hit on some of the key points that as we talked about a year ago, the acquisition strategy was developed with the
retention component. So, we work very hard to get those maintenance users enrolled in ExtraCare. And I think if you
reflect on some of Mark's comments earlier, the ability to communicate with them in a very personalized way is a key
element around retention. And then as I just mentioned a minute ago, we certainly recognize the convenience and
locale also becomes part of that retention strategy. So, I don't know that there's anything out of the ordinary that I could
add to your question.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: And maybe just quickly a modeling question on sort of the Pharma Services business, as you
look at sort of the first quarter guidance, it implies a bit more deflation versus the rest of the year. What's sort of driving
the step-up of where we're given the script guidance of where we're going from sort of a more significant decline to
kind of an increase by the end of the year? Is there a portion in the year where you're assuming, given mix, something
is changing from deflation to inflation? I'm just trying to get a little more clarity.
<A - David M. Denton>: We're cycling through the first couple of months, the introduction of a large generics – of
large generics in last year, primarily Lipitor.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Especially Lipitor. Yeah.
<A - David M. Denton>: And so, that's what's driving that inflation/deflation cadence, if you will.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: So, Ross, keep in mind that to Dave's point on Lipitor, we cycle that in June 1. So, first, almost
two quarters.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yep.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Congratulations, guys. Nice quarter.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Meredith.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: I'm losing my voice. I want to go back to just questions about Maintenance Choice 2.0, it's
probably very early, but I'm just wondering what kind of feedback because this is something really unique for these
patients. Is there any feedback coming so far about how they're responding to it? Or is it really just too early?

Page 17 of 20
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Meredith. So, Maintenance Choice from a member perspective, Maintenance Choice 2.0
will perform the same way as our original Maintenance Choice product, Maintenance Choice 1.0. So, the member has a
choice to either go to CVS Retail or to go to mail to get a reduced co-pay. They get a 90-day maintenance script. The
client gets mail pricing. And so, we see about half the members like to go to CVS Retail for their Maintenance Choice
prescriptions and the other half like to go to mail.
And if you look at the penetration for these voluntary mail customers that move into Maintenance Choice, we see – it's
on average, around 15%. And so, as we get this new benefit, we think that that penetration will grow beyond 15%. So
that will generate more savings for the client and offer a benefit to the members at no charge, actually a savings to the
client.
The other thing we're working on is continuing to improve the member experience with 2.0. So, the move between mail
and CVS Retail can be more seamless, it's more of a binary choice now. We see people kind of go to either Retail or
mail and stay, and we're going to evolve our ability to allow them to move much more seamlessly. People are moving
around the country much more now than they used to. So, very positive response, members love it and clients love it
and it's a win-win-win for everybody.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. And then I have a question about specialty. Obviously, specialty costs are just going up
and up and up, and I think there has been more effort by health plans and payors, generally to push more costs on to
patients. Are you – what are you hearing from your customers about that and do you think that will have any kind of
impact on the growth of specialty? Yeah.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Well, if you look at specialty trend, both on the pharmacy side and the medical side it's
growing at 20%. If you look at the pipeline, it's dominated by specialty and if you look at 8 of the top 10 drugs by
2016, it's going to be specialty. So, as we move out of this big generic way, which has delivered tremendous savings
and you combine that with a specialty trend in the double-digits that I described, specialty is becoming the highest
priority for our patients.
PBMs have traditionally managed specialty on the pharmacy side. We've expanded our capabilities to manage it on the
medical side, where really half of the specialty spend is. And we're really going to focus on really three areas to manage
costs for the members; utilization, unit cost and drug mix.
So, our clients want us to manage trend, they want appropriate utilization, but I think you're going to continue to see
significant growth in specialty as we move forward. And we're expanding the piece of the pie that we're managing for
our clients as we move into managing the medical side.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Meredith, We talked a little bit about some of the initiatives that we have underway there and
some of them are in pilot, as we speak. I think that we're all very excited about the ability for these pilot programs to
bring some meaningful solutions to what clients are worried about, and we'll certainly talk about that as we move
forward throughout the year.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Super. Thank you very much.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Meredith.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Good morning. Thank you. My first one is, lot of attention lately on the PDP area within
Medicare drug benefit, and some of the plans that have preferred Retail design. I know you're in some of those, I guess
mostly yourself and Aetna, your plan and Aetna's, and some of the others are in more of the plans out there. Can you
talk about your thoughts around preferred Retail networks, I guess both within Medicare and within the private sector
and some of your strategies there, over and above Maintenance Choice, obviously?

Page 18 of 20
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Tom, I think it's probably important just to level set a little bit in terms of start with the
difference between preferred and narrow/restricted networks. And I think as everybody knows the narrow – in the
narrow/restricted network, there are pharmacies that are excluded in the preferred network all pharmacies can
participate. But the customer is incentivized to use one pharmacy over another in the form of a reduced co-pay.
And then when you start peeling back the onion, all preferred networks are not equal from a co-pay differential, and
you look in the Med D space that could vary anywhere from $1 to $10. And within the Med D population, there are no
restricted networks there are only preferred networks.
So, as you mentioned, there are plans where we're identified as a preferred pharmacy, and then there are plans where
we're not. It's clear that there's going to be some movement between pharmacies. I think it's pretty early to measure the
specific impact, but we're not seen anything at this point that we didn't expect to see. And I think from a Retail point of
view, we're – we are well-positioned to be a participant more often than not and we'll go from there.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Okay. The other question I had, I think is a minor one, but I guess news today. The Postal
Service sounds like it's finally going to stop delivering on Saturdays. Can you just talk about any impact or how you
think about that from a mail order standpoint?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah. Tom, I saw that as well. So, we see a small percentage of our mailings delivered
on Saturday. So, obviously for those deliveries, they're not going to happen and they're going to be pushed to Monday.
I will say that anything that does require Saturday delivery for a member we have other ways of making that delivery
happen. We do that today and we'll continue to do that. So, net-net, I think it's a small impact overall, maybe an extra
day for members, but generally, if mail members aren't waiting for the last day to get their mail prescriptions and I
think the cost impact is negligible.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. We'll take two more questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the
specialty question. I know, you mentioned that you are moving into managing the medical side, can you guys share
with us what's driving this, is it your clients that are asking you to kind of like expand what you're doing with them? Or
is it coming from the health plan that are reaching out to you and asking for your help, given sounds like your
expertise?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Ricky, this is Jon. So, we're actually hearing from both health plans and employer
clients and what they see is that particularly on the medical side, the specialty spend just isn't being managed. And so,
there's an opportunity to leverage our capabilities to help manage what I talked about earlier which is utilization, unit
cost and drug mix. So, significant interest and we're moving rapidly to expand and help our clients in these areas.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then one additional question, your distribution contract is up for renewal this
year. Any thoughts on when you expect to make a decision on that?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ricky, I think as we've mentioned in the past, we – as a matter of policy, we won't comment
on individual contracts. And I think it's widely known we have relationships with both Cardinal and McKesson. And
I'll just say that both of those organizations do a terrific job in servicing the CVS Caremark business.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. And our last question coming from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citigroup. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Thank you much. Thanks for a great quarter. And I'll make sure to make this a good
question. So...
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you, Deb.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: So, you talked a lot today about ExtraCare and a lot of the work you've done on the
card. And can you review for us your capital allocation priorities coming off of such a strong quarter? And how should
we think about your investments in tech, whether in Retail or the PBM side, especially in light of the increased focus
on personalization?
<A - David M. Denton>: Deb, this is Dave. I guess from a capital allocation perspective, I can assure you that we have
adequate capital to invest in the digital and ExtraCare space as needed to drive value for our company and for our
shareholder. And we've laid out I think a fairly clear roadmap over the next several years on how we're going to
enhance all the components associated with those products and services in ways in which we engage members and our
customers more fully. And we will continue to push in this area. I think it's an area that we see opportunities over time
to drive a lot of value.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And Deb – and Deb, I'd just add that that technology roadmap is very much aligned to the
strategic growth framework that we laid out on Analyst Day. And in terms of the support that those initiatives would
require.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Great. And then, how are you capitalizing on the customers who came in to visit
MinuteClinic, and also the – I think you see an unprecedented number of daily levels of flu shots that were
administered, in terms of new patients? And how might you get them to be more regular customers?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, I think, Deb, it is consistent with things that we've talked about in the past. I mean, I
don't know if we've looked at this lately, but we knew that a large percent of MinuteClinic patient visits had not had a
prescription filled at a CVS. That could be based on need or demand, okay, but certainly there is nothing more
convenient than being seen by a nurse practitioner and then getting the script filled, while you're there. And then we
have the opportunities to engage that patient at the point of care, in terms of getting them enrolled in the programs, and
I think our Retail teams do a pretty good job in terms of identifying those new patients and letting them know the
advantages that CVS has to offer.
<Q - Deborah L. Weinswig>: Great. Well, thanks so much, and best of luck.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.
