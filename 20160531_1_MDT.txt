Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, which ended on April 29,
2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments; earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our
performance and outlook.
Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements
and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional
information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the
SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, the reconciliations of any

With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us.
This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, representing growth of 6%, which was at the upper
end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings
per share were $1.27, growing 18% on a constant currency basis.
Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I'd like to recap fiscal 2016. FY 2016 was a transformative year
for our organization, our first full year after closing the largest ever MedTech acquisition. It was a year where, in
addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions totaling $1.5 billion. It was a
year where we launched a number of groundbreaking new products and extended our thought leadership within
value-based healthcare.
We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion, grew at the upper end of our mid-single-digit baseline goal and capped
off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid-single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with
strong progress against each of our three strategic pillars: new therapies, emerging markets, and Services & Solutions.
Our FY 2016 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the
beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We
executed on the Covidien integration synergies delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which
contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY 2016 EPS leverage.
We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points, including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. We
reinvested in R&D organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any dilutive impact to EPS and capitalizing on our
strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in line with our stated strategy and further support the
sustainability of our long-term growth and market leadership.
In FY 2016, we untrapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns for shareholders,
allowed us to pay down debt and increase our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by
25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, well above our
minimum commitment of 50%.
Despite our strong operational performance in FY 2016, our non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4% after including the
$0.47 negative impact of currency. While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking
at natural ways to limit the impact, we do see this as largely outside our control and we feel that over the long term, FX
should balance itself out.
Now, moving to our Q4 performance. 6% revenue growth was very strong, especially when considering this was built
upon a 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY 2015. We continue to outperform the market and the strength of our diversified
portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in Diabetes, CVG and MITG more than
offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG.

Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid-single-digit growth in developed
markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe, and 11% growth in Australia and New
Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our three growth vectors: new therapies,
emerging markets, and Services & Solutions.
In new therapies, we delivered above goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company
growth. In our Cardiac & Vascular Group, which grew 8%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance.
We're helping to create rapidly growing markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, MRI-safe implantable
technology, AF cryoablation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons.
In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in High Power from the ongoing launch of the Evera MRI ICD as well
as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI Quad CRT-Ds. We also saw exceptional growth of over
50% from our TYRX Infection Control product.
In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker,
one-tenth the size of a traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique
single-chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricle using proprietary detection algorithms first
developed for our highly successful Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder.
In CSH, our Resolute Onyx DES saw sequential share gains in Europe, and our Evolut R Transcatheter Valve gained
sequential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market.
In APV, our Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft and Heli-FX EndoAnchor system drove above-market growth. Our
IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon [indiscernible] (7:56).
Over the past two years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry-leading levels of internally driven R&D
productivity across its businesses and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share
more details on what is ahead for CVG at our Investor Day next week.
Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6%, led by strong above-market performance in Surgical Solutions and
low-single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from five key growth drivers:
open to minimally-invasive surgery or MIS, gastrointestinal diseases, lung cancer, end-stage renal disease and
respiratory compromise.
Open to MIS grew double digits in Q4, helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and
Advanced Energy portfolio, including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple
Technology and Valleylab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double-digits with solid
growth in our GI diagnostics business resulting from PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe.
We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam COLON 2 capsule to potentially reach
more patients at risk for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled, largely as a result of the acquisition of
Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions.
Respiratory compromise grew in the upper-single-digits, benefiting from our capnography market development efforts.
We also continue to make progress in bringing our new Capnostream 35 to market in FY 2017.
MITG continues to supplement their businesses with stock and acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently
agreed to acquire Smith & Nephew's highly profitable and fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our
existing global GYN product lines. We expect this acquisition to close this summer.
We also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic or NOK, which I
will touch on later. Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable
earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through
less-invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at next week's Investor Day.

In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products. In Neurovascular, our
Solitaire FR mechanical thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the
rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market even after the anniversary of The New England Journal of Medicine article
last year.
Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, Pipeline Flex in the U.S. and Japan and
Pipeline Shield in Europe continue to lead the market. In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20%s growth in imaging
driven by strong customer demand for new O-arm O2 Surgical Imaging System.
In Advanced Energy, a business annualizing at over $250 million, our Aquamantys System and the PEAK PlasmaBlade
are driving consistent upper teens growth.
In Core Spine, new product introductions across several procedures resulted in a sequential improvement to our growth
rate. Specifically, we're seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated OLIF procedures as well as from the recent
Solera Voyager ELEVATE and PTC interbody launches for TLIF and MIDLIF procedures.
We're also realizing some early benefits from our Speed to Scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables
rapid deployment of these products and procedures to the entire market.
Looking ahead, we're expecting FDA approval for our differentiated two-level Prestige LP artificial cervical disc in FY
2017. Strong seven-year clinical outcome data in the two-level Prestige LP were presented earlier this month at AANS.
As expected, we faced challenges in our Neuromodulation division. While we continue to make progress against our
FDA consent decree commitments, we're still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our
revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for four quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat
going forward.
In DBS and Pain Stim, we're facing increased competition, but as we look ahead, we're optimistic the driver such as
expanded early onset DBS indication in the U.S. that we received earlier this year and new strategies that focus our
Pain strategies in the growing opioid epidemic and improve our Neuromodulation results. On balance, however, Pain
Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters.
As we enter FY 2017, we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger
focus in the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally, we will report revenue results for four divisions
comprising RTG: Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP, and Kanghui businesses; Brain Therapies, which
includes our DBS, which we're now calling Brain Modulation, Neurovascular and Neurosurgery businesses; and Pain
Therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation, and intervention [indiscernible] (13:22) in Pelvic
Health, Advanced Energy, and ENT will be reported externally as the Specialty Therapy division.
As part of these changes, RTG is adopting the general manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a
steady cadence of meaningful innovation in our Cardiac & Vascular Group. Additionally, RTG has aligned its
commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital
administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Geoff Martha will discuss these changes as
well as additional details on his turnaround efforts in Spine and Pain at the Investor Day next week.
In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10%, we continued to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system in markets
where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States, despite having
anniversaried the launch of the MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect, which
is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the user's smartphone.
Regarding our pipeline, we are on track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM sensor to the
FDA before the end of June. Once launched, this will be the world's first hybrid closed loop system.
Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare to be their preferred insulin pump
provider. UnitedHealthcare saw what others, including UK's NICE, have seen; that we are the only company with
evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both

patients and for the healthcare system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in
innovation that drives evidence-based outcomes.
In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro2 Professional
CGM system to Type 2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry
Schein and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm, Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our
Type 2 business.
In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we're on track to launch Guardian Connect in Europe with the current
enhanced Enlite sensor in early FY 2017, and in the U.S. with the next-generation sensor in the second half of FY
2017. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a
standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution.
When you combine our stand-alone Professional CGM product with the applications in cognitive computing
capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients with
not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution.
While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our Diabetes business is well-positioned to drive sustained
growth, and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week's Investor Day.
Our new product pipeline is robust across all four of our business groups, and we are confident that we can drive
sustainable growth for our new Therapies Group vector in the upper half of our 150 to 350 basis point goal.
Next, let's turn to emerging markets. In Q4 we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total
company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver
double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries. This is a result of
continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements, and private
partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance.
Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence on
any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets
represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long term.
In Q4, our businesses in the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe all grew in the
upper teens, and India and China grew in the low double digits. Next week at our Investor Day, you will have the
chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions.
Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our Services & Solutions growth vector contributed
approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis
points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our
growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups.
In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high 20% in Q4, driven by strong growth
within the U.S. Veterans Administration healthcare system. Care Management Services represents an important
platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for
different interventions.
In our Hospital Solutions business, for which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily
administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth in the high 50%.
Since starting this business a little over two years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term managed service
agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an
average span of six years. While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have management contracts with
hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle East and Africa.
We're attracting strong customer interest in hospital solutions in regions around the world and have a full pipeline of
potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the hospital solutions model from cath labs into

operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have already signed 10
operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue, with an
average lifespan of seven years.
We're also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management. One example is Diabeter, a
Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating four
centers providing holistic diabetes care management.
Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric
surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in NOK this month. NOK offers patients an integrated
comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program,
and long-term follow-up. Their approach is highly successful, and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of
expanding NOK's clinics to more countries, providing broader patient access to their multi-disciplinary teams of
specialists in improving patient outcomes.
Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we're uniquely positioning our
business to focus on not just devices, but providing services and solutions across the care continuum. While all of these
services and solutions are still relatively early-stage businesses, they represent important building blocks that we will
use to create comprehensive value-based healthcare offerings where business models will be based on measurable
patient outcomes over specific time horizons. Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver
better clinical and economic value but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models
with providers and payers.
Turning now to the Q4 P&L, we grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18%, and EPS leverage was 1,210 basis points, both
on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies were over $100 million in the quarter, were in line with our
expectation, helped drive a 180 basis point improvement in SG&A, and were a major contributor to our strong EPS
leverage.
In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. The combination of Covidien
synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for
unplanned items. Our non-GAAP operating margin including the negative impact of currency was 30.3%, which was
70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter.
This was a result of three unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin: first, an additional 30 basis points
from the FX impact on inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations; second, a 20 basis point
impact from the one-time purchase accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory; and third, a 20 basis point
impact from higher than anticipated scrap and obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific
unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these
pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to the bottom line.
Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus on M&A investments, meeting our
debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50%
of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, we
expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth. Last June, we increased our dividend by 25%. And we expect
to grow our dividends faster than earnings, with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior-year
non-GAAP EPS in the near term.
Regarding share repurchases, in FY 2016 we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we
announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program, completing a total of $2.3
billion in net share repurchases in FY 2016. We also continued to use our capital to make strategic and disciplined
M&A investments, which must meet our portfolio criteria, namely: the targets must provide a line of sight to improving
outcomes; allow for Medtronic to add value; and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In
addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.

Before going to Gary, I'd like to note that in a transformative year, with a significant number of complex moving parts,
our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication, teamwork and passion that
our 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaken a strategy to transform
healthcare. We don't take lightly the challenges this lofty goal places on our organization. And it has been amazing to
see what our combined organization can accomplish. We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our
partners in healthcare to serve millions of patients around the globe, fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating
pain, restoring health and extending life.
We're building in our track record of delivering consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth. And with every quarter,
we're increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance. While we recognize that we still have a lot of
work ahead of us, we are well on our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage
commitments. We're looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week.
Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar.
Fourth quarter revenue of $7.567 billion increased 4% as reported, or 6% on a constant currency basis, which excludes
the $179 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 60 basis points
to Q4 revenue growth.
Our Cardiac & Vascular group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8%, with all
three divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid-single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to
grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar
mentioned. We have now started U.S. position training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker.
In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30%s and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion.
AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with Arctic Front Advance following the compelling FIRE AND ICE
trial, which was featured as a late-breaker at ACC and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of
Medicine. Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE AND ICE trial on rates of re-hospitalization and repeat
ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late-breaking clinical trials at the Cardiostim Congress.
In coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitive launches due to our
customers' increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets' continued enthusiasm for
the delivery characteristics of Resolute Integrity in the U.S., and our expanding use of CVG multi-lining contracts in
many geographies around the world.
In transcatheter valves, we are seeing strong growth and expect this market to grow to $4 billion to $4.5 billion by
2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3 from not having a large size Evolut R. We have started our
Evolut R XL clinical, which is a 60-patient 30-day follow-up trial.
In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment of – in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval.
And we are moving into continued access for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers. In Q4, we also
saw a strong acceptance of core valve in Japan, following the first full quarter of launch. In peripheral, we had a
number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month at Charing Cross,
including mechanisms-of-action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions.
We also received FDA approval for a change in – to the IN.PACT labeling, removing requirement for pre-dilatation,
and replacing it with simply – with simple appropriate vessel preparation. This labeling change now position Medtronic
as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as
combination therapy for SFA disease.

Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales, grew revenue 6%. We
continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S., and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most
recent quarter, with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus the 1% to 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal
year. We are seeing stronger mid-single-digit growth in U.S. outpatient surgery market, while inpatient surgeries are
growing in the low-single digits.
In PMR, quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 Ventilator and the Capnostream 20 capnography monitor had
a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this
summer.
Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 3%, with strong
growth in Neurovascular and Surgical Technologies and an improved result in Spine, which offset low-single-digit
declines in Neuromodulation. Our U.S. core Spine business declined 1%, a large improvement over the past two
quarters. We estimate the U.S. core Spine market is growing 2% to 3%, so while we lost share year-over-year, we did
gain over 100 basis points of share sequentially. We expect Spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters.
In Europe, we continue to be affected by the ship hold on our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of
approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the
issue sometime during Q3 FY 2017. In Neuromodulation, it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the
divestiture of the intrathecal baclofen drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8
million per quarter.
Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales, grew revenue 10%, with strong broad-based
performance across all three divisions. It is worth noting that the Diabetes Group double-digit growth came in the face
of a competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building diverse revenue streams
through geographic expansion and growth in our new businesses.
Products like MiniMed 640G System, with Enhanced Enlite sensor and SmartGuard technology help drive growth
outside the U.S., while our non-intensive Diabetes Therapy and Diabetes Services & Solutions divisions also contribute
to overall performance. And while we expect a tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA
approval for our MiniMed 670G Hybrid Closed Loop system, we believe there are sufficient drivers to continue to
deliver high-single-digit and low double-digit global growth in our Diabetes Group.
Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant
currency basis, after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP
diluted earnings per share was $0.78.
In addition to the $348 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to
earnings on an after-tax basis were a $118 million charge related to the retirement of $2.7 billion of debt; a $97 million
debt restructuring charge; an $85 million charge for acquisition-related items; and a $44 million impairment charge
related to an investment in Biocontrol.
The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency
improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the one-time Bellco acquisition
inventory step-up and negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin
would've shown a 260 basis point constant currency improvement, which fell in the range of our expectations. It is
worth noting that ASP declines were in line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.
Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4%, all on a constant currency
basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency
gains of $102 million, primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower
than the prior year.
Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market
currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged,

especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings.
Below the operating profit line, Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast.
At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments,
of which, approximately $5 billion was trapped. In Q4 we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt, utilizing a
portion of the $10 billion of cash that was untrapped in a transaction last September.
Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6%. This was an improvement to our forecast and
included an approximate $40 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with foreign net
operating losses from our Interventional Spine business.
In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to timing on certain items, but
we expect it to recover going forward. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to
shareholders and are also continuing to target an A credit profile. In Q4 we paid $531 million in dividends and
repurchased $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorizations to repurchase
approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.416 billion
shares.
Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal – initial fiscal year 2017
revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the
mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis. For FY 2017, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be
in the upper half of the mid-single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis, constant week basis, which
excludes the estimated negative 150 basis point annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY 2016.
Assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a €1.11 and a ¥1.10,
our FY 2017 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 million to $75 million, with modest FX
headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year.
In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% to 6% annual revenue outlook range on a
constant currency basis, constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative six
percentage point impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY 2016, as well as a
negative $25 million to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in
the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately $225 million to $250 million of targeted value-capture
synergies from the Covidien acquisition. While the expected FX impact on our earnings per share from our unhedged
currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by an increased expected FX impact
on inventory. Given this, assuming current exchange rates remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, foreign
currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY 2017 earnings per share.
Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on a constant currency basis, after taking
into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY 2016. For the first
quarter of FY 2017, we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis, constant week basis to be
around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range.
However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share growth to be slightly down, given
the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 impact of
FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would
be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.

Thanks, Gary. And while I have more to say next week at the Investor Day, I did want to take the opportunity to
recognize Gary's service to Medtronic today, in what is his last earnings call as Medtronic's CFO. Gary has served in
this role for the past 11 years. And since May of 2005 has been with – since May of 2005 and has been with Medtronic
since 1989.
Now, Gary has been a constant counsel to me during the time that I've been here, and his experience and knowledge
and overall guidance has been critical and invaluable to both me and our overall team, as we've navigated through a
very complex environment. Gary's expertise will be missed, but he will still stay on as IT and Operations leader, at least
for a little while. And we'll still have the benefit of his strong counsel. More on that in Investor's Day.
And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. And in addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our
Cardiac & Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha,
President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We
want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question, and if
necessary, a related follow up. If you have any additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations
team after the call.
Operator, first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning. Sure.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Let me just try and clarify a few items. So one, could you just maybe make a little bit
clearer for us the FY 2017 guidance? What does that assume in terms of your margins? Second, I think, I understood
the commentary on the first quarter. Basically, you're saying down slightly on a reported basis, so, let's call it $1.02 –
$1.03. I just want to clarify that. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. I'll let Gary take this one. Go ahead.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: As far as FY 2017 margins, we would expect, going forward, based on the assumption,
obviously, of the earnings per share on a constant currency basis growing 12% to 16% as we indicated, that the
operating margins would obviously continue to improve similar to what you saw in the current year. Obviously the
synergies from the Covidien integration, as we indicated in the call, would be a little bit less for next year, but the
operating leverage from the rest of the business would be, obviously, a little bit more as we move into the FY 2017
period of time.
So operating margin improvement, we're not getting specific on that, but basically the assumption would be, Mike, that
we're assuming a 12% to 16% constant currency earnings per share growth. You're going to see a similar kind of
growth in operating margins, similar to probably what you saw in the current year, as we model things. As far as the Q1
guidance, what we're trying to indicate in the call is that yes, being in kind of that upper end of the range would –
taking in effect the extra week, et cetera, I think you're probably – the $1.02, $1.03 you mentioned is probably right in
that – well, within that range, as far as what people should probably be assuming.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And, Gary, I was asking on the FY 2017 margins, because the incremental inventory hit on
– from FX, I'm just trying to think about the actual impacts on reported margins for the year.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, yes.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: I would assume that FX is going to negate that, right?

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, I agree. It will be. You're right. On a constant currency basis, we'll continue to see the kind
of improvement. The FX impact in the first quarter of $0.06 to $0.08 reflects that we are going to still see more FX on
the inventory in that number. We saw a little bit higher number here in Q4 than what we had originally expected, and
that's what we – based on our guidance at this point. Obviously, if that number continues to get even worse, that could
be a different issue. But right now, I think it will be a slight negative – or mitigate, I should say, some of the operating
leverage we're getting on a constant currency basis, as we saw during the current year. But we would expect to see, on a
constant currency basis, that would continue. But as reported, you're right. It might be less of an impact in Q1.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: Okay.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Mike.
<Q - Michael Weinstein>: And then, Omar, for you, maybe just two questions. So one, the commentary around
surgical volumes is obviously consistent with what we've seen from companies reporting from across the sector over
the last month as well as not just device companies but hospital companies. Can you just talk? Was the commentary
about the uptick in surgical volumes consistent over the course of the quarter, being this is something that you've seen
even in April and maybe into May, if you have insight into that?
And then second, I was hoping you could just comment on the Diabetes business because your international
performance was exceptionally strong this quarter, and just trying to look forward to what's going to play out in the
U.S. once you get 670G approved here. Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay, just a few words, and then I'll let both Bryan and Hooman give you some more details.
First, I think we saw a steady improvement in surgical volumes through the course of the quarter, and I'll let Bryan
comment in a minute on the continued outlook. Why don't you take that, Bryan, and then I'll check on Diabetes? Go
ahead.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: I don't know that I would give specificity in the quarter, but I would say the same thing. Across
the quarter we saw more volume growth than what we had seen in the last few quarters. We use a bunch of data points
to be able to get to that. One of the big data points that I personally use is calling our sales reps because they're out in
the operating room, and they see the number of cases. And there's a definite feel that there was an increase in volumes
during the quarter. Now, until I see it for another couple of quarters, I'm not calling it a trend. It's one quarter, but it
certainly felt nice in the quarter.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And with Diabetes, I'll let Hooman comment. Obviously, we're very excited about the
potential of the Hybrid Closed Loop system. But I also want to draw your attention to much of the commentary around
our broader-based efforts. That is one aspect of our growth in Diabetes. I think we're very excited about what we can do
about overall patient management and in our agreements that we can make with major stakeholders, such as payers like
we did this last quarter. But, Hooman, do you want to say a few words?
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Yes, sure. Thanks, Omar. Hey, Mike. I would concur with what Omar said. I think if you
take a look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong. It was largely driven by OUS revenues and the 640G
product. And I think it just shows you what kind of uptake we can get with a new product launch.
The U.S. continues to be competitive, and here we have a product that was launched in September of 2013. And so we
don't have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product, like we do in Europe. But I think this underscores a couple things.
One is what Omar said, is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse. And we are seeing more traction
from OUS revenues, from emerging market revenues and from, call it, non-Type 1 revenues with Type 2 in Services &
Solutions.
The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next-generation platform here in the United States, we can
expect some great results. The traction we're seeing in Europe and the feedback that we're seeing on our new pump
platform is great. We expect to see that here in the United States once it's launched. So as we get the 670, we think
there's going to be really strong uptick there. And as you heard from the commentary, things are on track with respect
to that.

And then finally, the last point I would make is that between now and when the next-generation pump comes out,
Mike, we've got a lot of assets that we can leverage within the Diabetes business in the U.S. The size of our sales force
is the largest. The size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We've got the largest scale and service
infrastructure for patients. We've got deep and broad payer relationships. And on top of that, we've got a growing Type
2 and Solutions business here in the United States. So we feel good. Even though the competition continues to intensify
in the U.S., we feel good about our overall global performance. And then once things come with a new product, we feel
very, very good.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: A few quick questions here. Hi, guys. First question here, just to reconcile fiscal 2017
guidance and non-op items, your free cash guidance for next year is very strong. I wondered if you could update us on
two points. One is just the size and timing of anticipated buybacks in the guidance, as well as the potential tax rate for
fiscal 2017. And I had a couple of quick follow ups.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Go ahead, Gary.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: As far as the free cash flow or the guidance that we're giving of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for
next year is in line what we're expecting from our operating earnings growth and then continued focus on working
capital. So that expectation we do expect, as we've indicated previously, and we'll talk about it at the investor meeting,
that our free cash flow will continue to grow very nicely, probably close to the double-digit range similar to the
earnings as we go forward. So we're feeling confident about that.
We're not getting specific, obviously, about what we're doing with share buyback. But as we indicated previously,
when we announced the incremental buyback, and if you watched historically, we tend to do that. We said we're going
to be more front-end loaded on that, and so I think you could assume the same thing as we go into FY 2017; that it's
more front-end loaded than towards the back half of the year, but we're not getting specific about how much we're
going to be including in that piece of it.
So as far as tax rate goes, there's obviously the benefit of the R&D tax credit catch-up during the current year. If you
take that out of the equation going forward, we haven't provided any specific guidance on tax rate, but we basically are
saying that our tax rate is going to be relatively flat with where we're currently at. So I wouldn't expect any significant
uptick or reduction.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay. And then just – that's very helpful, Gary. Thank you, and then maybe just a follow up
or two here. Omar or Gary, there has been a lot of focus, as you know, on quarterly margin performance. But the
message that we've gotten from senior management is that there's a long-term margin opportunity here. Can you talk a
little bit about your confidence and long-term margin assumptions here, why you believe that double-digit earnings
probably can sustain itself for a few years? And I think about the Covidien synergy number you gave today, $225
million to $250 million certainly gets you to an $850 million number in a few years, but it may not give you above that
$850 million number. So what's giving you the confidence that you can deliver this maybe double-digit earnings for

longer?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: A number of things. And at the Investors Day, it will be definitely a core subject because we
want to explain this to you in detail. But look, it starts with our revenue growth. So you've got to get to our
mid-single-digit revenue on a consistent basis, otherwise you've got a big hill to climb here. So revenue growth has to
be sustainable and has to be consistent. And that is something that we're feeling, as I said, better and better about.
Having said that, then we need operating leverage, like you said, and that in the short term comes from the Covidien
synergies. But what the Covidien synergies do is it builds a platform for us from which we can continue the same work.
As we keep growing, taking advantage of our scale in our functional costs primarily, we think we've got productivity
that has a long tail, a long tail that we can continue to do.
And in addition to that, our product cost reduction will also have good sustainability as we consolidate our
manufacturing operations, which we really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million
number, because we felt that that would take longer than the initial three-year period in the interest of preserving
revenue and not taking any risks. That's why we didn't jump into that. But what it does is it gives us continued
sustainability beyond the three-year period.
Those are the two main things. It's an area of extreme focus for us. And we think it's very important for us to build a
plan that's sustainable and that's diversified in a way that is reliable. And we'll walk you through a lot of those at the
Investor Day, but that's essentially our thinking.
<Q - David Ryan Lewis>: Okay, thanks so much, Omar. I'll step back in queue.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks. Thanks, David.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: We'll go to the next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wanted just – go over to the CVG
business for a second. And maybe you could talk in a little bit more detail about the performance of the Transcatheter
Valve business and help us understand the path to returning to market-type growth in the U.S., and maybe what you're
seeing specifically from an end market growth perspective, how that's evolved since ACC, and highlight your relative
competitive positioning?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yes. So first, the overall growth of the market is at the high end of the ranges that we had
been speaking about in prior quarters. So, the global market appears to be growing in the mid-30%s. Our reported
growth this quarter was in the high 20%s. I think, the primary difference between our growth and the market growth is
the performance of the large valve segment of the Evolut R. We don't have available yet the 34-millimeter version.
When we do get that product, we would expect to be able to have its share of performance perform like the other three
sizes do and provide us with share growth opportunities. So that would be the primary current dynamic.
In terms of overall market growth, obviously, both international and U.S. growth is well above, as I said, high end of
where we have been thinking the market would go. We think the positive data in the intermediate segment that has
been available, A), from our competitor, and B), from our own sub-analysis of our high-risk data bodes well
[indiscernible] (52:52 – 52:57) essentially an expectation that by the time we get to 2021, we should be looking at a
market that is around $4 billion, with some modest penetration of the low-risk segment, And of course, we've now
started clinical trial activities in that low-risk segment. So I think that would be our picture of the market currently.

<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. Maybe just to follow up on the P&L, clearly you've elected not to give segment
margin, P&L margin guidance or modeling help, whatever you want to call it, for 2017 versus what you've given in the
prior years. And given the investor focus on those metrics, it's certainly very clear about how to think about this for FY
2017, that the context should be essentially stable-ish to maybe slightly down gross margins, leverage on the SG&A
line. You have this dynamic with other expense, giving you modest reported operating margin expansion, a flat tax rate
and down share count is what gets you to the $4.60 to $4.70. Are those the right moving parts to think about in the
model for FY 2017?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: That's pretty good.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes. Without giving any model...
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: You figured it out.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I think you've summarized it well. Again, we're trying to focus on what the two levers that we
are driving, revenue and the bottom line, and the leverage we talked about there. But you're right. To achieve the
constant currency earnings growth that we highlighted here, we're going to have to continue getting operating margin
improvement, which we expect with not only the Covidien integration synergies, but clearly, with what the other
operating leverage components we're driving.
The gross margin, the only comment I'd make to your comments is I'm not so sure that the gross margin will be down.
It's possible it will be on an as-reported basis because of FX, but the reality is we are expecting some of the operating –
assuming some of our synergies to start to be coming in manufacturing line. And so, it's possible you could see the
gross margin being flat to maybe even slightly improving. But that's probably the biggest fluctuation we saw here in
Q4. So, I think, your assumptions for next year, the way you laid it out, is probably not a bad assumption right now
until we can actually show that we can improve the gross margin a little bit.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: And just to be clear, I was laying that out on an as-reported basis just to reflect...
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yup.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: ...the numbers that are going to end up in consensus, because that's where we're all so
myopically focused right now. So that's why we're saying down on a reported basis.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: I agree.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: But operating margin slightly better on a reported basis year over year.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: That's right. Yes. That's right.
<Q - David Harrison Roman>: Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, yes.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Great. Good morning. So, one – two questions, one looking backwards and one
looking forwards. First, looking backwards, Omar, I'd love to get your take on something. You guys have really been
performing very well on the top line. But over the last two quarters, you kind of struggled to get to your goals on
operating margins. And I just wanted to get your take on that. I mean, is this a case where you're just not quite giving
yourself enough room with guidance to account for the normal fluctuations that you see, or are synergies maybe
expected a little bit more? Just wanted to get your take on the last two quarters from an operating margin perspective.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think it really is the guidance being too tight. I mean, look, our main area of focus is the
overall EPS. And we felt that we had all these moving parts that we're to balance and then get to an EPS number. That
tight of a guidance that we have talked about before was really directional in building to the overall EPS. And if there's
not that – if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line, we would never have
given such a tight range. I mean, the sorts of things that happened, there was no way in which we could've predicted
them.
And with things like the Bellco acquisition and its map, we hadn't really done that accurately, because we just closed
the acquisition like a week before we – the earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became
obvious, and there were pressures. And it's absolutely the right thing to do for the long term. And it's extremely
accretive, been a positive deal for us. But on an immediate, three-month basis, you can get surprises.
So, really, our guidance should have been more thought through. And we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal
is the right way to look at our company. Because it's a company with a lot of assets and capabilities, and we think that
if it can grow mid-single-digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of
free cash flow to shareholders on a consistent basis, I mean, that's a pretty good deal, if you can do that at a constant
currency level. Gary, do you want to say a few words...
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes, Bob, I think, you said it well. In hindsight, we would have realized how much focus was
going to be on the operating margin line, we would've – we're probably – clearly, we've given a broader range when we
were talking about that at the end of our Q3 earnings call. A 30 basis point range that we gave on an as-reported
number, where the FX and everything else moving 30 basis points is $20 million-some on – and a $7 billion company
with FX and all these moving parts. That was my mistake. We should not have done that. But we didn't realize the
focus everyone was going to have on it.
And the reason, I think, we were trying to address it and get it out there for the modeling was exactly that. It's not that
we're not getting the synergies. In fact, if anything, the Covidien synergies and the other operating leverage we're
getting across the organization, we feel very good about, and we're tracking that on a very tight basis. It's the other
moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this that we get specific on certain line items is creating an
issue. And so what we're trying to do, as Omar said, is focus on we're driving the top line, we have plenty of levers,
including all the cost synergies that we are achieving to drive the bottom line. But in general, there's going to be some
moving parts in the middle. And we were way too specific in Q3 on a tight range on the operating margin. And that
was my mistake.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And these moving parts we hope to offset at the EPS level, because then that gives you the full
flexibility to be able to do that. So, that's the way in which we are modeling our business.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Okay, thank you for that. That's helpful. And then one other question, kind of looking
forward on the 2017 guidance. First, are you going to provide any longer-term directional guidance at the analyst day
on the 6th?
And then secondly, it just seems like since the last – on the Q3 call, you gave some preliminary thoughts on 2017. And
it seems like what you're doing today is just sort of narrowing that range with a few moving pieces. But as I look across
the business there are a couple things that it would suggest have gotten better. I mean, you've done a deal that looks a
little bit accretive, you did a refinancing that looks a little bit accretive, so I might've thought the EPS guidance would
be a little bit higher. So, I just wondered if you could comment on those two things. Any long-term thoughts, and just

maybe some thoughts on the 2017 guidance?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: We'll certainly discuss the long-term strategy at the Investors' Day, so just hold on for a week
for that one. And in terms of the guidance, look, like we just mentioned earlier, there are a lot of moving parts here, and
we've been burned by FX before. And so, we just want to be reasonable in our approach, and that's the most accurate. I
mean, it's not overtly conservative nor, is it overtly aggressive kind of an estimate that we gave. It's a fairly broad
range. And obviously, we do our best to maximize performance. That's really the best I can do there with that range.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yes. And, remember, Bob, at the Q3 call, we really didn't give any guidance for FY 2017, we
just remembered – said, remember these factors as far as when you're putting together your thoughts for FY 2017. And
I think we basically have come in. As you said, we've tightened up a little bit from that as far as where we're at. FX has
been moving around. If you look at it even just a few weeks ago, it was probably not $0.05 benefit from where we were
talking about. It was going to be as much as another $0.03 or $0.04 higher than that. But then that the dollar strengthens
again a little bit. So, we're just – we're being somewhat cautious, because as Omar said, FX has continued to be a
headwind for us, and we expect that in next year.
You're right. From an operating perspective, things are going very well. The revenue is strong. We're getting the
operating leverage we would expect, but there's also a lot of still moving parts. We still have a lot of integration efforts
we have to get done. We're going live with SAP in Europe for the Covidien entity this week. So, it's – there's just still a
lot of moving parts. And we think the range we've given is consistent with what we've communicated before and
consistent with our long-term strategy.
<Q - Robert Adam Hopkins>: Thank you.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: Thanks, Bob. Next question, please?

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask first
question on organic top line growth guidance that you provided for fiscal 2017. It's a little bit of a tighter range than
we're used to. Clearly, you're confident in the lower end of the range at north of 5%, but can you just help us think
about how you set the top end of the range at 6% and whether you're leaving some conservatism in guidance and what
needs to happen in order to get to the – above that top end of the range?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: We need to deliver what we talked about first, so before we think about going above that.
Look, first of all, the range is tighter. That's true, and we did emphasize the words given current trends. We are overall
committed in the mid-single-digit range and we feel that given our performance and given the diversity of our portfolio,
we can get to the upper half of that range like we've discussed. And we need to first deliver that consistently before we
talk about meaningful upside beyond that.
Like I've mentioned in previous calls what our trigger, any thought of consistently delivering over that would be a fee
instead of overachieved on each of our growth drivers; new therapies, Services & Solutions and emerging markets for a
few quarters in a row. Only then, we'll have confidence that more than 6% is sustainable. You'll get the odd quarter
where we do better, but you'll get some pressures in other quarters. So I don't want to bank on that yet.
Like you said, it is a tight range and it's something that we internally did debate about. But given the trends and the fact
that we've been holding that level of performance over a significant period of time, sort of makes us feel reasonably
confident that it's something that we can achieve and it's not something – the best response I can give on that one.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Okay, thanks. And just a question on longer term margins, as the Services & Solutions
business continue to contribute to the revenue base and top line growth in more meaningful levels, can you just talk
about how we should think about that contribution's impact to margins as we move forward into fiscal 2017, 2018 and

beyond?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: We will lay some of that out in the Investors Day, but essentially, as you point out, Services &
Solutions net operating margin on its own is usually lower than what we get from a device perspective. However, in
almost all of these transactions and agreements that we make, there is a device component that gets attached to it and
we get incremental overall revenue. And we find that, overall, our operating margin dollars go up significantly as a
result of these transactions.
And then, as we go forward, we expect to see productivity from those Services & Solutions arrangements, both from
the services themselves, but also from, hopefully, lower cost of sales on some of those accounts offer support sales.
That's the way we're looking at it.
It's something that we feel that we have to cover in our overall model and yet deliver the EPS that we're talking about.
And that's where we're focused on and use every other variable that we have to cover for that because we do think that
the Services & Solutions gives us a sustainable long-term growth, which is very sticky. And besides that, it's something
that our stakeholders and customers want. So it's something that we're going to manage from our overall business
perspective and not get too kind of line item-focused on that one.
Do you guys want to add anything to that?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: No, I think you said it, Omar. In and of themselves, the Services & Solutions business has a
lower margin just by its very nature, but the reality is there's benefits that also benefit the rest of the company from
those Services & Solutions that actually can potentially help leverage some of the margins on those sides of the
equation. So it's a little bit of a headwind especially here in the near term as Omar said. But as we get those more and
more efficient at it, we get more productivity out of it in general, we don't think it will have a huge impact on our
overall operating margin. And obviously, it will help solidify and give us more sustainability in our overall revenue
growth and even in our overall shares.
So we feel good about the prospect overall and how it increases the bottom line growth, but you're right in and of
themselves. Those contracts, the Services & Solutions component has a slightly, obviously, lower margin than the rest
of the business.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think that is an important point. If I can just follow up just to give you specificity. We just
did this acquisition of NOK in the Netherlands. That's a business where – which does bariatric surgery as well as other
service support areas. And the net operating margin of that business is lower than our average but sort of reasonable.
When you layer in our surgical devices into those contracts in a consistent basis, that drives up our volume on very
high-margin devices which gets coupled to this transaction, and therefore, increases the overall margin rate
significantly in those kinds of accounts from what NOK originally had. And so that's the kind of thing that we think we
can scale around the world and get significant benefit.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Thanks, Josh.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Thank you.
<A - Ryan Weispfenning>: We'll take two more callers, please. Next question.

<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just want to go back to your earlier comments about
surgical volumes. I was curious if you had any thoughts around what's driving the incremental improvement. Is it
economy or coverage or products? Where do you attribute some of that improvement to?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Given that it is consistent with what all the hospitals are reporting, I've got to say that the
overall healthcare demand, if you like, in the U.S. is something that is on an upward trajectory. That's got to be the
fundamental reason. And it's probably – some of it is just natural demographics which provide this. The other is
probably we're seeing some of the impact of the Affordable Care Act and although the initial pieces of increased
coverage might have been more upstream in nature in diagnostics and so on, some of these will lead to more
procedures.
Those are the only things that I can intelligently talk about, other than that, just what we experienced. It is not
something that is easy to predict to be fair, and we look at all kinds of different factors and then do the best we can. We
have leading indicators. We talk to people and we get a sense for it, but everything that I just said was close to
conjecture on my part.
<A - Bryan Hanson>: I'd say the same. It's very difficult even to get – because you've got to go to different data points
and triangulate just to get a sense for what's happening to the volumes, to go deeper levels than that and understand
why it's difficult to make assumptions, but it's very difficult to pinpoint the specific reason.
The other thing that I would reference beyond just the increase in overall volumes, the other thing that we're seeing is a
mix shift, a much greater growth in the MIS procedures versus open. And this is pretty consistent when I look at other
players in the marketplace and I look at their revenue growth in the quarter. So I'm really happy about that. And
truthfully, that's probably the bigger opportunity. A small uptick in surgical volumes in the U.S. versus a real change in
mix shift to MIS, I'll go with the mix shift to MIS all day long. And that's pretty consistent again with what we've seen,
what our reps are telling us, and what we're seeing from other companies that are playing in the same space. That to me
is really the story.
<Q - Matthew Taylor>: Thanks, and just one on Spine. You did a little bit better this quarter. You were flat. Can you
talk about your overall strategy there? You recently announced this deal with Mazor. Can you talk about some product
flow and other improvements that could help Spine this year?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure. We detailed some of that in the commentary, but I'll let Geoff comment on that directly.
So go ahead, Geoff.
<A - Geoffrey S. Martha>: Yes, sure. So hitting the Mazor deal, we are very excited about that. That is, I'll call it, one
leg of a multi-pronged strategy around what we call surgical synergies. And we feel as we move out into the future,
these surgical synergies will be into Spine, our calling card.
We've got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging. We're excited about the partnership in
robotics with Mazor. And then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide and to differentiate spine
procedures, both economically and clinically, and the surgeon experience – low radiation, just easier surgical
procedures, et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our Spine business. And so as you move forward, this is going
to – this isn't five years from now. This is going to take place quarter over quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So
this is something we're very excited about.
And as we forward outside of surgical synergies, we do have a number of products. Starting in our FY 2014 – FY 2015,
our Spine business has put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio. And the products that are hitting the
market now, our ELEVATE cage, for example, Voyager is another one, and this quarter launching our new OLIF
procedures. I'm calling them our second-generation OLIF procedures. We're getting a terrific uptick in these things.
My only regret is that two quarters ago when we're planning, we didn't plan aggressively enough because I think we're
hitting our maximum with sets. And if we had more sets, we'd even see more growth. So that's something that we're
factoring into our planning going forward is to be a little bit more aggressive.

But those are from a product standpoint and then from what we call surgical synergies standpoint, things are looking
very good for our Spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter we've improved over the last five
quarters, and it's a big shift. It takes a little bit of time to change the direction. And you should continue to see
continued improvement quarter over quarter.

Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Hi. Thanks, everybody.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: I hope you all had a happy Memorial Day weekend. I had a couple of questions. I just wanted
to go back to the RTG and the new reporting divisions. Is there anything I guess to be said for the four different
businesses? Is it more just alignment with the underlying surgeons, or is it just to facilitate maybe better structure to
improve the performance? How should we think about this? I'm just curious if it has anything to do with just perhaps
isolating Spine and perhaps thinking about it as maybe less core.
<A - Geoffrey S. Martha>: No. Actually, it's not isolating Spine. It's the other way around, actually. So, Kristen, there
are a couple changes going on and we'll get into this next week. But just as a summary, one, moving into these different
reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease state or condition versus technology,
and the example I'll give is Neuromodulation. That was the business largely held together based on technology, an
implantable stimulator.
And from whether it be Gastro/Uro, which we're now calling Pelvic Health or whether it be DBS or Pain Stim, they're
all calling on different physicians, specialties. And we really felt we would get more traction if we organize by disease
state versus by technology. So that's going to help us, one, focus on the physicians appropriately; and two, innovate
because when we're innovating, we're looking across the disease state and across the care continuum rather. So that's
one change.
And the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving to this general manager structure. So that
gets to more execution, and this is something that CVG has done over the last four years, five years where you're
having GMs that are 100% focused, general managers that are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that
they serve and those products within that therapy segment and so making your businesses smaller, more focused, and
granular. So that's another component of that.
And then along with this, we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG. And many of the leaders that are
now running the group are top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure,
this disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and then new players, proven players from
other areas in Medtronic, we feel very good as we hit FY 2017.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: And again to clarify the Spine comment, look, this is a specific Spine customer. And the only
thing that we did is remove Interventional from it and that is not the same customer. It made a lot more sense to group
that together with Pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies and we were missing the big picture look at Pain by
splitting up all the different very significant non-opioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease-based look
and a look at our customers, and that will drive innovation and will drive a clearer picture of how we go to market with
our sales force. And then it finally leads to value-based healthcare, driving for outcomes. This is the only way in which
we're going to do it.

<A - Geoffrey S. Martha>: Another thing on Spine is regarding surgical synergies, as you know, the enabling
technology platforms fit in what we historically called Surgical Technologies which that component of it is now in our
Brain business, so nav and imaging. We actually built a small Surgical Synergy team which is a bridge between that
business and our Spine business, and looking at an integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out and
that also works for DBS as well.
So before, we had two separate businesses that weren't linked quite close enough in my humble opinion to drive the
Surgical Synergy benefit. So we put a small team that includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that
integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition.
So just in Q4 alone, we had 15 new kind of combined capital equipment, Spine, core metal deals, which is significantly
more than we've had in the prior three quarters combined and this is something that is a result of that. And as we move
forward, you'll see the technology roadmap more integrated. So, we've actually built a little bit of a bridge between
Spine and our capital equipment business.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: So taking the structure that was successful with CVG and kind of overlaying that to...
<A - Geoffrey S. Martha>: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on Diabetes, I saw today the announcement or I guess it's
maybe last week with Qualcomm with Type 2 diabetes.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes, yes.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Maybe if you could just, sir, have Hooman kind of expand a little bit more that. It's been
interesting to see more of the emphasis on Type 2. This seems to be kind of very early stage. When might a product
like this kind of come out or just kind of how should we think about what to, I guess, look forward to next week?
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Yes, sure. Hi, Kirsten. Look, we continue to be excited about and focused on our Type 2
business. This is a new business unit that we put in place a little over a year ago. And we'll talk to you about the
product roadmap next week at the Investor Day session, so you'll get more insight there.
But suffice it to say that our focus within Type 2 – first, the Type 2 population is 90% of all patients with diabetes. So
it's a huge market opportunity. And when you take a look at those – 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus
on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the route of insulin delivery because that's also a core
competency, but insulin delivery within that Type 2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%.
The broader opportunity is within monitoring. And what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you're seeing with iPro2
and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions
to those Type 2 patients.
And at the end, our goal isn't just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product. It's really to deliver an
integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insights
that can give those patients actionable information so that they can better manage their disease, and also to do the same
thing for physicians who are managing those patients. So, we're really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we're
just getting started, but we think there's a tremendous amount of runway in this business.
<Q - Kristen Stewart>: Okay, thanks very much and see you guys next week.
<A - Hooman C. Hakami>: Thank you.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. It's time to close the call out here. And I'd like to remind you that we plan to host our Investor Day next Monday,

And finally, in conclusion, as we've noted, we continue to focus in delivering consistent mid-single-digit constant
currency growth, strong EPS leverage and returning a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders.
FY 2016 was indeed a successful and transformative year for our company and looking ahead, we feel we're
well-positioned to participate and lead in the transformation to value-based healthcare, which can ultimately create
long-term dependable value for our shareholders.
And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and
interest in Medtronic. Thank you and all of you, please have a great day. Thanks.
