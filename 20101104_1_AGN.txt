Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate
Communications
Thank you, Brandy, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to Watson's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings
Conference Call. Earlier this morning Watson issued a press release reporting its earnings for the third quarter and
year-to-date period ended September 30, 2010. The press release, together with additional materials reconciling our
GAAP and adjusted financial results and forecasts, are available on our Web site at www.watson.com. Additionally, we
are conducting a live webcast of this call, which will also be available on our Web site after the call's conclusion.
With us on today's call is Paul Bisaro, our President and CEO who will provide an overview of the third quarter within
our Global Generics, Global Brand and Distribution business segments. Todd Joyce, our Chief Financial Officer, will
then provide additional details on the performance of our business segments as well as on our consolidated financial
results for the quarter. Paul will conclude our presentation with our updated outlook for 2010. We'll then open the call

Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Siggi Olafsson, Executive Vice President of our Global Generics
Division; Fred Wilkinson, Executive Vice President of Global Brands; Bob Stewart, Executive Vice President of
Global Operations; Al Paonessa, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of our Anda distribution

Actual results may differ materially from current expectations and projections depending on a number of factors
affecting the Watson business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, including but not limited to, the Watson Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2009 and the
Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2010.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Patty; and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report yet another
very strong corner for Watson. Net revenue for the third quarter increased 33% to $882 million. Adjusted net income
for the third quarter increased 18% to 106 million, or $0.85 per share. And adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased
18% to $211 million.
Our performance in the third quarter was driven by a number of factors. In our Global Generics business, we continued
to see strong sales of new and existing products in the U.S., particularly from our extended release product portfolio,
the addition of product sales from our international markets and, of course, better than expected pricing in the U.S.
These factors resulted in adjusted Generic gross margin of over 50%.
In our Global Brands business, we acquired the progesterone business from Columbia in July and expanded Columbia's
previous promotional efforts for Crinone, a treatment for infertility, by adding it to the products offered by our
OB/GYN sales and marketing team. Crinone has been well received by doctors and their patients and we expect sales
of Crinone to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters as our efforts begin to yield results.
Overall Brand revenue was lower than anticipated in the third quarter due to two factors. One, the delay of approval of
our value brand of Ferrlecit, and second, an issue that affected sales of our Trelstar product. The majority of Trelstar
sales are reimbursed under the least costly alternative program administered by CMS, and Trelstar has historically been
the lowest price alternative.
Earlier this year, a U.S. federal district court struck down this program, which, along with other products,
disadvantaged Trelstar from a physician reimbursement standpoint. In short, following the decision, physicians
received less – lower reimbursement using Trelstar than Lupron and Eligard. We are currently pursuing all available
options to reestablish a relatively level reimbursement environment.
Finally, our Anda Distribution business had another great quarter with our third party sales up 35% due primarily to the
launch of generic Effexor XR and continued sales of products launched in prior quarters.
We continue to make significant investments in our business to support future growth. During the quarter, we invested
heavily in our R&D programs. Our Global Generic R&D spending increased 46% to $54 million and our Global Brand
R&D increased 45% to $21.7 million. We also completed an agreement with Moksha8 to market a select number of

Watson products in Brazil and Mexico. This is part of a long-term strategy to expand Watson's presence into these high
growth emerging markets. We will begin to launch some of these products in these markets in the first half of 2011.
We also continue to execute on our Global Supply Chain Initiative. We are on track to close our Carmel, New York
facility by year-end, the Australian R&D facility will close in the second quarter of 2011, and the Toronto facility is on
track to close in early 2012. We continue to move products to and invest capital in our India and Malta facilities. Our
focus on the Global Supply Chain Initiative will ensure that we remain competitive in the global marketplace.
We also had a number of developments since quarter end and I would like to provide some background on these. First,
our agreement with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen on Concerta. Under the agreement, we will be the exclusive authorized
generic beginning May 1, 2011, for the duration of the agreement, which ends in December of 2014. This agreement
provides a date-certain launch of a more affordable generic Concerta product. It also allows us to continue to pursue
FDA approval of our ANDA and launch our own generic version at expiry of the agreement.
Additionally, the economics of this agreement are not structured as a typical authorized generic agreement. During the
initial few quarters, the gross margins realized by Watson will be below current gross margins in our Global Generics
business. However, following the initial first few quarters, the gross margin will be comparable to or modestly above
current gross margins in our Global Generics business.
In our Brand business we continue to prepare for the launch of ella, the emergency contraceptive we licensed from
HRA Pharma. We anticipate the product will launch later this quarter.
Columbia's Phase 3 clinical trial on Prochieve and Crinone for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a short
cervix is nearing completion and we anticipate results will be available at the end of the year. Also we licensed rFSH
product from Itero Biopharmaceutics (sic) [Itero Biopharmaceuticals] during the quarter. The collaborative work
involving Itero, our Salt Lake City R&D team and Eden Biodesign has begun. We are currently in the process transfer
stage for the product.
Moving to our International business, we continue to face challenges in many of our major markets, driven by the
dynamics and competitive pricing issues within each market. In the U.K. and Canada, we are seeing price weakness
outpace volume growth. In France, sales and profitability are in line with our expectations. We do, however, expect
fourth quarter international net revenues to be higher than our third quarter.
In summary, our performance in the quarter was strong and we're continuing to execute well on our strategic goals that
we had set to grow the business.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd for some financial review. Todd?
R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our financial performance on a consolidated and divisional basis.
For the third quarter of 2010, net revenues were 882 million, an increase of 33% over the prior year period. Net revenue
for our Generics division was 578 million, up 45% on a year-over-year basis. U.S. Generic revenues and margins
remained strong due to stable pricing in the U.S., higher sales of our extended release products including Metoprolol
ER, Potassium XR and Diltiazem LA and the launch of new products including Zarah, our generic version of Yasmin.
For the quarter, oral contraceptive sales were 101.3 million, up 9% over last year. Ex-U.S. net revenues were 102.2
million. Sequentially, international product sales were down 11% due to seasonal factors and lower pricing in certain
key markets.
Adjusted gross margin for the Generic division was basically flat at 50.3% as increased sales of our higher-margin
extended release products and oral contraceptives were offset by lower margins in our International business.

Moving to our Brand division, net revenue was 99.7 million, down 12% from the prior year period. Product sales were
82.4 million, down 14% year-over-year. The decrease reflects the loss of Ferrlecit and the lower sales of Trelstar,
which were partially offset by increased sales of Rapaflo, Gelnique, Androderm and the addition of Crinone. Brand
other revenue was 17.3 million for the quarter, an increase of 4% as a result of higher AndroGel co-promote revenue
and the addition of Eden Biodesign. Brand adjusted gross margin was 80.1%, down 1.6 percentage points compared to
last year due to the loss of Ferrlecit.
Finally, net revenue from our Anda distribution business was 205.1 million, up 35% from the prior year period due to
higher third party product launches. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 14.8%, essentially flat with the third
quarter of last year.
Turning now to GAAP operating expenses, consolidated R&D for the third quarter was 75.8 million, up 46% over the
prior year period as a result of increased development spending in both our Generic and Brand businesses. Generic
R&D increased as a result of the addition of our international business. Brand R&D increased primarily as a result of
product development milestones for rFSH, Uracyst and ella. For the full year 2010, we now expect total R&D spending
on a GAAP basis to be in the range of 265 to 275 million.
SG&A for the third quarter was 241.6 million, an increase of 121.5 million over the prior year period. The current year
period includes an 89.9 million charge related to the potential settlement of certain drug pricing litigation and SG&A
expenses related to our International business. For 2010 we expect our SG&A spending on a GAAP basis to be in the
range of 700 to 720 million.
Amortization expense for the third quarter was 45.9 million, up from 22.2 million last year as a result of the Arrow
acquisition. For 2010 we expect amortization expense to be approximately 180 million.
Our income taxes on a GAAP basis reflect an 18.7 million tax benefit associated with favorable resolution of an IRS
audit. Our GAAP tax rate also reflects 4.2 million in other non-recurring tax benefits recognized during the quarter. For
2010, we now expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. On an adjusted cash basis we continue to
expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.
On an adjusted cash basis, which excludes amortization expense, earnings for the third quarter was $0.85 per share, up
9% from $0.78 per share in the prior year quarter. Also excluded from the GAAP results for adjusted cash basis
reporting purposes were 10.6 million in acquisition and licensing related charges, 9 million in costs associated with our
Global Supply Chain Initiative, an 89.9 million litigation charge and 22.9 million in favorable tax benefits.
Included in the 10.6 million of acquisition and licensing related charges are 8.2 million of GAAP interest deductions
related to the revaluation of liabilities associated with the Arrow acquisition and the acquisition of the progesterone
business from Columbia. The acquisition of the progesterone business was treated as a business combination for GAAP
purposes. Consequently, contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition have been valued as of the acquisition
date and reflected on our balance sheet. Adjustments to the fair market value of these contingent liabilities will be
reflected in earnings on a go-forward basis.
GAAP earnings for the quarter was $0.21 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 211.1 million, up
18% compared with the prior year period. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was strong at 136.5 million.
We ended the quarter with just under 1.2 billion of debt and 266 million in cash and marketable securities.
During the quarter we repaid 50 million on our revolver, leaving the entire 500 million undrawn at quarter end. With
this debt repayment, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to 1.5 times as compared to 2.1 times at year-end.
I'm pleased with our financial performance in the quarter and with our ability to utilize our strong cash flows to both
de-lever and reinvest in the growth of the business. Watson is in a great position to capitalize on opportunities for
future growth.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2010 forecast and concluding remarks.

Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Todd. Now talk about the remainder of the 2010 forecast. Our estimate for full year net revenue is
approximately $3.5 billion. We expect our Global Generic segment revenue, including our International revenues, to be
approximately $2.3 billion.
Turning to the assumptions for our U.S. Generics business, we are assuming no new competition on Metoprolol or
Micro-K for the remainder of the year. We have, however, accounted for KV's re-entry on generic Micro-K. Our U.S.
forecast does not include any contribution from additional patent challenges.
On the International front, we continue to expect our International revenues in the fourth quarter to be higher than those
in the third quarter. On the Brand side of the business, we expect net revenues to be approximately $400 million for the
year. And with the Anda distribution business, we anticipate revenue to be approximately $825 million. We expect
adjusted EBITDA of $835 to $850 million and adjusted cash EPS in the range of $3.37 to $3.45.
In summary, with the majority of 2010 now complete, I can say that I'm extremely pleased with how the year is
progressing for Watson. The business is performing well and we've made considerable progress on every one of our
objectives for the global growth of our company. I want to thank my Watson colleagues for their hard work and
dedication without which our performance to date would not have been possible.
With that, let's turn the call back to Patty for questions. Patty?
Patricia L. Eisenhaur, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate
Communications
Thanks, Paul. And, Brandy, we'll open up the queue for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Great. Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups on the Concerta agreement. Can you elaborate a little bit
more on the step up in gross margins? Is that something that's just a time-based event? Or is that tied to your own
approval or something else? And can you also provide a little bit more color on the gross margins in the first few
quarters; is that something that's going to be meaningfully below your current gross margins? And I just had one final
Concerta follow up from there. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm surprised that was the first question. Hi, Chris,
how are you doing?
<Q - Chris Schott>: Good, good.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It is a time-based step up, okay. And as to the first
few quarters I would say it's modestly below the generic margin. And then as we said in the last few quarters, or after
the first few quarters it steps up to being more like our generic margins and then at some point modestly higher.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Okay. And then just a final Concerta question. Is there any constraint on the amount of product
that you're going to be able to ship into the market?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No.

<Q - Chris Schott>: Okay. Great. And if I can slip one final question in here. Micro-K, I think you mentioned you've
accounted for the re-entry of a competitor in this space. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about price in that
market and about that re-entry in terms of your share? And just the dynamics overall? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. Well, like anything else, it's a question of
market dynamics. We would anticipate, since there's certainly plenty of product in the market that we've provided, that
it should be orderly. It wouldn't make a lot of sense for a mass disruption. So we're expecting a more orderly
marketplace. Only time will tell, however.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Thank you very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur with Needham & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: First question is just with respect to potential future expansion efforts, particularly outside the
U.S. Given that you've now successfully established a global beach head in – I guess in light of some very fast moving
market dynamics over the past couple of months, has that at all altered your acquisition game plan going forward? Or at
least maybe changed your potential angle of attack in terms of buy versus build in some of the countries that you're
currently in, in terms of building or optimal scale and also thinking about expansion into some additional territories,
particularly in the EU?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, as you correctly point out, Elliot, it has been in
a fast moving environment, but I think the base fundamentals are still in place that attracted us to that – those global
markets and those base fundamentals are the continued need to increase generic utilization in many of these markets, as
well as which we think will certainly outpace any pricing declines. Also the fact that Watson is, I think, well and
strategically placed now with our facilities and Global Supply Chain to be competitive in those markets on a long-term
basis. So it hasn't – things haven't changed for us. We still want to expand our global footprint. As to the opportunities,
there are obviously less and less opportunities every day. The consolidation of the generic marketplace continues pretty
aggressively and we've been very selective at what we've been looking for.
We want to find the right opportunity in the right market. We have certainly key markets that we want to continue to
build like France and Germany and the U.K. and Canada, Australia as well, I mean places where we currently have a
good business, but we know we can build it. And we're going to go at those two different ways. We're going to
continue to use our internal resources, our own applications, file our own products and build the businesses, but we're
also going to look for selected opportunities to grow them by acquisition. If a bigger opportunity presented itself, we
would certainly look at that, but those opportunities are fewer and fewer out there.
As to emerging markets, I think you saw us do the deal with Moksha (sic) [Moksha8] where we acquired about 20% of
Moksha (sic) [Moksha8] . That's a strategy that we'll probably follow more and more in these emerging markets that
are really sort of difficult to enter. They're difficult to enter because of local environment, local players, cost of
manufacturing generic drugs on those markets and a brand of generic strategy in many of these markets. Moksha (sic)
[Moksha8] provides us a great opportunity to do a brand and branded generic strategy in two very attractive markets
and we'll look for those kinds of opportunities in other emerging markets around the world.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: And as a follow up to that, how would you rank order your acquisition priorities in terms of just
building out additional scale in some of the markets, global markets in which you're currently present on the Generic
side versus looking for a scalable platform in which to leverage your U.S. Branded business in your international
markets versus potentially even enhancing your U.S. Generic positioning with some select product acquisitions –
company acquisitions?

<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think we're lucky enough to be in a financial
position to be able to do sort of all three of those things. And so – but if you ask me to rank them, I guess we're very
aggressively looking around for Generic growth opportunities globally. However, we're also looking pretty
aggressively at how we expand our Brand footprint outside of the U.S., focused primarily on countries where we have
scale, where we have critical mass. And for example, we have a number of products filed in Canada. And so the
Canadian brand opportunity is probably the next one we'll look at as a, well, as a way to take advantage of those
products that are filed there.
And then finally, on the U.S. side, on the generics piece, I mean I think we're a very, very large company here in the
U.S. We're number three or four, depending on how you count it. And additional scale for us doesn't really do much for
us in the marketplace. We have a great pipeline, we got great products. So there's not a lot of incentives to do a big deal
for a generic piece in the U.S. However, we do continue to look very aggressively at brand opportunities to continue to
fill out our urology and women's healthcare portfolios, including the pipelines. I think they're very strong, but you can
always make them stronger. And then as we prepare for even more future opportunities, we have to continue to look at
biologics and continue to keep focused on the fact that five, seven, 10 years from now biologics are going to be the
drivers of growth. So all of those opportunities, we're working on all of them and we have the balance sheet to be able
to do that.
<Q - Elliot Wilbur>: Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Buck with Buckingham Research.
<Q - David Buck>: My question, just a quick one. Paul, since it's about a year from the acquisition date, or close to it,
of Arrow, can you talk about how you see that in terms of the returns you've been getting from that business versus
what you had expected? And can you talk a little bit about just what the currency impact might have been
year-over-year? And then just a quick one, Paragraph IV opportunities in generic Ferrlecit and the generic Fentora, just
an update on the expectation now and why they're not in the guidance. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. As to Arrow acquisition, it's sort of a rehash of
kind of where we're at. I think it was a – in retrospect, it was a very solid acquisition for us. It gave us many, many of
the things we needed. I think Elliot called it a beachhead, and I think that's probably what it did. It gave us a global
footprint that we can build off of, and from that perspective we really couldn't be happier. We did face some headwinds
and challenges in international markets, just like everyone else has done, but that's to be expected. It's to be expected
that some years the international markets are going to face some challenges and some years the U.S. market's going to
face some challenges and that's the point of being diversified. So when one market is struggling, hopefully the other
one – another market is picking up and I think we're in a good position to take care of – to take off on that.
And we've also had some very, very good assets from Arrow on the U.S. side. We of course look forward to the launch
of Atorvastatin next year; we have the launch of Xopenex in 2012. Some very solid assets were provided to the
company from the Arrow acquisition. So all in all I think we're very pleased with where we ended up.
I'll let Todd address the currency question.
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. Sequentially, David, there was
minimal impact of the currency fluctuations for the quarter.
<Q - David Buck>: Okay. And, Todd, just year-over-year, what would the impact have been if you had owned it last
year for a full quarter?
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: We didn't evaluate it on that basis.
<Q - David Buck>: Okay. Thanks.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And then, David, I think you asked about Fentora,
and Fentora is out – we decided to remove it from the guidance principally because it's late in the year and we face a
couple of issues there. We've got – there's an injunction that was entered against us while the judge is preparing her
decision. We do expect a decision any day and then we'll see what happens. So it made sense to take that out. We also
are – there's, I think, two new Citizens' Petitions or two relatively new Citizens' Petitions that were filed and of course,
as you know, we have to address those and that always takes a little time. I think the other question you asked about
was Ferrlecit and...
<Q - David Buck>: Yes.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: ...the generic Ferrlecit – this is one of the frustrations
I think the entire industry is having, the predictability of FDA approval, as I've learned the hard way, is impossible.
We've – we haven't – our application continues to be in the queue for approval. It's an expedited review, but expedited
doesn't mean what you and I think it means. It means something else. It's just slow.
<Q - David Buck>: Is there any actual dialogue on that? Or it's just...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We're just waiting for them to sign the papers.

Your next question comes from the line of David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David Amsellem>: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to come back to Brazil real quick and just
emerging markets. I mean, what's your appetite for doing a larger scale acquisition there? And just given the growth of
the overall pharma market there, is there – is that a market where you see yourself looking to expand your Brand
footprint?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes. I'll answer the last question first. It is absolutely
where we're looking to expand our Brand footprint, which is why the Moksha (sic) [Moksha8] transaction is so
valuable. Moksha (sic) [Moksha8] is principally a brand company today with brand sales forces calling on physicians
and in some cases pharmacies. And we will be putting – it is our intention to put our Brand portfolio into Brazil and
Mexico, using their sales forces. In addition, we'll be using their sales forces to sell generic, branded generic products
in those markets, and then at the same time, using our own capability which we currently have in Brazil, to sell more
tender-like generic products.
So if you think about it, we're coming at the whole market from sort of a two-pronged approach. We've got – combined
with Moksha (sic) [Moksha8] , we're using a brand strategy and branded generic strategy, and then a tender strategy for
our generic products that fit that kind of category. So it is an attractive market. If another opportunity in Brazil
presented itself, we would certainly take a look at it. I think, as you know, the acquisition prices for opportunities in
those markets are a little high at the moment. So we have to be cognizant of that and be, in a word, pretty careful of
what we look at to buy and want to make sure the numbers would work.
<Q - David Amsellem>: And then a quick one on ellaOne, and I might have missed this since I joined late, but just
remind us what your timeline is for the commercial rollout and how we should think about pricing relative to your

<Q - David Amsellem>: Okay. That's helpful. One last one, just any update on the Lidoderm Paragraph IV, where you
are in the litigation and any expectations regarding movement from the FDA on the Citizens' Petition?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, the Lidoderm litigation is sort of just in the
early stages. We don't think we run afoul of the Citizens' Petition. We've said that before; we'll say it again. The
guidance – we follow the bioequivalency guidance as issued by the FDA, which actually came out about six months
after the Citizen's Petition was filed. So we feel pretty comfortable we satisfy the requirements as well as the arguments
laid out in the Citizen's Petition. And I guess you should probably recognize that our 30-month stay on Lidoderm ends

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Cacciatore with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Hi, good morning, guys. Paul, on Concerta, can you just talk about maybe the sustainability of
this product? Are you aware of any kind of industry chatter about other Concerta approvals or where folks stand? And
then as well I would just say to you, do you really want us to be left to our own devices here looking out to 2011 and
2012? These seem like huge economics as they escalate, I guess, per your guidance north – near 50%. So do you all
want to take a cut at giving us some direction? You previously were at 10% growth in those years. This seems like this
would escalate it dramatically higher. Do you want to comment on that? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure. Well, as to the competition, I mean it has to be
sort of pointed to two companies that we know have said they have applications. One we know, KUDCO, is in
litigation right now with Ortho-McNeil and Janssen (sic) [Ortho-McNeil-Janssen] on the product. We don't expect
them to get approval in the time period between now and May. And Impax has indicated, I think, that they're still
working on their application. And so right now on both of those – from both of those companies we don't really expect
any competition in the short-term.
Regarding guidance we'll give a lot more color on 2011 guidance to the Analyst Day which we expect to have in
January, but I think you need – well, we did give you pretty specific guidance around what margins to use.
I think one thing you need to remember, of course, is Concerta will also be supporting – the revenues and profitability
for Concerta will also be replacing some of the product loss that we have on a year-over-year basis in our normal
generic business. And normal generic business has the unfortunate problem of a decline every year because of new
competition, price declines and the like. So it doesn't necessarily be all additive. Some of that will – and also some of
that we can reinvest in R&D and the like.
So it is a good – we think it's a good arrangement for us. We think it's a good arrangement for Ortho-McNeil and we
think it's a good arrangement for consumers. Because we got a product out. We know we're going to get it out. We
know we're going to get a lower cost alternative out and we know when it's going to happen. And we don't have to wait
for approvals and the vagaries of fighting through the Citizen's Petitions and everything else. So hope that helps.

<Q - Louise Chen>: Hi. First question I had was with respect to your OUS Generics business namely Arrow. How are
the sales of that business tracking relative to your initial expectations? And then what do you expect for growth in
2011? I knew you gave some guidelines this year. Will you provide those again for next year, for 2011?
<A - Sigurdur Oll Olafsson>: Hi, Louise. It's Siggi Olafsson. I think our International business is tracking quite well
where we have seen the price pressure probably a little bit more than we built in our forecast was in Canada and the
U.K. On the other hand, there has been more volume increase. Without going into – we don't give details on the
countries, but we have a volume increase in our U.K. market of around 20% year-over-year, but the price pressure has
built that down. On the other hand, in France we are in line or about with our expectation. Then we have a smaller
markets around the world and Paul explained those are the platforms for our new portfolio going forward. So I think
the overall international market outside of the U.S. really has the opportunity of growth.
With regard to forecast, we will give that again on the Analyst Day in January how we see the 2011 and the future for
these markets.
<Q - Louise Chen>: Thanks. And then second question is just with respect to your women's healthcare franchise. You
obviously have a lot of potential shots on goal with respect to new product approvals and potential product approvals
coming up. Can you talk about how big your business is today? And where do you want it to be over the next, say,
three to five years?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. Thanks. That's a great question. Remember this is kind of our first year back
into women's healthcare so we've been focusing on a couple of smaller products, help build our knowledge – rebuild
our knowledge of the customer base and establish kind of an understanding of how the OB/GYN works today. We
currently promote Gelnique and Femring, and then as of July we put Crinone into the bag.
Starting the end of this year we'll have ella. Beginning of next year we'll add an oral contraceptive and it just kind of
goes from there. And hopefully with some good luck on the Crinone Phase 3 program in pre-term labor, we'd like to get
that into the marketplace at the end of next year. So we see ourselves as this is a year of re-emerging in the market.
Several assets will come into the bag at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, which really takes us into
the base business of women's healthcare and then with some good luck we'll be introducing a novel therapy in a
category where there's a completely unmet need.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Silver with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Richard Silver>: A few questions on the Brand side. Can you give us an update on Rapaflo and Gelnique, what
you're seeing quantitatively, qualitatively, in terms of trends there?
<A - G. Frederick Wilkinson>: Absolutely. So Gelnique continues – Gelnique and Rapaflo continue to grow. We've
shifted some emphasis to Rapaflo versus Gelnique so Rapaflo now is sitting in first position in all of the bags as we get
out into the marketplace. So we've increased the coverage of the urologist for Rapaflo. We're still experiencing about
23% to 24% growth quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions, which is good news because each quarter it's on a higher
volume. I think our revenue actually increased about 38% quarter-over-quarter on Rapaflo. And this is trending in a
position that we think we'll be making a meaningful product out of it in the end of 2010 and going into 2011. We also
have some new data on an indication or a potential new indication that we're starting to put into the marketplace that
helps differentiate product from this and the other competitors. And so we're bullish on Rapaflo and the opportunity
there.
Gelnique is actually functioning in a much tougher marketplace because we're seeing the marketplace declining
slightly. We think that's a significant impact on – from the economy. We actually see it in all of the products in the
OAB marketplace. We're actually growing about 10% to 12% quarter-over-quarter on prescriptions, a little bit higher

than that on our revenue, as we reported in the quarter. And we've got that into a solid second position detail in front of
all the urologists and the primary care physicians. So still looking for growth for both of those products, and I think you
can anticipate a little larger growth out of Rapaflo than Gelnique.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Okay. And then just shifting to the Generics side, the 2Q to 3Q increase excluding
international, can you comment on that? And anything there that might be noteworthy?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: In terms of revenue?
<Q - Richard Silver>: Yeah.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think the revenue growth in 2Q to 3Q was
driven principally by our extended release products. That would include – we've had quite a portfolio of extended
release products now with Metoprolol, the Potassium Chloride, Clarithromycin and [inaudible] and Cardizem LA,
we've had – we certainly have a good and growing portfolio. We would continue – you should continue to expect to see
continued products like that from us. These products present great opportunities, generally less competition, and that
generally means that the product is going to continue to grow for you over time. So we – that's kind of what did it,
Rich.
<Q - Richard Silver>: And one last one on Concerta. Sorry, I know we're spending a lot of time on this one, but the
agreement, can you at least tell us whether the step-ups are equal in time, if it's, say, three-and-a-half-year agreement, is
it equal divided by the three-and-a-half or 1.2 each, or is it...? And I guess the last thing, is there – you said time-based,
is there any component at all of the agreement that's not time-based that might take into consideration additional
competition during that period until 2014?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, there are – the economics would change in the
event of competition. So that is not a time-based issue. And then the – but the step-ups are time based. And because of
confidentiality constraints we're sort of prevented from giving much more detail than that.
<Q - Richard Silver>: And how would it change if there was competition?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: The economics would change.
<Q - Richard Silver>: Right. But and...

minimums as to how much J&J has to supply you with Concerta starting May next year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No, Tim, we're not constrained either with minimums
or maximums. So we're working with them right now to prepare for the launch of the product. And we don't expect any
issues or any hiccups with that. There's always start-up potential concerns as you – as product switches from one label
to another. But I don't really foresee anything right now. Our Global Supply Chain people are on it and I think we've
had a good relationship with – working with Ortho-McNeil in the past and we've certainly done a number of products
with them. And we don't see any issue really.

<Q - Timothy Chiang>: And you don't see anything with the DEA quota? I mean basically you're going to be working
underneath Ortho-McNeil's quota? Is that right?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Right. The good news is that they have quota for the
whole market right now, so it makes it a lot easier. Otherwise, we would have had to get our own quota, convince the
DEA that – with – and take part of their quota. So this actually makes it a little easier.
<Q - Timothy Chiang>: I guess I want to just ask one follow-up. And I've always thought that you guys were the
front-runner in Concerta and that you certainly would be in the driver's seat if the FDA ever decided to approve this
product. And I guess with this settlement, maybe you can talk a little bit about what your expectation for an actual FDA
decision on generic Concerta is. I mean, do you think is going to take years? Or do you think this is the right deal even
if a generic Concerta does get approved in the next six months?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think, Tim, as we've seen and I've sort of
indicated with my frustration regarding Ferrlecit, generic Ferrlecit, it's become very difficult if not impossible to predict
the timing of the agency's ability to deal with complex questions. We were pleased to see that they moved earlier in the
year on difficult products like the Ambien and then also the Lovenox. But it takes a long time for them to get to that
spot, and what we wanted to do and what we were able to do with this transaction is provide certainty, provide certainty
for us and provide certainty for consumers. So I think for all those reasons, it made sense, and as you say, even if
competition does appear, we think we did the right thing.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thank you.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: A couple of questions. First, regarding the closing of Carmel at the end of the year and Toronto and
Puerto Rico later, roughly how much [inaudible] understand a lot of the costs come out just when you close down a
factory. Roughly, what will be the step up in gross margin or in gross profit that will come from the closing of the
Carmel facility once we enter 2011? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Okay. Well, Ronny, let me just clarify. You said
Puerto Rico. It's actually Australia R&D that we're talking about there. The R&D facility in Australia.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Right.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: It was a smaller facility that the Arrow folks had. I'll
turn it over to Todd for the question about the step up.
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure. In terms of margin, what we've
communicated previously in terms of the savings from our Global Supply Chain Initiative, it's running about 2%
margin impact, so we've seen a 2% favorable margin impact from the actions we're taking.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And how much of that will come in just when you close the facility? It's kind of tough for us to
estimate when those cost savings begin to trickle in or when do they end.
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, right now, these facilities, the costs
we're incurring is to transfer the product out. We're excluding those from our adjusted numbers, so you're already
seeing, really, the impact of that. What you're not seeing fully is the impact of shifting that production from high cost

manufacturing to low cost manufacturing. And so that's going to be incremental and you'll start to see that as we
actually move, complete the process of moving products from the U.S. into Malta and India.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: So somewhere next year we should see those 2%.
<A - R. Todd Joyce, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: You'll start to see that – you're seeing
some of it now and you'll see the rest of it in '11 and '12, early '12.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Great. Great. And the follow-up is around Micro-K. Paul, I look to be – you are the RLD right now
on the Potassium Chloride, and I'm guessing right now what's happening is that your competition is trying to shift the
RLD back to them and then they can launch their own generic. My question is really about additional competition in
that market. Is it fair to say that given the unclarity who the RLD is, and just the length of time to do the clinicals on
this product, we're probably not going to see another Micro-K competitor until 2012?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think I would go that far. I think people were
probably working on the product, and the RLD shift is not – it's my understanding, because that's a very good question,
does that affect the timing. If – I believe the agency's position is as long as you use one of the RLDs at the time for
[inaudible] -
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Ah. Okay, so it's either one. It's not [inaudible] -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I don't think it's – that's going to impact the timing of
another competitor. But again, I would hesitate to say we won't see competition before 2012. I don't think that's
probably accurate.

Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Hey, Greg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Just one other Concerta question I don't think you've had yet. Can you just confirm that your
approach here will be a typical generic approach where you try to maximize penetration in all channels?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, I think that's exactly accurate.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. I have a Lipitor question; it might be more of an industry question, too. It's my
understanding that starting next year when patients hit the doughnut hole, they might have to pay more for an
authorized generic than a pure generic. Do you see it that way? And if so, do you think that it has implications for your
Lipitor share and in general for industry shares of AG's versus pure generics, because this is a unique situation starting
in 2011?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think you're – I think it's true that AG's fall
within the brand version of the reimbursement, so they do participate as part of that doughnut hole issue. Do I think it's
going to affect the utilization? Not really at all, frankly. I don't think that's going to happen. I think more likely the
naïve people will just continue to use whatever generic the store provides to them. So I don't think it's going to have an
impact on utilization.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. And then lastly, you've gotten a lot of, I think, similar questions about your bus dev
strategy internationally, but I wanted to ask you, if you step back, are you considering any business development
strategies that would be more transformational in nature relative to geographic diversity, business mix, tax structure?
Are you considering any large transformational type things that could even include mergers of equals at this point?

Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Gregg, that's a great question. I think the answer is
we're always open to consider those kinds of opportunities, and we would consider them provided that we convinced
ourselves that it was right for our shareholders and our company. And we have looked and will continue to look at
some of those opportunities. Anything – I think it's very clear, I've been very clear about this, if anything we can do to
lower our overall corporate tax rate makes an enormous sense for us, 37%, 38%, is a very big number and it's a very
big challenge for American companies to have to deal with that when our top competitors are paying half that amount.
So we've got to find a way – we got to find a way to get that down. And sometimes it's the way you do it is with a
transformational transaction. That has to be well thought out and well understood by everyone before you do something
like that. So, anyway, that's the answer.

Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Christopher Caponetti>: Hi, guys. It's actually Chris Caponetti for Dave. I was wondering if you could just
comment on Lipitor? Do you guys expect Pfizer to do more deals with a mail order firm besides Medco for Lipitor post
November 2011?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think we've said, as we've talked to people
about how they should think about the opportunity, we said we would expect, and I think it's reasonable to expect, that
Pfizer will do what other companies have done in this space and that is play a bit of a defense in closed model
opportunities. So we don't expect that the full $8 billion market would be open to our product, but we do expect it still
to be a very significant market.
So, yeah, I guess we would expect that to happen. If it doesn't, we'll be ready for that as well. Pfizer will have to make
its own decision economically whether that makes more sense or whether it makes more sense through their transaction
with us on the authorized generic or does it make more sense for them not to do that. That's their call.
<Q - Christopher Caponetti>: Great. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up question. You talked about Micro-K in
2011, but could you just comment on incremental competition for Metoprolol next year?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think we've been – we sort of study and listen
to what other folks have said and we would expect to see additional Metoprolol competition in 2011. Certainly, Sandoz
has been pretty clear that they're working on getting their product back so I would expect to see them at some point in
2011 and perhaps one or two others. It is a big marketplace, it's solid and we would expect to have an orderly
marketplace as people enter, but only, again, time will tell on that.

<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. Sorry. So I'm sorry to ask another question on Concerta, but I just wanted to make
sure that I heard correctly. Paul, did you say that the gross margins on Concerta are going to be close to your generic
margins, which are around 50%? Am I misunderstanding something? Because when we spoke earlier this week or
when we were trying to kind of run an analysis, we were thinking better than the typical authorized generic margins
and we were modeling 25 to 50, but this looks maybe like you're talking more like 45 to 55. Is that the correct way of
interpreting what you're saying?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Shibani, remember what I said was that in the
early quarters, the first few quarters it's lower than our generic margins.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. But you're not saying how much lower?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: And then I said later – in the later portion of the
agreement they would be equivalent to or modestly above.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on your Generics or oral contraceptives business.
We've heard both Mylan and Lupin talk about entering the market, but we really haven't seen that much as yet. But
could you just talk us through what you're expecting going forward in the next couple of years, please? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well it's funny. I've been in this business a long time,
at Barr and now at Watson, with oral contraceptives and I've answered this question every quarter. People are saying
that there's going to be additional competition and frankly we just have never really seen that. For the remainder of the
year we see no major disruption in our oral contraceptive business through – because of additional competition. In 2011
– I try to remind everybody that we have somewhere around 25, 26, 27 different products. As far as I can tell, the FDA
has never granted 27 approvals to any one company in one year. So it's very unlikely that anybody's going to be able to
compete with that basket of oral contraceptive products, either the Watson portfolio or the Teva portfolio. So anybody
who enters this marketplace will be disruptive to that particular product, but overall, our business I think will remain
strong into 2011. I would expect it to also be a contributor, and maybe not as major of a contributor, in 2012.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure.
