MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Triano, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please
go ahead, sir.
Charles E. Triano
Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer's first quarter 2013
performance.
I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Ian Read; Frank D'Amelio, our CFO; Olivier Brandicourt, President and
General Manager of Emerging Markets and Established Products; Mikael Dolsten, President of Worldwide Research

And the slides that we'll be presenting can be viewed on our homepage by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly
Corporate Performance First Quarter 2013 located in the Investor Presentations section in the lower right-hand corner
of this page.
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussions during the call will include forward-looking statements and
actual results could differ materially. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2012
annual report on Form 10-K and in our report on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and the reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today.
As we outlined in our earnings release, the IPO of the 19.8% interest in Zoetis was completed on February 6 of this
year. Thus, effective February 7, the earnings attributable to the domestic portion of Zoetis are excluded from adjusted
and reported net income and diluted EPS in both our first quarter results and our full-year 2013 guidance. We still
retain an 80.2% ownership interest, so all Zoetis revenues and expenses continue to be included in first quarter results
as well as in the financial guidance for the full year.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck. I'll begin with some comments on the quarter.
We started the year continuing to create significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, we completed a successful
IPO of a minority interest in Zoetis and a related debt offering and began returning those proceeds as well as the
proceeds from the sale of our Nutrition business to our shareholders through share repurchases.
So far this year, we have repurchased approximately $6.3 billion of our shares. In addition, our focus on rebuilding and
strengthening our innovative core is yielding results. During the quarter, we launched some significant products. Most
noteworthy were the launch of Eliquis in the U.S, U.K., Germany, Denmark and Japan; and the launch of Xeljanz in the
U.S. In addition, we recently approved (sic) [received] approval for Xeljanz in Japan and Russia.
Regarding Eliquis, the market introduction since the launch is in line with our expectations. We continue to work with
our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, on securing broader commercial, medical and hospital formulary access. We expect
to gain broader access as the year progresses, as we seek to establish Eliquis as the leading novel oral anticoagulant in
the market over time. We are very confident in Eliquis' clinical profile and our ability to translate that into a leading
market position given the new prescriptions we are seeing.
Regarding Xeljanz, we're encouraged by the early indications or indicators we're seeing with the U.S. launch.
Prescribing by rheumatologists is tending higher and we are seeing that repeat prescribing is also tending higher, which
suggests that once a physician prescribes Xeljanz, they generally increase prescribing. Importantly, we are seeing use in
post-methotrexate and post-TNF patients at similar rates.
Our full promotional campaign launched in March, and we plan to introduce DTC advertising this summer. In addition,
we recently submitted the supplementary NDA for Xeljanz that was accepted for review by the FDA to include
supportive patient reported outcomes data in the label.
Last week we announced receiving a negative opinion for Xeljanz by the Committee for Medical Products for Human
Use in the E.U. In the opinion letter to Pfizer, CHMP noted that tofacitinib is a new chemical treatment with a different
mechanism of action to products already approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and that in their opinion,

the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib is not properly or sufficiently demonstrated.
We disagree with their opinion and are seeking a re-examination. While history would show that a reversal of such an
opinion is not common, we feel compelled to further address the risk benefit issues raised by the rapporteurs through
this process. We believe the risk benefit profile of Xeljanz has been well characterized to date with approximately
5,000 patients across Phase II and Phase III trials in more than 40 countries resulting in 7,000 patient years of exposure.
The original application submitted to the E.U. was based on the same pivotal efficacy and safety data package that was
provided to regulatory agencies around the world, and that has resulted in approvals in the U.S., Japan and Russia. This
recent development in the E.U. does not change the status of Xeljanz as an approved treatment option in these markets.
It is also under review in several additional countries, and we anticipate decisions this year in a number of those
markets.
Turning to our Oncology business, we launched Bosulif in the E.U. and saw good and improving performance from
both Xalkori and Inlyta across the markets where these products have launched. Within our pipeline, we have shown
steady improvement in the quality of the compounds and in the rate of progress in advancing these compounds. Of
particular note is the breakthrough therapy designation that the FDA recently granted to palbociclib, our innovative
new investigational compound for patients suffering from breast cancer.
Yesterday, we announced our worldwide collaboration agreement with Merck, except in Japan, for the development
and commercialization of ertugliflozin, our investigational compound for the treatment of Type II diabetes. Phase III
trials are expected to begin this year, which will examine both its use as monotherapy and in fixed-dose combinations.
We look forward to moving ahead with Merck in this area of significant unmet medical need.
And we have a robust vaccines portfolio that includes a vaccine for mening [meningitis] B for adolescents and young
adults that is currently in Phase III. Earlier in the pipeline, we are working on prophylactic vaccines to reduce the risk
of some of the most difficult hospital-acquired infections such as Staph Aureus and C Difficile, our next-generation
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and therapeutic vaccines for smoking cessation and allergic respiratory diseases.
While we are seeing good momentum in our innovative core, our operating environment continues to be challenging
and at times volatile due to ongoing pricing and macroeconomic issues. This quarter, our Emerging Markets revenue
grew 6% operationally, but we were negatively impacted by certain events that included the timing of certain
government purchases of Enbrel and Prevnar franchise and the transfer of some of our products to a joint venture in
China with Hisun Pharmaceuticals.
Let me note that we do expect the second half of the year will be stronger for our Emerging Markets business and on a
full-year basis, we continue to expect it will deliver high single-digit operational revenue growth.
We also continue to demonstrate good fiscal discipline in managing our cost structure by continuing to align our costs
with our revenue base. This quarter we reduced our total adjusted cost of sales, SI&A expenses and R&D expenses by
approximately 7% compared to a year ago. Overall, I believe our results demonstrate our continued financial flexibility
in adapting to our current operating environment.
In a moment, Frank will provide you with more details on the quarter and what we expect for the full year, but before
he does that, I want to point out that we expect to see data from several important clinical trials during the second half
of this year. This includes CAPiTA data for Prevnar 13, which if positive, may result in broader recommendations for
adult usage following review by key vaccine technical committees like the ACIP. We are also expecting data from two
Phase III programs for dacomitinib towards the end of this year. These programs involve patients with advanced
non-small cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed after prior treatment. Full data presentations are planned for a
medical conference next year.
And we're expecting data from Phase III studies for Xeljanz for the treatment of psoriasis by mid-year. If favorable, we
expect to file early next year in the U.S. and Japan for the Xeljanz psoriasis indication. Separately, we also anticipate
beginning a Phase III psoriatic arthritis study for Xeljanz later this year. Thank you, Geno. As you can see, depending
on our clinical outcomes, Xeljanz has the potential to become a broad-based product franchise for our Specialty Care

business.
Also later this year or early next, we will see the complete Phase II data for palbociclib for the treatment of breast
cancer and the associated assessment of progression-free survival and overall survival. We believe that palbociclib may
represent an important potential treatment for this devastating disease given the encouraging data we've already seen.
And in February, we began enrolling patients in a Phase III study evaluating palbociclib in combination with letrozole
for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with ER Positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. This
represents 60% of cases amongst postmenopausal patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
Regarding our options relative to our 80% interest in Zoetis, we have not yet made a final determination. We are
actively assessing the best options to maximize value for Pfizer shareholders in an expedient and efficient manner. As
we shared with you over the course of last year, with the sale of the Nutrition business and the successful IPO of
minority interest in Zoetis, we are building two strong businesses, an innovative core and a value core, each with
distinct cost structures and operating drivers. We know it will take the next few years to fully realize the potential of
each, and as each of these businesses progress, we will continue to evaluate how best to deliver their value to our
shareholders.
In summary, throughout this year, we will continue to stay focused on building a substantial innovative core. We will
use our capital in ways that deliver the greatest value to our shareholders. We will continue to manage our cost
structure. We will press forward on our initiatives to help enhance our reputation with society, and we will focus on
creating an ownership culture that helps to drive results.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that
adjusted and reported net income and diluted EPS in both our first quarter 2013 results and our updated 2013 guidance
reflect the IPO of a 19.8% interest in Zoetis, which we completed on February 6, 2013. We still retain an 80.2%
ownership interest so all Zoetis revenues and expenses continue to be included in our first quarter results and in the
financial guidance for the full year. However, effective February 7, 2013, the earnings attributable to the divested
portion of Zoetis are excluded from first quarter adjusted and reported net income and diluted EPS in both our first
quarter results and our full-year 2013 guidance.
Now let's move on to the financials. First quarter 2013 revenues of approximately $13.5 billion decreased 9%
year-over-year, reflecting a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange and an operational decline of approximately 8%
driven mainly by the loss of exclusivity of several key products in certain geographies, notably Lipitor in developed
Europe during the second quarter of 2012, and Geodon in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2012, the timing of
government purchases of Enbrel and Prevnar franchise in certain emerging markets and of Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and
the transfer of certain product rights joint venture in China with Hisun.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.54 decreased 5% primarily due to the previously-mentioned decrease in revenues which
was partially offset by an aggregate operational decrease of 7% in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and
adjusted R&D expenses primarily resulting from cost reduction and productivity initiatives, a lower effective tax rate
and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to our ongoing share repurchase program.
I want to point out that our solid performance during the first quarter was unfavorably impacted by approximately
$0.02 per share due to changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar including the devaluation of the
Venezuelan Bolivar since we first provided our full year financial guidance in late January.
Reported diluted EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.24 in the year ago quarter and was favorably impacted by lower
overall costs and lower certain other items including non-acquisition related restructuring costs and fewer shares

outstanding, and unfavorably impacted primarily by the loss of exclusivity of certain products as well as other factors
impacting revenues previously mentioned.
During the first quarter biopharmaceutical volume growth of 10% in the BRIC-MT markets was primarily driven by
strong growth in China and partially offset by price reductions of 1% in these markets resulting in operational revenue
growth of 9%. If you exclude the portfolio of products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China with
Hisun our operational revenue growth would have been 8% in our emerging markets business, 14% in the BRIC-MT
countries and 31% in China. In addition, foreign exchange negatively impacted BRIC-MT revenue by 1% in first
quarter 2013.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter revenues by 1% or $118 million and had a net positive impact of
$24 million in the aggregate on adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses. As a
result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared to the
year ago quarter.
We're reducing our 2013 reported revenue guidance range by $900 million, solely to reflect the non-operational,
negative impact of the changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar since mid-January. While most major
currencies have worked against us since mid-January, approximately half of this unfavorable impact is attributable to
the weakening of the Japanese-yen versus the U.S. dollar.
I want to remind everyone that Japan is our second largest market and represented 10% of our total revenues in 2012.
In addition, the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar accounts for approximately 20% of the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange since mid-January.
Now moving onto our 2013 financial guidance, I want to emphasize again that our guidance for this year reflects the
completion of the IPO of a 19.8% interest in Zoetis and the resulting non-controlling interest. All Zoetis full-year
revenues and expenses are included in our guidance but the earnings attributable to the 19.8% divested portion are
excluded from both adjusted and reported diluted EPS guidance beginning on February 7, 2013.
As I just mentioned, we've lowered the upper and lower ends up our reported revenue guidance range by $900 million
or approximately 1.6% due to foreign exchange movements since mid-January. We've lowered our adjusted diluted
EPS range from $2.20 to $2.30 to $2.14 to $2.24 to reflect the aforementioned changes in foreign exchange rates and
the completion of the Zoetis IPO and we've lowered our reported diluted EPS range from $1.50 to $1.65 to $1.44 to
$1.59 to reflect these same factors as well as some other offsetting factors.
Approximately $0.04 of this EPS decrease in adjusted and reported diluted EPS guidance ranges is due to the
non-operational unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates from mid-January to mid-April on our
full-year guidance which includes the weakening of the Japanese yen and our basket of other currencies versus the U.S.
dollar but excludes the $0.02 negative impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar, which we are absorbing.
Approximately $0.02 of the decrease in the adjusted and diluted EPS guidance ranges is due to the elimination of the
non-controlling interest of Zoetis. To be clear, excluding this $0.02 non-operational impact related to the
non-controlling interest of Zoetis, had foreign exchange rates remained constant, we would be reaffirming our initial
full-year 2013 revenue and reported and adjusted diluted EPS guidance.
Moving on to key takeaways, first quarter results were unfavorably impacted by the loss of exclusivity of several
products in various geographies and the expected volatility in emerging markets. As we've previously stated, because
of this volatility we anticipate our performance in that business to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. That said, we
continue to expect high single digit operational revenue growth in emerging markets in 2013 with the majority of this
growth occurring in second half of the year.
We continue to mitigate the earnings impact of product LOEs with both expense discipline and share purchases. We
received approximately $6 billion of proceeds from the successful completion of the IPO of the 19.8% interest in Zoetis
and related debt offering. We've updated our 2013 financial guidance to reflect the negative impact of foreign exchange
rate changes since mid-January and the completion of the Zoetis IPO among other non-operational factors.

During the first quarter we launched Xeljanz and Eliquis in the U.S. and Eliquis in several developed markets in the
E.U. as well as in Japan. We remain excited about the potential of our mid- to late stage pipeline and we continue to
create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation.
To date, in 2013 we have repurchased approximately $6.3 billion or 227 million shares and we have approximately
$5.5 billion of authorization remaining under the current repurchase program. I want to point out that since 2010 we
have repurchased nearly 1.1 billion shares of our common stock.
Finally, we remain committed to do delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2013 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.

Thanks for the review, Frank. With that, operator, can we please poll for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Good morning, everybody. Just two for you guys. First, Ian, you mentioned it's going to
take several years for you to fully develop your innovative and value cores. As you consider how to best realize value
from these divisions for your shareholders, should we think about the decision on that as something that could occur in
the near-term? Or do we really have to wait a couple years to see how these businesses evolve before you'll have a
better sense of the profiles of each?
My second question was on palbociclib, just thoughts on what breakthrough designation means here, the potential to
file off of Phase II data and could you talk a little bit about the early breast cancer opportunity. When we should expect
hear more about that? Thank you very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Thanks, Chris. I'll deal with the two core businesses then I'll ask Geno to deal with the
palbo question. I think what we're saying is that we believe in the two core businesses, we're going to – we look at this
year as a year as a decision year on how to structure those, how to indicate to you to give you further visibility and then
simply the work involved in order to have those businesses as entities with enough financial information to make
decisions when we're ready to make them, would take two to three years because of the complexity of separating out
the businesses.
So what we would like to do at some point in time and we'll take that decision this year, is to start to operate more
independently those businesses, give you more visibility as shareholders and then assess what are the advantages and
disadvantages of having these two core businesses housed in the same entity or not. And at that point, as we see that
happen and frankly as we see the innovative core's pipeline mature and as we take steps to continue to strengthen Value
Co.'s ability to have product growth inside certain segments of its product offering, that will inform our decision.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Okay. So, Chris, just a couple comments on palbociclib, I think you're probably familiar
with the breakthrough designation now. This is a new device that the FDA has to increase or intensify their focus on
programs where early clinical signals are compelling for conditions that are serious and life-threatening and certainly
palbociclib falls into that category and it was encouraging to see FDA give the designation to palbociclib recently. So
we look forward to continued engagement with the FDA on the program.

As you know, the Phase II trial is still ongoing. We're anticipating completion around the end of this year, or sometime
in the second half. It is an event driven trial so in a way, the longer that it takes, it's possible that patients are actually
surviving longer and without progression in the palbociclib arm which is, which could be a very good thing. So we're
just going to have to wait until we've achieved the required number of events and we'll report out as soon as we have
results ready for disclosure.
With regard to the early-stage trial, we're actually working on two additional Phase III trials now, one for earlier stage,
high-risk patients, as well as, for advanced recurrent patients. And our expectation is that we'll initiate those trials in the
second half of this year as well. So we'll provide more color once we reach that point.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Your next question from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Frank, I have a question for you. I guess I'm still very confused about something
related to the Zoetis IPO. Can you walk us through the dynamics of your 20% stake that you sold through the IPO and
how the $6 billion in proceeds from that, which were being allocated to share repurchases, would not have allowed you
to report accretion from your sale of Zoetis. Instead you're reporting $0.02 of dilution. So I'm just confused about that. I
would just think with the IPO proceeds and given your market cap or rather your PE multiple that this would've been
pretty meaningfully accretive.
And then secondly, can you talk about your current plans for the 80% Zoetis stake? I understand, as Ian said, that you
haven't yet decided when or how but if you could talk about maybe how you're thinking about allocating those proceeds
as well? Thanks.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Okay. So on the first question, let me walk through this in a couple of steps, Jamie. So
first, on the last earnings call, I mentioned that our current year guidance, the 2013 guidance, assumed mid-teens in the
billions, share buybacks. So that was already factored into the guidance. That mid-teens billions in buybacks made
assumptions about the Nutri cash proceeds, as well as, the Animal Health, IPO and debt offering proceeds, point one.
Point two, remember when we're buying back shares, we don't get the full-year benefit of those shares from the EPS
calculation in year. It is a weighted average calculation. So the full-year benefit of those buybacks will actually take
place in 2014.
Point 3, if we were to do something with the second step on Zoetis and you assumed that there was a share reduction
from that, it would clearly be, when you netted it all out, accretive. The reason you're seeing that $0.02 decrease in
earnings today is simply a timing issue. That's the way that I think about it.
So hopefully that explains the steps relative to why you saw the $0.02. It's really timing, not getting the full-year
benefit of the shares we repurchased this year and the fact that we had already planned for mid-teen billions in
buybacks, that – which had taken into account Nutri and the first step on Animal Health.
In terms of current plans for Zoetis and our remaining 80.2%, a couple of comments. First, we haven't made any
decisions to date. Second, we have several alternatives available to us, per the IRS ruling and we continue to monitor
market conditions. Third, there are no operational barriers that would prevent us from proceeding with a potential
second step. And then lastly, our compass, our goal remains the same, which is to maximize after-tax return to our
shareholders.

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. I was hoping you could talk about Xeljanz a little bit more and what's going on behind
the scenes in the U.S. and the launch there and how it's progressing and talk about the reimbursement that you have
now and how that's going to change.
And then second of all, on the Oncology products that you've launched, Xalkori and Inlyta, if you could just give us a
little bit of an update there, Geno, on just how those are progressing and what kind of patients have been already
penetrated and how much is left there?
And then third, when is the staph vaccine trials going to read out? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, I'll ask, as you requested, Geno to answer the Xeljanz and any Oncology questions and then
Mikael can give you some update on the staff readout.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, so I guess for Xeljanz in the U.S. we're pretty pleased with the way things are going
right now. We're seeing a continued adoption of the drug, fairly broadly now across rheumatology community. We
have somewhere around 1,200, 1,300 physicians who have initiated patient trials and about two thirds of them are
repeat prescribers. We see this nice trend week after week, after week increase in number of physicians with
experience. We know from our Phase III trials with the patient reported outcomes and the efficacy that patients are
likely to be very satisfied. We're already hearing from some rheumatologists that they are hearing back from their
patients that their early experience has been very favorable. So I think of it as a, so far, so good situation.
As Ian mentioned in his opening comments, we really just kind of got off the tracks on our full launch in March with
speaker programs, with sales representatives, with promotional materials in their hands, with additional medical
support in the field, and in the middle of the summer – beginning of summer we expect to launch our DTC, so we're
right where we need to be. We see the trajectory of our launch comparing favorably to other recent launches. We're a
little ahead of most of the other products that have launched in this category so again, we like what we see.
With regard to reimbursement, initially we had probably broader reimbursement support than we anticipated. Everyone
just seemed to agree to pass through reimbursement. Over the last couple of months we've seen more managed-care
players doing their full assessments and making decisions on formulary placement and we're getting the formulary
placement we would expect. There will be prior authorization required for this medicine just like there is for all of the
medicines in the RA category and so I think we have now formal reimbursement decisions made for lives totaling
about 60 million and continued – there will be a continuation of evaluation by plans as we go into the summer. So
again, that's looking okay.
And then finally just to reiterate another point that Ian made in his comments. What we're seeing in terms of patients is,
we're seeing about an even split in patients that are post-methotrexate and patients who are post-TNF. So we're getting
both second line and third line patients in the early experience so far. So that's Xeljanz.
With regard to Xalkori and Inlyta, again, we're continuing to make progress there. Inlyta in the first quarter we did $63
million in the quarter. We're seeing real good uptake in second line which is the indicated position for that product, we
have about 26% share in the second line.
In Europe where we launched later last year, we know about half the physicians now who treat patients with renal cell
carcinoma have had an experience with Inlyta up so the uptake there is on track. And in Japan we're had a very robust
uptake, it's actually the number one product for renal cell in Japan. So Inlyta is off to a good start, good feedback on
patient tolerability, which is what we expected the benefit to be. So again, so far, so good there.
With Xalkori we had a $53 million first quarter, up about 20% from the last quarter which is again good progress.
Out-testing continues to improve. In the first quarter of this year new guidelines were published for out-testing. We
think it will be helpful in setting standards for who to test and how to get through the diagnostic in an expeditious
manner. So we think that, that can have a benefit and we're actually seeing now that we're getting healthier patients on
Xalkori, a good duration of therapy. So all the indicators are on track with Xalkori as well and maybe I'll hand it over to
Mikael to comment on Staph Aureus.

<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Marc, thank you for your interest in our Staph Aureus vaccine. We are expecting data readouts
from our proof-of-concept study middle of this year. It's really a first-in-class vaccine which contains four components,
carefully selected to, on one hand, two of them allow immune mediated clearance of bacteria while the two others are
selected to inhibit the growth of the bacteria including proprietary antigens that we have identified. The vaccine is
designed to act on antibiotic resistant and antibiotic sensitive Staph Aureus and we are quite enthusiastic about its
potential new approach to deal with the threat of difficult to treat Staph Aureus.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thank you, Mikael.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And, Marc, I'd just add that's Xeljanz sales in the quarter were $11 billion and with that
operator, can we go to the next question.
Operator
Yes. Your next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yes. Thank you. A few quickly on the Merck deal should we view this as a step in the direction
of Pfizer wanting to have a full-fledged diabetes effort covering several classes of drugs or just a way to share cost and
risk for one product area?
Secondly, on capital deployment, your dividend yield is at the low end of the major pharma average at this point
certainly due to strong stock performance but your payout ratio was also somewhat lower than average. I was curious if
you had any updated thoughts on the balance between dividends, buybacks and business development or if not when
we can we expect an update?
And lastly in the pain area in light of the recent FDA actions on abuse deterrent opioids, I was hoping you could update
us on your current thinking on Remoxy and the ALO product in the oxycodone space as well as Embeda in the
morphine space. It seems like there's quite an opportunity there to cannibalize generics and generate a lot of revenue if
you can get Embeda back on track. Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks for your questions. A lot on your agenda. On the Merck deal, we have a large effort in
CVMED [Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease]. We continue to do research in diabetes and in areas around those
conditions. I think this was a great opportunity for us to partner with a product that could not be the backbone or
monotherapy and we continue to remain focused on CVMED opportunities. John, do you want add a little bit more on
what you see with this partnership?
<A - John D. Young>: Yeah, thanks for the question, Gregg. I think first thing to say is, we're really very excited
about the opportunity of this collaboration with Merck to develop and commercialize ertugliflozin and
ertugliflozin-containing fixed dose combinations with metformin and Januvia. It's a proprietary, innovative SGLT-2
inhibitor for the treatment of type-II diabetes, which as you know, is a huge unmet clinical need and one that is
growing.
We expect to begin Phase III trials later in 2013 and we think that the clinical profile and differentiated mode of action
has the potential to really compliment the market-leading therapeutic profile of Januvia brought to the collaboration by
Merck. So overall, we think, as Ian said, this is very positive opportunity and one that really gives us a great entry point
for the ongoing research efforts that we have in cardiovascular and metabolic.
Maybe just to pick up on your question on pain and opioids as well, clearly it's been an interesting last few months with
some of the decisions that the FDA have made which I think is really a recognition of some of the challenges that we
have here in the United States with the abuse of opioids. I think the decision, along with the guidelines that the agency
issued in January, really helped to inform our development strategies.
Specifically with Embeda as we said last quarter the required stability programs are already underway. We're working
towards the submission of a prior-approval supplement for Embeda in 2013 and we believe that Embeda, subject to

successful completion of those stability programs, will be commercially available in the first half of 2014.
For Remoxy, we had a productive meeting with the FDA in March and the guidance that we got out of that meeting is
certainly helping to inform the next steps in addressing the issues that the FDA had raised previously in their
complete-response letter. We believe we have a path forward and we will publicly communicate further details over
coming quarters.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. Frank, do you want to take the total shareholders return question?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Gregg, let me run the numbers first and then I'll give you little more color commentary.
So the payout ratio for the quarter was 44%, $0.24 on the dividend, over $0.54, so 44% payout ratio for Pfizer. If you
look at what we've done with the dividend since the acquisition of Wyeth, when we announced Wyeth we cut the
dividend from $1.28 to $0.64. Since then we've raised it from $0.64 to $0.72, $0.72 to $0.80, $0.80 to$0.88, and $0.88
to $0.96. So 12.5%, 11%, 10%, and 9% increases respectively, just in terms of running the numbers.
In terms of what we'll do going forward with the dividend is, every year in December, Ian and I make a
recommendation to the Board of Directors and then once we get approval from the Board of Directors we obviously
announce that to the investment community, literally that day or the next day. So that's the game plan for the dividend
on a going forward basis.
In terms of just capital priorities, capital deployment priorities, from my perspective they remain the same. So first and
foremost, in terms of total shareholder return, we understand the importance of dividends and buybacks, so that clearly
remains a priority. Investing in the business, whether that be with R&D programs, capital expenditures, launch costs
associated within our new products, continue to invest in the business, business development, will be an area that we
continue to look at, the amount of cash that we repatriate overseas. So all the things that I've talked about previously
and I think what's most important is, because of the amount of cash that we generate from operations, we have the
ability to do all these things, which is really, it's a nice luxury to have. So that's how I'd answer the question.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Our next question, please.
Operator
Your next question is from Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you. A couple of questions. You talked about Prevnar being weak in Q1, due to
timing. That would imply we should see a rebound in Q2 through Q4, such that on a full-year basis we'll still see
growth across the franchise. Is that a correct way of looking at it?
And then the second question relates to the mechanics of potentially splitting up the company further. You mentioned
recently that one of the things that would be needed to do this is three years of audited financials. My question is
whether that three year clock has started yet, and if not, does that mean that the earliest anything could happen, in terms
of actually accomplishing the split, would be 2016 or can you look backwards and satisfy some of that three year
period versus it being fully forward-looking?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Tim, thank you. Well, so I just want to emphasize, firstly, that I believe we do have two operating
models, two core businesses in the company. The first order of business is to find a model where we can separate them
and give the management the ability to run those businesses with as much authority and independence as is necessary,
and to judge if those businesses inside Pfizer can fulfill what we believe is their full potential, and whether shareholders
see the potential of those businesses and value them fully inside that combination.
If we decided, or came to the conclusion that there were further benefits from a split of those businesses, and that
decision has not been taken, I believe the earliest we could do that would be in 2016. And as I say, this year we're
studying how best to report and out the results and how complicated it will be for us to start generating different P&Ls,

and even potentially, balance sheets.
So that's the situation where we are and we will give you more color on when and how, later on this year. With that, I
would turn it over to Geno, for his comments.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, Tim. Just on Prevnar, I think actually you have it right. I think our first quarter was
impacted by some inventory differences compared to the first quarter last year, primarily with the CDC purchases,
some stockpile purchase last year in the first quarter, and even in the private market we saw slightly lower inventories
in the first quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. That'll probably even out as we go through the year.
Those decreases, relative to last year, offset a little bit by some price increase that we had for this year in the U.S. in the
first quarter, and a little bit of adult business that started to creep in.
So all in all, I think the business is stable. In Europe we were actually up about 3%, for the first quarter, reflecting a
better pricing situation in the U.K. And for emerging markets, rest of world, we're off, again, slightly, in the first
quarter this year, related to purchase timing, primarily. The fundamentals of the business are very sound. The only NIP
[National Immunization Program] that we don't have this year, that we had before, is Morocco. It's about a $9 million
impact. So we're on pretty solid ground with Prevnar. I expect we will see strength as we go through the rest of the
year.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Our next question, please.
Operator
Your next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum, MD>: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. On Xeljanz, if the appeal doesn't
work out and you end up re-filing, what new data would you have that would allow a re-filing?
And the second question is on PD-991, given the mechanism of action, I guess there's a reasonable, it's reasonable that
it may work across different tumor types and I'm wondering if you've seen strong signals, Mikael, outside of breast?
And then just finally, in the EM [Emerging Markets], you mentioned EM you thought growth would pick up in the
second half and I was looking for a little bit of color on that, why you think that's going to happen? Thanks a lot.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno, if you could deal with the Xeljanz and then I'll have Mikael talk about palbo and Olivier
talk about EM.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: So Mark, for Xeljanz in Europe, as we've indicated, we're going to go through a
re-examination process. We hope to be able to clarify some of the issues that were raised by CHMP and either
eliminate the majority of them or some of them so that we can focus our follow-up activities on the areas that are of
most interest or concern to the CHMP. We would probably spend more effort analyzing and reanalyzing data that we
have to complete a new filing.
We would have some additional data from our 1069 study, the two year data which would be new and we would have
updated safety tables from ongoing long-term extension trials as primarily the new data that we would put into the
filing. But I think it has more to do with going deeper into some of the areas that the CHMP has been asked about and I
think we can do some of that with just stronger analysis of some of the databases that we've already discussed.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: So on palbociclib and, Mark, we appreciate your interest in how this drug could be fully
developed. Certainly we are exploring opportunities in a number of different tumor segments, and we have pre-clinical
and some early clinical signs that this mechanism can have an important outcome also in other tumors. We're studying
now, or thinking on studying across a number of segments from melanoma to squamous cell carcinoma, in a variety of

different locations which can include head and neck, lung, esophageal tumors.
I would like though to underline that given the strength of palbociclib in ER-positive breast cancer, and the amount of
understanding we've got on the importance of this drug in breast cancer, as Geno outlined, this year we are starting
three different breast cancer trials, advanced ER positive breast, early breast cancer that are ER positive and recurrent,
but in addition to that there are more segments in the ER positive that we are considering as opportunities which can
include medium to low risk ER positive breast and also within the HER2 segment, a substantial proportion also carry
the ER positive signature.
So Mark, given the very strong signal in breast it's compelling to consider that just breast cancer ER-positive segment
alone obviously has potential to make this one of the most impactful drugs in addition to exploring other tumors, as you
asked for.
<A - Olivier Brandicourt>: Okay. Mark, coming to emerging markets you heard Ian and Frank talking about the
one-time event of government purchase of Enbrel in Brazil and Prevnar in Mexico and some countries in Africa and
Middle East. Those had a significant impact on the growth for the quarter and taking those events out, the underlying
growth is more like 10% for EM and something around 14% for BRIC-MT countries. So the reason why we are
expecting a better second half in terms of growth rate is due to the fact that we still are expecting to get the full-year
purchase order of those medicines, and I'm talking NIP Prevnar and Enbrel, but the timing would be pushed toward the
second half of the year.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Olivier.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator
Next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Okay. I have a few questions. What was the rationale for designing CAPiTA without a
comparison arm with Pneumovax? And without such a comparison do you believe you can still get an ACIP approval?
Secondly, does the ongoing Phase III palbo trial have an interim look built-in? And if so, when would we get that data?
And then thirdly on Xeljanz, I appreciate it's early days but of the $11 million in Q1, how much of that was pipeline
stocking? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Geno, would you like to take all three? I mean, the CAPiTA trial design, the palbo and the
Xeljanz?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah. So, I mean, that it's, the CAPiTA trial design was obviously discussed with regulators.
This is a post-marketing commitment for the accelerated review in the United States, so this is a trial design that's been
thoroughly discussed and agreed upon with the FDA. And the decision to not include Pneumovax as a comparator arm,
I think, was related to the fact that there's a lack of evidence that there's a Pneumovax effect on community-acquired
pneumonia, but essentially it was an agreed-upon protocol with the regulators. We do believe that with positive data
that we will be able to demonstrate or reach agreement on a favorable recommendation from ACIP.
So with the palbociclib Phase III trial, there is a provision for an interim look. I don't know what the timing on that is,
so I can't give you a date. We'll have to follow up with you, Steve, on that.
And with Xeljanz, of the $11 million, almost none of it is pipeline stocking. We put a very small amount of product in
the marketplace at the end of last year. Because of the cost and the specialty pharmacy management of a drug like this,
there are not large inventories out there.

Operator
Your next question is from Andrew Baum of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Good morning. Three questions, please. Firstly on palbociclib, you mentioned the recurrent
breast cancer trial you're running. I just want to understand the trial design. Are you looking at adding the drug on top
of Afinitor, or looking at it in a head-to-head design?
Second, are you looking at the development of palbociclib with concomitant chemotherapy in select hemotypes using
the drug as a chemo protectant, which is an idea that has been suggested by some?
And then finally on Xeljanz, could you just outline the rapporteur and co-rapporteur and whether the possibility exists
for seeking individual of and central approval if you do in fact receive a rejection from your ongoing appeal?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Andrew. I'll ask Mikael to answer the palbo questions, and then perhaps Geno could
talk a little bit about the Xeljanz and the European Union.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes. So concerning palbo, our Phase II study was on top of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor.
We do think that the unique opportunity with palbociclib is, to a large extent, to delay the need or replace the need for
chemotherapy, with all its burden on patients.
So our treatment designs for the advanced and recurrent involves the use of additional formal blockade beyond
letrozole, and in particular for the recurrent, we are keen on the opportunity to add a drug on top of fulvestrant, which
you may know has been used and demonstrated to be an agent that can have some intrinsic activity even after hormone
receptor blockade is diminished by a receptor antagonist by having additional receptor degradation of the estrogen
pathway. But we haven't excluded opportunity for certain chemo combinations, but we are even more enthusiastic
about the ability to give profound treatment effect without the severe side effect of chemo treatment.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Great. Thank you very much. Geno?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Okay, Andrew, I think your question was related to the opportunity or the potential to go
forward with individual country registrations versus the central approach, in the event that we're not successful with the
re-evaluation. I mean, certainly there's an opportunity to explore that option, but we're not at a point yet where we're
prepared to make that decision.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Geno. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thank you. I have a couple of questions, please. First, with respect to separating
established products, could you just explain to us some of the operational changes that you're making? For example, I
think you've mentioned in the past that you're moving some lines of manufacturing to different parts of facilities, but if
you could go into so more detail on operationally what action is being taken, that would be helpful.
And second, with respect to the possibility of exiting the business, I'm just curious about whether you need the three
years of financials to be able to do a tax-free spin-off and that's why you're looking at a three-year timeline or whether
you could exit the business sooner through a simple sale of the business? Or would that just be too difficult from a tax
standpoint to exit the segment through a sale prior to having three years of audited financials? Thank you.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Well on separating the business, we already have separated the management in the
U.S. and the developed markets. The key question that we're looking at is in our BRIC-MT and our emerging Markets
that are very successful and growing aggressively, what would we need to do to separate out and what would be the
dynamics of that of separating out, and what portfolio would we separate out so as to create an innovative core and a
value core and how would we allocate capabilities and assets within that. This is not a sort of trivial undertaking in an
organization that's already performing so well.
And then the second part would be clearly on the manufacturing side you would want to try and identify plants that are
purely of a value or Established Products Co. type plants and there would have to be independencies and you look at
that and then you also have to look at the tax issues as you do that.
So this is, we believe, worth doing. I believe it's worth creating that separation internally because I think it brings focus
and management focus and will improve the performance of those two businesses, but it's something that we're doing
carefully given the, you know, it's sort of a reorganization of – or a potential reorganization of emerging markets that
has been so successful as is. But certainly, that's some of the considerations as we go to look at the separation.
Now, I'll ask Frank to talk about the timing and the mechanics of that but I would just add if under your hypothetical
scenario of a buyer, I'm sure the buyer would want to see P&Ls and balance sheets.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And, Dave, I think what I'll add to what Ian said is, when we talk about the three years it's
really I'll call it a path that's similar to what we did – if we were to do it, a path that's similar like the Animal Health
path where basically it's a path that we're doing it ourselves and we set ourselves up in a position to be able to do
whatever kind of optionality we want on a standalone basis. But that's what we think about when we talk about the
three years.
<A - Ian C. Read>: The underlying thesis of this is that we have an innovative core which is focused on science and
focused on selling and delivering education in a certain way, and would have an exciting pipeline that would drive
substantial growth and certain shareholders would have an appeal for that type of investment and then we would have a
value company which has substantial cash flows, large dividend capacity, big brands in emerging markets, more of a
sort of traditional selling model also with branded generics. But also we want to take time as we go through the next
couple of years to see how we strengthened both of those segments with strengthening innovative core with the
pipeline. We also want to look at how do we strengthen the value of business at the same time. Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez of Leerink. Please go ahead.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Thanks very much. So just wanted to check in on BD [Business Development].
Historically you've discussed primarily tuck-in acquisitions, Frank. Maybe you can just give us – reiterate the
thresholds or give us the thresholds that you're thinking about in that regard?
Also historically you've talked about interest in the sterile injectable space as a potential area of interest. Can you just
update us on that as well?
And then lastly on psoriasis, and the indication for potential indication for Xeljanz, can you just give us a sense of the
dose used in the oral studies as well as the pursuit of a topical formulation? I'm more asking that in the context of safety
questions that have been raised at least by the CHMP. Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno, could you answer the psoriasis question?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, so for the psoriasis program, our Phase II trial, we used a 5-milligram and a
15-milligram dose, and I think those results have been disclosed. In the Phase III, we used 5-milligram and
10-milligram doses, both administered BID, and again, we'll be seeing readouts the middle of this year on those trials.

Frank. Our view on BD has always been that it is not a strategy, it's an enabler and we will do BD if it – if we see a
clear path to increasing shareholder value. So we've always said, never say never to big deals and we've said we're
looking at bolt-on deals or, frankly, any deal where we felt that there was a convincing argument, that we would add
value to our shareholders.
So Frank, do you want to make some more comments there?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, I think what I would say is just to punctuate Ian's comments is, from my perspective,
although we never say never, the strategy remains bolt-on acquisitions and when you say the thresholds, in my mind
the target areas are our priority therapeutic areas, so inflammation and immunology, pain, Oncology, CVMED,
neuroscience. Emerging markets, and you know you've seen us do, take actions in the emerging markets, more on a
local basis, when you see what we've done there, and then established products, which by the way, comprises a major
part of our emerging markets business. And that includes things like, reformulations, for example, which was the
Quillivant transaction with NextWave. So those have been the strategies, those continue to be the strategies, and always
with the focus being how do we create shareholder value.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks, Frank.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question, please.

Our next question is from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. First a question for Frank, on cost-cutting. I
think last year you characterized it as being in the middle innings, I was wondering if you could update us and let us
know which inning we're in now?
And then a follow-up on Xeljanz for Geno. Could you talk about your sampling strategy? And would you characterize
it as aggressive? And could that have perhaps dampened sales a little bit and when do you expect those patients to
come back to their physicians to perhaps get a prescription? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So last year I did say middle innings. If you look at what we saved operationally last year,
in terms of our total cost and expense base, it was almost $4 billion in operational savings. I think the exact number was
about $3.8 billion.
I think we've clearly entered the late innings, so I think we're entering the seventh inning, right now. Still opportunities
to further reduce costs. I think you saw that again this quarter, adjusted cost and expenses were down operationally,
$545 million, 7%. But I think, when you look at kind of the continuum, the rhythm, I think we've entered, just started
entering the late innings.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Xeljanz.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: So, Alex, the program that we've put out there for Xeljanz, there were two sampling
programs. One was a 14-day sample that's primarily managed through our patient support program, to help patients get
started on therapy right away, while they're going through the prior authorization process. So that's a 14-day, relatively
short term program.
And then we gave select physicians a series of 28 day patient starters, so that again, they could get some early
experience. It's very difficult for us to track the utilization of those samples, so it's difficult for me to say whether or not
I think that's influencing the uptake, and I'm not sure I would call it aggressive. I think we were somewhat pointed in

Your next question is from Tony Butler of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tony Butler>: Thanks very much. Just briefly, one question on our two parts to Eliquis, and one is around overall
spend there. Is, do you feel, and I realize it's an early launch, that the overall spend so far has been as you predicted,
sufficient for that initial launch?
And the second issue is, assuming the six month moratorium on DTC is over, do you anticipate a direct to consumer
campaign, much like occurs with rivaroxaban? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Tony. John?
<A - John D. Young>: Thanks for the question, Tony. So I think the first point to make is that, along with our partner,
BMS we've been very thoughtful about making sure that we were very focused on our investment, but we are also
mindful of the very competitive nature of this market and resourcing. What we remain convinced is actually a really
significant opportunity to improve the outcomes for patients with the indications that we've researched thus far.
So we've deployed resources that have made sure that we are competitive and in addition to just the sheer spend, I think
the other thing that both companies bring is obviously a strong heritage in cardiovascular medicine between Pfizer and
BMS which we believe is a real positive advantage for us in the marketplace. Our expectation for Eliquis are broadly in
line with launch, as Ian mentioned in his opening comments, we always have known that this was going to be an
opportunity that was going to require us to displace a competitor in warfarin that's been in the marketplace for 50 years.
But we're very positive about the progress that we've made thus far and certainly what we've seen is a trend in the
marketplace that has Eliquis pretty much on track with actually the second new act to enter, Xarelto.
In terms of DTC specifically, you're absolutely right we currently are still in that 6-month moratorium period but
certainly it's an alliance once we have come out of that moratorium period subject obviously to clearance by OPDP
[Office of Prescription Drug Promotion] and the FDA, we would certainly have plans to initiate a DTC campaign in the
U.S. to enable us to communicate the benefit risk of Eliquis to the patients and we are very positive about that as being
a further opportunity that will kick in, in the second half of the year.

Your next question is from Michael Tong of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Thanks. Just one quick question on the R&D side. If I look at Inlyta and Xalkori, it's nice to
see the ramp coming up but in the overall scheme of things still a relatively modest contributor to top line. So maybe
for Frank or Mike, as you think about capital allocation within the R&D segment, where are you allocating the R&D
dollars? Maybe perhaps give us an idea of how you're splitting between primary care and specialty care at the moment

and where you think it might be in two to three years' time?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Well – thanks for the question we have TAs [Therapeutic Areas] which we've broadly stated we're
spending on which is Oncology and vaccines and inflammation and immunology, CVMED, oncology, pain and that's
where we're dividing our spend and we're dividing as we see opportunities that occur in the science.
I personally am excited about what we see coming out of our oncology portfolio and I think they have the potential to
be a large driver on our revenue as we go forward as does the vaccine segment where we're investing in which really
basically we started investing from a standing start after acquiring Wyeth, they had one large and good vaccine but
since then we're really building up portfolio of vaccines.
So perhaps Mikael may just want to comment briefly on the more interesting Oncology projects?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes. So overall, oncology is our largest investment in R&D, it is slightly above 20% of the
R&D investments followed by immunology and inflammation, just slightly below that. And then a number of the other
core areas are somewhere between 10% to 20% and we try to do regularly capital allocation by looking at what's in the
pipeline, what is looking most promising and where we see a return of investment going forward, so it's certainly not
carved in stone but as we do cross the business and R&D allocation to maximize output, particularly in oncology, we
have after the successful launch of three products, in recent one to two years we now have a second wave that we're
very excited about.
On one hand, dacomitinib that will generate data within the next period of this year, early next year, inotuzumab for
blood cancer and of course palbociclib as we spoke a lot about today. But behind that we have other interesting
oncology drugs such as Smoothened for multiple blood cancers and PI3K/mTOR that we'll have read out over the next
couple of years in several solid tumors. So it's quite a rich portfolio in oncology, immunology, vaccines and across the
various therapeutic areas.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks, Mikael.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Mikael. If we could take our last question please, operator.
Operator
Yes. Your final question comes from Damien Conover of Morningstar. Please go ahead.
<Q - Damien Conover>: Thanks for taking the question. Just one question on the strategic deployment of capital to
research and development. As the pipeline has shown a lot of strength and productivity over the years, a lot of that
strength is coming from the R&D spend where the spend was much higher. As you look forward, are you comfortable
with around 12% of sales going to R&D? And keeping this high productivity going – to keep it going over the
long-term? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you for the question. You know, we're very confident about capital allocation. We think we
have the right balance allocated to research right now and it obviously depends upon opportunities that come in the
pipeline. If large opportunities come that look very promising and require substantially more resources, then we will
not shrink from putting those resources there assuming we believe in the opportunities. Thank you.
