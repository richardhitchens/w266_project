MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Exelon Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks
there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacie Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your
conference.
Stacie Frank, Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exelon's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.
Thank you for being with us today. We issued our earnings release this morning, which is available on our website at
www.exeloncorp.com. The earnings release and other matters we will discuss in today's call contain forward-looking
statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties as well as adjusted non-GAAP operating
earnings. Please refer to today's 8-K and Exelon's other filings for a discussion of factors that may cause these results to
differ from management's projections, forecasts and expectations and for a reconciliation of our operating to GAAP
earnings.
Leading the call today are John Rowe, Exelon's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Hilzinger, Exelon's
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other members of Exelon's senior management
team, who will be available to answer your questions.
We've scheduled 60 minutes for this morning's call. I will now turn the call over to John Rowe, Exelon's CEO.

John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Stacie, happy New Year. 2010 was another year of fine operating and financial
performance for Exelon. I'll start with some of the key factors. As you know from our earnings release, our operating
earnings were $4.06 per share, handily beating our original expectations for the year and at the top end of the range we
provided you last quarter. We accomplished this through strict attention to cost control across the business. We met our
target for operating O&M for 2010 despite starting the year with pension and OPEB expense that was $35 million
higher than 2009 and a challenge in our budget of $100 million to offset rising costs. This was our second straight year
of delivering O&M below the 2008 level of $4.5 billion.
Revenues at Exelon Generation were helped by better-than-expected market conditions across the portfolio. Higher
capacity prices from the scheduled reset of PJM capacity rates were expected but nonetheless helped in delivering on
our commitments.
At both ComEd and PECO, weather effects particularly in the summer months increased earnings over last year by
about $0.16 per share. I would point out that we saw very little load growth in either company although we're always a
little uncertain about our weather adjustments, and there may be a little more than we're seeing, but it was basically
very close to flat.
We generated cash from operations of $5.3 billion, one million more than our original expectations. Our higher net
income, our tax planning work and cash benefits from bonus depreciation were the primary drivers.
Our cash generation in 2010 allowed us to contribute $765 million to the pension plans, including a $500 million
voluntary contribution last August. Separately, we contributed $200 million to our OPEB plans. And of course the best
thing of all is that we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders through the dividend, which we held stable at $2.10 per
share.
In operations, both ComEd and PECO maintained strong performance, while managing cost despite intense storms. In
each case we were a little disappointed in the duration indices, although I believe we're either in first quartile or close to
it, but we were very pleased by our frequency of interruption statistics.
ComEd achieved its highest customer satisfaction scores in more than five years and PECO had its best ever customer
satisfaction scores. Exelon Nuclear turned in its eighth consecutive year of capacity factors over 93%. While that starts
to sound routine, it simply isn't. The management focus that goes into consistent operations at these levels with a fleet
our size is a clear competitive advantage for Exelon.
We added 59 megawatts of new nuclear generation to the fleet through our uprate plan. We have another 98 megawatts
projected to be added in 2011 across a number of sites, including Limerick, LaSalle and Quad Cities.
For Exelon Power, 2010 marked our first acquisition of wind assets with the acquisition of John Deere Renewables,
now of course called Exelon Wind. This portfolio positions us as an important player in renewables policymaking, and
as we told you before we have long-term contracts to lock in our earnings expectations and cash flow. If, as suggested
in the President's speech last night, we have continued growth in requirements to purchase renewables, this puts Exelon
in the place of selling as well as buying.
We also lived by our own creed and advocacy in retiring some of our oldest plants. We received FERC approval for
short-term RMR agreements on Cromby and Eddystone through the retirement dates that we've announced in 2011 and
'12. We also solved a longstanding dispute with the State of New Jersey regarding the early retirement of our nuclear
plant at Oyster Creek. This provides certainty that we will not be required to install cooling towers, which the plant
simply could not afford while still allowing us to capture the majority of the estimated remaining value in the site.
We are preparing the transmission system for a cleaner future. We move forward with $178 million of transmission
upgrades in downtown Chicago. We expect to complete these by the end of 2011. Our transmission team is pursuing
high-voltage transmission development across the Midwest to move renewable energy to where it is needed most. And

Exelon Generation is taking steps to reduce congestion around our units through projects like the transformer
replacement near Clinton Station that is planned for the fourth quarter.
So let me say that I am very pleased with what our management achieved in 2010. This was a tough year and across the
board, PECO, ComEd, Nuclear, Power Team, Exelon Power, our Business Service group, our business entities met
their cost goals and in the case of Power Team, found ways to get some extra revenue in a very challenging power
market.
Now turning to 2011. As you've seen in the morning's release, we are expecting another good year with operating
earnings somewhere in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 per share. Our estimate reflects a number of items, which go in both
directions.
PECO has now transitioned to fully deregulated markets, and new electric and gas distribution rates went into effect on
January 1. The below-market power purchase agreement between PECO and Exelon Generation ended, which will
allow Generation to realize about $20 more per megawatt hour in 2011 on power sold to PECO customers.
Exelon Energy, our retail sales arm, is growing its presence in the East as a result of PECO going to market. The
pricing on financial swap between Generation and ComEd had a scheduled increase at the beginning of the year,
adding about 150 million of revenue net fuel over 2010 levels.
Our financial results will continue to be helped by the hedges put on by Power Team for 2011, which were in the
money by over $1.7 billion at year-end. That includes the swap in Illinois as well as the other contracts in other regions.
We expect demand at both ComEd and PECO to again be flat on a weather-normal basis. Now, on the other hand, we
of course must continue to limit cost increases and to work ever harder on financial discipline across the enterprise.
PECO had a favorable rate case settlement during the year. ComEd is working hard with other utilities in Illinois to
pursue a legislative proposal to invest in modernizing the grid in return for a formula rate structure. While it is too soon
to tell the outcome, the proposal would be an economic development engine for the state and would give ComEd more
timely and predictable regulatory mechanism for recovering its costs.
As we have reported before, tax legislation passed in December accelerates $1 billion of cash flow. We are using that
along with other funds and the tax benefits thereof to make a $2.1 billion contribution to the pension plan. Using the
funds for this purpose meets our obligation to our employees. It reduces the long-term corporate liability and takes
advantage of the tax deductibility of the contributions. It means that our future operating cash flows are more available
for things like our nuclear uprates and other long-term growth opportunities. Needless to say, it also makes those more
available to protect your dividend.
We, of course, radically improved the funded status of the pension plan, and this allows us to accelerate our plan to
rebalance the asset mix of the trust. And what we're doing is moving from our present equity contribution cut to a
higher level of debt so that we reduce the volatility and match the assets more closely to the liabilities.
Now 2011 is going to bring a lot of things that bear on our future value. These include environmental regulations,
changes in energy and capacity markets and the prospects for the broader economy. We believe and every check we
make confirms that EPA will issue its proposed rules for hazardous air pollutants in March, and the final rules are
scheduled for later this year. Both because EPA is committed to this end and because there are legal requirements under
court order, we expect EPA to move vigorously in this regard. We all know there will be a great deal of political debate
about whether these regulations are in some way too much too soon. Since we haven't seen them, we can't opine on
whether they're too much, but the Clean Air Act has been around for a long time and compliance requirements are
hardly a surprise.
EPA has shown what we believe to be commendable reasonableness on the 316(b) Clean Water rules. The agency has
indicated that it expects to issue those rules in March as well. Final rules on 316(b) are expected in mid 2012 with
compliance staged over some period after that. Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, has stated that a one size fits all
approach does not work and that closed cycle cooling may not be the right technology at all plants. We believe that to
be good news for Exelon and the entire industry. So there'll be a great deal of news on the EPA front.

With respect to energy and capacity markets, situation remains murky. As you all know, gas prices remain low. We are,
of course, very interested in the results of the May capacity auction in PJM. We believe they will be higher than last
year's results. The question is how much higher? The reduced demand forecast from PJM will exert some downward
pressure on the markets. It is possible that the recent New Jersey legislation to pay for new gas plants will also be a
downward force. However, we believe that under FERC precedent, FERC will move to require a reasonable minimum
bid price for these units and do so in time for May's RPM auction. We are also evaluating other options on how we
would respond in the event the Governor signs this legislation into law.
There are a very large number of factors affecting the result of May's capacity prices. These include the amount of
demand response participation, the number of plant retirements that are definite and bidding behavior reflecting what
people really can commit themselves to do with coal plants in the face of both gas prices and the coming EPA
regulations. They also reflect the timing of transmission upgrades.
We keep trying to evaluate all of these moving parts, as do you, and we will do our best to put them all together again,
once PJM releases its planning parameters and FERC issues its ruling on the demand response market saturation.
However, the reality is that we, like you, will not know the May prices until the auction takes place in May. The
long-term trend to us is clear, however, capacity prices must rise if new entrants are to be afforded.
Now as I said earlier, we're all aware that gas prices remain low. In the fourth quarter we did see tangible increases in
energy prices. We had West Hub forwards up about $3 per megawatt hour. Some of that has sagged off in January, but
prices still remain above the September 30 level. NI-Hub prices remain a challenge, but our hedge prices in the
Midwest are helping us here.
We will continue our radical hedging policy, which we've talked to you about many times. It has served us well
through this period of low prices. And of course, Ken Cornew and his team are constantly looking to lock in
longer-term power contracts that give us both some value for our capacity and reflect the value of the environmental
costs in the long-run price of energy. And while we don't get many when we look out at the longer-term we do see
some that give us this sort of value.
So that is 2010 and 2011 as we see it. As I said earlier, we are simply very pleased with 2010 performance, and we see
no reason why we can't do it again for you in 2011. Matt.
Matthew F. Hilzinger, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President
Thank you, John. Happy New Year everyone. This morning I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and
provide additional details for our 2011 earnings and cash forecast. My key messages for today are on Slide 6.
Starting with the fourth quarter, we achieved operating earnings of $0.96 per share for the quarter, compared to $0.92
in earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter results were mainly attributable to higher
capacity revenues and higher nuclear volumes partially offset by unfavorable market conditions and increased nuclear
fuel costs.
For the year, Exelon's 2010 operating earnings were $4.06 per share. We are very pleased with our financial
performance for 2010 because we were able to deliver earnings well above our original guidance range despite the
slower economic recovery unanticipated a year ago.
Now a few thoughts on our latest hedging activity and current market conditions, as we mentioned last quarter, and as
you can see on Slide 8, we increased the pace of our hedging activity for 2012 during the first half of the year when
prices were higher, and we have since slowed down as prices moved lower.
Also, as you can see in the chart on the left, we increased the percentage of put options during the year, which comprise
most of our sales above purely ratable sales plan. The use of put options provides downside price protection but allows
us to capture higher prices as they rise.

The chart on the right highlights the PJM West Hub energy prices continue to improve with some contribution from
increasing Eastern coal prices. Midwest energy and natural gas prices have remained relatively unchanged over the past
quarter. Our hedging disclosures, which are in the appendix of today's presentation, now incorporate all of Exelon
Wind sales. Wind assets located in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are included in the Midwest region. All other
wind assets are located in the South and West region.
Moving to Slide 9. ComEd had a great year, despite lower than expected loads. ComEd was able to absorb increased
storm costs and the impacts of an unfavorable Court of Appeals ruling, principally due to their proactive focus on cost
management. ComEd's load results are on Slide 10. A weak economy continues to weigh on ComEd's load growth.
ComEd's weather-normal load growth for the fourth quarter of 2010 declined by 1.2% driven by lower residential
usage, which was largely a result of the continued impact of high unemployment and higher foreclosures in the
Chicagoland region. Chicagoland's regional unemployment rate of 9.3% is in line with the U.S. rate, while the GDP of
1.6 for the region lags behind the U.S. statistics.
Looking ahead to 2011, we're expecting flat usage next year, compared to 0.2% for 2010. We believe that the Chicago
economy is gradually turning a corner. However, we expect the improvement in the residential class will be offset by
the energy efficiency efforts and the Large C&I growth will be slower, reflecting the stability of the gains experienced
in 2010.
Turning to PECO on Slide 11. PECO also had a very good year and delivered solid earnings despite historic summer
storms. As expected, PECO's fourth-quarter results were lower than last year due to the scheduled reduction in the
collection of CTC revenue. As a reminder, this was the last year of PECO's CTC revenue collections, as PECO has
made its full transition to competitive markets.
On Slide 12, PECO's weather-normal load was flat for the fourth quarter and essentially flat for the year. In the fourth
quarter, PECO experienced positive growth in the Large C&I class, which was offset by decreases in residential and
Small C&I classes.
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect PECO's electric deliveries to be flat, consistent with 2010 as a result of larger energy
efficiency impacts in 2011 that will offset economic improvements, particularly in the residential class and Large C&I
classes. Small C&I sales are expected to contract this year but at a lesser rate than 2010.
According to 2011 earnings outlook, we are expecting another good year for Exelon with operating earnings in the
range of 3.90 to 4.20 earnings per share for the full year and first-quarter results in the range of $1 to $1.10 per share.
Exelon's 2011 operating earnings will be led by ExGen, primarily due to the expiration of the PECO power purchase
agreement with ExGen. Under our normal hedging policy, ExGen has been locking in forward sales of its 2011
expected generation at market rates since 2008.
2011 effective realized energy prices for the Mid-Atlantic are expected to be approximately 20 per megawatt hour
higher than they were in 2010. A portion of this increased revenue will be offset by lower capacity prices, once the
2011 and '12 planning year rates are effective in June. We expect ComEd and PECO's 2011 operating income will be
supported by increased distribution rates. PECO's new distribution rates were effective at the beginning of 2011. For
ComEd, new distribution rates subject to approval will be effective in June. Our full year operating earnings estimates
also reflect higher state taxes of $0.03, attributable to the recently enacted Illinois income tax rate increase.
On Slide 13, our 2011 earnings guidance assumes O&M on a consolidated basis of 4.68 billion, a $290 million increase
over 2010 primarily driven by three items: First, 90 million for wage and inflationary increases; second, 55 million for
increased nuclear costs, driven by two more outages in 2011 than in 2010; and third, 50 million for the inclusion of a
complete year of O&M projections for Exelon Wind. Going forward, we expect future O&M increases for Exelon to be
more in line with a 2% growth rate, particularly in 2012 and 2013.
Our pension estimates on Slide 14 reflect our year-end valuation, and the $2.1 billion pension contribution announced
earlier this month. The incremental contribution will be funded by 500 million of cash from operations, 850 million for
bonus depreciation benefits and 750 million in tax benefits from the contribution itself.

Slide 15 has more information as to why we decided to make the $2.1 billion contribution to Exelon's pension plans.
Under the Pension Protection Act, effective in 2008, we are effectively required to fund our pension obligation over a
seven-year period. With this contribution, our funded status is expected to be about 90% by the end of the year.
Accelerating our funding enables us to reduce the risk on the balance sheet and reduce the sensitivity of our funded
status and contribution requirements to future changes in the discount rate. The pension contribution improves cash
flow due to lower future funding requirements, particularly in 2012 and 2013. It also lowers pension expense, provides
additional cushion in our already strong credit metrics and creates additional debt capacity.
Moving to Slide 16. We expect operating cash flows of 4.3 billion in 2011, and combined with our strong credit metrics
we are well positioned to meet our operating commitments, make investments in growth opportunities and fund the
dividend.
As you can see, we expect to spend approximately $700 million at ExGen for investments and uprates in wind projects.
As planned, we will continue work on our uprate projects across the fleet including MUR uprate projects at Braidwood,
Byron, Limerick and LaSalle. All of which are expected to be fully operational over the next two years, and EPU
projects at Peach Bottom and LaSalle.
We will also continue the completion of the three Michigan wind projects that were in advanced stages of development
at the time of that acquisition. At the utilities, we anticipate spending over 400 million on new business, Smart Grid
investments and transmission upgrades.
As shown on Slide 17, John has discussed many of the key events that we are focused on in 2011. As we actively work
our way through 2011, we will continue to focus on managing our costs, anticipating events that can have a significant
impact on our business and adapting accordingly to maximize opportunities and minimize challenges.
And at this time, operator, we are ready for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] In consideration of others, we ask that you please limit your questions to one question and one
follow-up question. Please return into queue for further questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question
comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Morning. John, you made reference to kind of the RPM outlook and some of the pluses and
minuses we've seen since the fall. If you were to add those all together, relative to some of the expectations you guys
shared at the EEI conference, are you more positive? Less positive? Or indifferent to the outlook to the auction results
this spring?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm never indifferent that's not one of my sins. We
really haven't been able to add them together in a new an interesting way. I suppose we're a little less optimistic at the
moment than we were in September but not a lot. And we just have to see because we know a couple parts that move
negatively, but there are some things out there going positively too. Ken Cornew, would you like to add to that?
<A - Kenneth Cornew>: Yes. Dan, obviously the level of PJM demand forecast that they produced in January would
have downward pressure on modeling of prices. Also, consideration of any kind of subsidized generation essentially is
a price taker, like what's proposed in New Jersey legislation would also have downward pressure. And as you know and
are well aware of and have been vocal about, there are other moving parts. PJM's going to issue its planning parameters
in February. FERC's going to have to rule on minimum-offer pricing and demand response saturation and ultimately
the big driver is the EPA environmental standards and reduced energy margins and how they play into how coal plants
bid in the next auction. So we still see upside, and we're going to be watching very carefully what happens in the next
two months.

<Q - Dan Eggers>: Ken, I guess, maybe kind of thinking about some of the forward hedging opportunities and some
of the longer-term full requirements, auctions. With the move in coal prices, particularly in the West where you guys
have a lot of generation, are you seeing a forward curve that is economic for people to bid in the '12 and '13 time
horizon? Or are coal prices at a point now where there seems to be a fundamental disconnect to the physical power
markets?
<A - Kenneth Cornew>: Clearly, Dan, the margins from coal generation in the Midwest are getting squeezed down
when you look at forward prices. Forward prices and heat rates have moved up more aggressively in the Mid-Atlantic
than the Midwest in the past quarter and obviously in January they've come back a bit, as John mentioned. I still think
there is upside particularly in heat rates at NI-Hub. I know we've talked about what CADR could – how CADR could
impact power prices. We think there might be a little bit of that in the forward market, but not much of it. We've talked
about how MACT standards in '14 and '15 could improve prices more significantly. As [inaudible] congestion has been
pretty significant in the last 20, 30 days. A lot of transmission work is going on in the Midwest region. We think some
of that is making its way into forwards, and I think that'll turn around over time.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: So, Ken, does that mean that you're, are you more reluctant to bid Midwest power forward or sell
power forwards? So is the hedging bias more in Mid-Atlantic right now just because it's a more efficient market from
your perspective and the Midwest will come later?
<A - Kenneth Cornew>: A little more complicated than that, Dan. But relatively speaking if we do think there is
upside, we will try to maintain that upside through option strategies, through what hubs we actually sell power at, and
we do consider the different products on-peak and off-peak. I think there is more upside in on-peak Midwest prices so a
lot of what we've done in the past quarter has been focused on Midwest off-peak, and we'll continue to look for ways to
hedge the portfolio while maintaining that upside. I think if you look at our hedge disclosures and our sensitivity charts,
you'll see that we've done a pretty good job of that.
<Q - Dan Eggers>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: First, a quick technical question. On the O&M increases, the 2% per year that you're talking
about, is that pretty consistent at both the utilities and at Gen?
<A - Matthew F. Hilzinger, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President>: Yeah. It's close. There could be
two, a little bit over two in some areas and under in other areas, but we've set the target to average two.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And then separate topic, on the issue of New Jersey that was brought up in terms of
this coming auction. John, I think you mentioned FERC precedent would not support what they're trying to do. Could
you maybe elaborate a little bit on the FERC precedent on this?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Sure, but it's better that Joe Dominguez does because
I've kind of gone to the extent of my knowledge. I think it's called the minimum price point. Joe, would you answer
this?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: Sure. Steve, when we're mentioning precedent in here, we're looking at the New York ISO
case that recently came down applying the minimum offer price rule in the New York market. There's also been
activity in the forward capacity market in New England. These are not new issues for FERC. FERC has applied
minimum offer price rules to these markets. We believe that both PJM suppliers and others will bring this issue to the
FERC very quickly, and that will get it rolling before the next auction.

<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Okay. And I guess one just last quick question. I seem to always ask it to you, John, but now
that we've had one of these monster mergers, any kind of updated thoughts on your M&A strategy?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We are always looking. We look in different
directions. We are absolutely value driven. We will not change. We will not abandon our value-added strategy out of
the lusts of an old man, out of the envy of other people's shiny press releases or for any other reason. But as to the
recent Duke-Progress announcement, it looks to me like a very sensible merger. I commend both Jim and Bill on doing
it. It's the right way to make things happen. It will make a good company. We, of course, had looked at Progress
ourselves. At our current share price, the accretion dilution numbers did not meet our tests. They apparently did for
Duke. We have nothing but respect for what they're attempting to do, and we expect to see more of it across the
industry. But it is one more example that Exelon is always paying attention, but we do this for value only.
<Q - Steve Fleishman>: Great, thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good morning. Just wondering if we could get a little more color on what you think is going
on with the underlying usage trends, particularly in ComEd, which seem to be – come in quite weak compared to what
you had been anticipating when you did the EEI slides I guess in early November.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm going to ask Anne Pramaggiore to answer that
because she's closer to it than I am.
<A - Anne Pramaggiore>: Sure. Thanks, John. We did come through 2010 lower than we had originally expected.
What we saw was a drop-off in fourth quarter, really September through November. We expected a decline in that part
of the year but not as dramatically as we saw. And I think our view of that – you have to break it down by class. The
Large C&I performed very well throughout the year. I think an overall increase of about 2.6%. And we had some
sectors that we're in – some of our manufacturing sectors where we saw double-digit increases. So I think overall that
sector's strong Residential underperformed, and Small C&I continues to underperform for us.
I think we're seeing general, just generally the Chicago economy lagging, what we see nationally. Our foreclosure rates
are higher. Repossessions were up 20% over 2009. Personal bankruptcies is up pretty significantly over 2009.
Disposable income is not up. So we're just seeing general tough economic trends in our region. And the other dynamic
that we think impacted Residential here is we had the hottest July in 15 years, so we had very high bills during the
summer. We saw our call center rate increase by about 23%, and that was driven predominantly by customers
concerned about high bills. So we may have seen a reaction coming off that hot summer so that's the way we're
interpreting it.
We're looking over out to 2011, flat, which is – we revised originally we thought we were going to see a little pick-up
in 2011, but based on this trend with the economy in the Chicago region we're looking to a flat 2011.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Thanks a lot, Anne. Could I just ask on one other topic? We've seen you go from a hedging
position that was well above your ratable plan range to something a little bit closer to that range over the last several
quarters. And your slides make a comment about willing to recognize future upside, et cetera. Should we consider that
where you see the curves today, you're going to continue to hedge slower than plan and allow that trend to continue? Or
do we go ratable from here? What's your current strategy?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: We're mostly ratable but let Ken answer that in
detail.
<A - Kenneth Cornew>: John's right. Jon, we are going to continue our ratable hedging program. As we said before,
we are going to focus on maintaining upside through our product strategies, focusing on the retail market, looking at

and watching very carefully what congestion looks like in the forwards versus what we believe. But we are going to
remain disciplined, and you should expect us to follow close to a ratable plan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Thank you very much. First question that I have is if we go back about a year in time, you had
been originally projecting 5%-type increases in O&M particularly at Exelon Generation. What accounts for the
improvement to what is now a much more favorable level? And does the pension contribution play a significant part in
the growth revision?
<A - Christopher Crane>: This is Chris. Yeah, so the pension has a positive effect overall. You have to first of all go
back to what we did a couple years ago. In 2009, we made a reduction of over 500 head count in the corporate office.
we continued to work on cost containment methodologies. We had some catch-up in certain areas on some
infrastructure spend, but I think overall this year's increase over last, as Matt said, is driven by a couple things, more
refueling, a couple more refueling outages, the wind expense and others. But we feel fairly comfortable with what
we've done in our contracting space and our services space, and what we'll be doing in our labor negotiations to
maintain that 2% going forward.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: In other words, we keep trying.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Second question, the amended rate request at Commonwealth Edison, is that primarily to affect
the full year expected impact of the September court ruling?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Significantly but let's let Anne answer in detail.
<A - Anne Pramaggiore>: I think we also have an adjustment in there based on the bonus depreciation. I think that's a
big driver of that adjustment.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Because I think you had an $18 million number in there as expected for the fourth quarter. So
should the annualized effect be roughly just four times that or $72 million?
<A - Anne Pramaggiore>: What you see in the adjustment is predominantly the bonus depreciation adjustment. That's
mainly what drove it. What's not in there yet is the Appellate Court ruling. That's still sitting with, I think, 326 now so
that still includes the roughly 80 million from the Appellate Court ruling on depreciation.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Okay. So the annual impact is $80 million?
<A - Anne Pramaggiore>: Yeah. And you'll see it. The staff position takes that out.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Got it. If I look at market heat rates, it looks like there's significantly more improvement in
market heat rates in the Mid-Atlantic versus the Midwest from I guess third quarter disclosures versus fourth quarter
disclosures. I would have expected because coal sets the price more of the time in the further west you go that you
would see the opposite trends. So what would you – how do you account for sort of the relative underperformance of
the region that seems to be more coal intensive than the East?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think the answer is you want to get to gas
because it's where you are in the knee on the curve. But Ken Cornew is the expert on knees.
<A - Kenneth Cornew>: Paul, the Mid-Atlantic increases in heat rates in the fourth quarter are largely driven by what
spot prices were doing, driven by coal prices ticking up, also driven by gas bases increases in the East. So really the
driver of the Mid-Atlantic increase was a combination of coal-price pressure and gas-basis pressure. And we didn't see
that. We saw pretty flat coal prices in the Midwest and Powder River Basin coal, so we didn't see as much of an uptick

in heat rates in the Midwest because of that.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Okay. And then I guess my last question is if I look at sort of the effect of the hedges and your
open, coupled with your gross margin numbers, it looks like ExGen would be up a little bit in '13 relative to '12. Is
there anything that we should think about in terms of the utilities whereby – I would guess they should be at least as
strong in '13 as '12? Or is there something there that I'm missing?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I think that you're probably right about PECO.
ComEd has got to get through this existing rate case and either get a more attractive rate regime than other Illinois
utilities have experienced or cut a change understanding with the legislature or else it will have to take more drastic
cost-cutting measurements, including things we really wouldn't like to do. Frank, would you like to pick up the answer
to that? This is Frank Clark.
<A - Frank Clark>: Well, that's comprehensive, John. We won't really know until we get at least a preliminary order
from the hearings down there with respect to the current rate case probably by the end of the first quarter. I'm optimistic
that 2012 and '13 will be solid years for ComEd because I'm very optimistic that we'll either get good regulatory
outcomes or efficiency in cost containment to offset it.
<Q - Paul Fremont>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning, Hugh.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Good morning. I was hoping you might elaborate a little bit on your comments on the EPA and
their forthcoming 316(b) regulations regarding cooling water intake. I guess I'm interested in your views as to what
considerations the EPA might take into account in determining which power plants are having a material ecological
impact on the cooling, on the bodies of water they use for cooling water. How they might differentiate among plants on
this basis? And what their developing thinking might imply for your fleet? Which plants might be most at risk?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'm going to start this and then turn it over to Joe
Dominguez, Hugh. I think it is a mix of analysis over many years plus community activism. And I'll give you two
examples of that. Dominion has put cooling towers in at the Brayton Point Station in New England, the power plant I
watch when I fly to see my mother-in-law because – and of course, used to run and so I pay attention to it. And there,
there were long years of studies on what was happening to the winter flounder population in what I think is called
Mount Hope Bay, and it was sort of the accumulation of those studies over many years that I think motivated both EPA
and Dominion in the ultimate settlement. It was also the value of the plant. There were a couple of plants there that
could support it.
Arguably, you would say the same about Oyster Creek. I mean we thought it should run for another 20 years without
the towers, but there were a lot of people who had studies of different weight in New Jersey saying there was localized
impact in Barnegat Bay, and so you had a lot of political pressure surrounding it. So I think what goes on is a mix of
science and community pressure, and that affects both state regulation and EPA. But, Joe, can you be more wise?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: I don't think so, John. I could use different words but say basically the same thing. I think
what we might say to you is some recognition of sensitive water bodies are going to be treated differently than the
Great Lakes and rivers and so I think EPA is going to pay special attention to estuaries as John just indicated. You may
see a change in the design intake criteria threshold but all of it's going to boil back down to some sort of cost benefit
analysis, we think, on the environmental impact versus the cost of the towers. And EPA is going to, I think, very
carefully look at the fish studies and the other biological impacts in making determinations. The thing that we felt was
very good about Commissioner Jackson's December 16 letter was she clearly ruled out a one-size-fits-all, which would
have been problematic for Exelon, but it would have been very problematic for just about everybody in the industry.

<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'd like to add one thing, Hugh. I'm scampering out
on the limb now and all my lawyers will be frightened, but I like them that way. But EPA, technically, does not mix its
air and water decisions together. They're different statutes, administered by different arms of the agency. But there is an
overriding economic issue here, which is EPA and the Administration are not going to enforce their regulations in a
way that makes two-thirds or three-quarters of the power plants in the country uneconomic.
And the real issue, I think, on water is to get at those that are in the most environmentally sensitive area. And on air, to
shut down the oldest, dirtiest and least economic. And a very strong case can be made and we've helped hire
consultants to do it, that you can replace 20% to 30% of the coal fleet and mostly it can be picked up easily by existing
or new gas-fired capacity. But I don't think once those numbers get up in the 30%, 35% range, the economic costs
become much more challenging and you put too many things together you start to fueling the Tea Party objections to
everything EPA is doing. And so I think you see some rough, practical balance emerge, and I still think that balance
will be good for us.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Just if I could a follow-up question on that. You've said that you think the EPA will pay special
attention to estuaries over rivers and lakes. I guess I haven't spent enough time underwater perhaps, but what is the
difference between estuaries and rivers and lakes in terms of the impact of these cooling water intakes structures?
<A - Joseph Dominguez>: It's fish concentration basically and spawning grounds for fish. So estuaries traditionally
have been very rich habitats for spawning, for fish spawning, so you have an impact on fish larvae that you don't
necessarily see in the Great Lakes or you don't necessarily see in fresh water rivers.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I was going to say we believe like swamps, but I
think Joe's answer was much better.
<Q - Hugh Wynne>: Okay, good. Thank you very much, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Hey, guys, a question for you. Can you give a little bit of an update on the Exelon
transmission? And can we go into a little bit of granularity just in terms of size, scale and timeline for specific projects,
if you know them at this stage? Or at least for kind of when you'll make major – when you'll make significant filings
for projects at either PJM or elsewhere?
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Do my best and then Chris will fill you in a little
more. But we started off with Exelon Transmission looking around the whole country to see if we could find and
develop a number of big for-profit projects. What we found was that the local utilities either want the big projects
themselves or don't have much interest in somebody like us coming in and building them. And the odds of getting a lot
of them done didn't seem too good, so we've sort of narrowed the goals of Exelon Transmission. I think its real
value-add is probably more localized, but we do have one big project, which is the so-called RITE Line that we're
exploring with AEP which would be a very big project to carry power East. And with that, let me let Chris flesh it out.
<A - Christopher Crane>: Yeah, that's the biggest project on the table is the RITE Line that we announced, and we
gave a little bit more color at EEI on it. And we continue to work on the agreements between co-owners and the design
cast. It's a couple of years out for large investment. The most significant thing that we've done with the organization
above and beyond that is building the analytic tools inside the organization to do a larger system planning awareness of
the whole PJM footprint. So we'll continue to work in partnerships with other utilities as opportunities come up.
<Q - Michael Lapides>: Got it. A while back you guys had talked about some of the transmission work in and around
the Chicago area, just kind of a planning I think in case certain coal plants are not operating down the road. Can you
just give an update on where that stands and what the impact of those projects likely would be?

<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: I'll ask Frank or Anne to fill in, but let me say that
ComEd took a look at those projects, realized that there was a significant probability that some of these plants would go
down, and put those transmission projects into its plans. Anne, do you want to be more definitive?
<A - Anne Pramaggiore>: Well, we have a project ongoing right now. We've received our certificate from the
commission, and we're looking to have that major project, building a new substation and some new conductors heading
south of the service territory or south of the city, I should say, through our service territory, and that we're targeting
completion towards the end of this year.

And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning, thank you.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: I wanted to ask you with regards to the Illinois legislation that you guys proposed a
few weeks ago, just one, with regard to timeline there and the expectations for this year. And then secondly with
regards to how that meshes with the Appellate Court case.
<A - John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer>: Only God and Frank Clark are able to make
estimates as to the timeline of the Illinois legislation.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Frank?
<A - Frank Clark>: I'm waiting for God to tell me. The General Assembly, jokes aside, should be out of session; they
should adjourn by the end of May. That often gets delayed a bit, but very likely by the end of May we'll know whether
the – our interest in legislation for formula rates will be received or not. In the meantime, we still have our rate case
going forward, and the timing on that's very similar to the end of May. And we will see. It's impossible to make a
prediction. We've got a strong rate case. And the regulatory results in Illinois have been less than maybe we would
have hoped for in the past, looking at some of the utilities outcomes. I don't want to be overly optimistic. We've
enjoyed a strong results in the General Assembly, but we've also have received something less than that.
So we – my best expectation right now is that we are working very closely with the leadership in the General
Assembly. Anne and John are doing an extraordinary job visiting all of the leaders, all of the decision-makers. They
know exactly what we're trying to do and if they embrace it, we'll get a good outcome. If they don't, we won't. There's
no money being offered to offset anything. It's very straight forward. It's all about economic development. It's directly
related to being a stimulus for State of Illinois and job creation, and I think it's at least received a warm reception. We'll
see what happens when it begins to move in the House and in the Senate.
<A - Stacie Frank, Vice President-Investor Relations>: Operator, I'm going to turn the call over now to John for just
a few final remarks, please.
John W. Rowe, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Our real news today is simply that we beat our earnings forecast again, as we have done quarter-by-quarter through
2010. And we expect to perform equally well in 2011. The important things to remember about Exelon are simple. We
continue to have the best upside in the industry by far. How much is in '14, how much is in '15, how much is in '16,

your guess is probably as good as ours, but nobody else has the same upside and the fully regulated with the high
market-to-book ratios will have real challenges keeping them.
While you're waiting for that upside we give you a 5% dividend. It got even safer with the bonus depreciation. We're
continuing to add capability through our power uprates and as we've shown you by beating our own O&M forecasts,
we continue to have capability to find new ways to save money. We can't manage 2013 or 2014 until we get to them.
We won't have any miracles, but what we do have is the ability to constantly hunt both on the revenue side and the cost
side for new opportunities, $1 million at a time or a $0.01 a share at a time, whatever we can find, we continue to hunt.
We continue to deliver. I have a wonderful management team around me that shares that junkyard dog attitude toward
money. And that's true when we look at acquisitions. It's also true when we look day-to-day. We'll run our models,
you'll run your models. We will beat our models.
