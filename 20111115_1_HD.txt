release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is
provided in the financial statements included with our earnings release.
Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Frank Blake
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone.
Sales for the third quarter were $17.3 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comp sales were positive 4.2%, and our diluted
earnings per share were $0.60. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 3.8%. From a geographic perspective, we saw
positive comps in all but five of our top 40 markets, with particular strength in areas such as our New Jersey and South
Atlantic regions, where there were significant storm impacts.
As Craig will detail, we saw growth not only in storm related product categories but also in our core categories. An
interesting broad indicator of this is that our strongest division for the quarter was our Western division, which was
obviously not affected by Hurricane Irene. We're also pleased that the growth in our overall transaction count has
improved sequentially each quarter this year.
On the international front, our Canadian business had essentially flat comps in the quarter. And our Mexican business
had another quarter of positive comps, making it 32 quarters in a row of positive comp growth, sustained positive
performance quarter over quarter for eight years in a row, a testament to the great job that Ricardo Saldívar and the
team in Mexico are doing.
In the U.S., we still don't see and we don't expect to see in the near term any meaningful tailwind from the housing
market. Inventories remain high. Pricing is under pressure, and credit is still difficult. Private fixed residential
investment, PFRI, as a percent of GDP is still at a historic low. In this type of environment, it is critical that we
effectively invest in our business and keep focused on customer service.
To that end, Marvin and his team rolled out three major initiatives during the third quarter: buy online, pick up in store;
a new scheduling system for our associates; and a new centralized return-to-vendor process. These have involved
significant operational changes in our stores of over a compressed period of time. It's an indication of the effectiveness
of our field leadership team that we could execute these initiatives without significant store disruption. Both the new
scheduling system and the new return-to-vendor process are allowing us to increase customer-facing hours in our stores
at the same time that we're improving overall labor productivity.
Our supply chain investments are also delivering significant benefits for the business. As Carol will discuss, we
leveraged supply chain expenses in the quarter. As you know, last year we completed the build-out of our Rapid
Deployment Centers, RDCs. Not all of those facilities were mechanized from the start. This was a conscious decision
to gain speed in the rollout and to learn about the processes within the RDCs before committing to mechanization.
As we've added mechanization, we're seeing benefits in capacity, efficiency, and accuracy. We're now underway with
mechanizing three more facilities. And by the end of fiscal 2012, eighteen of the nineteen facilities will be mechanized.
Year to date in the U.S., we've handled approximately 65% of our cost of goods through centralized distribution
compared to approximately 25% for all of 2007. We have a goal of 75% by 2015.

On the merchandising front, Craig and his team along with Matt and the IT team continued to make significant progress
on developing tools for our merchandising transformation. If you followed Home Depot for a while, you know that one
of our major areas of opportunity is in upgrading our legacy special order systems. We're now in the midst of a
multiyear initiative to replace the legacy system, not with one major change-out but with a series of incremental
releases. We're about a third of the way through this effort and are very pleased with the success to date. We've
digitized our catalogs and are putting the building blocks of the new order management system in place.
We're also in the midst of a major upgrade of our dot-com platform, which we anticipate completing by the end of this
fiscal year.
But this is not only about technology. There are underlying improvements in our merchandising processes that owe
more to business alignment than technology. We now have a process for developing and executing our off-shelf and
cross-merchandising strategy across the company. This may seem straightforward, but it has involved some
trial-and-error blending of centralized merchandising direction with local entrepreneurial activity. As we've gained
alignment, we're now seeing steady improvement in sales and unit growth from our off-shelf activity as we add more
merchandising excitement and value to our stores.
We will continue to invest in our business to improve customer service and productivity. Along with that, we believe
it's also critical to continue to invest in our associates. Approximately 81% of our stores would qualify for Success
Sharing based on our third quarter results. And our objective is to maintain record levels of Success Sharing payouts to
our hourly associates.
Finally, today our Board and announced a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share. Carol will discuss
our updated capital allocation principles in a few minutes. Our guiding philosophy has been and will continue to be to
maintain discipline on our capital allocation, focus on creating value for our shareholders, and maintain a solid
financial footing for our business on a sustaining basis.
Let me close by thanking our associates for all their hard work and dedication in the third quarter. And with that, let me
turn the call over to Craig.
Craig Menear
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.
Sales in the third quarter were driven by continued strength in the core of the store as well as storm recovery. We saw
growth in both average ticket and transactions during the quarter. Ten of our departments posted positive comps for the
quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were tools, electrical, indoor garden, building
materials, plumbing, and hardware. Paint, flooring, lighting, and kitchen showed positive comps. Comps in lumber,
outdoor garden, bath, and millwork were negative for the quarter.
Cleanup activity from the impacts of Hurricane Irene and the resulting flooding led to strength in storm related products
such as generators, pumps, extension cords, and wet/dry vacs. We also saw continued strength in roofing and gutters as
customers repaired damage from early harsh winter weather. We estimate that the impact of storm related sales to be
approximately a point of comp.
But temperatures normalized after a hot August and we saw customers return to simple outdoor projects and outdoor
living categories. We were particularly pleased to have posted positive comps in categories such as patio furniture,
fireplace, walk-behind mowers, grills, and lawn accessories given the strong performance we saw in outdoor living
categories during the third quarter of 2010. Outdoor projects such as fencing, exterior stains, exterior paint, and
irrigation also performed well in the quarter.
We did see some regional variances. For example, with drought-like conditions in parts of the Southern division, we
saw tough sales of riding mowers and live goods partially offset by strong sales of watering.

The maintenance and repair categories that make up the core of our store continued to perform well. Project basics such
as pipe and fitting, fasteners, air circulation, hand tools, chemicals, caulks, and appliance parts were positive. And as
customers prepared for winter, small maintenance projects like insulation and waterproofing also sold well.
Great brands and innovative products led to positive performance in portable power, power tool accessories, and hand
tools during the third quarter. We offered outstanding values in power tools from brands like Ryobi, Milwaukee,
Makita, RIDGID, and DeWalt. And we are seeing consistent response to these brands from our customers. We have
also seen positive response from our pro customers in hand tools from the Milwaukee and DeWalt lines that are
exclusive to The Home Depot.
We continue to deliver innovation through the extension of our LED light bulb offering for the home. At the beginning
of the third quarter, we added the first two LED bulbs that will fit most customers' recessed cans. Additionally, we just
added the first commercially available 75-watt equivalent LED A-line replacement.
We saw our total transactions grow by 1.2% while average ticket also increased 3% for the quarter. The transactions for
tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were flat for the third quarter. As I mentioned
earlier, we were pleased with our ability to manage effectively against categories that were significant transaction
drivers in the third quarter of 2010.
Transactions for tickets over $900, which also represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.6% in the
third quarter. Strength in roofing and generators contributed to the growth in our average ticket.
During the third quarter, lumber prices were essentially flat to last year. Copper pricing was elevated but began to come
down at the end of the third quarter. The total impact to comp from commodity inflation during the quarter was
approximately 40 basis points.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we're facing the anniversary of the expiration of an energy efficient tax credit
in the U.S. that increased sales in millwork and home services during the fourth quarter of 2010. We're also lapping
strong performance from our gift centers as well as our Black Friday lineup last year. We planned for this and we're
projecting to deliver positive comps in the quarter. We're excited about our decorative holiday and gift center offerings
as well as our Black Friday lineup. We have expanded our LED Christmas lights selection to over 70 different options.
And earlier this month we gave customers rebates for trading in old incandescent strands.
We also have added several new holiday decoration offerings from Martha Stewart. Our gift center offers outstanding
values with strong lineups of hand tools, power tools, safety items, tool storage, and special buys. And finally, we have
a strong lineup of special buys for Black Friday, including appliance offers.
We are excited about the products and values that we have to offer our customers in the fourth quarter. And we invite
you to visit us in store, online, or through our mobile apps to check them out.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone.
In the third quarter, sales were $17.3 billion, up 4.4% from last year. Comps or same-store sales were positive 4.2% for
the quarter, with comps up 5.2% in August, 4.1% in September, and 3.5% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were
positive 3.8% for the quarter, with U.S. comps up 4.5% in August, 3.4% in September, and 3.4% in October.
In the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.4%, an increase of 15 basis points from last year, of which 13 basis points
came from our U.S. business. The gross margin expansion in the U.S. was driven by 26 basis points of benefit arising
from our supply chain transformation, offset in part by a change in the mix of products and services sold as well as
higher shrink compared to last year. For the year, we expect moderate gross margin expansion.

Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 45 basis points to 25.1%. Our expense leverage reflects the
impact of positive sales growth as well as continuing cost control. While we had $26 million of natural disaster expense
arising from storm damage, we leveraged every major expense line in the quarter. For the year, we now expect total
expenses to grow at approximately 20% of our sales growth rate.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter totaled $158 million, slightly higher than last year due to higher debt
levels.
Our income tax provision rate was 35.9% in the third quarter. And earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.60,
up 17.6% from last year.
Now moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarter we opened one new store in Mexico and one new store
in St. Croix. We temporarily closed one store in Binghamton, New York due to flooding damage, and we expect this
store to reopen during the fourth quarter.
At the end of the third quarter, we were operating 2,246 stores, and selling square footage was 235 million. Reflecting
the sales environment, total sales per square foot for the third quarter were $293, up 4.3% year over year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $10.7 billion, down approximately $300
million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.3 times, a modest improvement from last year. We ended the quarter
with $41.5 billion in assets, including $2.2 billion in cash.
In the third quarter, we repurchased $800 million or 23.6 million shares of outstanding stock. Year to date we have
repurchased $3.1 billion or 87 million shares. It is our intent to continue using excess cash to repurchase shares. And
we plan to repurchase approximately $400 million of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on
invested capital was 14.1%, 210 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2010.
On the capital allocation front, we continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach investing in our business and
returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In this regard, we have a few items to
call out. First, year to date we've spent roughly $820 million in capital expenditures, and anticipate that our total capital
spending for fiscal 2011 will approximate $1.250 billion. Second, as Frank mentioned, we just announced a 16%
increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.29 per share. With this, we are lifting our targeted dividend payout ratio to
50%, up from our previous target of 40%. Third, as of the end of the third quarter, we have $6.8 billion remaining in
our share repurchase authorization. It is our intent to use excess cash to repurchase shares and complete the
authorization by the end of fiscal 2014.
And finally, we're assuming a slightly more conservative financial risk profile and are targeting to maintain an adjusted
debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of approximately two times. Our updated shareholder principal guidelines reflect our view that
a solid dividend coupled with prudent use of cash will create the most value for all stakeholders.
Now let me turn to our outlook for the balance of the year. Remember that we guide off of GAAP. Our sales
performance continues to outpace real GDP growth, driven by strength in the core of our store as well as certain
weather related sales and merchandising events. Year to date, our sales have grown by 2.9%. We face a tough sales
comparison in the fourth quarter. But consistent with earlier guidance, we continue to project that our fiscal 2011 sales
will grow by approximately 2.5%. Our business continues to perform to our expectations, and we're seeing positive
comps thus far in November.
Based on our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now project fiscal 2011 earnings per share
to increase approximately 18% to $2.38. While we intend to repurchase $400 million of outstanding shares in the fourth
quarter, given the timing of the repurchases, they won't have a meaningful impact to our full-year EPS guidance. Now
we'll share our 2012 guidance with you during our fourth quarter earnings call, which is scheduled for February 21.
We thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Vicki, we are now ready for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: First question, just delving into the 2.0 debt-to-EBITDAR target, down previously from
2.5%, so I just was curious if you could just spend a little more time talking about that decision. I think the dividend,
after raising the dividend, you get back to a similar capital distribution level in either situation. But I was just curious
what the conversation was among senior management and the Board.
<A - Frank Blake>: Yes, Chris, let me make a general comment and then turn it over to Carol. First, I agree with your
comment in terms of the return of the money to our shareholders. We also looked at the fact that while we've had the
2.5 times guard rail that we described, actually for the last several years we've been running at about two times. So we
thought that it was better just in terms of transparency to say here's what we think is the right target for us going
forward. And obviously, as our earnings improve that we'll have capacity for additional debt. Carol?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right, and you've seen that this year. We raised $1 billion of incremental debt earlier in the year
while maintaining that two times ratio. So looking ahead as our earnings grow, it gives us more borrowing capacity and
financial flexibility.
We also think in this low growth economic environment, a solid financial condition is a competitive advantage, and
we're really pleased with where we are. Now you might say gosh, interest rates are low. Don't you have an opportunity
to borrow? Our perspective is interest rates will remain low for a while, so there's no hurry to rush out to the market.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And then as a follow-up on the expense side, if you backed out that $23 million or $26
million, it looks like you would have leveraged SG&A about 60 basis points, so I was just curious if there was any
incentive comp drag in there. And also, should we think about 20 basis points of SG&A leverage per point of comp? It
was a bit lower, so I was just trying to figure it out there. Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. In the third quarter our expenses grew at about 59% of our sales growth rate, and there are
a couple of factors you need to keep in mind. First, we did have $26 million of natural disaster expense arising from
flooding. And then last year, as you may recall, we had a $20 million gain on the sale of real estate that didn't repeat
this year, so there is a little bit of year-over-year distortion. For the full year, we're expecting our expenses to grow at
about 20% of our sales growth rate. And that's a real tribute to just the great work that the team is doing in driving
productivity in all expense lines.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thank you.
<A - Frank Blake>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Good morning. I wanted to actually follow up on the capital allocation first. Carol, you
said that you thought 2.0 was "the right leverage ratio." I think the academic work would suggest that that's probably
not the optimal cost of capital for a company like you. So how are you arriving at 2.0 as the right?
And then just to follow up on that, is there any sense here that you want to keep a more conservative ratio for either
economic reasons because you're uncertain about the future or a more conservative ratio so that you have maybe some

dry powder for expansion outside the U.S. outside of North America? I know you've talked about potentially
acquisitions down the road so you have capacity if you wanted to do something like that.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It's such a great question in terms of the right ratio because all day long from an academic
perspective, we should say that really we should put a lot more leverage into our capital structure, perhaps go down to a
BBB rating or less to optimize the weighted average cost of capital. And yet when you look at it, you really believe that
you can create shareholder value that way. We think that by maintaining an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of two
times, we're projecting growth in 2012 and beyond. That's going to add additional borrowing capacity into our capital
structure, afford us a tremendous amount of financial flexibility.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: And what is that financial flexibility for? I guess that was my second question.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: As you know, we're investing our capital in our existing business. And as we think about
financial flexibility, what our actions have shown us is that we use it for the shareholders. So when we borrowed $1
billion this year, we returned that to the shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase.
<A - Frank Blake>: I would also say, Colin, this is not a signal that there's something different in our minds
internationally or anything like that. In fact, this is really just a slight move from what we've previously said and no
move at all from what we've been doing over the last three years.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Okay. I'm still not sure I'm certain of the thinking there, but a second quick follow-up.
Just in terms of your comments around the tough sales compare, are you seeing any impact yet from anniversarying the
tax credits in some of those categories?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: If I could just jump in and then Craig will comment, November is our toughest comparison, as
you know, and we're positive comping thus far this month. If you look at the performance by category, millwork is one
of our softest categories.
<A - Craig Menear>: We're definitely seeing the pressure from the growth in millwork last year versus this year. It
was one of the areas that we negative comped in, in the third quarter. And we anticipate that it will be a very tough
comp in the fourth quarter based on the overlap of the tax credit.
<Q - Colin A. McGranahan>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Craig Menear>: Thanks.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: First just a question on the comp progression for the quarter. So you indicated that weather – and
I'm assuming you're mostly talking about the hurricane. So as you look at the comp progression for the quarter, was the
majority of that weather benefit then in the month of August early in the quarter?
<A - Frank Blake>: Yes, it was.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Okay, so basically the comps have progressed evenly through the quarter. The second question, I
just wanted to ask a question on the capital allocation discussion today. The timing, you made the announcement today
on the dividend and the targeted debt ratios. As you decide to do this, is this more a reflection of what you're seeing
inside your business, inside The Home Depot enterprise, or is it more a reflection of external factors that you decided
this now?

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Generally, we've been on a cadence of lifting the dividend every year in the January – February
timeframe. As we sat back and looked at the performance of the business, the confidence that we have in all the
initiatives that we've got underway and our prospects for the future, we said there's no better time then to lift the
dividend. Now, you shouldn't expect us to lift the dividend again in January or February of 2012. You should expect us
to come back at the end of 2012 or the beginning of 2013 to look to lift the dividend again. We thought there was no
better time.
We also just wanted to add a little bit more definition around the targeted adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio. I can't tell
you the number of times we get asked when are you going to lever up to 2.5 times. We set 2.5 times as a cap, not a
target. We are now setting two as the target and we will maintain the target.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Thank you.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Michael Lasser with UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Carol, you set me up. When are you going to lever up to 2.5 times lease-adjusted debt to
EBITDAR, I guess? The strategy makes sense. You weren't getting credit for keeping it at or below two times, so now
you're merely signaling that that's what you're going to do. But are there certain triggers for – so if you started to see
4% comp growth for an extended period of time like you have?
<A - Frank Blake>: Look, Michael, that's a great question, a great comment. These things are situational. So as the
situation changes, we could obviously change what our target is. But as Carol said, we thought for the purposes of
transparency, it was better to say this is what we've been doing for the last three years. We don't see this changing
going forward, but we do see if circumstances change and growth starts to accelerate a lot more, then you might have a
different answer.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Great, understood. And then on the promotional side, is there a philosophy to promote to the
comp? And by that I mean do you anticipate that you – you anticipated that you have a difficult fourth quarter
comparison. So does that mean that you're intentionally planning some activities to comp the comp, and is that different
than how you've been in the past?
<A - Craig Menear>: Michael, we're always trying to build the business to drive comp performance year over year.
And I think the key focus that we've been trying to have for the past several years is to drive everyday great value for
our customers, to build our business bay by bay so that we're driving consistent performance. Certainly, we go in and
we create events. We're conscious of the fact that we need to in total cover that volume, but it doesn't necessarily mean
that it's going to cover in that category.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, let me sneak one last one in here. Of the three initiatives that were completed or near
completion during the third quarter, have there been incremental costs associated with those activities such that we
should see some benefit to the cost structure moving forward?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: This is Marvin. From a cost standpoint, the answer is no real incremental costs. These are
big initiatives, and the goal is to hit our 60:40 ratio of service and task, so the goal primarily is to drive productivity.
We believe that we're going to see productivity improvements in the short term, but more productivity improvements
will be in 2012 and going forward.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And if I could just jump in, some of the cost that we did experience was capitalized cost
associated with new technology. So if you look at our capital spending, it's up year on year, and most of that delta is in
the area of technology.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: That's it, thank you very much.

Next we'll hear from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Thank you very much, two questions. First going to the capital allocation, when you look at
your capital allocation, who are you benchmarking against to make some of these decisions?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We look at the world is the broad answer. It's hard to look at a retailer to say aha, this is the
company that we want to emulate. So we look broadly at the Dow group of companies, the S&P group of companies.
There are some really good stories out there to follow. One good story would be McDonald's. We love what
McDonald's has done, but there are other companies as well.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: All right. I guess in the past you had – I think, Frank, you had mentioned at one point
JCPenney, but they seem to have changed strategies pretty dramatically I think over the years as well. But I guess the
other question...
<A - Frank Blake>: They may be in the process of doing that.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Yes, exactly. One other, if you mentioned it I missed it. Talking about appliances, it seems to
have been a very volatile category in the third quarter in that there seems to have been winners and losers throughout
the industry. I'm just trying to get a sense where you guys – how you guys did in that area.
<A - Craig Menear>: We were mid-single-digit negative in appliances.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: Do you think you gained or lost share?
<A - Craig Menear>: We believe we lost just a little bit of share in the quarter.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: And when you're losing share there, do you think it's because of just an unwillingness to
match on price? Do you think there's anything structural there, or do you think it was just around near-term pricing?
<A - Craig Menear>: I don't think there's anything structural there. I think it's just there's activity in the marketplace.
We have a portfolio strategy. We're comfortable with the position that we take in appliances, not looking to be the
leader in that business.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I think that's the key, isn't it, Craig? We're number three and we're happy being number three.
<A - Craig Menear>: Right.
<Q - David S. Strasser>: All right, great. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

Next we'll hear from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mike Allen Baker>: Hi. Thanks, guys. So I'll ask one question and a follow-up. The question just on the cadence
of the buybacks, so I think you're saying about $3.5 billion this year. And then the $6.8 billion through 2014 equates to
something in the $2.3 billion range, so a significant slowdown. I guess the question is, is there upside to that number, or
is it really just a signal that you're just going to be buying back less annually?
And then I'll ask my follow-up up front. It would relate again to the appliance business. So I think H.H. Gregg and
Sears were pretty aggressive in the quarter. What are you seeing in November, particularly from your biggest
competitor, in terms of pricing in general, but specifically on appliances as they seem to be signaling a more aggressive
posture? Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So I'll start with the cadence on the buybacks. We gave some color today hoping it would help
you build your models. The way I would think about it is we're spending $2.5 billion with cash generated from the

business to buy back shares this year. So you should assume at least $2.5 billion next year. That would mean $2.5
billion in 2013, the remaining $1.4 billion in 2014. However, as we just talked about, with increased earnings we will
have borrowing capacity, just like we did this year. We raised $1 billion that takes us to the full $3.5 billion. So as we
look at next year, we'll have borrowing capacity, which would allow us to accelerate some of the share repurchases.
I don't want to tell you the day, the time as we sit here in November because we want to be opportunistic in terms of
debt capital raising. But there is clearly an opportunity to accelerate it, but hopefully this is helpful from a modeling
perspective.
<Q - Mike Allen Baker>: Very, thank you.
<A - Craig Menear>: On the appliance front, we've seen the market be fairly aggressive in this category. We see that
it's off to a strong start in terms of the promotional activity, if you will, in the business as we head into the holiday
season here. We're candidly pretty comfortable with the plans that we've put together for the business in the fourth
quarter. So again, it fits within – our plans fit within our portfolio strategy overall.
<Q - Mike Allen Baker>: Thank you.

Next we'll hear from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Good morning and thank you. Carol, I guess just first question would be around inventory. Can
you maybe talk about the decline in the quarter and how you guys are viewing inventory overall, and then maybe
highlight some categories where you're being either more conservative or more opportunistic?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We're thrilled with our inventory performance, and we've just spent a lot of money
transforming our supply chain, so we're hoping to see this come through. As you know, we have committed to get a full
turn of improvement over the next several years. If you look at where we are seeing it, part of it is really just in terms of
the quality of the inventory. Our clearance levels are as low as they have ever been in our company history. And then,
Craig, you might want to give some color on just how we're going about forecasting.
<A - Craig Menear>: Sure, all of the tools that we've been building and putting in place, the new forecasting system
that was put into place has helped us better manage the inventory on a day-in day-out basis. We've obviously worked
hard over the past several years to do a much better job of managing our seasonal inventory. But now we're seeing
benefits come through in our basic categories as a result of these tools that we've put into play. Obviously, the RDC
allows us to effectively put inventory where it's needed with the last-minute allocation that's put into place. So it's all of
these elements that are coming together that are helping us leverage the inventory investment.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And then if I could just jump in, I would say in-store execution is also helping. So Marvin, you
might want to give a couple comments about Power Pack Down and what we do there.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Dennis, as a little bit of perspective, when product comes from the RDC, over 80% goes
directly from receiving to the sales floor. I've been here over nine years, and that's a big difference from what we've
seen in the past. If you walk our stores today, as Carol mentioned, you will see less product in the overhead than in the
history of the company. It's not because we are doing anything other than getting the right product to the right place at
the right time, and we have some very fundamental things that we're doing in the store just to keep the product on the
shelf, stay in stock so we can limit the amount of inventory and have product on the shelf for the customers to buy. It's
a very fundamental approach, but the RDC and the technology Craig mentioned allows us to do this much better than
we ever have before.
<A - Craig Menear>: Dennis, the most important thing is the fact that when we look at inventory productivity, that is
always measured against in-stock. And so we're constantly making sure that as we look at the investments we're
making in the inventory that that is balanced by the fact that we have to continue to improve our in-stock position for
our customers, which we have.

<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay. And so the follow-up on that would be I guess, Carol, do you have a target of where
you'd like to end this year on inventory? And then bigger picture as you continue to refine the distribution network,
working capital was a nice swing this year versus last. Any general thoughts on how we could think about that in 2012,
can you continue to strip working capital out of the business in total?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, so we should show some modest improvement in inventory turns year on year by the end
of the year. That certainly is our target and we're on path to deliver that. As we look to 2012, we'll give you more color
in February, but I can tell you we're building our plans right now and we're building working capital as a source of cash
for 2012.

Next we'll hear from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys, Scot Ciccarelli.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Hey, Scot.
<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning, Scot.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: When you look at the different size buckets that you guys lay out for us, I think it's interesting
that you've had actually a pretty nice gain in three of the last four quarters. Not necessarily intuitive given what we're
seeing in the broader housing market, and I get the fact that stuff like storms can certainly help and skew the data a
little bit. But are you guys seeing or do you sense there's a little bit of change in consumer appetite for bigger projects,
or have three of the last four quarters just had its own unique aspects?
<A - Frank Blake>: I think what's happening is, as you mentioned, certainly as I called out, roofing, generators, those
type of things that are storm related certainly help. But the fact that we had a positive comp growth in our kitchen
business again is an indication of the work that we've done to really develop the business, give value to the customer
across any way they want to buy a kitchen, whether that's in stock, take it home today; special order; have their cabinets
refaced. All those being positive, being a bigger ticket sale has contributed to the past few quarters in terms of the
big-ticket growth. And candidly there, that's an area where we're taking share because the industry itself isn't growing
from everything we can gather from our supply base.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The other thing, we've just stood up a new consumer insights team, and we're getting some very
interesting data. If you look at the third quarter, both our transactions and our ticket grew, as you know. But when you
break it down between consumers and pro, we saw an increase in transactions and ticket for the consumer. But in the
pro, transactions were down but the ticket was way up. So the pro who's shopping with us is more sticky and is buying
more with us.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Interesting, and then just any thoughts or color regarding year-over-year comparisons for that
big-ticket bucket? Obviously, you were up I think it was north of a 9% increase last year in the fourth quarter.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The fourth quarter was a strong quarter...
<A - Frank Blake>: It was a very strong quarter last year.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: ...if we could anniversary that.
<A - Frank Blake>: And again, as I mentioned, we were aware that we have to deliver upon those comps. We've built
programs across the store to be able to do that. There are businesses, for example, where the continued development of
LED helps drive increase in ticket inside of that category. Lithium tools, for example, carry a higher ticket than NiCad

Next we'll hear from Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi, good morning. It's Dan Binder. I just wanted to jump back to the competitive landscape
for a minute. Your main competitor is shifting more towards EDLP. I'm just curious if you're feeling compelled or
seeing any need to price-match in certain areas of the store. And there also seems to be a little bit more of an emerging
online growth by some other players, and I'm just curious how you're viewing the online opportunity longer term. I
know you're investing a lot in that currently.
<A - Craig Menear>: So first and foremost from a go-to-market strategy, ground zero for us is our portfolio strategy.
We always go back to our portfolio strategy. What is it we want to stand for? How do we drive the business? That
determines both assortment strategy as well as our go-to-market pricing strategy in the business. We've been focused
for a number of years on driving to everyday great value for our customer. That remains our focus. Certainly, we have
categories like appliances where the industry still remains promotional. It's difficult to break those businesses, as hard
as we're trying. But our focus is really on trying to drive great value for our customers every day.
When we look at competition, we look at competition across a broad segment. It's not just our largest competitor in this
space. We compete against multiple people, independents as well as online competitors. And we're constantly looking
at how we react to the market. Again, our portfolio strategy guides where we react and how we react and to what depth
we react in a given category. But that's a constant monitoring, both brick-and-mortar retail as well as online retail, and
making adjustments in our business to make sure that we're delivering value for our customers.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. So I guess with that said, are you finding that you're having to do any material price
matching activity? Is that seeing any kind of increases, or are you doing it in the aisles before the customer approaches
you?
<A - Craig Menear>: Yes, I haven't seen in our numbers any dramatic change in competitive price-match data. We are
constantly monitoring the market on a weekly basis, proactively making adjustments in our business as we need to.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We view broad discounting with a great deal of caution. And we have competitors who do offer
broad discounts like with their private label cards or something like that, and we aren't seeing that we have to match
that.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Dan, this is Marvin. There's really great alignment between the store operators and Craig's
field merchandising team. We're keenly aware of all of our competitors, but we have not seen any major changes in
price match, not in the near term or even in the past. We're just very consistent with how we run our business. And as
Craig mentioned, the portfolio strategy is the cornerstone, and we provide input into that.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great, thank you.
<A - Craig Menear>: Thanks, Dan.

Next we'll hear from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning.
<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: You've shown I think what you characterized as a little bit better sales growth than the market.
You've done better on expenses and better on gross margin. I guess I'm curious as you think about 2012, the
sustainability of what looks to have been some outperformance relative to the market, maybe even relative to your
targets across those three areas.
<A - Frank Blake>: Eric, our job is to continue to invest in the business so that we position ourselves to continue to
gain market share. We don't stop. It wasn't like 2010 or 2011 we look at as one-off years. It's a sustaining effort, and
that's really the purpose behind our investments on the supply chain, merchandising tools, and on the operational side.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We're on a path to reach a 10% operating margin by 2013.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: As you think about 4Q, you have characterized it as a tougher comparison and seem to be
framing that the market share gains or the upside sales performance may take a pause in the fourth quarter. I guess I'd
be interested if you could broaden your thoughts on that, if that's a one-quarter event. Or if not, the comparisons are
tougher, so we're going to see more in line with the market type of sales performance.
<A - Frank Blake>: Yes, I think if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2010, it was a significant outperformance in
2010 and, as we called out at the time, around our seasonal and appliance offerings. We know, as Craig said, that's in
our plans for how we approach the fourth quarter, but that delta performance was probably a one-off in that quarter.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It's also the impact of the energy tax credit. In the fourth quarter of last year, we estimated it
drove about 40 to 50 basis points of comp in the fourth quarter. As we've reflected on it and done additional work, we
think it was even a bigger contribution. So that's not repeating this year.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And then one other follow-up, on the gross margin line, impact of inflation, did you see any
negative impact or notable impact on profitability from inflation in the quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We didn't. We would have called it out had we seen that.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay, great. Thank you.

<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Hey, TJ. Good morning
<Q - Thomas J. McConville>: Hi, guys. Carol, you mentioned quickly in passing the consumer insights team and
what you're finding with your pro customer in reference to ticket and traffic. I would love to hear any of the other
findings that you've had so far with that program as to maybe within the pro, what the category changes have been,
maybe if you're gaining share there or anything that you've found early days so far.
<A - Frank Blake>: So TJ, as Carol referenced and if you take a step back, we have had an outside third-party firm
that was helping us do consumer insights. We've now shifted and have that capacity in-house. And some of the very
basic data is what we're just getting now, but it is just starting now; so around the very broad, hey, here's what your
pros are doing, here's what your consumers are doing. So we really don't have additional items to share with you all.
<Q - Thomas J. McConville>: Okay, fair enough. We'll look forward to hearing those data. And then secondly,
Marvin, you mentioned earlier you're still looking towards 60:40 customer-facing to task. Where do you stand today?
And how much more of these three initiatives do you have to roll out in the next quarter, and where do you think you'll
stand after that?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: TJ, we're going to end the year at roughly 55%, and we're very pleased with that. The reason
we started this a few years back, we were at 47% service to task, so we'll end this year at 55%. We think that we'll get
north of 60% within the next 16 months.
My team is responsible for working cross-functionally with Matt Carey's IT team, with Craig's team to lay out
initiatives for the upcoming years to keep this process going. We don't see it as an endpoint. We see it as a continuous
point of improvement, so we have initiatives that actually go through 2015. We're going to continue to drive
productivity. We have a very simple philosophy of trying to take task out of the store while driving productivity
concurrently.
And we've been very pleased with our payroll leverage and our ability to reduce overall payroll yet add hours to the
sales force. So we're increasing coverage for service while reducing overall payroll because we're eliminating some of
the tasks that in the past dominated all of our payroll spend.
<Q - Thomas J. McConville>: Okay. Thanks much, best of luck on the rest of the year.

<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Maybe if we could build on that, if you look at all the work you've done on the RDCs and
distribution in general, but then combining it with what Marvin just talked about holistically on the efficiency of hours
and tasking in the store, given the stage of all the work that you've done over several years, how should we think about
the rate of change for both gross and leverage or just operating margin benefits of all that efficiency work in aggregate
the last couple years versus the next couple going forward?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You'll recall when we had our Investor Day back in 2010, we said we'd get 40 basis points of
margin expansion off of the supply chain. I think there is more upside opportunity to this than down just looking at the
performance for the past two quarters, which gives us just a tremendous amount of confidence and our trek towards that

10% operating margin that we really believe we'll deliver by 2013.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Okay. Is the efficiency more targeted at just pure flow-through of gross, or is it what it allows
you to do labor-wise in the store, or is that changing at all?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I commented on the gross margin aspect on the labor productivity. You're seeing it today. We
leveraged hourly payroll in the quarter by about 38 basis points, so it was the key driver of the leverage that we
experienced. And supply chain is a piece of this. All the new tools that Marvin and the team have introduced is another
piece of it.

Next we'll hear from Greg Melich with ISI.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi, thanks, two quick questions. One, could you just give us the actual numbers for the comp
traffic and ticket in the U.S.?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The actual numbers for the comp in the U.S., the comp ticket was up 2.7%, and the transactions
up 1.1%.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: On a comp basis?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And the second is on SG&A. Carol, if I take the guidance of growing 20% of sales and just use
your 2.5% for the year, I get deleverage in the fourth quarter. Is that because last year was so strong and that's just the
flow-through to the SG&A side, or is there something else that we're missing there?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: There are probably some modeling nuances going on because we're showing that we will
leverage expenses in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Got it.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. And then quickly then, credit, do you have the update on the credit penetration,
particularly given the strength in large ticket transactions?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, we're very pleased with how our private label credit card is performing in this
environment. We saw a slight tick down in penetration, about 17 basis points, to 22.7%. But the reason why I say we're
very encouraged and pleased with the performance is simply when we look at new accounts.
As you may recall, we have a consumer card and a pro card, and 70% of the penetration is on the consumer, 30% on
the pro. If we look at approval rates for our professional contractors, they're up 300 basis points year over year. That's
great news because you know how important the pro is to us. It's great.
If we look at approval rates for the consumer, however, they're down about 400 basis points. And the reason why
they're down is because of the requirements pursuant to the CARD Act and the ability to pay. It's very cumbersome to
apply for a consumer card in our stores. And it's cumbersome on our part. It's cumbersome on the part of our
underwriter.
So we have a number of changes underway to make it less cumbersome, and we believe that will help increase the
approval rates. It's not that the quality of the applicants is bad. It's just that they don't have all the information necessary

to get approved. Now, our approval rates are still pretty good. They're 71%, so that's still pretty good. But we think if
we simplify it, we'll get it even better.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: Vicki, we have time for one more question.
Operator
All right. With that being said, we'll take our last question. We'll take that question from Kate McShane from Citi
Investment Research.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Frank Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: I was wondering if there was any more commentary about the successes that you're
seeing with the buy online, pick up in store, and if you've seen any increase in conversion and as you get more people
in the store with this initiative.
<A - Frank Blake>: We're pleased with how our total online business is progressing. We have currently about 9.5
million visitors to our site a week, which compares to about 6.5 million back in 2009. We continue to add SKUs to our
business overall. We're north of roughly 300,000 SKUs at year end. And we made a number of changes to our site, as
you probably have seen. So we're very pleased with the progress. We're obviously making an investment in our
operating system right now, but our business hasn't reached $1 billion in total yet.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Kate, this is Marvin. We're very pleased just with the alignment. We talk about alignment a
lot, and we think that is a powerful component of success in our business. With the IT team, with Craig's team, with the
dot-com team, we have spent a lot of time ensuring that we benchmark really good retailers not only in the U.S. but in
Europe on how this process should work. The rollout was very smooth. The reception from our associates and
customers have been very good, and we're excited about how well the stores are executing and how well the customer
service feedback is coming back to us on how easy the process is and how transparent it is. So, so far, we're very
pleased.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Frank Blake>: Great, thank you, Kate.
Diane Dayhoff
Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking with you throughout the quarter and in our
fourth quarter earnings call, which will be in the month of February.
Operator
