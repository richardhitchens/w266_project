During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings
materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles
used by other companies. Unless otherwise specified, 2014 growth rates referred to on this call are pro forma for the
Bresnan transaction, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2012. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call
and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. And with that, I'll turn
the call over to Tom.

Thanks, Stefan. Our strategy to deliver superior products at attractive prices continues to resonate with consumers.
Charter Spectrum products are now in over 85% of our customers' households. The continued strength in our customer
relationship, revenue and cash flow growth reflects the success of our product. And our service metrics, customer
satisfaction and churn rates are all improving. And we will launch new products that leverage the superiority of our
network and that will translate into more revenue and EBITDA for home passed. Charter remains in an excellent
position to grow its business organically via additional market share gains, with or without M&A.
During the first quarter, we added 86,000 new residential customer relationships and over the last 12 months we've
grown our residential customer base by 4.5%. Residential PSUs grew by 160,000 during the quarter. Over the last 12
months, we've grown expanded basic video relationships and we still expect to add video relationships for the full year.
In the first quarter, we lost 7,000 video customers and we added 125,000 broadband customers. Our broadband
penetration is now at over 40% of our homes passed and today about 85% of our residential Internet customers
subscribe to tiers that provide 60 megabits or more.
During the first quarter, revenue grew by 7.3%. Excluding advertising revenue, total revenue grew by 7.6%, faster than
last year's first quarter. Residential revenue growth also improved year-over-year, growing 6.7% and we're growing
faster with less reliance on annual price increases. And adjusted EBITDA grew by 7% when excluding Comcast
transaction transition expenses. Our first quarter results continued to demonstrate the sustainable growth profile of our
operating strategy.
It also demonstrate Charter's cash flow potential with all-digital behind us excluding transaction related expenses,
EBITDA less capital expenditures, increased by more than $250 million versus last year's first quarter.
Looking specifically at video, during the first quarter we made a few operational changes, including a tightened credit
policy. And we didn't have the prior year benefit of all-digital which drove bulk upgrades and a reduction in
unauthorized customers last year. In the coming months, we'll be launching our new cloud-based user interface,
Spectrum Guide, in markets like Reno and St. Louis. Spectrum Guide works on nearly all of our boxes and makes
content search and discovery easier and fully enables our on-demand offering.
Results in Fort Worth, the test market have been positive. Over the coming months, we'll increase the number of
on-demand titles we have on our set-top boxes and on the Charter TV App by a factor of three. In coming months, we'll
also see the wider rollout of our Worldbox, our new more advanced and less expensive downloadable security
infrastructure, in several markets. So our video product, which is fully competitive today, continues to improve, and
with Spectrum Guide and other features, it will get even better throughout the year, offering a rich, fully-featured video
package that is superior to the competition at a highly attractive price.
We believe that most consumers want fully-featured video products. Those fully-featured video products are at the
heart of our video business today, and we believe they'll be at the core of our video business well into the future. And
we expect growth in video in 2015 despite the continued pressure on pay TV customer growth. That pressure is coming
from weak household formation, higher content costs and other entertainment diversions.
Given all the reporting on a possible à la carte services and smaller package offering, we've been considering ways to
provide compelling services and packages at lower retail price points with a lower content cost structure, and with the

inclusion of direct-to-consumer services, all in an offering that satisfies the unserved marketplace. If we can create a
new video product that offers real value to the segment we target and that customers will stick with, that also gives us
some opportunity to upgrade customers to our fully-featured video product as consumer needs change. And obviously
we'll do it if we can. We haven't found that product mix yet, and we don't think anyone else has either. Therefore we
remain focused on the opportunity to provide high quality television service with a modern user interface to all our
passings and grow our video business further.
Turning to commercial, in early March we reorganized and rebranded our commercial services under the Spectrum
brand and launched a new pricing and packaging structure for the small and medium business segments. That
structure's intended to provide better products and greater value to small and medium business customers and to drive
deeper product penetration at the point of connect with manageable price step-ups over time, very similar to what we've
done in the residential marketplace. We're already selling more and we expect this new pricing and packaging to
reaccelerate the financial growth of our commercial services unit as it has our residential business. The entire business
telecom market footprint remains a very significant growth opportunity for Charter.
I'd like to make a few comments on our recently terminated transaction with Comcast. As a company we put a
significant amount of time and effort and money into completing our transaction with Comcast. Obviously we're
disappointed that our transactions did not close.
But I'm pleased that we continue to grow our core business, and we've put ourselves in a better position to acquire the
6.5 million unserved passings in our footprint. And to acquire other passings in a disciplined manner consistent with
our goal of delivering competitive products and high quality service at attractive price points to drive market share,
cash flow, and shareholder value.
Our agreement with Advance/Newhouse requires that we negotiate in good faith upon the termination of the Comcast
transaction, and we're doing that. There isn't more that I'll say beyond that, except I want to compliment the quality of
the Bright House assets and the management team, as we already have.
And with that I'll turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. And turning to slide three of today's presentation; as Tom mentioned, we grew residential PSUs by
160,000 during the quarter. And in video we lost 7,000 residential customers, compared to 2,000 non-bulk video
customer net adds in the prior period. This slight decline was related to the factors Tom described and has not
dampened our full year outlook for video.
In residential Internet we added 125,000 customers, and we grew residential voice customers by 42,000. Over the last
year our residential customer base grew by 254,000 or 4.5% for the last year. And at the same time first quarter
residential ARPU rose by 1.8% year-over-year, driven by sell-in, step-ups and a lower level of annual rate increases for
the reasons I mentioned on the last quarterly call.
Despite good triple play sell-in we continue to have a fair amount of single play Internet, which pulls on the average
ARPU. As slide five shows our customer growth combined with our ARPU growth resulted in year-over-year
residential revenue growth of 6.7%, compared to 6.5% one year ago, again with lower rate increases this year.
Looking at commercial we added 21,000 PSUs. Commercial revenue grew by approximately 15%, driven primarily by
small and medium businesses. Excluding the lower growth hospitality video business, telecom revenue grew by 17%.
As Tom mentioned we recently re-branded our commercial services unit to Spectrum, with some associated cost in the
quarter. And we launched new pricing and packaging to the small and medium business segment. We're already seeing
a significant sales uplift at the new price points.
Our advertising revenue declined by about 2% year-over-year. And in total revenue was up by 7.3% in the first quarter,
and excluding advertising revenue, total revenue grew by 7.6%.

Turning to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide six. Total operating expenses grew by $127 million or
8.9% year-over-year. And transition costs related to our transactions with Comcast accounted for about $21 million of
that $127 million. Excluding transition costs total expenses grew 7.4% year-over-year with total programming expense
growing by $60 million. And that accounted for about half of the year-over-year increase in total operating expense.
The 10% increase in programming was driven by contractual rate increases, about 1% growth in our expanded video
customer base over the last year, and higher penetration of our tiers, broader carriage, and the launch of new channels.
Costs to service customers, which includes field operations, customer care, and network operations cost, grew by 5%
year-over-year, driven by a similarly larger cost in customer base.
Other costs grew by $23 million or 12.6% year-over-year, driven by higher labor costs to support commercial, some
additional administrative labor expense, and an increased bad debt. Excluding transition cost, adjusted EBITDA grew
by $54 million in the quarter or 7% year-over-year with a lower level of rate increases. So our first quarter operating
results were solid and generally as we expected.
Moving to slide eight. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $351 million or 15% of revenue, including $14 million
which was related to the Comcast transactions. Much of the transition capital we've spent won't in fact be lost, as we
needed to accelerate platform investments that would have occurred over the next couple of years anyway.
Either way the significant year-over-year decline in CapEx was driven by the completion of all-digital during the fourth
quarter of last year. And we continue to expect approximately $1.7 billion in capital expenditure in 2015, excluding
spending related to acquisitions.
If you just look at the EBITDA and CapEx excluding transition expenses, the increased contribution to cash flow was
$256 million in the quarter. That said we generated $101 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, compared to $74
million last year. The free cash flow that I mentioned was offset by $35 million of transition expenses and CapEx, I
mentioned a moment ago, M&A expenses, which are included below adjusted EBITDA in other expenses, and $36
million of cash interest paid during the quarter for the $7 billion of escrowed Comcast transaction debt.
But the biggest driver was first quarter trade working capital as we saw a significant decline in accruals and payables
for CapEx year-over-year, which was a one-time reversal for the all-digital build. So absent that roughly $80 million
impact in the quarter, which was $150 million year-over-year working capital swing, our business trends should
provide us with a slight working capital benefit on a 12-month rolling basis going forward as they normally do with a
lot of seasonality in the quarters between.
Turning to our balance sheet, our current leverage ratio is 4.4 times on an LTM basis within our target leverage range.
And including the impact of our recent debt refinancings, our current weighted average borrowing cost is now 5.2%. I
won't go through all of our tax assets again, but we believe we've constructed a very attractive capital structure profile
that supports our operating strategy.
And with that, operator, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks. I just had two quick questions. In your prepared remarks, Mr. Rutledge, you
talked about direct-to-consumer offerings that you were exploring. I just never heard that phrase. I was wondering if
you could just elaborate on what that is?
And then second on the CapEx front, can you just provide maybe a little bit of color in terms of why the $1.7 billion is
still the correct number for the full year given the sharp drop off in the first quarter? Thanks.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: All right, Jason. Well, the direct-to-consumer notion in my script was really about a
provider of over-the-top services like Netflix or now in the case of HBO or Hulu or others like that where the purveyor
of the content has a direct relationship with the customer. And so what I was saying was that our view is that we can
mix those products into products that we sell to satisfy the entire customers' video needs.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: And does that – when you say direct-to-consumer, does that imply outside your
footprint as well? Or you're only envisioning DTC within your footprint?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I can't hear him.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Are you talking about – yes, go ahead.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: The question was whether direct-to-consumer implies inside of our footprint or also
outside of our footprint?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: No. I'm assuming that products can be built, which would be sold by us inside our
footprint but would also contain products that are sold outside our footprint delivered by the Internet.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Understood. Okay.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Generally, but not necessarily.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Understood.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And, Jason, on CapEx, $1.7 billion Q1 in cable tends to be a little bit light and
seasonal, and that's no different here. We also benefited inside of Q1 coming off of all-digital with higher inventory
levels. But we think that $1.7 billion is still a fair estimate for the full year, and when you take a look around, Q1
always tends to be a little bit lighter than usual.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Thanks. Maybe we could just explore the subscriber, the video subscriber trends a little bit
here in the first quarter. It sounds like trend's coming down, so if you guys were a little light it was on the new
connects. And you mentioned a couple of things, but if you could maybe sort of give us an indication of sort of the
weightings of each. But you said tighter credit standards, maybe incremental competition from sort of non-traditional
guys because with the all-digital transition and I would say less competition from AT&T, are we expected somewhat
higher numbers? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So, John, this is Tom. I think there are several factors. One, you've got to understand
where we were and what our planning was. We were getting ready for a big integration. We also had come off...
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Right.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: ...the all-digital project, while it has benefits to consumers and even benefits to us in
prior quarters, like, for instance, unauthorized customers get cut off when you digitize and they become your customers
in many cases, although the return rates are higher than the average customer base, at the same time the all-digital
project is very disruptive. We had to put out 6 million boxes in a universe of 10 million televisions in a single one year
period.
That's actually – while it ultimately benefits the consumer to have that all-digital product because it frees up our
network to increase the data speeds and it frees up our network to put on more HD channels, the whole process is quite
disruptive from a consumer perspective and it creates a lot of service transactions. So we were slowing down the

business in the first quarter to manage our service calls, and they have dropped off, as we expected they would. So we
actually had a fairly modest video budget because of all that activity anyway.
And, finally, I guess when you think about our incentives as a company, our biggest opportunity was the transaction
that was in front of us. We were about to divest 40% of our business and so our focus was somewhat distracted. But
all-in-all the operational issues of changing credit policy changing year-over-year outcomes as a result of the
termination of the all-digital project and the management of the service issues around the all-digital project, we're
comfortable with where we are and we're comfortable with our growth prospects for the year which is why we're saying
we plan to grow video throughout the year.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Makes sense.
Operator
The next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. Chris, would you be willing to give us the – quantify the
level of rate increase now that the first quarter is behind you so we can think about it versus prior year? I know it was
lower but if you could put any numbers around it that would be very helpful.
And then just, Tom, could you talk about the set-top platform today and where it's going? So Worldbox I imagine is
less expensive than what you've been deploying. Can you give us a sense for maybe how much and what else it might
do for you? And then on Netflix OTT integration idea you brought up. How many of your set-tops today could you
deploy a product like that in terms of integrating those services into your core video platform?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So on rate, Ben, it's a little more complicated because you don't have, it's not just a
Q1. In both years you had different timings season inside the month. What we did this year was extremely – was very
minimal but we also benefit from their re-trans pass-through that came through inside of Q4. And so you have to look
at those two effects cumulatively.
One is what was in place in Q4 and therefore the run rate already in January of this year, plus the very minimal
increases around the edges that we did this year as compared to the timing of when larger rate increases not only just
for Q1 but cumulative larger rate increases took place last year. The net effect of all of which is a cumulative Q4 and
Q1 increases that we took this year were substantially lower on a percentage and dollar revenue basis than what we had
done last year.
And without getting into all the complexities I think the easier way to take a look at it is you look at the – if you look at
the quarter-over-quarter residential customer ARPU growth, this quarter we were at 1.8%, with more of the base
stepping out but we have a lot less annual rate increases and if you look at Q4 of last year it was up at 3.1%. We really
did go out of our way last quarter to explain that to people of what the Q4 impact was and how we were intentionally
not going to take the same level of rate increases this year for the reasons we mentioned last quarter, some of which
Tom just touched on frankly. So it's a roundabout way of saying that it's a large difference when you take the
cumulative Q4 and Q1 and largely lower than what we did last year.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So, Ben, there – your question on the set-top platform, Worldbox and price and
integration of other products into our product offering. There are really two platforms that we're currently rolling out
that increase and change the nature of our video product dramatically. One is our new cloud-based user interface, our
Spectrum Guide and that's a backward compatible user interface that's state-of-the-art and looks like any kind of guide
that can be rendered on any kind of device today. It is completely modern and useful and can be changed with very
little development time, because all the activity is done centrally in a server-based architecture.
The breakthrough that we've achieved in our strategy is that this cloud-based user interface also speaks multiple
languages of digital. So it can talk to DOCSIS boxes, it can talk to any device, both in the home or outside the home

and it can talk to historically-placed digital boxes in the language of MPEG as opposed to IP, which can be either cable
or Internet language. And so we can render this user interface on every set-top box that's been historically deployed.
So, as I said earlier, we now have 10 million deployed set-top boxes, many of them which can't receive DOCSIS
signals, many of which can. And we're going to deliver this new user interface in both DOCSIS and in MPEG, we're
using the active video platform and other software platforms that we have.
And we're also going to leave a small resident guide on the set-top boxes so that if the boxes ever lose connectivity to
the server, that customer still has a user interface. Our view is that that won't be needed, but we've built belt and
suspenders around it.
On that platform because it's streamed, we can put any other services as well onto every television or outlet we have.
Those can be services that we sell directly. They can be services that other companies sell directly. And we can include
those in the UI if we want to or not. So it's an open architecture that gives us a tremendous capability, depending on
which way the television marketplace evolves.
Worldbox is a better set-top box. And it uses downloadable security that is under our control, as opposed to the box
vendor's control. And it allows us therefore to buy boxes from any vendor, anywhere. And the reason we call it
Worldbox, it just means we can buy from any world vendor. And we don't have a particular vendor in mind when we
think about Worldbox, although we've done deals with Cisco and ARRIS and others too, to build these boxes and
deploy these boxes.
It's a very sophisticated box, but it's inexpensive, because, one, the conditional access isn't part of the box price. And,
two, we're sort of riding Moore's Law. And, three, we're getting the effect of having a competitive world marketplace in
front of us, and people offering their products at competitive prices to us.
Interestingly the all-digital project that we just did was positively impacted by the fact that we built Worldbox. Our
traditional box vendors became very accommodating to us and developed Worldbox with us. Saw the writing on the
wall and proceeded to go where technology takes them.
And we actually got very good pricing on the traditional boxes that we deployed. And we also worked with the FCC
and got a waiver so that we could put out boxes that didn't have cable cards. That waiver has since been negated by a
change in the law. But we took advantage of our rollout strategy and our architectural strategy throughout the period.
But going forward we expect CPE to continue to come down, and that ultimately takes capital intensity out of the
business.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you, Tom.
Operator
The next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with NSR.
<Q - Jonathan Chaplin>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to go back to your comment on how
you're looking at the video market and get a sense for the opportunity – one of the opportunities we're excited about at
Charter is your ability to take video penetration up fairly significantly from where it is at the moment. Is it your view
that the market has changed? And you need to put a lower price to offer into the market with the direct-to-consumer
product feathered into it in order to get to penetration levels that we might have thought you could get to before? Or is
that entirely additive to the original business plan?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well I'd say it this way. The multi-channel video universe is very highly penetrated. And
there is a slight loss of video penetration in aggregate.
That said there's a tremendous opportunity for us to shift share to us to our better platform. So we see lots of video
growth in front of us in a market that is mature, but not shrinking dramatically. So the whole over-the-top issue, or
cord-cutting I guess is a better way of describing it, issue is the fact it is occurring. And it's occurring for a variety of
reasons that I stated earlier, household formation, income levels, particularly the price of the full package is expensive.

And we do have the Internet now. And people are using the Internet for both video entertainment, but other kinds of
diversionary entertainment, all of which you see affecting the ratings of video product in a negative way. But which
puts more pressure on the price side of the video product from a licensing perspective.
All of those factors are real. But it's also a reality that people do like the full service, and people want the full service.
It's just that it's not that inexpensive.
And so we see growth. We'd love to be able to serve people with products that are less than the full package if their
income or light viewer limited in terms of their desire for the product. I mean the elasticity of demand for the product
changes by what the alternatives are. And frankly if you sell people products that they think are cable or the full
product, and they are not that product, the churn rates go very high.
And Philippe Dauman yesterday said something about family packages in the video space, which I think is right.
People have played around with packaging in the past, and the reality is that most people want the whole thing, even
though it's true that they don't watch that many channels. They have access to a lot of service. And the quality is quite
good.
So when you think about packaging and targeting people, it's not that easy to find niches. And it's not that easy to make
the model work without a full-service package of product. That said, we are looking at all our – all the alternatives. We
see what's going on in the marketplace. We see the maturity of the marketplace. But fundamentally, our growth strategy
is driven by high-quality, full-service products.

The next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thanks. So I'm just continuing on your prior comments. Obviously, FiOS is trying to take a
creative view on how they can do this. Do you believe that that kind of a structure of a consumer proposition is what
the market needs? And one, can you do that? And then for Chris, just very quickly, just the pulse of the higher market
today. Is there – obviously been borrowing money over the last few months as part of the Comcast transaction, but to
get tens of billions of dollars of financing, is the market fully available? Are the big banks willing to provide bridge
loans, broadly speaking? So just want to see if you can give us some sense of how the credit market is. Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: With regard to the FiOS package, I think those kinds of products have been tried in the
past. And I don't know what's in FiOS's contracts with c, but generally there are tiering requirements and there are
penetration requirements for service levels that are quite – have been historic in the industry because people have tried
these tiers previously, family packages. In fact, at one point, the FCC was promoting that idea with a family tier in the
last administration.
So it's not a new concept. Products have been launched even decades ago, HBO Lite, Festival and other services like
that, that were designed to appeal to niches. But all of them have ended up migrating back into a full package kind of
world. And so it's hard to actually, given the way that business is structured when you're buying programming, to build
products that actually satisfy people. And – but would I rather be able to sell lots of smaller tiers? Yes, I would. But I
still think the majority of households would buy most of them.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And, Vijay, on the capital markets question, there's some of that that's an embedded
M&A question that I'd like to steer away a little bit. But generally I'd say it feels to us that the capital markets remain
healthy and receptive for good credits and for good operating strategies. And that's what is on our hands is to have a
good operating strategy. And beyond that, it's difficult to say.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Great. Thank you.

Next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.
<Q - Craig E. Moffett>: Hi. Thank you. So I want to return to the trajectory of ARPU for a second. Separate and apart
from the mix of single plays and triple plays which sort of clouds it, can you just give us a little bit of insight into how
you're tracking with respect to the step-ups in pricing? And is that flowing through at the rate that you had come to
expect it? And if you could just update us on how much of that is still to come as we look forward?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Craig, yes, it is as we expected and our model is working. I think the mix is slightly
different than I might have thought a couple of years ago in terms of triple play to single data play and that kind of
thing, but it is essentially those people that price into packages are stepping up as we expected and the retention rates
are what we've forecasted and planned all along. And so the trajectory of the ARPU is consistent with our model.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And, Craig, it's a – I'd add on to that it's a healthy ARPU development. So it's an
ARPU development that's supported by delivering the customer what they want with the fastest Internet speed, the
lowest-cost voice, the most fully-featured video product at an attractive price, which is what gives you the step-up
power to begin with. But even when it steps up it's still at a better price point for all the services with better service than
the customer could receive elsewhere, which is really what makes it sustainable. At the same time, you're delivering
4.5%, 5% customer growth at the same time.
<Q - Craig E. Moffett>: And so how should we think about the growth of ARPU going forward? I know you can't
give precise guidance, but can you give us some general guidance for how you would expect ARPU to track over the
next year or so?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. I'm not going to give forward guidance but I think I can direct you to in our
investor presentation that we produce every quarter, you can see the year-over-year growth rates and you can see where
– points in time where we've had some annual rate increase flowing through. And you can see when there is essentially
not been that effect flowing through, which is why I was making the healthy – the healthy ARPU increase is based on
the business development. And you have a lot more transactions that are taking place than meets the eye. You don't
only have gross connects, you have migrations, you have upgrades, you have downgrades and you have the bundling of
those customers and the pricing you have of the bundle of those customers that are just connecting. It's a really complex
model.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: It is.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And I think it'd be wrong to try to oversimplify it, but when you have an operating
strategy that has the product pricing and packaging that we have, you can be in an environment where you have steady
price increases that are based on the value that you're providing. And you can do it in a way that despite the higher
input cost that your overall gross margin and EBITDA margin per customer and your EBITDA margin per passing can
increase, substantially in some cases despite the fact that some of your input costs are going up at a higher rate. And
that's what puts cable generally and Charter I think in a unique position relative to others as long as you provide the
right product pricing and packaging.
<Q - Craig E. Moffett>: Okay. Thank you.

curious, is that coming from the commercial side or the residential side? And then just as a follow-on, could you talk a
little more broadly about what you're seeing in the economy and how it's affecting your business?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I don't it's much from an economic development. I think it ties into what Tom was
describing before is coming out of the back end of all digital. We had some uplift from unauthorized customers
becoming paying customers, and sometimes you see some of that coming out the back end as well. We also did make
some changes to both our collection and credit policies that weighed into that that has one-time effects. So it's a
combination of those two factors. I'd call it more self-inflicted as intentionally and for good reason as opposed to
broader macroeconomic or cable industry challenges.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. The broader economic situation is actually slightly improving.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: There's more housing construction than there has been. Not much, but more.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Great. And just to follow up, I mean, should we expect that bad debt expense will
improve going forward from this point?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: That's our goal.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Great. Thank you.

The next question will come from James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James M. Ratcliffe>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I could. First of all, on the business
services side, you talked about free packaging on that front. How much of an issue you're finding the lack of
availability of a bundled wireless product to be and how much interest are you seeing customers for that? And
secondly, just from a staffing perspective, do you have any replacements or rebuilds needed in particularly the systems
you're planning on divesting of folks who decided to depart before that happens? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: So in business packaging, your question was do we need a wireless component to that
product?
<Q - James M. Ratcliffe>: Are you seeing any meaningful number of customers where the – who are looking for to
roll wireless into it? Or are people mainly making those decisions separately?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we currently – our wireless product in the small business space is a Wi-Fi router
for the business and for the public spaces in the business as part of the product mix. And we see that as highly attractive
from a product point of view, and we see increased market share shift to us in that area.
With regard to mobile wireless phones, we are not in that business, don't have a product today for small business to do
that so all of the business that we're creating is wireline and Wi-Fi. But our fundamental strategy there is to – like it is
in the residential space, to just stand up a better product than our competitors and to sell it at reasonably attractive
promotional pricing and to drive a market share strategy and to – we've reorganized our operations so that we can
actually handle the speed of a higher activity level which has an effect in our cost structure, by the way, also initially.
But we're very pleased with the results we're getting already and our expectations there are proving out. So we expect
to have an accelerating small business growth prospect.
With regard to staffing, Charter maybe got a little ahead of itself in some staffing areas and hiring people as a result of
the proposed transaction that probably aren't reflected in all the transaction costs. But in general because of the way our
operations are structured, the divested areas are not – they're fully staffed. And the people were planning on going to
Comcast and working for Comcast. And we really haven't lost people in those areas. And they're all – obviously they
were confused and their lives were disrupted and all of that. But they're with us and their prospects with us are bright.

The next question will be from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Great. Thank you. Can you give us an update on your prospects for fiber-to-the-tower and
small-cell builds in your territories? Are you seeing any meaningful business there? And what do you think your
outlook is for getting those kind of contracts?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. Fiber-to-the-tower and small cell?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. Well cell backhaul prospects.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I'm sorry. We're having a hard time hearing you. I am anyway. Our fiber-to-the-tower
business is still a good business and still growing. It's not growing as fast, because we covered a lot of the towers in our
footprint.
With regard to small cells we don't have any small cell arrangements with anybody and haven't done any. We've looked
at that. And we've looked at the opportunity to combine licensed and unlicensed spectrum in small cells, but we don't
have any business plans to announce.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Frank, what I would tell you is a lot of the capital has been spent on that. And so
we're seeing the benefit of the existing contracts through revenue, which is always by design, it's capital intense
upfront. And we are seeing second tenants connect to the existing capital that we've deployed, which was always our
hope and not part of the ROI business case when we built it. So...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: That's right.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: It's an attractive business.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Can you give us an update on maybe how many towers you have wired up? Or the value of
the revenue stream?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I don't have that in front of me. And so I could give you a number. But I want to make
sure that if I did, it didn't run the risk of mixing fiber sites and cell backhaul together. And I'd rather not do that and
have to correct it afterwards.
But it's still growing and it's growing well. But it's not growing at the pace of newbuild that it did probably a year ago.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: But upgrades are growing faster than the pace they were.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, yeah. That's exactly right.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: All right great. Thank you.

it. But just your thoughts on what the environment is from a regulatory standpoint, whether or not it's sort of friendly to

cable or not? It seems sort of not. And then commenting maybe on the voice side with respect to the pricing strategy
there? And maybe cost per month per sub and how that's trending? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Okay. Well look on the regulatory side, I mean I think I think every situation is different.
I mean Title II is a – it's actually a longstanding issue. The issue of net neutrality has been around for a long time. And
companies have been agitating. And it has been part of the President's agenda all along, and he campaigned on it
initially.
So it's not surprising that the forces that prevailed there did. Although I wish it were structured differently. And I
thought that the outcome was less than ideal. I don't think that is particularly related to being friendly or not friendly to
cable in general. And I think every company is different, every transaction is different. And they're really independent
structural questions from a regulatory perspective.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: On voice pricing...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah go ahead. You want to...
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: It's going down. The...
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah. Our view in the long run is that it has to go down. We price our permanent pricing
at $19.95, all taxes and fees included. And the costs of providing voice have gone down. And we're still growing voice
very nicely, because it's worth it at that price today. Will it be five years from now? Probably not. But I think having a
fully featured wireline voice product with high-quality service is worth something. And so in the package I think we'll
continue to sell it well.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Yeah. I guess I was just trying to get a sense for how that margin trends over time?
And does it approach a sub-overall business type margin?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. The issue that you will see in our P&L is that voice revenues have been coming
down. A lot of that's just allocation into bundles that we move from new pricing and packaging, despite the fact that
we've been going up. So instead of selling at $40, it's being priced in on a rack rate at $20. So that's just an allocation
issue.
But we're in a position now that despite that allocation, you can start to see gross margin, despite moving dollars out of
that piece of the bundle, gross margin can be increasing. And I believe has started to do so already.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah that's right. We've hit the – because of the way we transition the pricing, we finally
hit the place where we'll start to grow telco revenue.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. Now I want to be clear that's now how we look at it. We look at it on a per
home basis in terms of what the EBITDA and cash flow that we can get out of a home because I could price, and I'm
not saying we're going to do this, but you could price – I wouldn't do it anyway. It'd be Tom. But we could price phone
at zero, and you can talk about margin on the price on the product. And you can price it at $35. The reality is most
people aren't buying phone on a standalone basis. They're buying it together with their other services. So what you have
to focus is the value that you're providing inside the home, what you should price it at, what's the margin that you have
for the whole bundle of service.
<Q - Michael L. McCormack>: Sure. No, understood. Thanks, guys.

The final question will come from Marci Ryvicker with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thanks. Chris, you mentioned, I think, previously that when your new programming
contracts came up, you're going to negotiate as a larger company. And I guess with the transactions now being called
off, does anything change with upcoming programming negotiations?

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: I'll answer that. Probably, but I don't think that the arc of our programming expense will
change significantly as a result of this. I think there are synergies that occur in transactions that come from scale or
existing contracts attributing to another company. But in terms of Charter as a standalone business, I don't think it
materially affects what our costs will be relative to what they were historically.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: The other thing I'd add to that just purely from a financial perspective, while we knew
it was there, and we knew we would get it, we never put it inside of any of our plans because you couldn't forecast
exactly where and when it would come from. So we took the conservative approach and when we put things together
for acquisitions that ended up being publicly disclosed places that didn't reflect those type of synergies.
