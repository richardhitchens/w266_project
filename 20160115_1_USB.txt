Richard K. Davis
Good morning, [ph] Bob. (01:49) Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.
I'll begin our report with a few highlights from U.S. Bank's 2015 full-year results on page three of the presentation.
U.S. Bancorp reported record net income of $5.9 billion, or $3.16 per diluted common share. We achieved
industry-leading profitability with the return on average assets of 1.44%, a return on average common equity of 14%,
and an efficiency ratio of 53.8% for the year.
Total average loans grew by 4.1%, adjusted for student loans, and average deposits grew a strong 7.7% year-over-year.
Credit quality continued to improve with a 12.1% decline in net charge-offs and a 15.8% decrease in non-performing
assets. Our capital position remains strong and we returned $4 billion or 72% of our earnings to our shareholders
through dividends and share buybacks during 2015.
Turning to slide four and our quarterly highlights, U.S. Bancorp reported record revenue of $5.2 billion and net income
of $1.5 billion, or $0.80 per diluted common share, an increase of 1.3% year-over-year. The fourth quarter of 2015
included a gain from the sale of an HSA account deposit portfolio, [audio gap] (3:15-03:20) diluted earnings per share
by $0.01. I'm very pleased this quarter with the momentum in our linked-quarter loan growth, the continued strength of
our payments business and the improvement in our operating leverage. Total average loans grew 1.7% linked-quarter,
adjusted for student loans, which exceeded the high-end of our 1% to 1.5% range.
In addition, we continued to see strong growth in average deposits, which included consumer net new account growth
of 3.2%. Credit quality continued to remain strong. Total net charge-offs and non-performing assets declined on a
year-over-year basis and non-performing assets declined on a linked-quarter basis as well.
Slide five provides you with a five quarter history our performance metrics, and they remain among the best in the
industry. Moving to the graph on the right, you can see that this quarter's net interest margin of 3.06% was relatively
stable, as expected, improving 2 basis points from the third quarter. This is primarily driven by higher loan growth,
which reduced the amount of cash balances.
Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 53.9%, [audio gap] (04:25-04:30). We expect this ratio to remain in the
low 50%s going forward, as we continue to see the results of our expanded efficiency effort that we introduced last
year, which includes prudent FTE management and a renewed emphasis on other discretionary spending. As I said
earlier, I'm particularly pleased that we were able to achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, which reverses
a trend of negative leverage over the past several quarters. I believe this positions us well as we move into 2016.
While prudent expense management remains a priority for our company, we also continue to focus on revenue growth
and innovation, which means investing in those businesses and products that will provide strong returns. During the
quarter, we announced a new agreement with Fidelity Investments. U.S. Bank is now the exclusive issuer of the
Fidelity Investments Rewards Card program. As part of this arrangement, which closed at the end of 2015, we
purchased the existing card portfolio of $1.6 billion. This follows the announcement from last October about our card
issuing partnership with the Auto Club Trust, and the purchase of an existing $500 million portfolio. These agreements
exemplify the strength of our payments business model and a continued commitment to strategic growth for our
company.
Turning to slide six. The company reported record net revenue in the fourth quarter of $5.2 billion, a 0.8% increase
from the prior year, which included core revenue growth and a gain on the sale of the HSA deposit portfolio, partially

offset by the Nuveen gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014. The revenue momentum we are seeing is primarily
due to our growing balance sheet and growth in a number of our fee-based businesses, including our payments and trust
businesses.
Kathy will now give you a few more details about our fourth quarter results.
Kathy Ashcraft Rogers
Thanks, Richard. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on slide seven. Average total loans outstanding
increased by over $10 billion, or 4.2% year-over-year, and 1.7% linked-quarter, adjusted for student loans. As you may
recall, we moved our student loan portfolio to held-for-sale in the first quarter of 2015, and subsequently, returned it to
held-for-investment during the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, the increase in average loans outstanding on a year-over-year basis was led by strong growth in
average total commercial loans of 9%, and 2.5% linked-quarter, the strongest linked-quarter growth seen in 2015. Line
utilization, however, remained relatively consistent with the previous quarter and flat year-over-year.
Consumer loans, again, showed positive momentum, led by credit card and auto loans. Average credit cards increased
4.7% year-over-year, and 5% on a linked-quarter basis, which included the acquisition of approximately $500 million
Auto Club portfolio at the end of quarter three. Auto loan growth remains strong, up 13% year-over-year and 2%
linked-quarter. Residential mortgages grew 2.1% year-over-year, reversing a declining trend over the last several
quarters, and rose 2.2% on a linked-quarter basis. We currently expect total average linked-quarter loan growth to be in
the 1% to 1.5% range in quarter one.
Total average deposits increased $19 billion, or 6.9% over the same quarter of last year, and 1.7% on a linked-quarter
basis. Growth in non-interest bearing and low interest checking, money market and savings deposits remained strong
on a year-over-year basis and continued to more than offset the run-off of maturing, larger dollar time deposits.
Turning to slide eight and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 1% on a year-over-year basis, and increased
4.5% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to lower recoveries. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans
outstanding was 47 basis points in the fourth quarter, a slight increase over the third quarter.
Non-performing assets decreased by 2.8% on a linked-quarter basis and 15.8% over the fourth quarter of 2014. The
fourth quarter provision for credit losses was equal to net charge-offs, which compares to a release of reserves of $20
million in the fourth quarter of 2014, and $10 million in the third quarter of 2015. As we move into 2016, we would
expect that reserves will begin to build to support loan growth. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently
expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to remain relatively stable in the first quarter of 2016.
Slide nine gives you a view of our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results versus comparable time periods. As I
mentioned, our diluted EPS of $0.80 includes $0.01 related to net impact of the sale of our HSA deposit portfolio,
partially offset by accruals related to the legal and compliance matters. Fourth quarter net income decreased $12
million, or 0.8%, year-over-year. This is principally due to a higher provision for credit losses, increase in net interest
income primarily driven by growth in earning assets, lower non-interest income impacted by the 2014 Nuveen gain,
partially offset by increases in payments-related revenue, trust and investment management fees, and the HSA deposit
sale gain.
On a linked-quarter basis, net income was lower by $13 million, or 0.9%, mainly due to predicted seasonal increase in
non-interest expense and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher net revenue, primarily
due to loan growth.
Turning to slide 10, net interest income increased year-over-year by $72 million, or 2.6%. The increase was a result of
growth in average earning assets of 5.1%, partially offset by lower net interest margin. The net interest margin of
3.06% was 8 basis points lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. The decline was primarily due to a change in loan
portfolio mix, as well as the growth in the investment portfolio at lower average rates and lower reinvestment rates.

Net interest income increased $50 million on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to higher average total loans. The net
interest margin of 3.06% was 2 basis points higher than the third quarter. The increase in the net interest margin was
principally due to higher loan growth, which resulted in lower cash balances. We currently expect that the net interest
margin will be relatively stable in the first quarter.
Slide 11 highlights non-interest income, which decreased $30 million or 1.3% year-over-year. The year-over-year
decrease in non-interest income was primarily due to the impact of the 2014 Nuveen gain, partially offset by fee
revenue growth and the HSA deposit sale gain. Higher credit and debit card revenue, trust and investment management
fees, and merchant processing services were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue, primarily due to an
unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, net of hedging activity.
Momentum in our payment businesses was reflected in our fourth quarter results. Credit and debit card fees grew 8.1%
on a year-over-year basis, principally driven by higher volumes, which were up 6%, compared to 5.3% in quarter three.
Merchant processing revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year and approximately 6.5%, excluding the impact of foreign
currency rate changes. The growth was driven by higher transaction volumes, account growth, and equipment sales to
merchants related to new chip card technology requirements. These equipment sales were modestly lower than the
amount recognized in quarter three, as expected.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest income was higher by $14 million or 0.6%, principally due to seasonally higher
credit and debit card revenue and the HSA deposit sale gain, partially offset by lower corporate payment product
revenue, reflecting a seasonally higher quarter three government-related transaction volume. Mortgage banking revenue
was also lower, as expected, primarily due to seasonally lower origination revenue. We would expect that fee revenue
in quarter one will be seasonally lower on a linked-quarter basis.
Moving to slide 12, non-interest expense was essentially flat year-over-year. Higher compensation expense, which
reflected the impact of merit increases and higher staffing for risk and compliance activities, along with higher
employee benefit expense driven by pension costs, were largely offset by lower marketing and business development
expenses, principally due to charitable contributions recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower other expense
reflecting a net year-over-year impact of legal accruals.
On a linked-quarter basis, non-interest expense increased $34 million or 1.2% as predicted, reflecting seasonally higher
cost related to investments and tax advantage projects and accruals related to legal and compliance matters partially
offset by the favorable impact of reduced mortgage-related compliance and talent upgrade costs, which were elevated
in quarter three and declined, as expected, in quarter four.
Compensation expense declined, reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives and declines in variable
compensation. Employee benefits expense also declined, driven by lower payroll tax expense and healthcare costs. We
would expect expenses to be relatively stable in quarter one compared to quarter four. Seasonally higher benefits
expense will be offset by seasonally lower tax credit amortization and the impact of the credit card portfolio
acquisition.
Turning to slide 13, as Richard mentioned, our capital position remains strong. We returned 61% of our earnings to
shareholders during the quarter. Dividends accounted for 32%, while stock repurchases accounted for the remaining
29%. For the full-year, we returned 72% of our earnings to shareholders, and we expect to remain in our 60% to 80%
range going forward. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if
fully implemented, at December 31 with 9.1%, which is well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement. Our
tangible book value per share rose to $17.44 at December 31, representing a 9.3% increase over the same quarter of last
year and a 1.4% increase over the prior quarter.
I will now turn the call back to Richard.

Thanks, Kathy. I'm proud of our fourth quarter and full-year results. We reported record full-year net income and
record revenue for the quarter. We remain industry-leading performance measures and reported a 19% return on
tangible common equity in the quarter. We delivered on our promise to work toward positive operating leverage with
the efforts that we've made through our efficiency program. We're continuing to make strategic investments in our
businesses and focus on innovation for the benefit of our customers.
As we look to 2016, we start the year from a position of strength, as we continue to build revenue momentum,
thoughtfully manage expenses, work diligently to exceed customer expectations and to create value for our
shareholders in a competitive marketplace. We remain focused on delivering consistent, predictable and repeatable
financial results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Kathy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer your questions.

Maria, we can go ahead now and open for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Good morning, everyone. Good morning. Richard, maybe a question for you on just lending
and your overall mood. Obviously, pretty negative, some of the global macro stuff that we're seeing. But at the same
time, you've held to your growth guidance, your typical growth guidance, you're actually coming in a bit ahead of that.
So maybe if you could just step back and give us a bit of a state of the union on lending and how you're feeling about
the economy. And, I guess, I'm also curious of what you're seeing from the consumer in terms of their outlook and loan
demand there.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Jon. First of all, I had predicted that question. I was thinking this morning, we are a
classic American bank. We do primarily business in the domestic United States and we're very much a consumer small
business payments kind of a company. So despite what's going on in the backdrop around the world with the China
reevaluation and what's happening in oil and some of those areas, which we're not immune to, by all intents and
purposes, we're not seeing the majority of that on our books or by our customers.
So we're actually seeing a continued steady, I'll say, slow but steady improvement every quarter and our customers are
reflecting that across the board, from the large corporate customers – we're still doing robust M&A transactions to
restructuring their portfolio – all the way down to the small businesses, which continue to grow for us double digits,
based on their interest in setting themselves up for a better consumer-led recovery; and just in general, people who are
using banks for the retail services.
So I'm quite optimistic against a negative backdrop. And I know we won't be immune to all of that, but based on our
geography, based on our mix of business, based on our history and based on our appetite for risk, I think we're actually
fairly immune for most of those issues at this stage, and yet we stress test for the worst scenarios that would, of course,
affect us. So I would say, across the board, from a lending perspective, that same range you've seen, the 1% to 1.5%
we're predicting again for this quarter. Already off to a really nice start. And we're not seeing any disruption, neither
from the 25 basis point increase, which we knew would be more symbolic, and actually not yet from the impacts of the
stock market or the China revaluation. So, at this point, we're remaining optimistic in a cautious and careful way.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, is Bill Parker there?

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Bill is here.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah. Hi, Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Hey, Bill. Anything to add in terms of – from a credit perspective? I mean, Kathy talked
about the reserve releases are over and you've all been very transparent on that. But anything from a credit perspective
that's making you a bit more nervous or that is a change maybe compared to a quarter or two ago?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, Jon, first I'd direct you to the [ph] dependency (18:55) slide and you can look through
those. And if you look at any of the portfolios and you see, sort of, year-over-year delinquency patterns, they're either
stable or better than last year. So overall, very strong. Of course, the one exception is energy and some of the metals
and mining related credits. We do have that small energy portfolio, it's about 1.2% of our total loans, so obviously we
have seen some downgrade there. And we've been building our allocated reserves for that all year long. But we've built
that at low-$30s price of oil. So we feel like we're good for now, but we'll see where oil settles in. But either way, that's
not going to have a material impact on, kind of, the overall go-forward credit performance.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. And, in terms of the way we see things, just the assumption should be maybe a glide
path back up, in terms of the provision over charge-offs, just building for loan growth? Is that how we should approach
it?
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I would jump in there, Jon. It's the old-fashioned days where you're supposed to
provide for the next new loan, right? And I think we're at that inflection point. I don't know if we'll start moving up
very quickly because we're settling here at that turning point of no provision, but we don't see anything in the near-term
that's going to harm that. I want to pick up on energy and metals and mining. We do stress test our portfolios routinely,
and not just for those particular categories, but tangent effects it might have on other parts of our customers and
portfolios and in certain geographies. And, as Bill mentioned, we've increased the reserve levels for both of those
categories, and continue to have the room and the expectation that if we need to do more, we can.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Erika.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hi, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Hi. Good morning. When we last spoke, Richard, I think you were fairly optimistic about
your prospect for 2016, and I think we talked about the concept of USB being a maximized franchise. As we think
about building revenue momentum, slow but steady, into 2016, could you give us, sort of, what the top three drivers
are, in terms of what could drive a year-over-year improvement in revenue outside of, of course, any more increases on
the short end?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, sure. I'll actually add some more than the question, as I think I also mentioned when
you and I had the fireside chat. I might add, without the fireplace. We were talking about what kind of assumptions
we'd have in our plan, and we actually expected to have two rate increases from the last time I talked to you. We hoped
for one in December and we expect one in June. And that's really the amount of the risk we placed into our plan this
year. So – and we're halfway with one of them, at least at this point, if it's fixed. So that alone does actually help us. But
we're not relying on that, to the very point you made.

The most important thing to happen to us is just a continued improved recovering economy, where people feel they can
consume, people feel they don't have to save quite as much and that they've got a higher backstop, either in their own
savings account, or in their home equity, or in their own debt positions, where they can start spending money and feel
more comfortable about it. That's going to be huge for us. That's way more important than any interest rate because, as
I said earlier, we're a consumer, middle market wholesale bank and those are the things that matter the most.
But I want to tell you the things that we'll put our shoulder against to watch for improvement this year. One will be the
continued success we're having in relationship management with our customers. I think I've said this before, but we're
developing a much smarter technology around who our customers are, what they expect, what their likely next needs
are, particularly, around the mobile banking aspect. And so we're investing a great deal of money and time. And in this
whole efficiency program, you never heard me take anything away from our investment in innovation and
entrepreneurship, and we're not, because I do believe that's going to be the next big idea. So having a payments
business and a bank connected together, we have the best of both worlds because we can test virtually any paradigm,
buyer, seller, and moving money back and forth. So that's our number one. We're going to lean on the bank and the
payments businesses coming together.
Number two, the corporate trust business. It's been remarkably good for us. It doesn't get a lot of visibility. It's actually
confusing to a lot of people. But we're not only domestically quite large and capable, but when you start looking at how
that's starting to build across the pond over in Europe, with both our funds administration and our classic corporate
trust, we're going to expect a lot from those two businesses as well in 2016.
And finally, I would say, the next chapter in our wholesale bank becoming – we've moved out of the audition stage and
we're now bona-fide one of the most important banks to deal with the large Fortune 100 companies. When you think
from an M&A deal, to a first left lead on a deal to just moving money on a very sophisticated way, we are continuing to
see momentum there. I am quite proud of what the wholesale commercial bank's done. We are celebrating Dick Payne's
retirement this quarter. And we're also celebrating the addition of two new leaders coming up from within the company
to run the wholesale bank and the capital markets, and I expect a lot from the two of them. And they've got the
capability and energy to pick up where Dick has left us, which is a really good starting point. So I would say those
three things, Erika, to answer your question.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the question on credit. Oil and gas and metal
and mining aside, charge-off levels for the industry have been abnormally low. And, I guess, maybe, Bill, if you don't
mind jumping in, could you remind us what you think, given the risk portfolio embedded at U.S. Bank right now? What
you think is your normal charge-off rate? And how long does it take to get there?
<A - P. W. Parker>: So, again, when we talk about normalized, we call that the through the cycle rate, and it's a rate
that we've talked about before that's between 95 basis points and 100 basis points, but you don't really get there, you
just go through it, when you're going into a recession or you're in a recession. So in times of stable employment, as
we're in right now, the rate you see for us is sort of what would be a normal rate in these kinds of – in this kind of
economic environment. But that over the cycle rate is something that we calculate every quarter, and it remains
between that 95 basis points and 100 basis points. It really has not materially changed for us for many, many years.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Understood. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Erika.

<Q - John E. McDonald>: Hi, good morning. Richard, I guess, I was kind of wondering how should we track the
progress of your new emphasis on the non-FTE expense controls this year? What should we look at to, kind of, see how
you're doing from the external metrics? And then what kind of confidence level do you have in the ability to deliver
positive operating leverage this year in the environment that you're planning for?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, John. First of all, you can measure all of our expenses quarter to quarter. And I think
you know we're as transparent as cellophane. So we're going to tell you exactly any moving parts, and then you can
model what's left. But you will see the benefits in this quarter and you will see them in next – current year of both the
FTE watchful placement we've had on adding people unless we need them, and the more discretionary expenses. I will
tell you, however, and I'm also going to tell you about along the way how we're going to spend money on things that
we think are quite important. I will start bringing more visibility to our innovation budget and the kind of money we're
spending to be at the front end of some of those new ideas. And we're going to be introducing a fairly significant
branding and reputation campaign in 2016, which in fact, some of that savings will go towards, because I want to keep
investing. I just want to put it in more of the right places. So don't watch for just a number, watch for the moving parts
and I will give you the visibility of that so that you can make that assessment over the course of time.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: And in terms of what you're expecting for, kind of, revenue expense growth this year,
Richard, and...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Oh, that, I forgot. Yeah. No, one quarter is going to be positive operating leverage in this
environment, but we are still planning. This year, our plan says positive operating leverage for 2016. I will also remind
all of you that quarter one is our weakest quarter. So it's not the one I'm going to be able to showcase and show off as
our strongest quarter, because it's seasonally lower for us, but it will be, I think, a better first quarter than you've seen in
a while. But in some ways, it's going to be on its way to a positive operating leverage.
If we don't get at least that second of two rate increases, that will put a challenge on that ability, so I'm not going to
make any guarantees, but I'm more concerned less about the rate itself than the fact that rates moving up will continue
to reflect that the Fed believes the economy is strong. And what we care most about is a strong economy. The metrics
and the arithmetic of the 25 basis points is far less important. So we'll get to watch it as we go on, and I will keep you
clearly aligned on how we think that's going.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on the loan growth. What got better this quarter to
get you into that 1.7% growth? And what assumptions underlie the outlook for the 1% to 1.5% range going forward? Is
it more of a consumer pickup driving that and do you assume C&I slows a bit here going forward?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, John. This is Andy. I would say corporate continues to be strong, as you saw our
year-over-year growth about 9% and strong on a linked quarter basis. I think what's turned a little bit more positive is
the consumer side of the equation on two fronts. Our mortgage activity on balance sheet, that jumbles principally,
continues to be strong. And home equity, for the first time in a while, we're seeing growth in that category. And as we
dig into that a little further to understand what that's about, we are seeing consumers taking home equity and using it
for home equity. So using it to improve their homes, furnishings and things of that sort. So those two categories are
strengthening, and finally, card spend and card balances are also growing. So I do think we see continued strength on
wholesale with increasing strength on consumer.
<Q - John E. McDonald>: Okay. Thanks, Andy.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning. Kathy, if I could just follow up on the 1Q expense outlook, I think
you said stable linked quarter. Are there any one time expenses related to the Fidelity card deal? I think you normally
have some seasonality on the way down on expenses in 1Q.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. Let me talk about that. There's a couple of things that are going on with that
because you're right, we normally would see a first quarter decline in expenses. But I'll answer your first question and
then add some more light. So, yes, we would expect to see some one-time expenses related to the Fidelity card deal that
will come through in the first quarter and then just the overall operating expenses related to that will increase as we
move through the year starting in the first quarter. Additionally, if you think about our first quarter expense, we usually
have the seasonally lower [audio gap] (30:24-30:30) our tax credit expense in fourth quarter was lower than we
normally would have seen and that's normally due to a mix of where that's reported. So you also saw that our tax rate
was a bit higher.
So that benefit that we get on a linked quarter basis for tax credit is going to be lower than what you would have seen in
the past and that coupled with the Fidelity causes us to be relatively stable.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then, a bigger picture, Richard, for you. Maybe you can comment on
your ability and appetite on the acquisition side of things. I think you guys talked about in the third quarter 10-Q...
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: ...some things around the Know Your Customer and obviously, there is some price
resetting occurring right now as we speak. So maybe you could update it for the current environment and how you can
be a player in that, if at all?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yep. So the answer I'll give you, Matt, first and foremost is what you see we've done is what
we want to do more of. So you saw these two fairly large portfolios in the card business that we continue to be attracted
toward. These are picking up portfolios that already have momentum [audio gap] (31:35-31:41). And we are finding
more and more people interested in allowing us to take a look at that. So I hope there will be more of those. We've
talked before about our merchant acquiring business and the way we've cobbled that together over the last now 15 years
is to find a partner, work with them on a JV kind of a basis with a rent to own sense. And there is more of that in
Europe that we are continuing to look at and hopefully opportunities in that regard as well.
And then, finally, the more classic kind of opportunity that I talked about, innovation. And there may be some small
businesses, some small companies, some small garage deals that we might find where we want to bring the capability
in house and not outsource it. And if those come along at the right price at the right moment, we'll also not hesitate
there.
As it relates to full bank acquisitions and interest, our interest remains exactly what it was. We don't have a high
interest and there's no one knocking on our door. And yet, at the same time, it's a good thing because given the consent
order that we entered into in October, we wouldn't be allowed to do a full bank acquisition until we're through and past
that consent order, which we're moving swiftly along and actually have been predicting that we can move that as
swiftly as anyone ever has. So we are well aware that at the point in time we want to buy someone, we want to be past
that point and our goal is to be there. But now, it's not inhibiting anything that we would otherwise want to do. And I
think portfolios and merchant acquiring would be the two places you should watch the most.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: And what's the fastest someone else has gotten through the consent order?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I actually don't know because I'm not exactly sure who all is in one, but I know that there is –
in our case, we've talked with our OCC, which is the lead regulator here, made it clear to them that our goal is to satisfy
the aspects of the consent order that would otherwise preclude us from being able to buy banks and make that our
number one area. They've made that clear to us that they understand that's our goal and I don't believe you have to be
all out to be all done, you just need to be accomplishing the things that are most concerning to them as it relates to
branch related, Know Your Customer thing. So we're going to approach it on that basis.

The OCC has also been on record saying how one of their goals this year is to move more swiftly with the closure of
open issues and we're going to hopefully be one of the first to prove that. And we'll work through that swiftly and we've
been working on it actually for quite some time and have lined everything up now to move out of that as soon as they
give us permission as we prove our sustainability. So it's not impairing us now. It will, if we're not out of that in a year
or two, but it's not in harm's way at the point, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. I mean, if I could just squeeze in one more here. I guess the point I'm getting
at is, you've been more conservative – well, pre-crisis, during the crisis, post crisis and I'm trying to get a sense of, if
the mentality is, let's use some of our conservatism and capital and deposit base to look for opportunities out there. I
mean, my guess is some sellers may be interested at a much lower price than before. There are some assets in the
capital markets that are being significantly repriced. You could probably gain a lot of share in energy, if you wanted to
now. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of, is that the mentality? Or is it just keep talking and talking?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Great question, Matt. We've been together the whole time. So, what you know about us is,
we kind of set a mantra in place, which is, we will never do anything that doesn't look sustainable and repeatable. It
sounds corny, but we've done it long enough, it's real. And you think about opportunities that come along. If it's a
portfolio and it's priced perfectly, and it's within the scheme of our risk tolerance, absolutely, we're all over it. Many of
them, though, will come to us at a slightly disadvantaged risk perspective, and we don't convince ourselves to make it
up in volume or to buy it now and change our original mantra. We'll take the hit from you guys for not having that
acquisition, but we'll take the benefit years later or months later when we don't have a problem. So I would say our
conservatism is every bit exactly what it was before, and during the downturn, and we're not tempted by anything right
now that would otherwise cause us to change that thinking. And that could disappoint a few people, but slow and
steady kind of wins the race. So we're going to stay in that boat.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. Thanks for taking all my questions.

<Q - Scott Siefers>: Good morning, guys. Let's see. First one is sort of a ticky-tack question. Did you guys quantify
the specific size of both the HSA gain and then the legal and compliance accruals? And if not, I mean, could you
please?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm going to have Kathy do it.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: We had a bet that no one would ask. So I just lost the bet, by the way.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: So thank you very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: So, Scott, I'm going to – I'm calling you for the money.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. So, Scott, yeah, so the gain on the HSA sale was right in that kind of $50
million range, and I would suggest you think about half of that were related to the regulatory and legal accruals.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, just so I'm certain, the guidance for fees and expenses in the
first quarter is off the reported numbers however, right?

<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. Perfect. So thank you for that. And then, second question, either for you, Kathy or Richard,
just as it relates to margin. Even though you guys characterize it as relatively stable, it was still up, which I consider a
good thing. I'm just curious, in your mind, what it would take, whether it's how much more rate increases – how many
more rate increases, I should say, or an increased pace of increases until sort of the bias gets a little more optimistic? In
other words, at what point do we more visibly see the margins starting to expand?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. I think that's a couple of things. I do think we need a couple more rate increases
to see a material change in our margin. I think what's as important, Scott, is that, we have to – we've been talking a lot
about this pricing pressure on some of the different portfolios and I think we need to see that start to stabilize a little bit.
But, certainly, as we think about where we are today, and if you think about where our margin improved from last
quarter, we did have some nice growth in our loan portfolio, which allowed us to, essentially, fund that through cash.
So that allowed us to go forward. So as we move forward, I think the mix of our business, interest rates increasing will
certainly help, and some of that pricing pressure easing will certainly see us start to lift.
<Q - Scott Siefers>: Okay. That's perfect. Thank you guys very much.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Scott.

Our next comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, John.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hey, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Just back on that, on the margin comment, just to clarify that. So, basically, if
you don't see any incremental rate hikes, if you don't get the June hike, is it fair to assume that you expect a relatively
stable margin through all of 2016, or could you see degradation?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: I think it's going to come – I would suggest that it would probably, I would say, start
with relatively stable, but I think some of the caveats to that would be really around some of the mix of our portfolio,
and then of our loan growth. And then also, as you know, in our securities portfolio, we have about $2 billion run off.
So to the extent where those reinvestment rates fall could potentially impact the margin. And then also I will tell you,
we're keeping our eye very close on the long-term rates and what's happening on long term rates. So I think all of those
together would impact it, but with no rate increase, I would say we're probably in a little bit of a steady state here.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. Thanks. And then, back to the M&A topic. Richard, I heard what you said about
interest in M&A. If you did not have the consent order in place, what would be your appetite around larger whole bank
deals? I know you used to say you had no interest in holding company transactions and shying away from large deals.
But is that appetite steadily changing, given the disruption and the opportunity maybe to capitalize on valuations, et
cetera?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Nope. You can – I'll exaggerate – nope, but the reason I said – and I'm on record, for quite a
while, John, saying that from our own experiences, the statute – I'm going to call it the statute of limitations, it's not
legal by any means – was that you can still pick up a company and you can still be placed in harm's way for dealing
with any of their potential problems, let alone your own.
And I think it's all the way back to 2007. When you take a seven-year to ten-year old window on when things start to
roll off in terms of statute, and we're already starting to see things continue to come through and people try to get under
the wire. I've always said 2017 would be the first time that we'd want to look at the – well, our appetite for bringing on
a risk into our company that we simply couldn't do due diligence for and couldn't possibly imagine. That, at least
elegantly, is lined up with our current moment where we can't do it anyway but we don't want to anyway and I wouldn't
be interested.

If pricing doesn't change, you can't get a good enough deal, if you don't know what you're getting. And I could be
wrong, but I feel very strongly about that and have for a long time and I would say that, as the moments clear, let's say,
a year or more from now, our ability is there, our appetite will be higher, the moment in time, I think, will be safer, and
all of those things will line up, and then we could be very much involved and engaged in that.
But the reason we're, most importantly, less interested is, we don't really need it. I mean, as much as it's attractive to
have the wallpaper behind me and somebody else shaking hands, it's really not necessary for this company. We are in
every business line that we're in that we want. We're not in anything that we don't want to be, and if we do, we sell it
like the HSA deposit business, and we don't covet anything we don't have. We just want to be better at what we're
doing and do it better and deeper, wherever we are. That would be attractive to me. But it's not going to be a headliner
kind of a deal, at least as long as I'm around. It never has been. It's just going to be kind of a steady state kind of
approach. But I would hope that all those stars would line up so our options are better in a year or two from now.
<Q - John Pancari>: Got it. Thanks, Richard. And if I could throw in one more, on the loan growth side, on the
residential mortgage front, can you just – I know you indicated that growth could remain around where it is. I think you
implied that. So you still have the appetite to continue to add to that portfolio regardless of what the longer end of the
curve is doing here?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes, we continue to add residential mortgages, principally jumbo prime mortgages. Home
equity, as I said, is the other category that's growing, and finally, credit cards. Those are areas that can – the slope is
upward. The area that continues to be strong is auto lending. And, as Kathy mentioned a little bit, the challenge on auto
lending is while volume is great, spreads are challenged, but given our cost of funds, they're still very profitable, but
not as profitable as they were a year ago.
<Q - John Pancari>: Great, Andy. All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. Thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, we know we had the new
disclosures in the [ph] CFEP trade (42:33), but it looks like your mortgage banking was in line with what we expected.
Can you talk about how you managed to do the trade? It looks like it wasn't that big of a deal for you guys.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes, Paul. So we had a significant team of folks focused on that with a great effort, and we
were able to automate much of the process. We had a pretty major conversion to do that last weekend, in fact. So there
was a little bit of a backlog that occurred, because just the natural process of new disclosures, new requirements caused
more time, but it wasn't hugely impactful. And as you said, our results were pretty much in line with what we expected.
We might have a little bit of a pickup in the first quarter from that lag, but we are principally automated on that in very
good shape.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then, on the other side, because you do have a pretty good pulse on the consumers out there,
do you see a big pickup in purchases? We had a very strong purchase market, probably the strongest we've had in seven
years in 2015. Do you see that continue in 2016?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So the year started – you know all the facts. The year started about 50/50 purchase versus
refinance, ended the year about two-thirds/one-third. And sort of a normal environment is 75/25. That's what, I think,
we expect as we go into 2016, about 75% of the volume being new money and 25% refinances.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks. Hi. Good morning. On your Fidelity co-brand win, it seems like that's a product
that's going to give you exposure to a national spend from a fairly affluent customer base. Should we conclude that you
guys are seeking to become more of a national player in card? It certainly seems like you're expanding well beyond
your footprint.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, we already are a national player in card. So – and this is just adding to that. What
we're seeking is always a good portfolio with good customers. And this is a great example. It's a high-quality portfolio.
It offers us a great opportunity for growth, and our customer service levels with this portfolio, I think, is what's going to
make the difference. So it's a continuation of what we're doing. That would be also the same with the Auto Club
portfolio. So as Richard mentioned, I think, those are focus areas for us, have been and will continue to be.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Bill, it's Richard. I don't know how long you've followed us. But many, many years
ago, one of our biggest moments in time was when we lost the WorldPerks card from Northwest Airlines, and it went
to American Express when Delta bought Northwest. And we came up with the FlexPerks card, which, I'm going to say
this now, when I retire will be one of the top three things, I think we ever did really, really well here. And it's very
national.
In fact, when I talk to you guys, if oil were to go down to $10 to $15, and shudder the thought, but if I had to talk about
where the tangent risk would be, we would be talking about the unemployment issues in those areas affected mostly by
oil and energy and our very own customers who you may be surprised, have a lot of people in parts that we don't have
branches that have that credit card and like it a lot.
So it will be our own victim of success here. But it's been quite national for five years, six years. And Andy is right. We
just want to be more perceived as that and we're not going to hesitate to take national portfolios. Just like we would
with commercial real estate or wholesale banking, we want both our branches to be considered a national player on
everything else.
<Q - William Carcache>: Thank you. That's very helpful. If I could ask one more, on a different topic, there are some
banks who many would put into the quality bucket who have significant excess liquidity parked at the Fed and there are
others that use their excess liquidity to restructure the right-hand side of their balance sheets, and therefore, don't have
that liquidity available today. Obviously, everyone regards you as being in that kind of high-quality camp, but you don't
appear to have as much excess liquidity that you're holding at the Fed. Can you remind us of why that is?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. We look at our liquidity. As you know, we've got 9.1% on our Common Equity
Tier 1 ratio. That's about 110 basis points above our target of 8%. And if you think about it, we're holding that excess
rate between our target and where we're actually performing, because we haven't been able to really reinvest or grow
our loan balances as much as we would want to. So if we can get back into that 6%-plus balance sheet growth and so
forth, I think, that you'll see our capital be right in line with kind of our real target.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Exactly right, Kathy. And I'd add, actually, one of the reasons we don't have excess liquidity
on the balance sheet is because we were building our securities portfolio to address the LCR at exactly the right time, at
the time the deposits were going faster than loans, and we used the excess to build security, so we're very balanced and
we sit in that situation today. So we are not [indiscernible] (47:19) at the Fed in any material way. You're right.
<Q - William Carcache>: Got it. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well, I'll repeat the same question as in the past, Richard Davis versus the 10-year. And the
10-year has been winning recently. And here you are talking about faster loan growth, which seems to be that you
should be winning over the 10-year as far as what the 10-year is saying about growth. On the other hand, you're seeing
what's going on in the market.
So my question is, is the economy getting better or worse? What's your conviction level and confidence? And also, as
the capital markets, at least, in certain areas of the capital markets, liquidity is less plentiful. Is that an opportunity for
you to step in and lend even more? Because you said the expansion in loan growth is on the consumer side and on the
wholesale side, it's the same. But is this an opportunity for you to step in and borrow where some of the non-banks
might be retreating – I'm sorry, a chance for you to lend more where some of the non-banks are retreating?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I got it. Let's start first on just general lending appetite. As a junior lender years ago, there's
still a steady state paradigm that you only make a loan based on ability, stability and willingness. And the willingness is
a low part. People are able to take loans. They are more stable than they've been in seven years, eight years, but they're
just not willing. So we can't create willing, and we're not going to create willing. And those that are most willing are the
ones that are too eager; we don't want them.
So that's, in part, why you're going to see our loan growth, I think, be steady, but not robust, because we're going to
reflect whatever the economy says. I also do think our market share has grown a lot; and you have all the data to prove
it. So we are getting first look from a lot of customers that maybe a decade before didn't think of us as much.
Capital market side, I think, you also – and the answer is yes. We can step in and now be a lender of support for those
who have other alternatives and want to use it a more traditional balance sheet approach to growing their business. And
as I said earlier, we're no longer auditioning. We're well ensconced now as one of the top two or three banks in most
large companies' portfolio, or the place they would call for the opportunity.
And that comes from our debt ratings, Mike. I mean, if you're a C-Suite person in a Fortune anything or one of the
largest private companies, you really do value ratings, and you value the top-notch level that we have, and that means
more to you than sometimes pricing, which we also offer. So I think, in many cases, we'll get more than our fair share
of the capital markets, where there's an interest in using that as an alternative to traditional financing and we set
ourselves up perfectly to be early call and a chance to deliver.
Andy, you might add to any of those since you run them.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. I think that's right. And I think the point that you made, which is the market share
point of the equation, I saw that growth perhaps is a little higher than it would be average, and most of that's coming
from taking market share. And that's certainly true on the wholesale side of the equation. And it comes back to that
ratings discussion you just had.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: On that last point, so as you see private equity firms back away from some energy companies
and you see some loan funds that have gotten burnt back away, is that an opportunity for you to step in and lend more
to, say, oil and gas companies? And I'm sorry, I got on the call a couple of minutes late. Did you indicate what are your
reserves against oil and gas loans?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. I'll jump in. First of all, nothing you said changes our appetite for risk. We're not
going to change it no matter how attractive things look. And you probably heard that part earlier. As Bill talked earlier,

our energy portfolio's only 1.2% of the company. We've added reserves to at this particular quarter. We're at 5.4%
reserves against the energy portfolio for our company, which, I think, will prevail to be a reasonable place at this point
in time with oil at $29, $30.
I also said we have plenty of room and appetite and willingness to move those reserves higher, if we need to, and we're
watching as we stress-test the heck out of those things. But as it relates to taking alternatives, we want to be a capital
markets alternative to more traditional lending. But if it has anything to do with the risk profile that's unique and
different than it is today, it doesn't matter what it is, we're not going to do it.

Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Hi. Couple of questions. Just trying to get a sense of what you're seeing in the marketplace. C&I
loans, your yields were flat, LIBOR was up through the quarter. Can you talk a little about we're not seeing any impact
of that, why? And then, the yields are fairly low at 2.86%or something like that I believe – no, 2.68% actually.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Vivek, this is Andy. So the corporate spreads are a function of two things. One is where our
growth is coming is more from the high-quality side of the portfolio. So a little bit less on the highly levered things like
that that are falling off on some of the leasing portfolio. And we're seeing high-quality corporate growth, which is a
little thinner spread, as you're right.
The second is some of the growth that you're seeing is also short term in terms of its tenor, which is causing – it's a
little bit of a thinner spread, perhaps, linkage to a bond deal that's short term in nature, related to an M&A transaction.
So it is a little thinner, again, than what is typically on the books, but again, high-quality, still profitable, but just a little
different mix.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Andy, for that. Secondly, on the NIM side, going back to the comments
you and Kathy and the others have made, you've got a very healthy amount of non-interest-bearing deposits. Even
though I know it's only 25 basis points, I'm presuming, are you – firstly, are you passing – have you begun passing
anything on at all to any of your customers? And secondly, given that, what's offsetting the NIM benefit from all of
your low-cost deposit base?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. So at this point, we are passing. We are seeing some interest rate increases,
particularly, around our wholesale side. We haven't seen a whole lot of movement right now on the consumer side. And
I think that's pretty true across the industry. So that is, as we look into quarter one, the fact that those repricings are
starting, but starting a little bit maybe lower than what we would have actually modeled, I think, is basically benefiting
us.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Vivek.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. Richard, several quarters ago, I asked you about projects that you might be
investing in if you saw better revenue trends. I think you said at that time you had a whole list of projects that you
wanted to dive into when things looked a little better. Are we at that point yet? Do you still have that list? Or have you
started to implement some of these investments?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Nancy. I remember saying that. And first of all, what we didn't do is, with our
efficiency program, we didn't stop, as I said earlier, our innovation and our investments in technology. So one thing that
I would have put back first was something I never took out. The other one, I think, I mentioned was wealth
management and the ultra-high net worth and building more locations – physical locations for people to come and visit.
We currently have six.
I'd love to move that to a much higher level. It's going to be a long investment lead. So I've got to be thoughtful. I'd do
it if I could right now, but the investment lead is so long then until I see a more robust economy with interest rate
increases, I would be putting too much ahead of that and put ourselves in harm's way. So those would be the two that I
meant when I mentioned it to you. And one of them we're still doing, the other one we've got – on the placeholder
ready to roll when it needs to.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Yeah. And could you just give us, Andy, this might be a question for you. I mean,
you mentioned the auto business. What's your outlook for this year? I mean, you're coming off such a strong year. Can
you just sort of give us some color on that segment?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I would expect the growth to be similar to what you saw in 2015. More focused on the
lending side versus the leasing side and a little bit – principally, prime auto on the lending side. So the spread situation,
what might have been 110 basis points or 120 basis points is maybe down to 100 basis points or right around that area.
A lot of that's because of the aggressive nature of the manufacturers, but I think the growth prospects for 2016 are
going to be very similar to what you saw in 2015.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Are you picking up market share there? Is that part of your growth picture?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yeah. We are both with the dealers as well as certain manufacturers that we're trying to
partner with in different ways. A little bit on the lending side, but also on the leasing side.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Optum is part of UnitedHealth.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. UnitedHealth.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Great. Thank you. And then, and Richard, I appreciate you calling out the gain in HSA and
maybe the possible offset in terms of the expenses in the quarter to get more of a run rate. And I hope you don't think
I'm beating you up too much, but should I really back out the expenses in the quarter tied to legal and compliance since
first quarter, your level of expense is supposed to be similar to the reported level in fourth quarter?
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: There's going to be a lot of moving parts to this. And we're very early in the quarter,
but I think that if you go with the guidance of just relatively stable, I think, you'll – in fact, that's kind of what we're
thinking of as we look out into the first quarter.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm going to give you something you don't know, which is why you call. This year we're
going to look back on 2015 and we're not going to pay out 100% of our bonus pool. This is my tenth year as CEO, it'll
be the first year we didn't. And I'm okay with that, because we live and die by the sword, and our guys are amazingly
competent and capable. And when we have great years, we pay them out handsomely over 100% of target and when we
don't, we don't. And so what that means to you is the accrual goes back to 100% in first quarter, because you expect to
make your plan.
And so that's a fairly interesting delta. I'm not going to size it for you exactly, but that would be something that I would
have told you more next quarter, but I might as well tell you now, because you're struggling to think it through why we
would otherwise want to say stable. That's another fairly meaningful part of it.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of Guggenheim.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. Just one final question on expenses, which has been discussed at great length, but I just
want to understand what is actually funding these growth initiatives? Is it strictly the benefit of the top line growth
that's occurring in some measure? Or is it coming from efficiency savings that continue to be gained in other places?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Both. In terms of your speaking of innovation, particularly, we just had that in the run rate
for about seven years or eight years. It's just something that would be easy to slow down. And that's the part I'm
defending that we didn't. I can't underestimate enough. When you have an acquiring payments business, not just an
issuing, you get to work with the merchant, not the commercial customer, the merchant, the one who sells stuff. And
then you get to bring your consumers in.
And we pilot and test all kinds of relationships and partnerships, and we learn best practices, consumer preferences,
merchant preferences, and some of the stuff never makes it to the Street, because it's really a bad idea, but it looked
good. So that we don't want to slow down. That's been in the run rate for, Eric, for as many years as I can remember. So
there's no new increased cost.
And as I said earlier, things like our large brand reputation campaign we're going to launch this year will cost money.
We haven't had the run rate, but it's going to come in part from the efficiency program. Some we'll give back to the
shareholders, some we'll keep for ourselves and invest in things we've long wanted to do. So that's kind of the way to

think about it.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. And you've given, I think, very clear guidance about the first quarter. But has
anything that's occurred in terms of portfolio acquisitions or other kinds of dynamics further disrupt what would be the
typical quarterly cadence in terms of expense seasonality?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Not at all. You're right to ask that. In fact, I think, in this quarter we're going to go back at
our next opportunity and show and remind people how steady our four quarters are and how – which quarter is
strongest, which one's weakest and how the linked quarters move. And I'm only saying that because it's so consistent,
you can set your watch by it. And it's probably a good way to go back and look.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hi. Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just credit quality for you guys has been
good and you continue to expect that it's going to remain very good, but the world's obviously starting to worry about
bigger other things. So you guys don't have to worry so much about energy, but Rich, I'm just wondering – I don't
know if Bill's there, but back in all of your industries and your subgroups, what are you starting to watch for? What if
anything are you concerned could go the wrong way? We're certainly not seeing it in NPAs, delinquencies, et cetera,
across the company. So can you just tell us your underlying comfort in terms of how things are going and what you'll
be watchful of?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. I'm going to have Bill answer that, Ken. But I do want to call out what a good question
that was, because even with our board of directors, we haven't really focused on credit in many years. And I'm putting
it right back in the front burner, because we're going to start watching trends, and we're going to watch competitors, and
we're going to watch different buckets and tranches, and we're going to learn a lot, all of us, by what's about to happen.
And we start learning about – these small moves now don't look very big, but they can be quite telltale for what's going
to happen. So ask more questions like that, because that's going to, I think, give us a chance to – I'll talk about risk
profile and likely future losses, but, Bill, why don't you answer the question on we're most worried about after energy
and precious metals.
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, I mean, really, it's the impacted areas in the country that we would look most closely at. So
if you think about the Dakotas, and there's not a lot of people or infrastructure up there other than what's in the oil and
gas, but if you get to a state like Texas and the Houston area, where it is fairly energy dependent economy. So you
really look at kind of newly unemployed trends.
I mean, that's the thing that's going to generate potential delinquencies in the consumer portfolios, and then, that just
has a ripple effect in terms of lower demand for small business growth, et cetera. So we're focused very closely on
watching the economies around kind of the energy belt areas in the United States. We do have, as Richard said earlier,
we're national in our commercial real estate, national in our auto lending cards. So we have been watching carefully.
We have not seen any impact yet even though we do see that 50,000 oil workers have lost their jobs in the last year or
so. But it really has not shown up yet, though. But those are the kinds of things that we watch every day.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. And one follow-up, just you guys talk a lot about the strength in the payments
businesses, and then, we still have that offsetting potential benefit from the energy subsidy that's not quite coming
through. So in terms of just payments growth and underlying, can you talk about do you envision the energy subsidy

starting to get spent? Or do you think that's just an ongoing drag in certain parts of the businesses and we're not quite
seeing it offset to the positive in other?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: This is Andy. So I wouldn't say that the energy subsidy is being spent to a large degree. So
we're seeing steady growth. Our card growth, as you saw, was very good. We had a fairly good Christmas season, the
holiday season, if you compare and contrast to the MasterCard numbers, which from Black Friday through Christmas
Eve, let's say, a 7.9% growth. Ours was over 10% growth, which is better than it was last year, but it's not substantially
better. So it's good and steady, but we're not seeing all the dollars saved on the energy side move into spend on the
consumer side.

Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Terry.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Hi, Terry.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the headwinds to credit and debit
card revenue in 2016 just from lower equipment sales, they kind of were up in Q3. You mentioned they were down a
bit in Q4. And then, maybe just as a follow-on, that same question on revenue, given lower gas prices and what that
does to the fleet vehicle card at Elavon?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So actually, the spend activity on merchant terminals peaked in the third quarter,
came down about 1% or 2% in the fourth quarter. And I would expect it to be fairly level going into 2016. So there's
still a number of merchants who haven't purchased new terminals that we would expect a steady stream of that
occurring. But the headwind, so to speak, as you described it, was about 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter, but I don't
expect a lot of further headwind going into 2016.
<Q - Terry J. McEvoy>: And then, just a quick question for Kathy. The tax rates kind of jumped around. Could you
give us a little insight into full-year 2016 for the tax rate? Thank you.
<A - Kathy Ashcraft Rogers>: Yeah. You're right. The tax rate did rise in the fourth quarter and that was principally
due to the fact that we had some mix change in our tax credit business. So as I look out into 2016, I'd put that rate in the
kind of in that 28% to 29% range, and, as I said today, probably right in the middle of that range.
