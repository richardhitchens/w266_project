As always, we've provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today, and as a reminder,
you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at Boeing.com.
Before we begin, I need to remind you that any discussions and goals this morning are likely to involve risks, which are
detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statements disclaimer at the end of
this web presentation. In addition, we refer you to the earnings release and presentation for disclosures and
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now I turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everybody.
Let me begin today with an update on the 787's return to flight, followed by an overview of our business environment
and some thoughts on yet another strong quarter of operating performance. After that, Greg will walk you through our
financial results and outlook.
As you may recall in January, I described returning the 87 to service as our first order of business. Nothing is more
important than the safety of the crews and passengers who fly our airplanes, and nothing rallies our team more than the
challenge of resolving issues that affect our customers' ability to operate those airplanes as intended. Over these many
weeks, hundreds of experts from across Boeing, our supplier partners and other outside organizations worked day and
night alongside U.S. and Japanese authorities to identify the factors that could have caused the 787 batteries to fail, and
then to design, develop and test a comprehensive, permanent fix.
Last Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration formally approved our proposed solution after carefully examining
the results of a rigorous month-long certification test program. In short, our battery system improvements include
multiple layers of protection to prevent and isolate potential faults, along with a new enclosure designed to keep any
battery event from affecting the airplane or even being noticed by passengers. After more than 200,000 hours of
engineering work, validation by a non-advocate team of more than a dozen leading battery experts and now with the
certification by the FAA, the 787 will return to flight with our continued high confidence in its safety, reliability and
overall integrity.
Immediately upon receiving the FAA's approval last week, we began the process of installing the improved battery
system on the in-service fleet while also implementing the changes on new airplanes being readied for delivery in
Everett and Charleston. Thus far, we have started installation on 10 fleet aircraft and nine production airplanes. We
expect to complete the bulk of fleet retrofits by mid-May. Production test flights began last week and deliveries are
expected to resume in early May and despite the three-month delivery suspension, our forecast remains to deliver
greater than 60 787's during 2013.
On behalf of everyone at Boeing, I would like to thank our supplier partners, our outside battery experts, the FAA,
NTSB, JTSB and JCAB for their determined professionalism throughout this journey. We would also like to thank our
customers and their passengers for enduring this disruption and inconvenience caused by this issue. While
disappointing and frustrating from the outset, the silver lining in this experience has been seeing all parties in this
process working to ensure that air travel remains the safest form of transportation the world has ever known.
Furthermore, the value proposition of the 787 and its game-changing economics, fuel efficiency, lower noise and
emissions and unmatched passenger comfort has emerged fully intact, and we look forward to reconnecting airlines and
their passengers to the 787's remarkable benefits in the coming days and weeks.
As many of you know, in the 15 months of service prior to the major issue with the battery, initial dispatch reliability
on the 787 was at par or better than the benchmark 777. We fully expect that trend to continue as we return the airplane
to service. Our nearly 97 years of experience introducing new airplanes also conditions us to expect additional, more
normal, shall we say, start-up issues as more airplanes enter the fleet with more carriers in the months ahead. Our

approach will be to find them, address them and ultimately ensure the 787, like every Boeing airplane before it,
achieves the very high level standard for performance and reliability we promise customers at the outset of the
program.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 2. Global customer demand for our fuel-efficient and
value-creating commercial airplane family remains strong. A fact reinforced by a healthy first quarter net new orders
total of 209 airplanes, which increased our record commercial airplane backlog to more than 4,400 airplanes worth
$324 billion. Our customers continue to replace older airplanes in favor of new ones that offer compelling economics
and increased fuel efficiency. The quest to accelerate deliveries also continues at a healthy pace.
Passenger traffic trends remain healthy. However, we continue to see near-term pressure in the cargo market. Softness
in this segment contributed to the decision announced last week to adjust the 747 program build rate down to 1.75
airplanes a month from two a month beginning in early 2014. While we booked three 747 airplane orders in the quarter
and received commitments for two more, the rate decision was made to more closely align production to near-term
demand overall. As the only provider of very large freighters, we believe our fuel-efficient 747-8 is well positioned to
benefit our customers once cargo market conditions improve.
Airline interest in our fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains significant as we now have booked almost 1,200 cumulative
orders to date. 787 backlog was further extended by 42 orders during the quarter in addition to a commitment by British
Airways to exercise 18 options. We also received a commitment from Ryanair to order 175 737NGs. As a result, we
now effectively have bridged production from the NG to the MAX, allowing us to smoothly transition our production
system later this decade.
Overall, aircraft demand remains relatively balanced geographically, and our backlog remains evenly split between
airplanes used to support traffic growth and fleet replacement. We remain focused on balancing production schedules
with this strong demand in order to minimize long-term volatility in build rates and maximize productivity and
profitability.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, during the quarter we saw Congress and the Administration act to avoid
indiscriminate across-the-board budget sequestration cuts in fiscal year 2013 by passing a continuing resolution that
permits the Defense Department to more selectively allocate spending and approve multi-year contracts for programs
such as, in Boeing's case, the Chinook and B-22. We believe this flexibility advantages our portfolio of reliable, proven
and affordable systems that are on budget and on schedule. However, we remain cautious regarding the potential for
further U.S. defense budget reductions and the mid- to long-term impact of continued sequestration.
In the President's fiscal year 2014 budget submission, we noted strong support for the majority of our core programs.
Despite budget reductions at the top line level, growth is still expected in areas we have been targeting with investment
and attention such as space, unmanned systems, intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance, and cyber security. With
our expanded product offering in commercial satellites, we expect to pursue and capture growth in this market due to
the compelling value our smaller satellites provide to global customers.
Last week's major win for the AH-64 Apache in the Republic of Korea is the latest in a series of key international
competition results that reflect the alignment between our portfolio of products and services and international customer
requirements in the current business environment.
International Defense, Space & Security business represented 28% of revenue during the quarter and grew to 42% of
our current backlog as we continue to expand our share in addressable international markets. To enhance our
competitive position in the Defense market, achieving our market-based affordability targets that maximize efficiencies
and reduce infrastructure costs is a daily focus of Defense, Space & Security business and its multi-year effort to
further strengthen its competitive position in U.S. and international defense markets.
That effort is also benefiting from productivity gains and cost savings achieved through our Enterprise Partnering for
Success initiative that we launched last fall with our major supply chain partners. Partnering for Success, as you may
recall, takes a team-oriented approach to examine opportunities across the supply chain in design, production and
support to drive significant improvements in quality, flow and efficiency that will increase productivity and lower costs

for customers. It's a win-win for us and our suppliers who step up to the challenge and secure future growth in so doing
by increasing customer value today.
During the quarter we also succeeded in averting a work stoppage through successful negotiations of a new four-year
contract with our Engineering and Technical Workers Union in Puget Sound to support our commercial airplanes and
defense programs in the region. This agreement also helps mitigate our future pension liabilities by including a defined
contribution plan for all new hires.
Moving on to slide three, our business and core functions performed extremely well during the quarter as we reported
strong revenue, expanded operating margins, and solid operating cash flow. Revenue at Commercial Airplanes was
$10.7 billion and operating margin grew to 11.4%, resulting from solid program execution and lower margin dilution
from fewer 787 deliveries than originally planned. And as an example of our continued efforts to improve productivity
and efficiencies, we announced the consolidation of our North American Flight Training operation into our existing
Miami facility.
We are also reducing our infrastructure primarily on the 787, as we capture efficiencies and production stabilizes. We
delivered 137 commercial airplanes and successfully executed multiple planned production increases, including
increasing the 777 rate to a record 8.3 airplanes per month and raising the 737 to a record 38 airplanes per month, with
the next increase to 42 per month coming in the second quarter of 2014. We also initiated the rate break to seven per
month as planned in 787 final assembly. Production health on the 787 continues to improve and we remain on track to
increase the rate to 10 per month by year-end.
On our Commercial Airplane Development programs we have effectively completed engineering work on the 787-9.
The first airplane is expected to enter final assembly in Everett at mid-year, followed by first flight in the second half of
this year and first delivery in the early part of next year.
The 737 MAX development also remains on track with firm configuration expected mid-year and entry into service as
planned in 2017.
On our twin-aisle lineup with the 787-10X and 777X, we continue to progress through our disciplined gated
development process, focusing on affordability and discussing with customers their requirements and the technology
they value. These are very attractive investments that leverage prior lessons learned and previous technology
development efforts, all of which will increase shareholder value.
The business case continues to strengthen for the 787-10 and the customer interest in the airplane is high due to its
compelling price and value equation for both us and our customers. We continue to anticipate the potential launch of
the 787-10 this year.
Likewise, the business case for the 777X also continues to mature as we further evaluate options, including design and
production locations. During the quarter, we selected GE as the sole source engine manufacturer for the 777X program.
New engines and an all new composite wing that leverages the design and technologies of the 787 wing along with
other meaningful improvements will make this airplane immensely competitive and ensure our 777 franchise remains
the standard bearer in its class for years to come. We continue to target entry into service for the 777X around the end
of the decade.
Turning to the Defense business, Defense, Space & Security generated revenue of $8.1 billion in the first quarter,
delivering 44 aircraft and one satellite. Higher deliveries on Apache, C-17 and P-8 along with growth in satellite
volume contributed to healthy revenue in the quarter. Numerous important awards were captured during the quarter,
including a contract at our small satellite business as well as a contract for the integrated C4ISR targeting system that
provides the Air Force intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and targeting in one easy-to-use,
lightweight, handheld device.
Noteworthy milestones achieved during the quarter included the second successful test flight of the unmanned Phantom
Eye, delivery of the first Indian Air Force C-17 to flight test and completion of flight testing for the India P-8I airplane.
We also delivered the sixth P-8A to the U.S. Navy, which completes the first run of low rate initial production.

In summary, notwithstanding 787 deliveries deferred while we worked through the battery issue, operationally we are
off to a very strong start across the board for 2013 with solid revenues, earnings and cash generation. Our teams remain
laser focused on continuing successful execution of the ongoing production and development programs that are
important to our customers and are delivering value to our shareholders.
Now I'll turn it over to Greg to discuss our financial results and our guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning.
Let's turn to slide four and we'll discuss our results for the quarter. First quarter revenue was $18.9 billion, driven by
strong deliveries at both Commercial Airplanes and our Defense business. Strong core operating margins of 9.9% in the
quarter were primarily driven by solid productivity gains at both businesses and improved mix. Core earnings per share
increased 24% to $1.73 a share in the quarter on continued strong operating performance in both Commercial Airplane
and the Defense business.
As anticipated, first quarter EPS includes $0.19 from the 2012 research and development tax credit that was passed into
law earlier this year. First quarter EPS last year included $0.11 from a favorable court adjustment on a satellite
litigation.
Now let's discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide five. For the first quarter, our Commercial Airplane business reported
revenue of $10.7 billion on 137 airplane deliveries and strong operating margins of 11.4%. Commercial Airplane
operating margin benefited from delivery mix in the quarter, lower R&D and improved performance that was partially
offset by higher period costs, primarily associated with the engineering and retrofit activities on the 787 battery. The
strong core operating performance in the quarter was a testament to our continued focus on efficiently executing our
rate increases and driving productivity.
Gross inventory for the company included $28.8 billion related to the 787 program, an increase in the first quarter of
approximately $3.3 billion driven by the planned increase in production rate on the program and fewer 787 deliveries in
the quarter. Included in the work-in-process inventory are deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the
program was $17.1 billion at the end of the first quarter and includes approximately 61 airplanes still in process. The
deferred production balance is still expected to peak at slightly over $20 billion and then decline after the program
achieves the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level.
Commercial Airplanes captured $15 billion of orders during the quarter and increased backlog to a record $324 billion
for over 4,445 airplanes. Customer demand for our game-changing fuel efficient airplanes remains strong, as illustrated
by an additional 121 737 MAX orders and 42 787 orders in the quarter.
Let's turn now to our Defense, Space & Security results on slide six. First quarter revenue for our Defense business was
$8.1 billion and operating margins grew to a strong 10.3%, driven by improved mix and performance. International
customers accounted for 28% of our Defense revenue in the first quarter, and we continued to drive towards our goal of
30% of revenue going forward. Focus on affordability continues as we remain committed to driving our market-based
affordability efforts, and are on track for further lowering our cost structure in an effort to increase our productivity and
strengthen our competitive position in this challenging environment. Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft was $4.1
billion in the first quarter as higher deliveries on Apache, C-17 and P-8A was offset by lower F-15 volume. Operating
margin of 10.5% was primarily driven by improved performance and delivery mix.
Network and Space Systems revenue of $2 billion increased 5%, primarily driven by improved commercial satellites
volume. Operating margin was 8% in the quarter on favorable delivery mix.
Global Services and Support had first quarter revenue of $2 billion, resulting from lower volume on various logistics
contracts. GS&S had healthy operating margins of 12.1%, primarily driven by improved performance at our
Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades business. Defense, Space & Security had a solid backlog of $68 billion.

International business remains very strong with 42% of our current backlog representing customers outside the United
States.
Turning now to slide seven, the BCC Net Financing portfolio declined to $4.2 billion on normal runoff that exceeded
new aircraft volume. Unallocated expense from core operations was $170 million and was higher due to a favorable
court judgment on a satellite litigation recorded in the same period last year.
Now turning to cash flow on slide eight, both our Commercial and Defense businesses did an outstanding job on
focusing on cash in the quarter. Despite fewer 787 deliveries, first quarter operating cash flow was a solid $524 million.
Moving now to cash and debt balances on slide nine, we ended the quarter with nearly $12 billion of cash and
marketable securities, and timing of the 787 events limited our ability to repurchase shares in the first quarter.
However, we expect to begin our repurchase plan in the second quarter and remain committed to our $1.5 billion to $2
billion of share repurchase planned for 2013.
Turning now to slide ten to discuss our outlook for 2013, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2013. We still expect 787
deliveries to be greater than 60 this year, with second quarter deliveries for approximately 15% to 20% of our full-year
deliveries. Total commercial airplane deliveries are still expected to be between 635 and 645 for the year. Revenue
guidance for 2013 remains at between $82 billion and $85 billion, largely reflecting higher commercial airplane
deliveries and continued challenging defense environment. Core earnings per share guidance is unchanged at between
$6.10 and $6.30 a share, representing approximately 5% growth driven by continued strong execution across both
businesses.
Operating cash flow guidance before pension contributions remains at greater than $8 billion reflecting higher delivery
volume and again continued strong performance.
So overall, performance was stronger the quarter as we further improved productivity at both businesses, successfully
increased our planned production rates and efficiently and effectively managed cash. We expect this strong operational
performance to continue throughout the balance of 2013.
Now I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
W. James McNerney
Thanks, Greg.
With a strong first quarter behind us and implementation of the 787 battery solution well underway, we remain
committed to the goals we initially set for 2013. That includes continued conversion of our record backlog into
deliveries while generating strong core operating performance that allows us to return cash to shareholders while
investing wisely in our products, technologies and people to sustain our growth and competitiveness.
Our priorities going forward remain clear. The profitable ramp up of production on our commercial airplane programs,
executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability throughout the
enterprise, continuing to strengthen and reposition our defense business with investments in growth areas amid further
international expansion and importantly, returning increasing value to both our customers and shareholders.
Now with that thought, we'd be glad and happy to take your questions.

<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Your operating margins were helped, to some degree, by the absence of 78. On the other
hand, pre-R&D margins on commercial were up year-on-year and defense business was also very strong. Could you
address, Jim, maybe a little bit further from your commentary, what sort of goals you're setting for your operating units
so that you can see this ongoing improvement?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, Howard, first of all, productivity and affordability is fundamental to everything we
do, whether it's running a factory, whether it's running a back room, or whether it's designing or building airplanes, so
that has been a main theme that is beginning to pay off, has paid off, and we will not let up on even though we're
beginning to grow significantly led by our Commercial business. So productivity is foundational. Now growth is also a
piece of the margin expansion equation.
We've taken up rates on 777 and 73, you're going to begin to see the rate which is on schedule and we have confidence
in that schedule on the 87 begin to increase, a couple of multi-years have been nailed down on our Defense business
which also gives us opportunity to use volume to help drive margin expansion. I also think the other comment I'd make
is that we're entering an era now where R&D is being used more efficiently, and I think that will not stop this quarter
and so notwithstanding some development programs out ahead of us, I think you may see more efficient use of research
and development costs over the next period of time. So that would be my answer there.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: You're welcome, Howard.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I wonder if I could follow up on what you just mentioned which was R&D. Because you did
come in relatively low in spending on R&D, and given that year-over-year decline in commercial R&D, how do you
get to the $3.4 billion this year? Is it driven by the potential launch of 777X and/or 787-10 to drive that pickup over the
course of the year? How should we think about it?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I would think – the thought here would be and I would include the MAX in what
you've just said there in terms of some ongoing development efforts. I think look – if you step back for a second and
look at this decade compared to the last one we have the opportunity to harvest some hard-fought gains in our
Commercial Airplane business and we all remember the times of fighting through the 87 development were the
technologies weren't quite as mature as we'd hoped they'd be at certain points in time. We had to spend a lot of money.
The 47-8 cost us a bit more than we assumed it would and we spent a lot of money on research and development.
Now this decade this team is committed to harvesting some of the learning from that decade and also harvesting some
of the technology maturation that was hard-fought and we now have in hand. So I think when you look at the 777X you
look at a 10X or you look at a MAX these are derivative programs that tend to leverage more efficiently what we know.
There is not a lot of invention going on. There is a lot of creative application and use of a technological lead that we
have and that leads to – and I know this is a broader answer then maybe you were looking for – but that leads to
confidence that more restrained levels of R&D can continue for longer periods of time.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jim, you've highlighted that the demand environment remains very strong and that customers are
looking to accelerate deliveries but given how many planes you now have in the backlog what real capacity or
flexibility do you have to further raise rates beyond what you've currently committed to?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think that there is – demand is strong and in fact to be honest the first piece of
2012 surprised us a little bit. It's above trend. I think it's between 5% and 6% on an industry level. So demand on the
passenger side looks strong. We do have confidence in the ongoing trend line sort of between 4% and 5%. But I think –
we have been ramping up production, there is more to go on the 737. I think we've given you visibility on that beyond
the 38 that we just broke to. Could there be more be on the 42? We'll have to wait and see. But there is strong demand
for narrow body airplanes in the world today. I think getting to 10 a month, as all of you have mentioned to me, is not a
free throw.
On the 87, we have strong confidence levels that we're going to get there on the timing that we've suggested to you. Is
there demand beyond that? Question mark. There are many that think there is but we'll go through the disciplined
process. But I think the middle of the wide body which would span the 87 up to the 777 – there's more room to run
there and we'll adjust our rates as we see it and narrow body. So I don't think it's over yet.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Great. Thanks very much.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, guys, and good quarter.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning, Carter.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Thank you, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Greg, I wondered if I could ask you to expand on a couple of accounting points since you
know I can't help myself.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I understand.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: On the program versus unit, you guys were about $900 million in the quarter but there was
only one 787 delivery so I wondered if...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: First, you could expand on that and then secondly on the deferred production per unit it looks
like you took down pretty nicely there to around $70 million a unit. I know you went through the 100th unit in the
quarter and you had said that there was a good step down in costs there. So I'm not sure if you can comment within
those units if you saw even further progress from the beginning to the end but any color you could provide there would
be helpful.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure. Well, on the unit versus program most of that is driven by 47 and then that one
airplane on the 87 is our second delivery out of Charleston which, as you know, we had as planned longer flow and

learning applied to that airplane. But as I've said in the past looking at it from a unit versus program is going to become
more challenging because of the mix of differentiation in the lineup of airplanes that were manufactured earlier coming
out of EMC and airplanes coming off the line, now to add into that, you've got the -9.
So you're right, I would focus more now on the deferred production growth, and we are seeing improvements there on a
unit basis and I think that's a good representation of what you're seeing in the factories. Right now, we're looking at
about a 60% on a unit basis from kind of first airplane line eight to about line 100.
So we're continuing to see good progress there. We're seeing that both at Charleston and in Everett and when you kind
of step back and look at the key operational metrics that essentially are going to drive the financials we're seeing on the
87 right now, shortages that are at record low, travel work coming in is essentially at 0, so it's really giving us the
opportunity to stabilize the final production line and have it running as it was planned I think we're starting to see the
benefits of that.
We are also focused on the overall productivity and support ratios and you're seeing declines in employment around
there as planned as we kind of increase our production. So overall operationally you're seeing improved results and
that's translating into the growth in deferred production. But again, I would tell you from outside in, I'd tell you to
continue to focus on the deferred production growth in our production rates around that.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: 60% was the total cost or the deferred production per plane?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Total cost.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: You had a pretty strong result I thought in cash flow considering that you couldn't ship for
most of the quarter on the 787. And you've got some benefits in the advances category and I guess mitigated the
inventory build a little more than I thought. I just was wondering as you look forward, Greg, to the rest of the year how
you're feeling about that guidance? Is there upside there? And were there items here, big items that are going to
reverse? Or help us out with the profile there a little bit the rest of the year.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, look, I'd tell you first quarter was a combination of timing and improved
performance. We certainly were very active in managing our cash in the first quarter, and were able to pull in some
advances that were frankly timed in the early second quarter. But day-to-day, very disciplined approach to cash
management. I'm feeling comfortable and feeling good about full-year guidance, and obviously the profile on cash
from now going forward, will really be hinged on the ramp-up, primarily around commercial airplane deliveries in
particular on the 87.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: And you didn't dig into the share repurchase plan in the first quarter. Why exactly in the 787?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Just because of everything that was going on around the 787 in the battery we refrained
from doing any repurchase and as I mentioned, we're going to get back in here in the second quarter and we're still
committed to the $1.5 billion to $2 billion for the full-year.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Doug.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I want to follow up on the 787 discussion from before. Based on the deferred production
numbers it does look like your costs are coming down substantially. Could you comment on the trajectory going
forward both in terms of roughly when you might expect to reach break-even on a unit basis and then also what do you
expect to happen when the -9 comes in? Should we expect perhaps a bump back up for a little while?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I mean, well certainly we're planning on continuing to reduce the unit cost on the
airplane going forward and we've got good productivity plans in place for ourselves within the supply chain and we're
assuming that we execute to those. I think the -9 certainly if you look at it as Carter was indicating on it, unit versus
program, you are going to see disruption there, but again, I think the deferred production growth is the best way to look
at it.
As far as the break even goes, as I said, we're going to peak at just over $20 billion once we hit 10 and stabilize and
that's when we'll turn the corner on a unit basis. But Doug, very focused on this, obviously every element of cost,
whether it's in our factories or within the supply chain remains a big priority for us to continue to drive productivity on
this airplane.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And if I can, when you say stabilizing at 10, when you look farther out given the
uniqueness of this airplane, is there a timeframe when you're considering – what timeframe would it be when you
might consider even going higher in rate?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I think once we get to 10 and stabilize and feel good about where we are and all the
operational metrics are in the – all within the right bandwidth, that's the timeframe where we'd be making a decision to
– and obviously the capital and whatever investments are required and continued demand will all be taken into
consideration when and if we decide to take the rate up.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Noah Poponak>: Just want to follow up on 787 as well. Can you maybe sort of, I don't know, walk us through
what your process was to get comfort that the implementation of the battery fix won't be disruptive to all of the positive
comments you're making here on your metrics on cost and on deferred production? It seems like you have your arms
around it, but it's obviously fairly unique. You've never done it before, you have to retrofit the active fleet, retrofit
aircraft on the tarmac, put it into the manufacturing process. Maybe a little bit more color on how you're comfortable

with that not really changing things significantly?
<A - W. James McNerney>: No, I think as mods go, in the end with the fix defined and the implementation in hand,
this is not a big one, okay? This is two batteries and two locations on the airplane that the locations don't have to
change much. There's some different interface to the electrical system, which is not rocket science, I guess I would say,
and there's – the enclosure around the battery which fits into the spacing that already exists, and then there's the exhaust
system which is designed, again, to easily retrofit.
So this is days, not weeks. It's a standardized fix that we've already implemented on a couple of our airplanes and a
couple of our customers' airplanes already, and so we have a pretty high confidence level that we can be through the
majority of this in a few weeks, mid-May out in the field and into our production line and it's not a long pole in any
tent. It's not a gating item on any PERT chart so it's – the straightforwardness of the fix itself, the fact that it doesn't
represent a gating item in any of the production or design, gives us confidence that this won't disrupt anything other
than the schedule that we've laid out.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & company. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. So, Jim, you mentioned expecting to launch the -10 this year.
What would it take to launch? Because it doesn't look like you have a whole lot of delivery slots open at a rate of 10 a
month. What do you need to see in terms of customers? And do you also have to make a decision to go to 12 a month
to be able to deliver it in a reasonable timeframe?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, as usual, Cai, you're asking the right question. I think obviously the stability at 10,
the supply chain's capacity to do the 10 with possible higher rates if that's what the marketplace supports, are the key
questions. The cost of doing this airplane and the technical risk of doing it is not high. There is some – there would be
some capital involved probably, but I think we are feeling very good about all of those issues, okay? And so we're – we
just want to get through what we're getting through right now. We want to feel good about the production environment
that we feel increasingly confident in, and when that all comes together and I would anticipate sooner rather than later,
we're going to be making a call here.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And so, I mean, I assume – what's the earliest you could deliver it?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, we'd have to sort through that because if it did require taking up rate, that would
add a little more time into it. But, again, we'd have to define that and we're working through that right now.
I would say the one thing that we don't lack for with the -10 is demand. Customers want this airplane and so we're
being pushed to get this airplane out. This is more us being disciplined about feeling comfortable with the business case
and about the stability of the manufacturing environment overall before we add something else to it. Sooner rather than
later.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Greg, I'd like to stick with the 787 learning curve since it's just such a key component to your
cash flow story. And I wanted to ask for clarification and just a couple more points on this but when you were
answering Carter's question you mentioned 60%, I want to be clear on what you're talking about there. Are you talking
about a 60% reduction from line number eight in terms of cash cost?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. That's unit cost of line number eight versus unit cost of line number 100.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. So would that then imply something like $160 million cost on 100 down from $400
million on eight?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I haven't gotten into specific costs on the airplane for obvious reasons but I will tell you
from a unit cost perspective we're continuing to come down the learning curve and we expect to do that going forward.
And again, as I mentioned, it's not just within our own factories, it's within our supply chain. I mean just to give you an
example, I was out last week, lead airplane, they've got metrics in place, hours per job, what it is today, what it is on the
next airplane, what it needs to be next week, what it needs to be by the end of the year. So they're very aware of what
they need to do to come down the learning curve and again I think as the production system stabilizes, they're starting
to flush out the efficiencies and we're assuming they'd be able to do that as we continue to deliver more airplanes.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: On that note, could I ask you if the future step downs or the future improvements in the
learning curve – because this was a very significant one of course in Q1, are these tied to step downs that are negotiated
as the rates bump up? In other words, do we see another big move with seven and then another big move with ten?
<A - W. James McNerney>: No.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: It's not tied to that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No. Internally I'd say it's a pretty traditional learning curve with objectives to meet that
curve and then within the supply chain, I think as I've talked before, it's differed by supplier, by supplier depending on
what was negotiated. So in some cases you do have step down pricing at a specific unit. On other cases you have more
of a, I'll say kind of a traditional curve, but it differs supplier by supplier as we kind of work through discussions with
them.
So you won't see what I would say a traditional learning, when you look at an overall basis as you have on other
programs. But again, it's obviously a very big focus item for us and the team is very committed to continuing to look at
efficiencies and again whether it's us or supply chain, once any airplane program gets to rate and stabilizes, we've been
able to prove that we've been able to flush out inefficiencies and come down the curve even further.
And frankly, I think that 737 is a great example of that where that airplane has been in production a long time and
there's still opportunities that we've be able to capture and efficiencies and we're going to continue that discipline on the
87. So a lot of work to do, good plans, I think, in place, but a very committed focus and team to continue down that
curve on a unit by unit basis.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Greg, just on 737 since you brought it up, Jim talked about bridging the two models with the
Ryanair order. How should we think about pricing during that period of time and margins on the aircraft and then the
mix of production? Will you overlap or make something of a clean break between the two, in that [indiscernible]
(47:38)?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No, it'll be gradual. Part of the production plan there is to as you phase out NG, ramping up
MAX at the same time, so there's some capital that we've invested there to really do that seamlessly and have the MAX
running down and being proved out on one line as the NG line continues to be at peak rate and then we'll make the full
transition. So I think they've got a very good, disciplined, well thought out, manufacturing plan well in advance of
going into final assembly obviously.

As far as pricing is I'd say it's pretty much in line and is playing out within our expectations. As I said before, certainly
when you have end of line or you have airplanes that are first launch customers, so on, there's some more attractive
pricing in that regard, but overall, I think it's coming in within our expectations.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: And the team's doing a great job executing rate. We're at record rate there with record low
shortages, single-digit over time and a very good plan in place to get to 42.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Congratulations on dealing with the battery issue. It was done in a very nice way, I thought.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Thank you.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: A quick clarification for Greg. On the 787 you suggested that when it stabilizes, things will
get a lot better. Can you just clarify exactly how long it takes to stabilize the rate? And then Jim, can you talk a little bit
about what's going in services generally speaking, what your approach is to services going forward as far as growth is
concerned? And obviously you've seen some really nice margin performance in services, particularly on the military
side here recently. Can you just offer a little bit of color as to generally what's going on in services? Why the good
performance and what the outlook looks like there?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I think on the – make sure I answer your question on the unit cost, but as we peak and
then that's when we'll start to become positive on a unit cost basis again as it stabilizes. So that's usually about a year,
year and a half once we hit 10. That's the plan right now. But based on everything else you heard me say today we're
continuing to try to pull that to the left the best we can. But essentially that's the timeframe that you'd be looking at on a
unit basis.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And on your question on services I think overall in both sides of our business we see it is
a growth opportunity. I think if there was a theme – since we're leveraging the largest installed base in aerospace in
both our defense and commercial business there is an asset that many others don't have. And – but on top of that
footprint I think there's a theme of injecting more technology and more IT into the services we're adding and so I would
say those two themes plus the theme of packaged multi-year commitments where we're guaranteeing some performance
with technology and the reason we can do that – against some known income stream to us and the reason we think we
can do that more effectively than others is again because we know the technology involved better than anyone else.
And so I think these multi-year deals, more IT particularly on the logistics side and more technology for mods and
modifications. I think that all spells a major growth opportunity if we just keep our feet underneath ourselves and make
the right combo of acquisitions and internal investments which – and it seems to be going well, as you noted.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.

Thank you and that question will come from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Jim and Greg.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Nice quarter. Hey, Jim, I guess talking about 787 going back to when days of Global
Aeronautica used to be the long pole in the tent. It sounds like in South Carolina things are progressing quite well and
you're also announcing a big investment there. I think earlier this month you made an announcement about a $1 billion
investment. Can you give us just some more color about what you're seeing down there and the opportunity and what
kind of flexibility that's going to build in for you given all these projects you have got planned?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Peter, we see South Carolina as exceeding expectations in terms of its performance to
date. Greenfield operations in this industry are not easy and I give credit to the entire Boeing team, plus the team in
Everett, that went out of their way to help make South Carolina a success story early on. So all the metrics there are
good in terms of production rates and efficiencies and cost and productivity and, as you pointed out, we are going to
deepen our engagement down there. South Carolina has and we have put together a deal that offers incentives to us but
asks us to perform against those incentives in terms of investments in new jobs over I believe it's an 8-year period and
we're excited about that because I think Boeing overall is stronger and can handle the growth that we see in front of us.
We see tremendous growth in front of us for the next couple of decades and we're going to need a number of places
from which we can draw talent and use capital. And so we're very pleased South Carolina is moving along as well as it
is.

that'll be handled in accounting. I understand it's amortized over an accounting block of 1,100 planes. Just a little more
detail about that and what you think it cost Boeing overall even though it's not hitting the income statement. That'd be
great.
<A - W. James McNerney>: I'll ask Greg to answer that question for you, Al.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: The majority of it wasn't reflected in our Q1 results and that was period costs and
particularly around R&D and around our root cause investigation, redesign and the testing of that and then also our
estimated cost of incurring the repair for our customers' fleet going forward. So that's what was primarily reflected
there. And as far as the cost base, as you referred to in the 1,100 units, there was a slight increase there for the
additional retrofit on the undelivered airplanes throughout the balance of the cost base.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Can you give numbers? And R&D went down, so...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: We managed to absorb this so it was really a matter of priority when we re-shifted our
priorities and our people onto this effort from other efforts and this is a one-Boeing effort so it was people from MBCA
and BDS and our engineering and technology areas and so on.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: And the additional retrofit, how did that affect the accounting block?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: It's minimal within the accounting block.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: 1,100 up to?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, it's 1,100 units – it's amortized...
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Right.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: On a unit basis, over 1,100, but it's minimal.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Jon Ostrower with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead,
sir.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Morning, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: A question about the decision to, the production profile for 777X you talked about different
competing production locations. Number one, can you talk about the considerations there as you see it and also the 787
learning curve looking at a 60% reduction from airplane eight to airplane 100 with 92 airplanes of learning in that
process. Can you talk about how that compares to the 777 and just doing a rough calculation of the numbers seems to
indicate that it's actually a higher than 85% learning curve there that would seem to indicate that actually cost isn't
coming out as fast as it was in the 777? Can you kind of talk about those two factors.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Jon, I'll give you the answer on 777 and then I'll let Greg handle the learning curve
question. We have figured out, by and large, what airplane to build. We think we know, and as you know, because you
know us well, the composite wing, a modified fuselage, new engines and so the question there is, the question then
becomes and we're sort of in the middle of the assessment now, where to assemble it and where to build the major
components and we're in the middle of that process.

I mean obviously Everett is doing one heck of a job right now building the current 777 model and so it would obviously
be an attractive place to consider for the assembly for the next 777 model, the composite wing. We have to think
through, as in the case of assembly, where we do that. But we're sort of in the middle of that and I think over the next
few months we'll be in a position to talk more in a more granular way about what makes the most sense for our
customers and for the company.
Greg...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, Jon, with regards to the learning curve, yeah. You are seeing a steeper slope there
from unit 8 to 100 if you compare that to 777 and some of that obviously is just the upfront disruption. But over time
the learning curve assumptions will be very similar to what we've seen on the 777. So it's really just those upfront units
that really differentiate that curve.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: How you're seeing the 787 curve now, is it – how does it work over those first hundred
airplanes? Obviously there was a lot of disruption in terms of the rework and all of that. Are you seeing – as you got
stabilized from airplane 66 to 92, how is that curve looking as far as cost reduction goes?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I'd say we're coming down the curve as we had planned to whether it's in final
assembly or within Charleston. So I think the teams are tracking well to the plan we put in place there and certainly as
we've eliminated any disruption and we're seeing components coming in with no open work, again, it really allows the
production system to operate as it was designed and stabilize and therefore be able to come down the curve further and
we expect it going forward throughout the block. So again I think we're making good progress. A lot of work in front of
us but the teams are focused and dedicated to it and we've got to stay on it.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Thanks, guys.
<A - W. James McNerney>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you very much. Our next question in queue will come from Christopher Drew with the New York Times. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Jim, could you step back a second and perhaps reflect a bit on why it's so hard to make a
new plane these days when I think more broadly of not just the 87 but the F-35, some of the Airbus planes and whether
all those difficulties are now going to lead to this era of a little bit more caution here with the harvesting of the
technologies rather than big new planes for quite a while?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think – one thing I've learned in this industry is not to comment on another guy's
airplane.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: So if you don't mind I'll resist any Lockheed Martin or Airbus – I'm impressed enough
with how hard it is to manage what I've got to manage. I would say though there's a theme here. If you look back in the
100 years that we've been in business we go through eras where we get excited by new technologies because of the
performance it can bring our customers whether it's cloth to aluminum, whether it's quilted aluminum to smooth
aluminum and then there's just technological shifts that have gone on and as you make the first bite at that apple you
tend to be on the bleeding edge for a while, as you've heard me characterize. And I think that was the case with the 787.
We should have been – that's not an excuse. We should've been more disciplined about the way we went about that and
it has given us and I think to your point – it now has given us a number, a suite of technologies that we now can deploy
now that they were matured in bleeding edge fashion over the last eight years.
I think the next decade or two allows us to mature these mature technologies into a number of applications and each
and every one of the commercial applications that I talked about today whether it's the 737, the 787 or the 777 new

derivatives are all going to be step function improvements much more than a normal derivative even though the cost of
work will be roughly the same as a new derivative. But the reason they'll provide more benefit is because of all of the
investment and all the bleeding edge work we did over last decade.
So I think we may be in an era where we can absorb somewhat less risk and still deliver a lot of performance. 30 years
from now will there be some new technology that we'll all wrestle with? Probably. Hopefully will there be enough
people in Boeing that are here today that will remember the lessons learned from the 87? I hope so. I'm old; I'll be on a
beach somewhere then. But anyway, that's kind of the answer.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Andrew Parker with Financial Times. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Can you hear me?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, yes. Loud and clear.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Good. Can I just take you back to the 787 and the cost of the grounding episode? Can you just
spell out please what you estimate the cost of the fix that you got approval on from the FAA, what that is going to cost
Boeing? And also, can you speak to – airlines have been talking about compensation. Can you give – for the disruption
of their schedules, et cetera – can you give any sort of sense of the quantum you expect in terms of compensation that
you may have to pay?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I'll start with the cost. As I mentioned earlier, the costs that were incurred in the first quarter
were around the root cause investigation, the redesign and the testing of the components, and then an estimate of what
we think it's going to cost to repair the balance of the customers fleet. That was predominately what was reflected in the
first quarter. I'll let Jim talk about...
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Can you – forgive me for interrupting, can you spell out what that cost is then that's gone
through your Q1 earnings statement?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: We haven't talked specific on the numbers but it's minor in comparison to the overall results
and again we were able to absorb that by reallocating resources and expertise onto this. So again, what you saw in the
results for Q1 we were able to absorb that and that's in those margins, and at the same time, able to hold our full-year
guidance based on that.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Right. And does – to your point about as well as the testing of the fix and so on, you said that
it also reflects some of the cost of actually doing the work on the 50 planes that you've so far delivered.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Correct.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Does it include the cost of fixing all of those 50, or just some of them.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: It includes our estimated cost of what we think it's going to take to do all 50 airplanes.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Right. And forgive me, can you give us a specific number then on this cost?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Right. Okay. And to the point about compensation please?

<A - W. James McNerney>: I'll take a swing at that one, Andrew. I think as you know, there are no contractual
obligations there, but having said that, there are a few places where we'll work with our customers to ensure and there's
a variety of ways we can work with them to ensure that the disruption doesn't hurt their results and their operation more
than it needs to. And that'll be in a different way with every customer.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Right. And could I just follow up with one final thing, forgive me because you may have
addressed this earlier but when do you expect the 787 program to reach breakeven on a unit basis at least?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: It's about – when we reach – when we peak on our deferred production and basically peak at
rate in about a year, year and a half from that time period is when we, on a unit basis, we will break the curve versus
program accounting.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Sorry, the timeline on which on a unit basis you will break even is just in terms of when that
is?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: About two years from now.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: About two years from now.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Right.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Okay. Right. Thanks very much.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Tom Black with Bloomberg. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning. Yeah.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Could you discuss a little bit about the give-and-takes on the 777X that is under discussion right
now the economics versus range, the new components versus compatibility?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think this will be a derivative airplane, a significant derivative airplane. The two
new key technologies will be a composite wing which will be a fourth generation composite wing for us. So this is an
example of a game changing technology that we now have good experience with and now have matured and the second
will be new engines on the airplane. And our discussions with customers have said that the range and efficiency that
this engine wing combination will produce is significant in their minds, and that there'll be a splitting of value between
us and our customers that works for both of us.
So those are the discussions we're having right now. We have a lot of confidence that the – about the executability of
this plane and the pricing we think we can get that will benefit both us and our customers. So we're pretty far down that
evaluation and we're excited about what we see.
<Q - Thomas Black>: You talked about some step function improvements that came from the learning on the 787.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Will that be applied somewhat for the 777?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Will you have more – for example, will you have more electrical components on there versus
some of the bleed off the engines that you use now?

<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. I mean, I think the biggest of those things would be the wing, okay? Composite
wings are incredibly efficient as compared to aluminum wings, not only in the way – not only in the aerodynamics, but
in the weight of them, and that plus the engines are producing over 90% of the value of this airplane. Let me just leave
it that way.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And the composite wing – the bigger a composite wing gets, the more efficient it
becomes, and this is a big composite wing.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Okay and if I could, just on the economics versus range. Some airlines want more range, others
what more economics...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think the market segment that this is going into in general wants as much range as
it can get. And so we will have two models that have different capacities. So thick roots versus thinner roots, but range
is something that within reason, they're going to pay for and that's what the wing produces and that's what the new
engines produce.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Are there any numbers you can throw out there?
<A - W. James McNerney>: No, were not ready to announce the specifics on that yet, but it'll be significant
improvements in most metrics that you would associate with a new airplane.
<Q - Thomas Black>: Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Steve Wilhelm with Puget Sound. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Thank you. That's Puget Sound. I appreciate it, gentlemen.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Just in terms of the 777, could you say a little bit more about the timing of the offer and also
what that will mean in terms of the 747-I?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think the – we see, first of all, we see those two airplanes addressing different market
segments. So I think – and the 777 market segment is a bigger one than the 47-I, but we don't see the 777X introduction
cannibalizing significantly the 47-8, which was the implication of your question. So I think we see two market
segments there and I think the timing is up to the approval of the Board of Directors. But it wouldn't be a shock if this
was settled before the end of the year.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, yes, Steve.
<A - Thomas J. Downey>: Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.

<Q - Joshua Freed>: One last question on the 787 cost. Can you give any kind of ballpark parameter around the per
unit cost of the fix for the ones that are out in the fleet? And obviously that number then won't include all the work that
went into developing the fix, but can you help us think about what it cost to actually install the thing on planes that are
out there now?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, again, I would say it was not significant. You saw it in the first quarter results so the
margin you saw for BCA absorbed that, and again, not significant. When you look at the overall program, over 1,100
units, very, very small. Because if you think about it, you had to put a battery on those airplanes, you're putting a
different configuration here so it's rather minimal on a unit by unit basis as you look over the 1,100 units.
<Q - Joshua Freed>: All right. And what's the current 787 inventory? And what it's going to be in May when the
deliveries restart?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, the 787 inventory is going to continue to grow as we build up for ramping up
production and then that'll be offset by the increase in deliveries. So we expect it to grow. It's planned to grow as we
increase – again, as we increase rate and some of that will be offset by the increase in deliveries. But this quarter, I
think total program was about $28.8 billion.
<Q - Joshua Freed>: So I'm sorry. I didn't ask it very well. What I meant was how many airplanes do have that have
been built, but not delivered now and how many will you have in May when those deliveries then resume?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, we've got 25 airplanes that are on the ramp today that are completed out of final, 5 in
Charleston, 20 in Everett, that are essentially waiting for the battery to be swapped out, so those airplanes, obviously
once we get through the retrofit, we'll get them into our normal test flight schedule and customer delivery, and they are
all assumed in our delivery profile through the balance of the year.
