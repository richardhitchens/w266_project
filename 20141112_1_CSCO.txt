Throughout this conference call we will be referring to both non-GAAP and GAAP financial results. The matters we
will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, and as such, are subject to the risks and uncertainties that
we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K and any
applicable amendments which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in the forward-looking statements.
Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. All comparisons to this call will be on a year-over-year
basis unless stated otherwise. As we have in the past, we will discuss product results in terms of revenue and
geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders, unless specifically stated otherwise.
I will now turn the call over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Thank you very much, Mel. I am pleased to report another solid quarter, our strongest Q1 ever in terms of revenues,
non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP earnings per share. We grew revenues this quarter to $12.2 billion up
from 1% year-over-year, returning to growth as we said we would. We generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow
and returned close to $2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. With strong total
non-GAAP gross margins of 63.3% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.2% we delivered non-GAAP earnings per
share $0.54.
When I think about the quarter, there are three key takeaways that you will see that we will call out in our following
discussion. First, I would say we are managing the business very well in a very tough environment. Second, we are
seeing the results of our three-year transformational work. In this work, moving from selling boxes to selling solutions
and leading with innovation, speed, efficiency as we disrupt the market. Third, we are leading the technology and
business transitions in the market.
Our strategy is playing out as we delivered innovative solutions based on intelligent networks to enable the next
generation of IT and the Internet of Everything. We continue to focus on what made us successful many times in the
past, leading through market transitions. I give us very high marks on our execution.
For example, in the data center, where we are winning the SDN battle with application-centric infrastructure. This
quarter we now have over 900 Nexus 9000 customers, up from 580 last quarter with strong, continued momentum. And
in its first full quarter of shipments, we more than doubled paying customer adoption of the APIC and our ACI
controller that enables automation and programmability of the network [ph] in a skill (04:12) that's never been done
before. The Nexus 9000 and ACI continued to see strong demand from customers who are seeing the significant
advantage of ACI in their application deployment and management.
As I said last quarter, we had two principal objectives when we rolled out our transformational plan in 2011, Gary. So
how are we doing against these objectives? The first one is about driving innovation, speed, agility, and affecting this in
our business. As you are all aware, we are navigating the same macro environment as everyone else. At the same time,
we are also executing on several transitions within our portfolio. Despite this, our results are at or near record levels
and showing momentum on both the top and bottom line. I'm optimistic as things play out this year and beyond Cisco
is very well positioned.
The second objective, move our business from a model that is selling boxes and standalone services to selling
architectures and solutions that drive business outcomes. As every company, every city, every country is becoming
digitized, and we're seeing this on the results of our customer visits around the world, we are engaging with entirely
new business models, leading with software and services and delivering integrated solutions.
Recently, we described an enterprise license agreement for our software portfolio we had signed with General Motors,
a model we're replicating across our enterprise accounts at this time. And last month we discussed what success we've
had together in Barcelona and Chicago as they digitized their cities and evolved into smart cities.

We are tying together the breadth of our product portfolio to deliver solutions that drive growth and economic
opportunity with security and scale. These large strategic deals are becoming a blueprint for how we will move
forward. In the last few quarters, we have talked about three headwinds: emerging markets, SP [Service Provider] and
product transitions at the hand of our switching and routing. The good news is that in the third quarter, the third area,
high-end switching and routing has turned to a tailwind based on momentum in our new product introductions, and
we'll share that with you shortly.
As we said last quarter, we are executing and progressing as I expected, and I am very comfortable with our growth
trajectory. We are pleased that in spite of the headwinds, we are growing again and are very nicely positioned once we
get a positive turn in service provider or emerging markets, ideally in both.
For Q2, we expect to see mid-single digit revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% and non-GAAP earnings per share
in the range of $0.50 to $0.52, which would be an increase of 6% to 11% in terms of the earnings per share given the
range that we covered. Our Q2 guidance reflects an added measure of conservatism, primarily related to reduced spend
at several large U.S. service providers.
I will now provide more detail on the business momentum in our geographies and customer segments within our
portfolio. As a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run the business. In these areas I will speak in terms of
product orders year-over-year unless otherwise noted.
We finished the quarter with product orders up 1% and product book-to-bill below 1, in line with usual Q1s. EMEA
was a highlight with growth of 6%. We saw very strong performance in the UK, up 20% and strength in Germany, up
6%. Southern Europe grew approximately 20%. We saw some stabilization in the emerging countries within [ph]
EMEAR (08:07), with growth of 2% in the emerging segment of Chris Dedicoat's business. Based on the role we play
in the digitization of countries and companies including our ability to bring innovation and job creation, we're more
positive on the future business in Europe than perhaps some of our peers are.
Our Americas business grew 2%. We saw growth in the U.S. of 3% and when you exclude U.S. service provider,
growth in the U.S. was 12%. U.S. Public Sector had a very strong quarter with growth of 22%. U.S. federal grew an
amazing 34% while state and local declined by 2%. U.S. commercial grew 7%. U.S. enterprise declined 1%. Last
quarter we shared the U.S. enterprise grew at a very strong 16% growth year-over-year. As I mentioned at the time, that
performance was higher than normal and I expected it to balance out this quarter. Looking at the pipeline next quarter
we feel good that this business will again deliver double-digit growth. U.S. service provider however declined at 18%.
Within the Americas, Latin America grew 5%. Asia Pacific/Japan and China declined 12% led by China down 33%
while India grew 6%. The remaining emerging countries in Asia declined 15%. Overall, emerging countries within the
three geographies declined this quarter by 6%. The BRICs plus Mexico were down 12% while the other emerging
countries actually grew 1%. Our position in emerging markets remains strong and we believe we are positioned well
for the inevitable upturn. However as we told you last quarter, that is not factored into our plans.
Moving on to the view from the customer segments. In this quarter global public sector grew 13% global commercial
grew 5%, global enterprise grew 2% and service provider declined on a global basis by 10%. Emerging markets
remained challenged and we saw dramatically reduced spend at several large U.S. service providers.
As you think about our service provider position, I would think about the following, all of which are in our control. We
recently reorganized to best align with what our service provider customers wanted from Cisco. That was true of
engineering, sales, services and how we go-to-market. Second, we had the same power to partner with customers as
they transformed during their own challenging time period in terms of their growth and their profitability. Third, our
market share and share of spend is strong, and fourth, our traditional box competitors have never been weaker. At this
point I don't think many of them have the flexibility to reposition in a way to remain relevant to these service providers.
So we are nicely positioned for a rebound in SP when it happens.
I now will move on to a discussion of our momentum in terms of products and services. I'll discuss our momentum in
terms of year-over-year product and services in terms of revenue but where appropriate will share order information
where it adds important color. As we move on, I want to call out the convergence that we are driving across almost all

of our portfolio.
As a first example, one that you all are very familiar with, in the data center we simply converged networking with
compute and storage and moved into what I believe is the number one data center position. Now we are converting
networking with applications, security and scale and that's our ACI implementation.
In routing our NCS platform converges IP and optical networking with virtualization. We successfully converged wire
and wireless into most all of our products and convergence will also be very key for us in collaboration, more of which
we'll talk about later. In the industry we are the only player with the assets to drive true convergence for our customers
and this is a driver of both revenue and margins across our portfolio.
Now let me move on to routing. Routing declined 4% reflecting both the lower CapEx spend by major service
providers and challenges in the emerging markets. We did see growth in several of our high-end routing platforms this
quarter. For example, the ASR 9000 saw double-digit order growth and our new products the NCS 6000 and CRS-X
continued to ramp well with new customer wins. Given the tough environment we believe we are gaining market share
in these routing areas.
Moving to switching: it was nice to see overall switching move back into positive territory, growing 3%. We returned
to growth after three quarters of decline driven by our strength in data center switching portfolio. In addition to the 60%
increase in the Nexus 9000 and ACI customers, we saw double-digit order growth from the Nexus 3000, 7000, 9000
and ACI combined. We signed a record 600 new customers for the Nexus 3000 this quarter including several major
Web 2.0 providers.
Looking at our performance relative to one of our merchant-based competitors making a lot of noise in this market, in
Q3 FY 2014 from a comparison perspective we saw orders of the Nexus 3000 and 9000, our comparable portfolio,
surpass their total revenue for the first time. In Q1 orders for the Nexus 3000 and 9000 were approximately 50% larger
than their reported total revenues, growing in excess of four times faster than their reported growth rates. Yet again, in
just one year we have blown by where they had gotten to in the whole history of their company.
A year ago we were fighting an SDN perception battle with competitors using PowerPoint instead of products. Today,
with ACI, we are bringing programmability and automation to networking on a scale well beyond what competitors
define as SDN. Now we're in the market with products and solutions and don't see either traditional box competitors or
the PowerPoint newcomers able to keep up. And for those of you who were concerned about SDN's effect on our
switching margins, our switching gross margins have been incredibly consistent over the last five to six quarters and as
far forward as we are modeling we see no change. In this quarter's example our switching gross margins were above the
mean level of this consistency.
Data center and cloud, where we first converged networking, compute, and storage and today have continued to hold
the number one position in revenue share for x86 blades in the U.S. according to IDC, data center grew 50%
year-over-year. Five years ago we invested in the market for converged infrastructures and brought it to life with our
ecosystem partners. Today FlexPod with NetApp and Vblock with EMC are the leading converged infrastructure
architectures and there is two common elements: Cisco's UCS and Cisco's networking.
Also in the quarter we announced innovation across our UCS portfolio broadening the product line to meet demands of
large cloud environments and also scaled down to environments with just a handful of servers. We continue to
demonstrate that innovation is very much alive in markets with standalone products considered largely commoditized.
I'll also touch on InterCloud, where we announced this quarter 30 new InterCloud partners – really nice job, Rob –
including Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom, NTT Data and Equinix. This brings our world's largest interoperable
network of clouds to 250 data centers worldwide across 50 countries, all of which are working with us through an ACI
plus InterCloud fabric plus OpenStack roadmap. This is truly unique to Cisco in being able to pull this all together.
We are frequently asked what Cisco is doing differently in the crowded cloud market. Simply put, we see the same
problem in cloud that we saw 20 years ago in networking, when numerous networks operated on different technologies
that didn't talk to one another.

As we broke down the silos with Ethernet we made the Internet pervasive. We are running the same play in cloud as
only we can, unifying private, public and hybrid clouds. Customers want to seamlessly move their workloads between
clouds with a common level of policy and security. They need scale, speed, and reliability and they care about data
sovereignty and openness. We will approach this market as a solutions play, meeting the network requirements of
enterprise class applications and providing the platform to deliver Cisco's growing portfolio of software-as-a-service
offers. This will drive our strategic role with customers and over time our recurring revenue.
I said earlier that security was the number one issue facing many of our customers. Security revenues grew this quarter
25%. In this quarter we combined our security products even more closely with the Sourcefire products and delivered a
highly anticipated Cisco ASA with FirePOWER services which combined Cisco's ASA firewall with Sourcefire into
one platform. Customer receptivity has been very positive. Our innovation in security is very strong.
Security continues to be our customer's number one business priority at the CIO level but perhaps even more important
at the CEO level, and we are doing very well in this market. Nearly every initiative we have at Cisco has security as a
key component and we are committed to becoming the number one security company.
Compared with even a year ago, we are getting good marks from our customers as now more than ever customers need
a strong and trusted company like Cisco to lead. They see Cisco alone in their ability to deliver an integrated security
architecture and security services and solutions across their business. I am very pleased that our leadership transition is
going very smoothly in this area and we are moving aggressively to capture the opportunity ahead of us.
Last quarter wireless grew only 1%. This quarter wireless grew 11% with strong momentum in our 802.11ac portfolio
which now represents over 50% of our access point revenue. Cisco Meraki continued on a tear with another
outstanding quarter, growing at 86%.
In the area of collaboration, we are going to continue to transform our collaboration portfolio and move to more
enterprise license agreements and subscriptions. In Q1 our collaboration business was down 10% in the quarter. As our
new video products ramp well but at dramatically lower price points, we saw declines in TelePresence and Unified
Communications. WebEx continued to grow well and remains one of our largest – remains one of the largest SAS
businesses in the industry.
As I mentioned before, collaboration should be the greatest productivity driver for our organizations. In the next week
you will see some bold moves that will secure our leadership position in cloud-based simple, secure and converged
collaboration. I think we have great potential to grow this business over time. I really like our position and our pipeline
and I am very optimistic about returning back to positive growth levels relatively quickly in the collaboration arena.
Service provider video declined 12% with set-top box business down approximately 20%. Revenue for service provider
video software and solutions grew by 13%. The bet we're making is on the video transition to the cloud and we are
seeing our video software business continue to grow as we help our customers transition to cloud-based video
solutions.
Now moving on to services. Pulling everything together is our services strategy and our services in this quarter grew
5%. Services now represent over 23% of Cisco's revenue on a 12-month trailing basis. We've added around $2.3 billion
in revenue over the last three years with strong margins. Today at $11.1 billion in trailing 12-month revenue, it is our
second largest business after switching and that doesn't count the literally billions of dollars being delivered by our
approximately 70,000 strong partner channels around the world where partners deliver solutions on behalf of Cisco, not
just boxes.
In many ways it's a bit unfair to refer to our services business by that name since this draws a comparison to what
investors typically see at other companies. While a large component is driven by maintenance and support, unlike our
peers, at Cisco nearly 90% of our issues we handle for our clients are solved with automation.
We have many large customers around the world that depend on us and depend on Cisco to run their networks. We
have also rolled out a unique set of consulting, cloud analytics and security services as the network continues to
increase in importance, our services becoming increasingly more important to our customers.

To summarize my commentary, we have undergone a successful reorganization across the company and are seeing the
results. Our employee sentiment data shows that employees both understand the challenges we have made and also are
optimistic about our future and the changes we've made to deal with these challenges. Thanks to a lot of hard work,
which will continue, I believe that we have positioned Cisco to lead the market transitions in front of us to the benefit
of our shareholders, our customers, our partners and our employees.
Frank, let me now turn it over to you.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thank you, John. We executed Q1 with financial performance slightly above our guidance. From a top- and
bottom-line perspective total revenue was $12.2 billion growing 1% on a year-on-year basis. Non-GAAP net income
was $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.54.
Our GAAP net income was $1.8 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.35.
Product revenue was flat and service revenue increased 5% on a year-on-year basis with product book to bill less than
one.
Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 29.2%. In Q1, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, above our
guidance of 61% to 62%. As we have said in the past, non-GAAP gross margin may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point
in either direction of our guidance range. This quarter we were above the range. Non-GAAP product gross margin was
62.5%. As compared to Q4, product gross margin was positively impacted by productivity improvements and by
product mix, partially offset by pricing. Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66%, consistent with historical levels.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion or 34.1% as a percentage of revenue, compared to 33.8% in Q4 of
FY 2014. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter and up 3% year-over-year reflecting
investments in key growth areas.
Our GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter for fiscal 2015 included a pre-tax charge of
$188 million or $0.03 per share related to a patent litigation matter described in our most recently filed 10-K involving
the Rockstar Consortium. A term sheet has been signed and we are hopeful to achieve a resolution of the associated
litigation in a manner that is constructive for the whole industry.
Now moving on to the non-GAAP tax provision rate, it was 22%, consistent with our expectations.
We ended the quarter with our head count at 72,247 a decrease of approximately 1,800 from Q4 of FY 2014. This
reflects reductions from our restructuring activity partially offset by key sales, service and engineering investments, as
well as acquisitions.
As a reminder, as we outlined in our Q4 call, in Q1 we began taking restructuring actions focused on continuing to
invest in growth, innovation, and talent while managing cost and driving efficiencies, which would impact our global
work force during fiscal 2015.
We announced and completed two acquisitions during the quarter, Metacloud and Memoir Systems, to enhance our
innovation and long-term growth opportunities in key growth areas, such as the cloud and software-defined
networking. Both were executed consistent with our portfolio approach to acquisitions to drive long-term returns.
Also, we, along with EMC and VCE, announced during Q1 the next phase of VCE. Cisco will continue as a strategic
partner and will have an approximately 10% equity interest in VCE. We expect the transition to close in Q2 of FY
2015.
Looking at our geographic segment results, in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, our Americas segment
was up 3%. EMEA was up 2%, and APJC was down 5%. Total gross margins for the Americas was 64.1%, EMEA was
63.8%, while Asia Pacific Japan and China was 58.8%.

From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective, total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $52.1 billion
including $3.8 billion which is available in the U.S. at the end of the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $2.5
billion during the quarter and in Q1 we returned $2 billion to shareholders that included $1 billion through our share
repurchases an approximately $973 million through our quarterly dividend.
Our balance sheet at the end of Q1 was strong with DSO at 33 days and non-GAAP inventory turns at 11. Deferred
revenue was $13.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 9% driven largely by
subscription-based offerings while services deferred revenue grew 1%. Each quarter we are consistently driving a
greater software mix and higher recurring revenue.
Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook or guidance for the second quarter. Let me remind you again that
our comments include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important
risk factors and understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking
statements and actual results could also be above or below this guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a
non-GAAP basis with a reconciliation to GAAP.
As John mentioned, we expect total revenue to be in the range of 4% to 7% growth on a year-on-year basis. For the
second quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%.
As we have said the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been very challenging due to various factors
such as the volume, the product mix, cost savings, as well as pricing, and as I said earlier, non-GAAP gross margins
may vary quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%.
Our non-GAAP tax provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the second quarter.
Our Q2 FY 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.50 to $0.52 per share. We anticipate our
GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.10 to $0.13 per share in Q2 FY 2015. The range includes a
pre-tax benefit of approximately $125 million from the reduced VCE equity investment to 10% and it also is offset by a
pre-tax charge of approximately $100 million in Q2 FY 2015 as a result of the restructuring actions that we announced
in the first quarter.
During Q1 we recognized pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial statements of $318 million related to that
announcement and we are now expected total charge to not exceed $600 million during the fiscal year of 2015.
Please see the slides that accompany this webcast for more detail. Other than those identified and quantified items
noted previously, there are no other significant differences between GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. This guidance
assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructuring and tax or other events which may or may not be
significant.
Our guidance does not assume a significant improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in
the near future and although we believe we are executing well in a rapidly transforming market, with these types of
uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance, with all the appropriate caveats, one quarter at a time.
We encourage our shareholders to have similar considerations.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit
public disclosure.
John, I'll now turn it back to you for some summary comments.
John T. Chambers
Thank you, Frank, and well done. I'd like to talk now about the leadership transition at the CFO level and I will then
summarize the call. When you look at the quality of the financial leadership team it is something that all of us take a

great deal of pride in. As you know, Cisco has successfully transitioned through multiple leaders, often five to eight of
them, in every major functional group in the company over the years. And recently, Frank has been exploring the right
time to step down as Cisco's CFO.
Frank joined Cisco over 10 years ago and has served as CFO for the last seven years. Among his many
accomplishments, Frank led our very successful capital allocation strategy including implementing Cisco's first
dividend, managed effectively some of our most challenging macro and industry environments and has been recognized
time and time again for his strong leadership.
While I know that Frank has other ambitions, I am also very glad that Frank has agreed to stay on as an advisor to the
financial leadership team and for me over not just, I hope, the next several months but I hope for longer than that Frank,
if you'll have us.
Effective January 1, Frank will be stepping down as CFO at which time Kelly Kramer will assume the role as Cisco's
CFO. One of Frank's best and most defining leadership characteristics is his focus on building incredible leadership
teams. Almost three years ago, Frank hired Kelly. It is a credit to the work of Frank that the leadership team and the
board have concurred in appointing Kelly to assume the role of CFO. Kelly brings a wealth of experience to this role
both from her three years at Cisco and 20 years at GE.
Kelly, you look too young to have that many years.
Kelly A. Kramer
Thanks.
John T. Chambers
Unlike Frank you haven't got any gray hairs and unlike me you aren't losing hair. But that's a separate topic.
In your last role at GE, you were GE's Healthcare Systems Business Group and CFO of that group. She is known for
her business judgment, no-nonsense approach, and strong strategic leadership style.
At Cisco, Kelly has led both Cisco's corporate finance and business finance groups, managing, among other things, all
the controllers at Cisco's business units with a particular focus around pricing and margins. She has learned Cisco's
business inside and out and has proven herself to be a highly strategic, thoughtful, and influential leader. Kelly is not
afraid to challenge all of us to think differently and it has been impressive to see her do this while becoming a trusted
partner for our entire leadership team.
Kelly, I am going to give you the same advice that I once got when I became CEO and that I gave Frank seven years
ago: do a great job, have fun, and don't mess it up. We know you won't and I look forward to working with you even
more closely.
Frank, I mean this is really something I'm very proud of in your many accomplishments. Your integrity and ethics
define you. And you have always kept our employees, customers, shareholders at the forefront of our long-term
strategic business planning. You have been a great finance leader, but more importantly, you have been a great business
leader. You have built a world-class financial organization that is driving Cisco's transformation and ensuring we are
positioned to execute on the opportunities ahead.
I know the future will hold very exciting opportunities for you, and I look forward to our continued relationship. Thank
you once again, Frank.

Thank you, John.
John T. Chambers
And, Kelly, congratulations.
Kelly A. Kramer
Thank you.
John T. Chambers
Frank, I'm just looking at you. You've weathered the last seven years better than I have. I've lost a lot of hair, you've got
a little bit of gray into it.
Frank A. Calderoni
I know. We'll have to just see how it continues, right?
John T. Chambers
Yeah. All right. Now to summarize our call today.
I have talked a lot about the accelerating pace of change in the industry, recognizing that in many cases Cisco and our
technology are driving that change. I am now more convinced than ever that the pace of change is providing an
advantage for Cisco for a number of reasons.
First, the role of the network is at the center of every major technology and business transition and that is becoming
very clear to our customers and to the industry as a whole. Most customers are no longer interested in piecing together
disparate infrastructure from different vendors or buying standalone technologies. They are digitizing their businesses,
their cities, and countries and want Cisco to be a strategic partner delivering solutions and business outcomes. They
recognize that to move with agility and security they need, their solutions have to be based on an integrated architecture
combined with intelligent network. You are seeing this showing up in increased enterprise license agreements,
enterprise services agreements, subscriptions, consulting contracts, and other advanced services, including cloud,
analytics, and security.
Second, we have proven our ability to move quickly and aggressively to transform Cisco into a leaner and a more
effective company. Remarkably, since FY 2011 we have added around $4.1 billion in revenue with about $61 million
in incremental non-GAAP OpEx. Said another way, for every dollar of revenue we've added over this transitional
period, we have only added about $0.01 of non-GAAP OpEx. There is not a peer who can come anywhere near close to
this by a factor of tens to what that performance has represented for Cisco and for our shareholders. And what is
exciting is we are just getting started in our transformational evolution at a time that our peers are just starting their
transformational work that we started three-and-a-half years ago.
We have also successfully redeployed this operating leverage in many ways. We have invested in innovation, we've
built entirely new skill sets within Cisco, we have disrupted our largest businesses in order to move at the fast pace this
market requires, and we've built flexibility into our operating model as we manage through these transitions.
Throughout, we have driven record annual non-GAAP earnings per share for our shareholders.

Third, we have and will continue to evolve the leadership team and the talent to drive us forward. As we focus on what
our people can do with the support of Cisco, we are unleashing incredible innovation and energy.
And fourth, the power of our brand: our global channels and our strategic relationships with our customers is only
strengthening. We continue to earn the trust of our customers and that is translating into greater opportunity for Cisco.
Today feels a lot like the mid-1990s, when companies were coming to Cisco to learn about the Internet. Today they are
asking Cisco to help make the transition and transition them to digitize their companies, their cities and even their
countries as they prepare to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Internet of Everything.
To repeat where we started, we believe we are managing very well in a very tough environment. We are seeing the
results of a three-year plus transformational program and work, moving from selling boxes to selling solutions and
leading with innovation, speed and efficiency as we disrupt the market. We are leading the technology and business
transitions in the market. We have been very clear with you when we have seen challenges in our business, or in the
environment, and will continue to do so. We have also managed the business very well in light of those challenges. We
have made hard decisions where we have needed to and are seeing the resulting benefits.
To sum it all up I am very optimistic about Cisco's future and excited about the path that we are on.
Mel, let's move to my favorite part of the session which is the Q&A, and I turn it over to you.
Melissa Selcher
Great, thanks. Operator, let's move to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted ask you first about your product order growth. I think you
said up 1% year-over-year. That comes on the back of relatively easy comps relative to the year-ago number and on our
math it implies that sequentially bookings declined something like the mid-teens, which I think would be well below
normal seasonality for this quarter. So, just curious if you can give us a little more color on the puts and takes in there,
if you can touch on FX. China seemed to decline at a little faster rate and how much of that was some of the weakness
in the U.S. carrier space that you referenced?
<A - John T. Chambers>: So, Simona, I'm going to go, as you would expect, to the most positive, and unlike last
quarter, where we had about five up and five down, this time most all of the positives were in the right direction, with
the exception of service provider and emerging markets.
So, start with our high-end switching and high-end routing puts and takes, the high-end switching grew at 10%, as I
alluded to earlier, and that shows how good of a job we've done on the transition and taking not just market share but I
think moving very rapidly away to pull away from some of our key smaller competitors.
The routing is probably gaining share. We have our best routing portfolio we have at the high-end and both Nick
Adamo and Kelly Ahuja who head that up, along with Cedrik [Cedrik Neike]. I would say we are very well positioned
in routing as well.
Security saw 25% growth.
Data center was at 15% growth, Simona, and that was probably a little bit lower than you might have expected. Q1 is,
Kelly, I think we were talking about it, usually a slower quarter for us in terms of our server technologies and spend. I
would expect that to come back up in Q2, more into the 20s. UCS at 16% and I'm seeing the same type of number for

Page 11 of 18
that in terms of – and these again are orders that I am referring to.
I've got revenue on the left and bookings on the right. Okay, I'm sorry.
So using UCS as an example, revenues are 16% and bookings are 18% in the quarter and I would expect them to come
back up into comfortable growth well into the 20s as well. Services, Gary, it's been very nice to return to
mid-single-digits. We hit a, hopefully what will be a bottom of 3% and I feel pretty comfortable about our services
revenues more in the mid-single digits.
Wireless which is one of the things you all rightly pointed out last quarter said it was a little bit challenging for us,
which was fair, returned back to double-digit growth of 11% on revenues and mid-teens on bookings. I expect a solid
quarter next quarter out of it as well.
Collaboration was the one area that I talked about that we didn't go into as deeply. I like where we were on bookings.
Bookings were down just about 2% negative. The collaboration portfolio was 10% on revenues and so that's the solid
part. Better growth in Europe than people anticipated, better growth in Southern Europe, better solidarity in the U.S.
minus service providers.
The two big issues, Simona, are around service provider and emerging markets. Emerging markets weren't down as
much as they were last quarter at minus 9% but they were down 6% and the BRICs were down 12% with China being
the heaviest in terms of the approach. The rest of emerging markets were actually slightly positive, I think averaging
out to be 6% number.
Service Provider is the big challenge. Let me be very explicit. That's due to 2 to 3 U.S. service providers who have
dramatically slowed their order rates and I mean dramatically slowed the order rates with us and that's an implication
also, I think, of some of the – what you're seeing in terms of net neutrality Title II discussions going on, where in my
opinion, it would be a very disappointing end result if we moved back to regulation the Internet like we did voice many
decades ago. It would dramatically slow the ability of service providers to develop broadband at a time that our country
has finally caught back up.
So my key takeaway, Simona, are the Service Provider business driven by primarily two or three large U.S. players is
the one area that has us most focused and we saw that in order rate in this last quarter to the tune of a pretty substantial
amount. In fact, if you take out those three service providers, you would have probably seen positive growth in our
service provider business in total, which you are beginning to see now. So our strategy in business is taking hold and
emerging markets are still a little bit, if you will, balancing with some very good ones and some challenging one. That's
how I would answer your question on the puts and takes.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Simona.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And I know you're going to say, keep my answers tighter, Mel. I will.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Next question, operator.
Operator
And your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi. Hey, Frank. First, sorry to see you go but wishing all the best. And, John, I just wanted to
clarify on the guidance maybe just taking off from the previous question, your guidance implies about a 4% decline in
revenues. Again should we assume that most of that, in fact all of that pressure is from service provider and emerging
markets or are you seeing maybe potentially some slowing momentum in the switching side as well or should we
expect that to continue to remain robust? I just want to clarify what is embedded in the guidance.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, my three years in law school, if I said it was entirely due to something my team
would fire me on, but it's almost primarily due to those two major factors on it.

If you look at, just repeating, the U.S. number without service provider was 12% growth major strength and that was in
spite of our enterprise business having a slow Q1 in terms of Brian Marlier's team. I've got a lot of confidence in Brian.
We went through the forecast pretty carefully with him, Rob. I think they're going back in double-digit growth this
quarter. It feels real good. The pipeline feels very, very solid on that.
Even within our service provider business, if you look out several quarters, our pipeline is increasing rapidly and I
think you're going to see us increase our share of wallet as well as our market share in many of our areas. The
transformation that we've gone through over this last year with Nick Adamo, Cedrik and Kelly leading the group,
you're beginning to see our relationship with these service providers, even when they're challenged, change a fair
amount.
So I would say it is emerging markets and again it's not all of them anymore. It's a better standard deviation but still
we're not going to turn on that and it's service providers but it's a lot of just a couple of service providers here in the
U.S.
So I like our pipeline. I think we're going to be challenged here for a couple of quarters. I think we'll power through it
and I feel very good about the end result.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Amitabh. Next question, operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Ah, yeah, John, how are you doing? And, Frank, yes, congratulations on your retirement and
good luck dealing with us, Kelly.
So a question on the gross margins. You had 63%. Your guidance is decent as well. I mean how do you see your gross
margins? I know some of the [ph] calls to the net (47:41) that you would see pressure there. It doesn't look like you
have. In looking at your mix in your forecast, how do you see your gross margins panning out over the next quarter?
And then real quick if I could slip in, you mentioned General Motors again. Can you talk about what that means in
terms of your ability to sell into the big U.S. and European telcos NFV and software opportunities in terms of offering
that type of product pipeline to them to sell to their customers? And how it might be as a recurring revenue stream over
time? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. Frank, why don't you take the first one. Gary, I'll have you take...
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So Brian, I am going to be a broken record at least one more time on this one.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Kelly, you might want to take notes.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: But from a gross margin standpoint, as we look at the gross margin it's 61% to 62% give
or take 1%, going back on the first quarter, yes they were higher, over 62%. We tend to see higher gross margin in the
first quarter. We did see a benefit from a mix perspective, I think the stronger switching helped as well as if you look at
the mix from a UCS perspective it tends to be lower, whereas in Q2, Q2 especially after the end of the calendar year, it
tends to be a stronger UCS quarter. So we will see a bit more of an impact from a negative mix standpoint in that
quarter. So when you take all those gives and takes, that's when we get to that 61% to 62%, give or take. And we will
continue to keep managing that balance as we look out over several quarters.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Gary?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yes. On the ELA that we did with General Motors that John did mention again this quarter,
that's a solid deal for them and for us. It has a lot of interest from other companies and we're actually working with a

number of them. And I think there is a lot of positive things about the structure of that deal, certainly for the customer
but certainly for Cisco. And with a customer like GM where they have gone all in on us, on our strategy, it's very easy
for them now to continue to grow and do innovative things that give them business outcomes that they weren't able to
justify to the business before. And I think that's something that a visionary CIO will do with a company and the CEO
and the CFO that really look for IT to be a competitive advantage and not an expense. And I think the team at GM has
done that, and we have a number of other customers that we are working with along those same lines.
<A - John T. Chambers>: What's exciting is these enterprise licenses. Think of it in enterprise software license where
literally you can fill in the hardware and [ph] need to (50:11) have it in the integration, and you can move from security
to collaboration, you can compete against white label. You can bring in your consultancy services, your knowledge of
the network in ways that no one else can do. You're seeing us do the same thing with services, enterprise services
agreements and that has even more impact when you go across a whole large enterprise and you do services tying all
together their networks, their directions, get efficiencies from it.
But then it really opens up your consultancy, your security, your collaboration offers. Then you combine that with our
architecture plays and you take it from cloud all the way through mobility, take it all away down to the edge. That's
why we win.
One thing, Kelly, you pointed out to me the other night, you were educating Frank and I as well, your attention to
detail, when you look, Brian, at the numbers, Q2 is usually a quarter if you watch historically, that has had lower gross
margins than Q1 because we do a bigger mix of our products on servers during Q2 because of the year end. So that has
been fairly typical in terms of our pattern. Did I learn that right?
<A - Kelly A. Kramer>: That's right.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: All right. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.
<Q - Ehud A. Gelblum>: Hey, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you. Frank, likewise. Good working with you and lots of
luck. Just aside on that, if you can give us some sense of your thought process as to A, what you plan on doing next and
what you were thinking as you went through the decision to retire, that would be awesome just to have some rationale.
But I was looking more for some, a little more deep dive into the enterprise business where enterprise orders were
down from being up last quarter and putting that together with what's happening with VCE, and with the data center
number of 15% that John said you thought was a little disappointing. And I think it was about 30% last quarter. So
putting that all together in one piece, could you give us a sense as to, A, I guess the questions are A, how much UCS
went through VCE and how much will that impact you as your piece of VCE goes to 10% from 35%? B, was, were all
these issues related, the low enterprise growth, the low UCS and data center growth, and the exiting, or bringing down
your equity stake in VCE, was that all the same issue? And what gives confidence that all these issues: enterprise, UCS,
data center, et cetera, rebound next quarter and going forward? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. So let me take it. Frank, maybe you can handle that one question with him
one-on-one. [ph] In terms of the matter (52:36) and I'd like to sit in on that discussion.
So let me address the enterprise question very directly. First, let's use our Global Enterprise Theater run by Woody
Sessoms. We didn't talk about it in the call, it's our top 29 global enterprise accounts. It grew 15% this last quarter, and
it grew across all those architectures, and it is one of the very best with VCE, with FlexPod and total architectures. And
so if you watch and we're projecting they're going to grow very well again this quarter, the pipeline looks really good.

So as you would expect, Ehud, the testing to make sure the pipeline is good where we're going, that would be an
example and those are our global enterprises. In the U.S. enterprise it was very simple. We finished up a quarter. They
were in the running to become top-tier in the world and they won it. They pushed hard in the quarter, it was financially
to advantage, and drive a little bit out of the pipeline on that. They made organization changes set up for this next year,
got going on even pushing harder on solutions, even harder on architectures and you'll see them, I'd give it extremely
high odds, 90% plus. I probably shouldn't say that, Mel. You'll see them returning to double digits and we've been
through Brian's pipeline. He is world-class, knows how to do it.
There is no effect of our agreement with what we're doing with VCE that has slowed at all. In fact, I think the VCE
numbers, Gary, feel very good and I think both VCE and FlexPod are growing off of a billion-dollar plus base at over
50% a year.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yes, VCE surpassed $2 billion annualized in the run rate. We have more than 2,000 people,
with 1,000 customers, 2,000 Vblocks out there and this did not slow them down at all.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And I guess I'd draw the parallel: government is nothing more than a public sector of
enterprise and you saw 13% growth in government around the world. Digitization of countries is taking off and I
cannot tell you what it means when a Merkel, the leader in Germany, says about Industry 4.0, she's going to digitize her
country and what we can do together with government and with Deutsche Telekom in the cities and rebuild off of it in
terms of direction. The same thing with commercial, commercial was solid at seven. It doesn't quite go up and down as
much.
So, that's an answer that I feel really good on enterprise. We are going to lead and break away from most every player
in enterprise and that applies across our products, including with our application-centric infrastructure enterprise, which
is going great guns. Nice way, I don't miss transitions like this. If I were concerned I would tell you. We always want to
watch the numbers though.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Okay. Thanks, Ehud. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yes. Thanks a lot. John, could you talk a little bit more there about service provider? What do
you need to see to have it turn? I thought that was interesting that you talked about net neutrality which is obviously a
hot button issue right now and obviously the spending, but I think we're all trying to figure out when it could possibly
turn. It sounds like there are several factors and your leadership on this issue, I think, would be very helpful to us.
Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. So several questions and thank you for the nice comment. On our service provider
business, first let's assume for now that it won't change in a couple of quarters. However, with our new structure
beginning to build different relationships at every single major service provider – Rob, you've probably been to 30 of
them in the last two months – at the CEO level, the CTO level, CMO level, operations, et cetera and our relationship is
changing with them and our ability to really bring a portfolio that addresses their top priorities in terms of what they're
doing on mobility, what they're doing on video, what they're doing with new services, in a market that their traditional
transport is commoditizing is pretty good.
However, I don't want to ignore one issue. They are struggling big time in certain geographies with how to make
money given the costs that are going flat to up and their revenues that are coming back through. And so you are going
to see certain service providers like AT&T said it very publicly, and obviously I'm very close to Randall and John and
Ralph there, we know that their CapEx is going to be down by a fair amount this next year regardless.
However, it will be down dramatically more if we don't get our act together on this Title II issue. So there's a way to
accomplish the goals of both sides. I thought Chairman Wheeler's original approach to this was right on, a right

compromise in terms of direction. And I think it is very important that we send a message, because you are going to see
these service providers slow, if not pause completely on broadband build out, because if they can't make money on
broadband build out, they aren't going to build it out. It's as simple as that. And we, clearly that was the wild-card factor
that Simona, you asked me about indirectly. We started seeing service provider spending slow a lot last quarter among
the three big guys that might be most affected here. So I think getting their act together there is key.
We do plan to be very aggressive on this and trying to educate people on all sides about why this is not right for our
country. I find it – just last comment, then very interesting that Europe looks at the U.S. that we got our act together.
We had the right amount of competition that allowed companies to make profits and the right amount of government
regulation that allowed them to build out broadband. So they look at us like we've got our act together and here we are
thinking about changing it.
So I think it's very important that the whole industry is active here. I think it is going to have a negative impact for all
of us that are connected to those large service providers in the U.S. here in this last quarter and maybe for one or two
more quarters. That clearly was reflected in our approach. Hope I'm wrong but it feels like that's going to be very tight.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Thank you. Good afternoon. At a high-level, the patterns that we're seeing today are somewhat
similar. You have some regions positive, some regions negative and then we're seeing a subsequent reversion to the
mean. Are there considerations to really think about can Cisco do things very differently, make big changes so that all
the efforts that Cisco is making can lead to a corresponding outperformance in terms of economic value add and also
equity outperformance for Cisco?
In terms of looking at unlocking value, are there discussions going on? Are we at a point where Cisco will consider
new inputs to change and formulate a better outcome?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Well, Mark, a couple of thoughts. You've asked a question that we could probably talk
about for half an hour. But let me hit it very high. We're winning in most all of our major market transition moves.
We're winning on architectures. We're winning on convergence in the data center, storage and network and processing
capability. We're winning big time on application centric infrastructure and pulling away from the start-up competitors.
Being very bold, I would say we're not only pulling away from, I think while they have moves left on the table, I think
it's game over. I think we've got them. There's no doubt about where we're leading with the Internet of Everything. Our
products are very uniquely tied together. That's why you've seen our gross margins be so strong.
We've moved to selling solutions in software and cloud. We've redone and then transformed our whole company to
move resources and freeing up by keeping head count flat into new areas. We've moved with InterCloud with
tremendous efficiency. We've realigned our organization. So we've transformed our company at a time that others have
not transformed at all and are just beginning to get started, Mark, with some of the things that you're outlining which I
think is going to get them into real trouble.
So I love our position in the market. Our position with customers, Gary, you and I are out there all the time, has never
been stronger and, Mark, we're winning with great gross margins. And where there is growth opportunities, we're
getting our share of it plus a lot, gaining market share in many of the areas. So fair criticism perhaps three years ago.
Probably not a fair criticism today.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks. Operator, next question.

Thank you. Next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thanks very much. Wanted to go back to the question that was asked earlier on margins.
Just wondering how we should think about the opportunity to improve profitability. It seems like we're on the backside
of a multi-year revamping of the internal organizational structural like you just hit on, John, and I wonder if there's an
opportunity to see some margin expansion as year-over-year growth persists or maybe to ask another way, what kind of
topline growth do you think we would need to achieve in order to show some margin expansion, improved profitability
as we get to the latter stages of the reorganization that's been underway for the last three years?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, so repeating first a theme that I commented on and then we're in agreement to where
you're leading us. You look at the last three plus years to grow revenues by $4 billion and to grow operating expenses
by $61 million. Our peers when we look at them, they were at $0.30, $0.50, $0.70, $1.00 per dollar of revenue gain. We
did at 1%. I'd have to give us very high marks on that over the last three years.
To the second part of your question, Gary has got the ball for me on that. It's about how do we drive productivity and
we're going to use one that we can kind of measure productivity per employee which is just the easiest one to do.
I know it's not anywhere near as sophisticated as many of us would use different measurements that add up to that. But
to how we drive productivity of our company on that and to your point, there are times either within segments of our
business or times when there are market segments where we will improve productivity dramatically and routing and
switching would be an example where even though we're breaking away with new products, we're moving resources
into other areas at the same time.
Gary, your thoughts on that?
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yeah, I mean, there are several things that we've done. I mean John spoke of the services
revenue growth over the last three years and the fact that we're doing that with automation and analytics and delivering
higher value at a lower cost, I think, plays into that and there's a lot more that we can do there as we continue to build
out the things that we've been talking about, about cloud-managed services, security offerings, the consulting, those
kinds of things from services as well as the things that Rob and the engineering team are doing with Pankaj relative to
the integrated portfolio.
So from a margin point of view, we still have, we may be on the backside of this, but as we've said, this is a game that
it doesn't have nine innings to it. We are going to continually turn the dials that we need to turn and we have all of
those levers available to us to coincide with the growth. We're well positioned if things do uptake, and we have moved
a lot to shared support, so we're in a really good position to expand margins, quite honestly in my opinion, if the growth
takes off because of what we have built on the infrastructure that is global and scalable.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And you will see us probably, I think given the market growth numbers, all fairly small
numbers, be more conservative about adding the head count once we've got the growth as opposed to betting a little bit
on the company as we move forward especially in this market.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, James. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Alex.

<Q - Alex Henderson>: So I was hoping you could give us a little more granularity on the service provider segment.
The piece that is confounding the analysis to some extent is the set-top box business continuing to fall off. And it has
fallen off so many quarters in a row it's kind of lost track of how big it is. Can you talk about what the service provider
business would be doing ex- the set-top boxes on an apples-to-apples basis? Because that piece has obviously got a
different trajectory.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, I've got it and my team will verify on the numbers. The business answered just the
way you worded it. Global service providers were down 10%. If you'd taken set-top box out of that, it would have been
down 6% in terms of the approach. And it did vary globally. Global service providers Europe grew by 13% this last
quarter in service providers, and relationships with companies like Deutsche Telekom, et cetera, are going extremely
well in terms of where we go from that side. And you are seeing us build very strong relationships in new and emerging
markets with players like Reliance and, Rob, you've got a list of 30 of our InterCloud type of partners in terms of the
direction.
And again, understand I'm not wed to set-top boxes. I am wed to winning the battle for video in the cloud. And so we
clearly use set-top boxes purely as a stepping stone to get into the cloud in direction. And right now we have a pretty
good portfolio on how this ties together, but it's all about winning software in the cloud. And you will see us evolve our
company that way in terms of products that don't add much margin over time.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Okay. Thanks, Alex. Operator, next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks. And, Frank, best wishes to you. And thanks for the many years of very good services.
Good luck to Kelly.
I wanted to go back to the point of gross margin, John, if possible. And I have heard all the explanations around it, but I
had to go back literally two or three years to find a point in time where you had a product gross margin this high. And
then I looked at your guidance over the past few quarters and years, and you have beaten gross margin 10 out of the last
13, you never missed in the last 13 quarters. I'm kind of wondering if we have gotten to a point in time where you feel
that you have a much better handle on the product cycles, you have a much better handle on the competitive front?
What is the possibility that you actually do start raising that gross margin range outlook going forward? Is that
something completely unreasonable to assume?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, it's a good question. We debated that at the operating committee, Gary, just a couple
of weeks ago. And so to answer your question on part, we are all over gross margins. Gary leads the project with Frank
and now Gary will lead it with Kelly. Every aspect of gross margins from the product cycle improvement to designing
products, to your point, let's not design a switch that comes in at 50% gross margins and we get it to 70% over three
years. That was a very painful when we did that across our lines the last time. And with our new switching products,
they came in at very high gross margins and I said earlier, are actually improving as volume picks up in terms of
direction.
I think the major issue quarter in and quarter out is more mix at the present time. We are going to go into next quarter
where UCSs will be up and hopefully up dramatically and it's a seasonally strong period for us on UCS as well as
otherwise. And I think there are certain transactions that we want to go after aggressively in emerging markets or not,
which tend to swing it up and down. But are we focused on this? Yes. Are we focused in each category even though the
real play is for architectures about how to improve the category on gross margins? The answer would be yes.
And then in final, the real issue on gross margins – if you can provide a solution, it is at three to five times the value to
a customer of providing products. And so when we tie together these architectures, Mark, at dramatically lower,
dramatically lower operating expenses to get to solutions to go to outcomes, that's what customers pay you a huge
premium for, that's where you make your money. By Mark I meant Mark Sue. I was referring back to this comment

earlier, why you don't change the structure when everybody else has left this wide open for us and we're breaking away
the last thing you would do would be to change that now. That would result in the exact opposite.
So I think there are areas that we can improve on and as we move more into cloud, as we move more into software, as
we move more into collaboration we are looking at the margins and you'll see us where we can't get good margins,
we'll walk from the business and we clearly are doing that with some service providers today. If we can't get a good
margin deal, you know it's important to us. We will walk, and that's the advantage of, I think, having the discipline this
leadership team has.
Mel, that's probably a way to summarize. If I were to look at it I would say the comments we started off the quarter
review with, I would end with.
I think in a tough environment we are managing very well. On the enterprise, commercial and public sector we're
lighting up the world and I think we're doing very well there. The areas we made big bets on that some people
challenged us, whether it's architectures or convergence or applications, infrastructure or embracing SDN and bringing
to life with programmability and leading. The Internet of Everything is finally taking off. You have an inflection point
on that. We had the courage to change our organization and make transitions that other companies struggled with.
And by the way, they're just now starting. We've been in it for about three-and-a-half years. I love our position and I
think we're going to win. I want to thank you all for your confidence in Cisco and thank you for your time.
Mel, let me turn it back to you.
Melissa Selcher
