Thank you, Rea. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chief
Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Frank Brod, Chief Accounting Officer; and John Seethoff,
Deputy General Counsel.
On our website, microsoft.com/investor, we have posted a slide deck which provides a summary of our financial
results, a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, and a table of noted items to
aid in understanding our results this quarter. Additionally, the slide deck contains detailed information regarding the
impact of the Nokia Devices and Services [NDS] acquisition on our financial results. Our press release is also on the
website and includes an addendum with additional information about our fourth quarter performance.
Microsoft is reporting the financial performance of the acquired Nokia Devices and Services business in a new segment
called Phone Hardware. Additionally, the Devices and Consumer Hardware segment was renamed to Computing and

Amy Hood
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. This month is an important time for Microsoft. As a leadership team,
we're taking bold and decisive action to evolve our organization and culture. This includes difficult steps, but they are
necessary to position Microsoft for future growth and industry leadership. Today, we'll spend more time talking about
the significant changes we're driving. However, let me first start with this quarter's results. After that, Satya will talk
more about our path forward, and then I'll share our financial outlook before we take your questions.
As I think about our strong execution this quarter, there are three things that stand out to me: significant momentum
with our cloud services; progress in a number of our consumer businesses; and continued cost discipline.
Our total fourth quarter revenue was $23 billion, including $2 billion from the Phone Hardware segment. As you know,
our Q4 guidance did not include the impact of the acquisition of Nokia's Devices and Services business. Excluding that,
we grew revenue 10%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.
Moving on to earnings per share, before the impact of the acquisition and the noted items Chris highlighted earlier, EPS
grew 12% to $0.66. These details can be found in the earnings slide deck on our Investor Relations website.
Geographically, performance was strong across most markets, particularly in North America and in Europe. We did,
however, see challenging conditions in China where, like many other multinationals, we're experiencing a weak
business environment which we do not expect to change in the near term.
Our commercial cloud revenue grew 147% this quarter, driven by both Office 365 and Azure. Our commercial cloud
annual revenue run rate more than doubled this year and now exceeds $4.4 billion. And with this rapidly growing scale,
we continue to expand our cloud gross margins. We saw strong commercial seat growth across Office 365, particularly
with SMB customers. Additionally, we added over 1 million new subscribers to Office 365 Home and Personal, and we
ended the quarter with 5.6 million users.
Azure has also grown dramatically, with storage doubling and compute tripling this year. Along with increased usage
of our core services, over 50% of our Azure customers are now also using higher value services, like the Enterprise
Mobility Suite which has seen strong adoption since the May launch. We're pleased that our customers are
enthusiastically embracing Office 365, Azure, CRM Online, and our other cloud services, especially considering it's
still early in the cloud transition.
Each customer has unique deployment needs. And as a result, CIOs value the flexibility that our hybrid cloud offerings
provide. You can see this in our commercial bookings, which grew 23% this quarter. And our contracted-not-billed

balance now exceeds $24 billion. As we previously discussed in fiscal year 2014, both the quarter and the year
presented a large renewal opportunity. Our differentiated value proposition combined with strong execution kept our
renewal rates very high.
In addition to transitioning to the cloud, our customers continued to invest in premium versions of our on-prem server
products like Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server. As a result, our server licensing revenue grew 14%
this quarter.
We feel good about the progress we're making with Windows. Developed markets continue to show stability, and we're
encouraged by the initial response from OEMs to our new consumer offerings like Windows with Bing. This quarter,
OEM revenue grew 3% as we saw the commercial hardware refresh cycle continue, with businesses updating their
devices and renewing their commitment to the Windows platform. XP end of support contributed to the double-digit
growth in both Windows Pro and volume licensing, though the benefits moderated throughout the quarter.
In Bing, we continue to see growth in both usage and monetization. This quarter, U.S. search query share exceeded
19% and RPS grew double digits again. As we saw in prior quarters, display revenue remained soft.
In late June, we launched Surface Pro 3. While it's still early, sales are outpacing earlier versions of Surface Pro, and
we are excited to bring the device to many more markets this summer. During the quarter, we reassessed our product
roadmap and decided not to ship a new form factor that was under development. Combined with the transition of
production toward our latest Surface offering, we made inventory adjustments which impacted our gross margins.
Also in June, we released our new Xbox One offering, and we're pleased with the response. At E3 we reasserted our
focus on games, with blockbuster titles and key exclusives coming this holiday. With the progress we are making in
channel inventories, the new markets for Xbox One, and our exciting game lineup, we feel well positioned heading into
the holiday season.
With the closing of the Nokia Devices and Services acquisition during the quarter, we established a new segment,
Phone Hardware, to provide transparency into the progress we'll make as we improve and grow the phone business.
This quarter, Lumia device sales were primarily driven by good performance in the lower price point 500 and 600
series. Sales of non-Lumia devices were in line with the overall feature phone market dynamics. Our gross margins
were impacted by decisions we made to rationalize the device portfolio as well as acquisition related amortization
expense.
Across the company, we grew gross margin by $1 billion or 7%. While the faster growing cloud and hardware
businesses impacted our overall company gross margin percentage, it's important to note we continue to drive margin
growth in key areas with improved discipline and business process.
In D&C Other, revenue from search advertising and subscriptions are driving gross margin growth. In Commercial
Other, margins expanded again this quarter, benefiting from both improved business scale and data center efficiency in
our cloud services. And we've made key changes to our Hardware business, which have been discussed by both Satya
and Stephen Elop in the past two weeks.
We've also kept our focus on rigorous operating expense discipline. Excluding the addition of about $750 million from
NDS, our Q4 operating expense came in at the low end of our guidance. And for the full year, with disciplined
decision-making, we grew revenue 9% for NDS, more than twice as fast as operating expense, which grew 4%.
Our effective tax rate was higher this quarter. Part of this was due to an adjustment to prior-year taxes related to
intercompany transfer pricing. Beyond that, the increase was driven by the inclusion of NDS results and our changing
geographic mix.
In Q4, we returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to finish this fiscal year at
$15.7 billion, an increase of 28% over the prior year.
With that overview, let me turn it over to Satya to share some thoughts.

Satya Nadella
Thank you, Amy. Hello, everyone. I'm proud of the results we've delivered this quarter and across the fiscal year. In
Q4, on an operating basis, we grew revenue 10% and operating income 12%. We accelerated our commercial cloud
business to a $4.4 billion annual run rate. And perhaps more importantly, we made bold and disciplined decisions to
define our core as a productivity and a platform company for the mobile-first cloud-first world.
Before I get into the investment principles and decisions, I want to explain how our focus on productivity and platforms
leads us to participate in cloud and mobile markets. Mobility for us goes beyond just devices. While we are certainly
focused on building great phones and tablets, we think of mobility more expansively. We think the opportunity that
comes from running our productivity experiences on Windows, iOS, and Android device, Office 365 and dynamic
SaaS offerings are targeted here. We also see great opportunity in simplifying and managing the user experiences
spanning multiple devices ecosystems with our identity management, device management, and data security. This is the
focus of our Enterprise Mobility Suite.
Similarly when it comes to the cloud opportunity, we run an at-scale public cloud service and provide servers for
private and hybrid clouds. Azure, StorSimple, InMage, and our data center additions of server products across
Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server all help us participate in the cloud growth.
Our mobile and cloud opportunity views informs our decisions on what to build and where to invest. More specifically,
we use the following three principles to guide our investments. First, focus investments on the core. Productivity
experiences and platform investments will prioritize across engineering, sales, marketing, as well as M&A. Second,
consolidate overlapping efforts. This means one operating system that covers all screen sizes and consolidated dual-use
productivity services that cross life and work. Third, run all businesses in an economically sound way. We will get
crystal clear on the core businesses that drive long-term differentiation and the businesses that support them. For those
supporting efforts such as MSN, retail stores, and hardware, we will also ensure disciplined financial execution.
Now let's talk about the specific investments. We will be relentless in our focus on our core digital work and life
experiences and the two platforms that support it, the cloud operating system and the device operating system and
hardware. Everything we do starts with digital work and life experiences to delight dual users. These are users who use
technology both at work and in their personal life. This is how we reinvent productivity. Last year, we started to take
steps in this direction. Now, OneDrive and OneDrive for Business are one team. Outlook and Exchange are one team.
Skype and Lync are one team, all focused on those dual-user scenarios.
We are clear that our experiences are going to be available on all devices. We have a specific goal for multiple
Microsoft applications to be available on every home screen. This is why we brought Office to the iPad, and now there
are more than 35 million downloads of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.
We believe productivity experiences will go beyond individual applications to deliver ambient intelligence that spans
applications. To that end, we introduced Cortana, our personal assistant in Windows Phone 8.1.
We also believe that productivity includes group collaboration and business processes within organizations. In
February, we announced our Power BI Suite to help customers harness the power of big data in order to drive a data
culture and greater productivity within their organizations. Power BI Suite enables you to ask natural language
questions, do rich visualizations, and collaborate around data. Customers are loving it. In fact, the average monthly
users have grown over 130%. We are pleased to see all-up Dynamics growth at 13% for the quarter, with CRM Online
nearly doubling. And it's great now to have Dynamic CRM in the Gartner Leaders Quadrant in both sales and service,
the two most relevant areas in the CRM space.
Looking forward in fiscal year 2015, we are increasing our investment in R&D and sales for our Digital Work and Life
businesses, even as we cut total operating expenses. We have a rich roadmap going forward. Two examples of our
innovation are what we are doing with Delve and Skype Translator. Delve is an Office 365 cloud-based service that is
the first in a new breed of intelligent and social work experiences. Delve will turn enterprise search on its head as
information that is relevant to you finds you. Think of this as the Facebook newsfeed for productivity. Skype Translator

will break down the language barriers in our communications and impact everything from everyday conversations with
friends to education to global business.
Additionally, I'm pleased to see the progress with Bing, now more than 19% U.S. query share and strong RPS growth.
Going forward, we will drive our Bing-related investments to contribute to the core digital work and life experiences
such as Cortana, Smart Search, Delve, Power Q&A, and many others. We expect Bing to be profitable on a standalone
basis in FY 2016.
Now let's transition to the cloud OS. Our cloud OS represents the fastest growing opportunity for Microsoft. Quarter
after quarter, we drive growth and customer adoption. Our server products benefit from our public cloud. The fact that
we use our servers to run our cloud makes our server software the most capable, enabling others to build and operate
their clouds. This has led to growth in Hyper-V share, which is now at 30.6%, and has helped grow data center
additions to Windows Server and System Center, both up more than 40% for the year.
We also had another breakout year for SQL Server. With SQL Server 2014, we released industry-leading in-memory
technology across all database workloads of online transaction processing, data warehousing, and business intelligence,
and we grew our SQL business by more than 19%.
Our Azure business is growing rapidly and we further accelerated growth last year. We grew our data center footprint
into Australia, Brazil, Japan, and China while doubling our capacity in existing regions.
In FY 2014, we also started to see the adoption of our high-value services on top of our base cloud infrastructure. We
announced the Enterprise Mobility Suite, a comprehensive cloud solution to address the consumerization of IT
challenges such as bring-your-own-device and SaaS application adoption. EMS brings together identity management,
device management, and data security into one IT control plane and architecture. The early data from customer
adoption for EMS is very encouraging.
We announced the Azure Intelligent Systems Service, our IoT [Internet of Things] service in the cloud that enables
organizations to securely connect, manage, and capture machine-generated data from a variety of sensors and devices.
To support these high value services in Azure, I have prioritized acquisitions such as GreenButton for Big Compute,
Capptain for mobile back end services, and just in the past few weeks InMage for disaster recovery for hybrid clouds.
In FY 2015, we'll make investments to drive this strategy forward. We will expand our Azure data center footprint and
increase capacity in existing regions. We will launch newer high-level services, including Azure Machine Learning that
currently is in preview. We will expand our hybrid solutions with new services such as StorSimple, InMage, as well as
our server products, all offering cloud tiering. We will continue to build out the EMS value proposition, and we will
expand our sales efforts to drive growth.
Let's transition to our device OS and hardware, the third component of our call. In everything we do with our Windows
OS and first-party devices, we will light up our digital work and life experiences. We're approaching the Windows OS
business with a bold challenger mindset and pushing both the product and business model forward. We start with a
focus on business customers in FY 2014. We saw these customers recommit into Windows. In April, we released an
update to Windows 8.1. To start, we improved the core desktop experience with mouse and keyboard advancements.
For enterprises, we released Internet Explorer Enterprise Mode and extended our mobile device management
capability.
With Windows 8.1 Update, we also lowered the hardware spec required so that OEMs can build tablets and clamshells
at lower price points. In addition, we made the decision to evolve the Windows business model. Now Windows
licenses are zero dollars for any OEM building a device less than nine inches. We also added a low-cost Windows
offering with Bing integration for OEMs. This new offering combined with lower hardware specs means OEMs will
bring a fantastic lineup of value-based notebooks and tablets to the market this holiday.
In June, we launched Surface Pro 3, the most productive tablet on the market today. The reason it's the most productive
tablet on the market is because we thought through the experience end to end. For example, one of the things you will
notice with Surface Pro 3 is how it excels at note taking. You can jot down your thoughts rapidly just like with a pen

and paper. To make this work in an integrated natural way, our developers pulled together one vision to write code that
resides in the firmware in Surface Pro 3's pen. The Windows shell and its inking support reduced the parallax error, as
well as in OneNote. And as Amy said, we are optimistic given the early signs from the Surface Pro 3's performance in
the market.
On phones, we saw a good early start to Lumia 630 and 635 as well as Lumia 930, especially in Europe. In the year
ahead, we are investing in ways that will ensure our device OS and first-party hardware align to our core. We will
streamline the next version of Windows from three operating systems into one single converged operating system for
screens of all sizes. We will unify our stores, commerce, and developer platforms to drive a more coherent user
experience and a broader developer opportunity. We look forward to sharing more about our next major wave of
Windows enhancements in the coming months.
Our approach to first-party hardware going forward is clear. At times, we will develop new categories like we did with
Surface, and we will responsibly make the market for Windows Phone. However, we're not in the hardware for
hardware's sake. And the first-party device portfolio will be aligned to our strategic direction as a productivity and
platform company. As I said before, going forward, all the devices will be created with an explicit purpose to light up
our digital work and life experiences. Good examples of this today are what we're doing with Surface Pro 3 for note
taking and PPI for meetings. You can expect to see this type of innovation in our hardware, including phones. Amy will
talk more on our plans for disciplined execution around our hardware business going forward.
I want to make a few comments on Xbox. It's important for us to have a core that's thriving. It's equally important to
place smart bold bets in other areas where we have the ability to add value and have impact. That's what we're doing
with Xbox. We made the decision to manage Xbox to maximize enterprise value with a focus on gaming. Gaming is
the largest digital life category in a mobile-first cloud-first world. It's also the place where our past success, a revered
brand, and passionate fan base present us a special opportunity. With our decision to specifically focus on gaming, we
expect to close Xbox Entertainment Studios and streamline our investments in music and video. We will invest in our
core console gaming and Xbox Live with a view towards the broader PC and mobile opportunity.
I hope you can see that we have bold ambitions and we have made a lot of progress. Also know that we are well
underway in evolving our organization and culture to deliver on these bold ambitions. This includes simplifying how
we work and modernizing our engineering processes. In all that we do, we will be accountable to our customers,
partners, and shareholders. Empowering every individual in the organization to do more and achieve more in a
mobile-first cloud-first world is a huge undertaking, and it is one that Microsoft is uniquely qualified to take on and
change the world.
Thank you. And with that, let me turn it over to Amy to give you more guidance on FY 2015.
Amy Hood
Thanks, Satya. Before going into detail about our outlook, let me first say that all forward-looking information assumes
the macroeconomic environment remains stable throughout this coming fiscal year.
As Satya detailed, we're taking bold steps to move Microsoft forward with a renewed sense of clarity and alignment.
Our investment plan reflects those changes, as we reallocate resources to aggressively drive toward our goals and
pursue the highest growth and financial return businesses.
Even as we invest for growth, we expect our total operating expense in fiscal year 2015 to be down from this past year
before considering the addition of the Nokia cost structure and integration and restructuring cost.
Now, let me address Phone separately. In fiscal year 2014, we recorded about $750 million of operating expense for the
Phone business for the period post the acquisition. Annualized, this would have been about $4.5 billion, but we are
aggressively working to drive synergies across key functions such as development, supply chain, and operations, as we
integrate and right-size the business. We expect to realize more than $1 billion in synergies. And as a result, we will be
on a path to reach operating breakeven for the Phone business in fiscal year 2016. Including Phone, we expect

operating expense to be between $34.2 billion and $34.6 billion in fiscal year 2015.
In addition to the expense guidance I just provided and as we announced on July 17, we expect to incur between $1.1
billion and $1.6 billion in restructuring expense. These will be substantially complete in the first half of the fiscal year.
Separately, we will also incur about $150 million per quarter in integration cost, such as systems work. Similar to this
quarter, we will continue to report these items in a separate line item in the income statement.
Now let me give our view on the first quarter, starting with Devices and Consumer. In licensing, we expect revenue to
be $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. This range reflects an ongoing business PC refresh cycle, headwinds for consumer PCs,
and a continued moderation of the benefits from the XP end of support.
In computing and gaming hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.7 billion to $2 billion. This range reflects the
continuing ramp of Surface Pro 3 and Xbox One, as both products are introduced into new markets in Q1. In phone
hardware, we expect revenue to be $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion as we de-line the device portfolio to our strategy. And in
Devices and Consumer other, we expect revenue to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.
Moving on to Commercial, we expect revenue across our two segments to be $12.0 billion to $12.2 billion. Within this,
we expect Commercial other revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. And in corporate, we expect about $300 million of
negative impact next quarter.
We expect COGS to be $7.5 billion to $7.9 billion, with variability being driven by both hardware segments.
We expect first quarter operating expense excluding integration restructuring to be between $8.5 billion and $8.7
billion. As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend interest income, offset by interest expense and the
net cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another.
We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 21% and 23%. This is in line with the fourth quarter excluding the
prior-period tax adjustment, as the changing mix of our business as well as the impact of the NDS acquisition will
continue to influence our tax rate.
Investments in cloud infrastructure are necessary to support and enable the significant growth and momentum in our
cloud services. In Q1, we expect CapEx to increase sequentially to further support our growth. Similar to fiscal year
2014, these investments are decided based on a thorough review of demand and capacity plans to ensure that the
investments provide an appropriate return on capital. We also remain focused on software-driven innovation to increase
the utilization and capacity of the capital we deploy. We expect our revenue to grow in line with normal seasonality.
In closing, Q1 is the start of an incredibly important year for Microsoft. We're making important changes to our
organization and culture to enable and empower our people to do their very best work. Mobility and cloud present an
enormous opportunity, and we are focusing resources on our core so we can capitalize and deliver on the next wave of
innovation, growth, and long-term shareholder value.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.

<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you very much. I've got two parts to it. The first is, Satya, you've been changing the
engineering processes within the company, adding more analytics to the process. How do you see this change
impacting both the product and the speed of go-to-market?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Two things, Mark. One is the diversity of products that Microsoft has from silicon tape-outs to
services that we are continuously updating in Azure or Office 365 is a lot more than let's say when we first created the
Microsoft engineering system. That was for retail package products. So since then, a lot has changed and a lot has
evolved. And so what we are doing is we are introducing new functions and new skills. Design is even more important
than it ever was. Data analytics, as you said, is very important to us, and they're not outside functions. They are
functions that are integral to how we do product development, how we do A/B testing, how we do log analysis on a
continuous basis. So that's the engineering process and culture change that we have ongoing, and in fact, a lot of
learning from a variety of different teams that's now spreading across a lot of Microsoft.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. And, Amy, one quick question. We saw a significant acceleration this quarter
in cloud revenue – or I guess Amy or Satya. We saw acceleration in cloud revenue year over year. Is this Office for the
iPad? Is this Azure? What's driving the acceleration, and how long do you think we can keep this going?
<A - Amy Hood>: Mark, why don't I take it? And if Satya wants to add, obviously he should do that. In general, I
wouldn't point to one product area. It was across Office 365, Azure, and even CRM Online. I think some of the
important dynamics that you could point to, particularly in Office 365, I really think over the course of the year, we saw
an acceleration in moving the product down the market into increasing what we would call the mid-market and even
small business at a pace. And that's a particular place I would tie back to some of the things Satya mentioned in the
answer to your first question: improvements to analytics, improvements to understanding the use scenarios, improving
the product in real time, understanding trial, ease of use, ease of signup. All of these things actually can afford us the
ability to go to different categories, go to different geos and to different segments.
And in addition, I think what you'll see, Mark, as we initially moved many of our customers to Office 365, it came on
one workload. And I think what we've increasingly seen is our ability to add more workloads and sell the entirety of the
suite through that process. I also mentioned in Azure our increased ability to sell some of these higher-value services.
So while I could speak broadly about all of them, I think I would generally think about the strength as being both
completion of our product suite, ability to enter new segments, and ability to sell new workloads.
<A - Satya Nadella>: The only thing I would add is it's the combination of our SaaS offerings like Dynamics and
Office 365, our public cloud offering in Azure, but also our private and hybrid cloud infrastructure, which also benefits
because they run on our servers. Our cloud runs on our servers. So it's that combination which makes us both unique
and reinforcing. And a best example is what we are doing with Azure Active Directory. The fact that somebody gets
onboarded to Office 365 means their tenant information is in Azure AD. The fact that the tenant information is in
Azure AD is what makes EMS or our Enterprise Mobility Suite more attractive to a customer managing iOS, Android,
or Windows devices. That network effect is really now helping us a lot across all of our cloud efforts.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Mark.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you. I appreciate it and congrats on the quarter.

<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Brent. Actually, I'll start and I think Satya actually will have some things to add. First of
all, I would start by saying I wouldn't ascribe the behavior to me. I would ascribe the behavior to a senior leadership
team and to a group that's focused on investing in the core, focused on making tradeoffs, focused on really accelerating
our growth in key areas. Our ability to make changes really throughout the second half of this year in particular and as
we've led into fiscal year 2015 is really about a group focused on building and investing in something that can really be
even greater than it is today.
And so while I would use the word disciplined, I don't think it's about a person, and it shouldn't be. It should be about
an environment in which every person here thinks about how they can increase their ROI and accrue to the collective.
And I think we've actually seen the benefits of that in the past few quarters, and I think you'll see it as we head into
2015.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Amy, you captured it well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Keith E. Weiss>: Excellent, thank you for the question and a very nice quarter. I was hoping to talk a little bit
about the growth strategy at Nokia. You guys look to cut expenses pretty aggressively there. But this is – particularly
smartphone is a very competitive marketplace. Can you tell us a little bit about the strategies for how you actually start
to gain share with Lumia on a going-forward basis? And maybe give us an idea of what levels of share or what levels
of unit volumes are you going to need to hit to get to that breakeven in FY 2016.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Let me start and, Amy, you can even add. So overall, we are very focused on I would say
thinking about mobility share across the entire Windows family. I already talked about in my remarks about how
mobility for us even goes beyond devices. But for this specific question, I would even say that we want to think about
mobility, not just one form factor or a mobile device, because I think that's where the ultimate prize is. But that said, we
are even on a year-over-year basis seeing increased volumes for Lumia. It's coming at the lower end, in the entry
smartphone market, and we are pleased with it. In many markets, we now have over 10%. That's the first marker I
would say that we need to track country by country.
And the key place where we are going to differentiate is looking at productivity scenarios or these digital work and life
scenarios that we can light up on our phone in unique ways. When I can take my Office Lens app, use the camera on
the phone, take a picture of anything and have it automatically OCR [Optical Character Recognition] recognized and
into OneNote in searchable fashion, that's a unique scenario. What we have done with Surface and PPI shows us the
way that there is a lot more we can do with phones by broadly thinking about productivity. So this is not about just
Word or Excel on your phone, it is about thinking about Cortana and Office Lens and those kinds of scenarios in
compelling ways. And that's what at the end of the day is going to drive our differentiation and higher end Lumia
phones.
<A - Amy Hood>: And, Keith, to answer your specific question regarding FY 2016, I think we've made the difficult
choices to get the cost base to a place where we can deliver on the exact scenario Satya has outlined. And we do
assume that we continue to grow our units through the year and into 2016 in order to get to breakeven.
<A - Chris Suh>: Okay, thank you, Keith.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi, guys, congrats a great quarter. I just wanted to dig into Office 365. You put up another
quarter of pretty impressive metrics. Gone up to 5.6 million Home Premium users. I think the commercial side grew – I
think it was 98% year over year. And, Satya, you talked about some pretty meaningful download numbers as far as on
the iPad.
Wonder if you could just give us an update on Office 365. How is it doing versus your expectations and what your
expectations are over the course of the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months as we continue this transition?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Phil. In terms of versus our expectations, in this quarter it did do better than we expected
and, frankly, we had quite lofty goals. So I think that is encouraging. I think I talked about some of those key drivers in
the prior question.
When I think really about Home and Personal because we haven't had a chance to talk specifically about the consumer
usage, and you referenced Office on the iPad in your question, I think it's really about continuing to make the
subscription value, whether it's through the Home SKU or the Personal SKU, have the most value to a user. It's about a
user having the opportunity to access Office, the world's leading productivity app, on the device of their choice, having
it light up the very best on Windows devices, and having that accrue back to our subscriptions.
And so I think our ability to execute on that over the past, I guess, 18 months that we've had these SKUs in market is
quite encouraging. I don't really look to Office on the iPad as one item. It's a part of a value proposition that I think we
make both in the consumer segment as well as in the commercial segment.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Phil.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Richard G. Sherlund>: Thanks. I'm wondering if you could talk about Office for a moment. I'm curious whether
you think we've seen the worst for Office here with the consumer falloff and Office 365 growth and margins expanding
there. If you can look through the dynamics and give us a sense. Do you think you actually have turned the corner there
and we've maybe seen the worst in terms of Office growth and margins?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Rick, let me just start qualitatively in terms of how I view Office the category and how it relates
to productivity broadly. And then I'll have Amy even specifically talk about margins and what we are seeing in terms
of, I'm assuming, Office renewals as that's probably the question.
First of all, I believe the category that Office is in, which is productivity broadly for people, their groups as well as
organizations, is something that we're investing significantly and seeing significant growth in. On one end, you have
new things that we're doing like Cortana. This is for individuals on new form factors like the phones where it's not
about any single application but an intelligent agent that knows everything about my calendar, everything about my
life, and tries to help me with my everyday tasks.
On the other end is something like Delve, which is a completely new tool that's taking what is Enterprise Search and
making it more like this Facebook newsfeed where it has a graph of all my artifacts, all my people, all my groups, and
uses that graph to give me relevant information to discover. Same thing with Power Q&A and Power BI, it's a part of

Office 365. So we have a pretty expansive view of how we look at Office and what it can do. So that's the growth
strategy, and now specifically on Office renewals.
<A - Amy Hood>: I would say in general, let me make two comments. In terms of Office on the consumer side,
between what we've sold on-prem as well as the Home and Personal, we feel quite good, with attach continuing to
grow and increasing the value prop. So I think that's to address the consumer portion.
On the commercial portion, we actually saw Office grow, as you said, this quarter. I think the broader definition that
Satya spoke to of the Office value prop, and we continued to see Office renewed in our Enterprise agreements. So in
general, I think I feel like we're in a growth phase for that franchise.
<Q - Richard G. Sherlund>: Great.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Rick. We'll move to the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi, thanks. Satya, I wanted to ask you about two statements that you've made, one around
responsibly making the market for Windows Phone, just following on Keith's question here. It's a really competitive
market. It feels like ultimately you need to be a very, very meaningful share player in that market to have value for a
developer to leverage the universal apps that you're talking about in terms of presentations you've given at Build and so
forth.
I'm trying to understand how you can do both of those things at once. And in terms of responsibly making the market
for Windows Phone, it feels difficult given your nearest competitors there are doing things that you might argue are
irresponsible in terms of making their market, given that they monetize it in different ways.
<A - Satya Nadella>: So one of the beauties of universal Windows apps is it aggregates for the first time for us all of
our Windows volume. The fact that even what is an app that runs with a mouse and keyboard on the desktop can be in
the store and you can have the same app run in a touch-first or in a mobile-first way gives developers the entire volume
of Windows, which is 300-plus million units as opposed to just our 4% share of mobile in the U.S. or 10% in some
countries. So that's really the reason why we are actively making sure that universal Windows apps is available and
developers are taking advantage of it. We have great tooling. Because that's the way we are going be able to create the
broadest opportunity, to your very point, about developers getting an ROI for building to Windows. So that's how I
think we will do it in a responsible way.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Let's move to next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great, thank you so much for your time. I wanted to ask a question about, Satya, your
comments about combining the next version of Windows into one for all devices, and I'm just wondering. If you look
out, you've got different SKU segmentations right now. You've got enterprise. You've got consumer less than nine
inches for free, the offering that you mentioned earlier that you recently announced. How do we think about when you
come out with this one version for all devices, how do you see this changing the go-to-market and also the traditional
SKU segmentation and pricing that we've seen in the past?

<A - Satya Nadella>: My statement, Heather, was more to do with just even the engineering approach. The reality is
that we actually did not have one Windows. We had multiple Windows operating systems inside of Microsoft. We had
one for phone, one for tablets and PCs, one for Xbox, one for even embedded. So we had many, many of these efforts.
So now we have one team with a layered architecture that enables us to in fact put on for developers, bring that
collective opportunity with one store, one commerce system, one discoverability mechanism. It also allows us to scale
the UI across all screen sizes. It allows us to create this notion of universal Windows apps and bring coherence there.
So that's what more I was referencing, and our SKU strategy will remain by segment. We will have multiple SKU for
enterprises, we will have for OEM, we will have for end users. And so we will be disclosing and talking about our
SKUs as we get further along. But my statement was more to do with how we are bringing teams together to approach
Windows as one ecosystem very differently than we ourselves have done in the past.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Excellent, thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Great. Thanks, Heather; next question, please, operator.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Maguire with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Edward E. Maguire>: Hi, good afternoon. Satya, you made some comments about harmonizing some of the
different products across consumer and enterprise. And I was curious what your approach is to viewing your different
hardware offerings both in Phone and with Surface, how your go-to market may change around that; and also since you
decided to make the operating system for sub-9-inch devices free, how you see the value proposition and your ability to
monetize that user base evolving over time.
<A - Satya Nadella>: The statement I made about bringing together our productivity applications across work and life
is to really reflect this notion of dual-use because when I think about productivity, it doesn't separate out what I use as a
tool for communication with my family and what I use to collaborate at work. So that's why having this one team that
thinks about Outlook.com as well as Exchange helps us think about dual-use. Same thing with files and OneDrive and
OneDrive for Business because we want to have the software have the smarts about separating out the state, caring
about IT control and data protection while me as an end user get to have the experiences that I want. That's how we're
thinking about harmonizing those digital life and work experiences.
On the hardware side, we will continue to build hardware that fits with these experiences, if I understand your question
right, which is how will we differentiate our first-party hardware. We will build first-party hardware that's creating
categories. A good example is what we have done with Surface Pro 3; and in other places where we have really
changed the Windows business model to encourage a plethora of OEMs to build great hardware, and we are seeing
that. In fact, in this holiday season I think you'll see a lot of value notebooks. You'll see clamshells. So we will have the
full price range of our hardware offering enabled by this new Windows business model.
And I think the last part was how will we monetize. Of course, we will again have a combination. We will have our
OEM monetization. And some of these new business models are about monetizing on the back end with Bing
integration as well as our services attach. And that's the reason fundamentally why we have these zero-priced Windows
SKUs today.

Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Thanks. I wouldn't mind focusing for a moment on the enterprise server side. That's where
at least for me much of the upside came. We haven't seen server product revenue growth in the mid-teens in a while.
Total Microsoft bookings 20% ex-Nokia, I haven't seen that in ages. Perhaps the answer to these questions are related,
but what's happening with those two numbers to drive the upside? I'm sure a little bit came with Azure being strong,
but that's relatively small. So clearly there was an inflection up on the on-prem server tools business. Maybe part of it
was renewal rates. And if that's the answer, how much room do we have to go on that? Thank you.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Maybe I'll start and then, Amy, you can add. Overall, we've had a major revamp of our server
lineup, SQL 14 being a recent one which we launched in the last quarter. And it's the strength of our server products.
This is that phenomenon where our servers have become much more competitive, Windows Server for virtualization
and private cloud, System Center for data center management, SQL for all the in-memory workload capabilities it has,
and BI. All of that has really benefited from us running our own cloud, pushing our own servers to run these at-scale
services.
And with that being in place and these refreshes, we are seeing increased investment and interest on our infrastructure
when it comes to data centers. One of the things is, as the public cloud is growing, we in fact don't see it, at least for
now as a zero sum. In fact, we see growth, especially with the virtualization rates, because people are – overall the
number of applications on the mobile side are growing. All of those mobile applications drive back-end compute and
storage. And that back-end compute storage, some of it goes into the public cloud, but a lot of it even goes into the data
center. And that's where we have a very good price/performance equation and TCO equation. And so we are being
competitive in grabbing share, and our Hyper-V share is a good example of that.
<A - Amy Hood>: And I think, Karl, you're right. When you triangulate the data around our strong trend line on
unearned, even commercial bookings growth of 23%, and the numbers you've exactly talked about, it really was a
combination of Office 365 cloud growth as well as we talked about the benefits of our hybrid offerings, a lot of
on-prem server growth as well this quarter.

<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Karl. Operator, we'll take the next question.

Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - James R. Moore>: Great, thanks, guys. This is Jim Moore on for Dan Ives. Can you talk a little bit about the
geographies? You mentioned some North America and Europe strength. Maybe just talk a little more about the
dynamics there in terms of where you're seeing the strength, cloud or PC there. Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Jim. Actually, I would say the strength across the products isn't geographically specific, so
it's relatively consistent. We've seen cloud growth globally. We've seen on-prem server growth globally. In general, the
products get launched first and often in the U.S., and so it tends to be the most mature of some of those transitional
markets. But I think in general, my geographic comments are far more holistic than they are product specific.

Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Hey how are you? Thanks very much. Satya, you guys did a very good job this year of
returning capital to shareholders, over $15 billion. Can you give us some sense philosophically if you see a lot of
opportunity for additional repurchase/dividend activity, or is this a level you're fairly comfortable with? Thanks.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks for the question. Overall, my comments remain the same. I answered this even in the last
call, which is the approach we have taken is a balanced approach and a thoughtful approach. We're going to look at our
own need to invest in order to drive growth in the opportunities we see. I think today's conversation and results show
how some of the bets we have made with our cloud are paying off. And it's great to see that momentum, and it's in fact
a pretty broad-based momentum across Azure, Office 365, and Amy mentioned it pretty briefly, even CRM Online
growth. So to me, that remains the core, which is being able to place our capital to drive organic growth for the
long-term health of this company.
That said, we will have a balanced approach in terms of both share buyback as well as dividends. That's the approach
we have taken over the last multiple years, and that will be the same thoughtful process that I expect us to continue
with going into the next fiscal and beyond.
