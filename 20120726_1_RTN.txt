MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. My name
is Deanna and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded
for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations.
Please go ahead.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call.
The results we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on
our website at Raytheon.com. Following this morning's call an archive of both the audio replay and a preliminal
version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Bill Swanson,
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief
remarks by Bill and Dave and then move onto questions.
Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and
expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.
With that I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?

William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon reported strong or solid second quarter operating performance
driven by great execution across the company. I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter. We continue to focus
our efforts on driving efficiencies across the operations and leveraging our portfolio of advanced technologies to
capture new business.
Bookings were solid in the quarter with a book-to-bill of over 1.0, driven largely by our domestic and classified
business. Notable bookings include awards for the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, Standard Missile-6, domestic and
foreign training and several classified contracts. Funded backlog decreased by over $600 million year to date and by
approximately $2.1 billion compared to the second quarter of 2011.
Our international pipeline remains robust. At the Farnborough International Airshow earlier this month I had the
opportunity to meet with a number of our international customers. And what I can tell you is that there was
considerable interest in Raytheon's solutions from a broad set of both existing and new customers. Overall at this year's
show we hosted 30 delegations and had over 600 meetings within a short timeframe. I'm encouraged by what I've heard
from our international customers. They continue to look to us for solutions in the areas of missile defense, radars, ISR,
cybersecurity, air traffic management and training. In the international market we continue to set the pace among our
peer companies and in the quarter international represented approximately 25% of our total sales.
I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight an important achievement in the quarter. Our Standard Missile-3 had two
successful intercept tests, one on May 9 and the other on June 27. These intercepts, which have been compared to a
bullet hitting a bullet outside the atmosphere, demonstrate a critical capability for the United States and our allies. And
they're an example of how Raytheon continues to provide some of the world's most advanced technologies to meet our
customers' most pressing needs.
In terms of contract awards we received an order for the next block of multispectral targeting system for the U.S. Air
Force Reaper UAV in the quarter. The MTS-B, as it's called, is a multiuse electro-optical infrared sensor that also
provides target acquisition. This is basically the round ball that many of you see on the Predator and Reaper drones, and
it's just one of the many products across Raytheon that leverage our core EO/IR capabilities.
This follows an order we received for the dismounted detection radar, DDR, in the first quarter also for the Reaper.
DDR is a synthetic aperture radar pod that can be used to detect ground moving targets in all weather, day or night.
And it's a product of our core RF capabilities being applied in innovative ways to meet the demands for the Warfighter.
These products reflect our strong position in the ISR markets, alignment with our customers' priorities and demonstrate
our platform-agnostic strategy at work. This strategy gives us the flexibility to place products on multiple platform
vehicles and systems.
I would be remiss if I didn't address sequestration. On this topic, there isn't too much news to report from where we
were at the end of the first quarter. Congress continues to look at alternative courses of action; however, the reality is
this is an election year, which makes coming to a final agreement more challenging. Further, the Office of Management
and Budget has not rendered its interpretation of the legislation and the Department of Defense has not indicated its
plan for implementing sequestration.
So in this context we continue to plan for a range of potential outcomes, and like we do every day here at Raytheon,
we're focused on reducing our costs, optimizing our resources so that we can provide the best value for our customers.
Whether sequestration happens or not, it's engrained here in our culture and you can see that reflected in our
performance. It's a product of our heritage that goes back nine decades.
This month we're celebrating our 90th anniversary. Back when we were founded in 1922 few could have imagined or
envisioned the idea of intercepting a ballistic missile in space. It was basically the realm of science fiction. Today it's a
reality. Certainly many other things have changed since our founding, but what is steadfast is Raytheon's consistent
focus on excellence in technology and innovation and tackling some of our customers' really hard problems. It is what
we're known for around the world and why our customers know that they can count on us today and in the future.

I'd like to thank all of those who helped make Raytheon into the company it is today, past and present. Thanks to them
and today's world-class team, Raytheon remains well positioned for the future. With that, I'd like to turn it over to
Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks starting with second quarter highlights and then we'll move on to
questions. During my remarks I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone
could please move to page 3.
As Bill noted, we did perform well in the quarter. Our adjusted EPS of $1.55 was up 13% driven by continued
operational improvements and capital deployment actions. Adjusted operating margin was 13.6%, up 130 basis points
compared to last year's second quarter, reflecting strong performance across the company. For the quarter total
bookings were $6.2 billion and sales were $6 billion, both of which I'll discuss further in just a moment.
We are increasing our full year EPS guidance and cash flow outlook, which I'll address further in a few minutes, along
with other updates for 2012. During the quarter the company repurchased 4 million shares of common stock for $200
million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 11.9 million shares for $600 million.
As you move to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company
bookings for the quarter were $6.2 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $11.3 billion. As I mentioned previously we
continue to see the order book back end loaded this year and as a result we expect the book-to-bill to expand. We
estimate a full year book-to-bill range of between roughly 1 and 1.05 times.
Notable bookings included $687 million at Missile Systems for the EKD contract for the Missile Defense Agency. MS
also booked $348 million for Tomahawk for the U.S. Navy and international customers and $302 million for the
production of Standard Missile-6 for the U.S. Navy. Technical Services booked $568 million for domestic training and
$90 million for foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS Program. Space and Airborne Systems
booked $205 million to provide multispectral targeting systems for UAVs to the U.S. Air Force. Integrated Defense
Systems booked $134 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile Defense capability for an international
customer. And Network Centric Systems booked $90 million on the STARS program for the FAA and $82 million on
the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System for the U.S. Army. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $458 million
and $462 million respectively on a number of classified programs.
Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $33.9 billion compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2011. And as Bill
mentioned, on a funded basis our backlog is up over $600 million from the end of 2011 and up approximately $2.1
billion from the same period last year.
If you'd now move to page 5, sales were in line with our expectations. When we first talked about 2012 we said the
sales cadence would improve as we progressed through the year in part due to the timing of the international awards
that we received in the back half of 2011. Basically our view of how we see the year playing out hasn't changed.
By business, IIS, Missiles and SAS had sales essentially in line with the same period last year. IDS had second quarter
2012 net sales of $1.2 billion. The change from prior year was primarily due to lower volume on a U.S. Navy program.
NCS performed as expected with net sales of approximately $1 billion. The change in net sales is primarily due to the
planned declined in production of U.S. Army programs. And Technical Services had net sales of $821 million, down
slightly from the comparable period a year ago primarily due to the completion of the Polar contract in the first quarter
of 2012.
Moving ahead to page 6, we're pleased by our overall company margin performance, once again showing
year-over-year increase, which was driven by operational improvements. Our adjusted margin was 13.6%, an increase
of 130 basis points. And on a year-to-date basis our adjusted margin was 13.3%, up 90 basis points over the
comparable period in 2011. The strength in our underlying margin in the quarter was due to our continued focus on
execution. We benefited from labor overhead and material efficiencies across the company, some of which were

expected in the back half of this year. During the second quarter a few of the businesses exceeded our targeted
improvement on a number of international programs, which we don't see recurring in the second half.
We continue to move forward with our productivity initiatives driven by Six Sigma: rationalizing our supply base,
improving our direct to indirect ratios, finalizing our common business systems implementation, reducing our real
estate footprint, as well as implementing overhead and administrative cost improvements across the company. These
actions continue to drive value for our shareholders and our customers.
So looking at margins by business, IDS, IIS, Missiles, SAS and Technical Services margins were all up in the quarter
compared to the same period last year. At NCS the change in operating margin in the second quarter of 2012 compared
to second quarter of 2011 was primarily due to a change in contract mix. NCS margins in the second quarter were in
line with our expectations for the year. Overall the company continues to perform well.
So if you'd now move to page 7. Second quarter 2012 adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, up 13%. The increase was
driven by operational improvements and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases, and on a
year-to-date basis adjusted EPS was $3.01, up 10% from the same period last year.
On page 8 you'll note that we raised our full year 2012 EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of between $5.15 and $5.30,
and on an adjusted basis to a range of between $5.70 and $5.85. About two thirds of the increase is driven by the
performance improvement in the business that I spoke about a moment ago and a little less than one third is due to the
recently passed pension legislation.
We repurchased 4 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter and have now narrowed our diluted
share guidance for the year. And as I discussed a few minutes ago we've increased our 2012 guidance for operating
cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million to between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion due to the recently
passed pension legislation. The new law will not have an impact on our 2012 FAS/CAS expense. In addition we
continue to see the cadence of cash generation weighted to the back half of the year. Essentially our view of the
cadence of cash flow from operations for the year hasn't changed.
And as you can see on page 9 we've included the change in our guidance by business. The increase in margin guidance
at IBS and FAS reflects solid overall program performance. On page 10 we've provided some directional guidance on
how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing
operations for the balance of 2012.
I'd like to take a minute to touch on how we're preparing for the future here at Raytheon. Technology and innovation
along with our people continue to be our cornerstone. And these are areas where we continue to make the right
investments. Some good examples of this are RMS's factory of the future in Tucson and the new all-up-around facility
in Huntsville, both of which should improve production efficiency and quality. In addition, our new cyber center,
which we call the code center, has come online in the Washington DC area. It incorporates our latest cyber
technologies to better serve our customer needs across the company.
We continue to directly invest in R&D in such areas as multifunction wideband systems, pulse weapons, automatic
target recognition, smaller and more precise missiles, resilient networks and cyber products, just by way of example.
Before we open it up for questions let me summarize. We saw solid performance in the second quarter and exceeded
the EPS and margin guidance we provided back in April even as the environment remains challenging. Our book-to-bill
was above one and our sales were in line with expectations. As we look to the balance of the year the pipeline of
international and domestic opportunities remains robust.
We continue to move ahead with our efficiency initiatives and are confident in our outlook for the year. With that Bill
and I will open the call up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] We'll take questions in the order received and with an interest of time please limit yourself to
one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol,
JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Good morning and good quarter.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Wanted to get a little color if you wouldn't mind, David, just on the cumulative adjustments
for performance in the quarter. What are you going to disclose in your Q? Is there anything you're going to call out in
particular in terms of programs? Whatever you can tell us about IDS in particular would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay, Joe. That was good. You wrapped six questions into one. So I can see you follow
directions well.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I have that skill.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. I know you do, Joe. Okay. Right. The Q will have all the disclosure that you just
suggested. The EAC adjustments, I think this is what you're getting at, in the second quarter were about $175 million, a
little under a $60 million improvement from the second quarter last year. It was driven by a couple of key factors but
there's obviously a multitude of adjustments given our 8,000 programs and 15,000 contracts. From a Missile Systems
standpoint they improved about $21 million as the result of improvements in the land combat systems program. There
was also material and other cost efficiencies in the international tactical radar product area at SAS. On a year-to-date
basis the EAC adjustments amount to about 2.6% of revenue.
So in general, we run about 2% to 2.5% of EAC adjustments relative to sales. That's been the historical pattern over the
last four or five years. The first half was on the higher end of the range. We do expect it to be lower in the back half.
That's primarily driven by the acceleration of cost efficiencies that I mentioned earlier. Much of these were originally
planned for the back half of the year.
I do want to point out something else on the margin profile because it's driven by a number of different factors. You
have the mix of programs, meaning the stage of completion, international versus domestic, development versus
production and fixed price versus cost by contracts. So if you're looking at the margin going forward you need to
consider all of these factors.
From a business perspective the opportunities are weighted toward our production and international programs over our
cost and service type programs. So a way to think about this might be if you look at Technical Services or IIS. These
businesses have a higher mix of cost and service programs. So they don't offer the same level of opportunities as some
of the other businesses.
Now for IDS specifically, the strength of the second quarter margins were due to continued focus on execution, again,
some of which we had expected in the third and fourth quarters. We also achieved better than expected results on a few
performance milestones. IDS did exceed our internal performance targets on some international programs. And again,
we don't see this recurring in the back half of the year. Given the order book, particularly in the international area, we
do see stronger volume from IDS and continued solid performance, particularly from factory operations.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Could you talk a little bit about international orders for the year and what you see as the
timing over the next two quarters? And then related to that, Bill, you talked about Farnborough and some of the
international discussions you had. Could you talk about what you're hearing with respect to events in the Middle East
and how that might affect demand for different capabilities that you have now?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Sure. I'd be happy to. I'll run through a few international. Notification on Kuwait is taking
place as we speak. We expect approval of that by the end of August. Kuwait will be for two to four fire units roughly.
We're figuring the first tranche at about $1 billion there. Turkey, because of what's going on in Syria and so forth, was
supposed to have their decision this summer. It looks like it'll be at the latter part of this year. So we expect to hear their
decision now at the latter part of Q4. Oman will be purchasing a ground-based system. That'll probably be in the $1.5
billion range. We expect that Q4 timeframe, maybe Q1.
We have precision munitions in the category of Paveway. We expect about $500 million cumulative in Q4 there. Air
traffic control radars probably $200 million to $300 million between now and the end of the year. We expect Missiles,
TOW, ESM and the other things we build probably around $500 million, plus or minus $100 million for that. Training
in the $150 million to $200 million. And international C4I, we finish negotiations in an area there, and we expect that
one to probably be in the Q3, early Q4 timeframe. So as you can see a rich pipeline there.
The airshow was interesting for us. It was a great opportunity for me. I always call it a target-rich environment because
all our customers are there and you get to spend time with them in a different kind of atmosphere and talk about some
of their problems. Clearly for the Mid-East, missile defense is important, whether you look at Saudi, UAE, Qatar,
Oman. Those are all areas for us that have interest in providing air defense for a number of reasons given the issues
they have in that part of the world.
You didn't mention the Pacific Rim. That's also very active for us when you look at the threats that they have in various
countries, either trying to disrupt navigation or control navigation on the seas there. So that has an effect
internationally. It also has an effect domestically as people try and think about keeping the United States out of the
shipping lines.
So for us we look at both of those areas and what they were talking to us about right in our wheelhouse. And they come
to us to help them provide full solutions, not just products. So that's one of our strengths. So I felt very good about the
airshow this year.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: As you look at this, I mean these issues have been there for some time. I'm just curious.
The discussions you're having now, have you seen any change in the last six months?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. I would say the changes were pulling out of Iraq, Afghanistan. So the U.S. has had a
big presence there for the last – what, ten years. And if the U.S. is pulling out than various countries realize that they
have to do more and I think they're thinking about that and taking action very seriously.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. I hoped that helped.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Yes.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. Bill, you've talked about the challenging environment. You've talked
about international a little bit. Can you sort of talk about how else you've changed the aperture of the company? And
also can you discuss how you are going to be able to take advantage of sort of these I'll call it lower cost efficiencies
going forward so that you share fairly with your customer as opposed to give it all back?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. I think, Howard, I'd describe it in a number of ways. I think your question goes to
the heart of sequestration and we've got five months to avoid it between today and first part of January. We've spent
time assessing the various outcomes that could take place, where the cuts would come from. When you look at all of
that, for us, I think I've said it before; I'm not in charge of the administration. I'm not in charge of Congress. But what
we all are in charge of here is our own destiny, so how do we make sure our program performance is flawless? How do
we shorten our timelines? How do we reduce our costs? How do we keep our focus on companywide productivity and
efficiency? And we do it across the board.
I think Dave did a nice rundown or summary of that from our design activity to supply chain to our factories. And for
that, that makes us better. We compete. We compete every day. And for us, we believe we have to do that in best value,
which means our technology and innovation has to be the best. But we also have to have the right cost structure and
what I learned from the 1990s is you need to get ahead of that. And I think that's what we're doing.
From that standpoint, the department will either take three courses of action when they do this. They'll take a peanut
butter approach. They might have a programmatic plus peanut butter or they might be able to do it on a project basis.
But one thing I know, the Secretary of Defense needs all the flexibility he can have because his strategy matches the
funds the way they are today. So if you go and take out more money, then the strategy doesn't match the funds and it
creates a problem for him and he needs flexibility.
For us that'll happen in 2013. When you go to 2014 it will become discrete again. They'll do it at the program level
rather than at the R1s and P1s on a percentage basis and from there we'll know where our customers are headed. We
believe they're going to be headed in the areas that the Secretary always outlines for us, which is the ISR world, missile
defense, EW, command and control and support, while at the same time I think what's important is that we are
continuing to invest. We are probably the largest CRAD house in the country. That's part of the fuel that goes into our
engine of technology and every quarter we get new things like the Air Soldier Personal Electronics Computer and
Display System. We won that. So helicopter pilots and others will get information right to the source programs.
One I thought you'd pick up on, the MORPHINATOR, which has probably got the best name yet, and it'll get voted this
year, but that gives us the cybertechnology to be able to address the Internet protocol with hopping in the battlefield so
it keeps people from understanding what we're trying to do. Those are things I think from our standpoint that if I was a
sailor our ditty bag has a lot of programs and technology in there that this is a cyclic business. When it comes out of
this cycle you want to be lean, mean and have things and tools available to you.
Probably the most important, and this is a long answer but it's a thoughtful question, is that one thing that we learned
from the 1990s and I learned it oh so well, is when the cuts come the plants or facilities where you want to work doesn't
have it and the places where you're not as good gets the work and then you can never balance your workloads. Here as
you know and others know our business systems allow us to win anywhere, design anywhere, produce anywhere.
That's the real key when you go to the future, do you have the ability and the agility and do you have speed, and speed's
something we're working on. We're not there in my opinion and we're trying to get there every day. That will help us
adjust to that environment better than anybody else.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. Did I get it?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, it was a little different from what I had wanted, but the one point...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Oh, what did you want me to say?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, no, no, no. It's not what I want you to say. The only pushback I have is these are
terrific margins today, and maybe just a little bit differently, they're terrific margins today and if you can deliver a 1.05

book-to-bill, are we kind of seeing that you're being able to position yourself to grow a little bit of the business, putting
aside the sequester issue, so that you could actually show improvements all in as we look out rather than hit a wall?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. Howard, I don't think we're hitting a wall if that's the question. And from our
standpoint when I went through the international, that gives us opportunities. We still have to work hard and manage
the programs. As you know and others know, international always has risk and the way you perform is to retire the risk.
I think this company does very good at that given our large international base and given our return. The one thing I got
out of Farnborough that I took home is that our customers are confident when they do business with us we are going to
deliver and give them the product they want. That kind of confidence and that kind of trust and respect, you can't buy.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hey, Dave, I got my usual couple of questions here. What was the international growth
year over year in the quarter? The classified growth and how much did classified account for sales? And then what
happened to domestic?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay, George. I could have asked that question on your behalf but I let you say it anyway.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: You have the answers there.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yes. I have the answers, George. From a domestic and foreign standpoint, we said this
early on, that we are weighted to the back half of the year and we're continuing to track to that pace and cadence. In the
second quarter, international sales were down about 5%, again, as expected given the ramp-up of the international
orders that we received in the back half of 2011. So again it is in line with what we had talked about on previous
earnings calls. From a domestic standpoint we were down about 2.5% on the quarter. So on the first half the company
is down about 3% in sales.
Now, moving forward, domestic we expect in the back half of the year to be about breakeven, plus or minus 2%. And
from an international standpoint, we see sales growth of 8% to 12%. This was mentioned just a moment ago. We do see
the book-to-bill for the year from a company perspective to be between about 1.0 and 1.05. International as a subset of
that will be about 1.1 to 1.17. So again we do see continued growth from an international perspective and domestic
continues to perform fine.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Dave, let me jump in here little bit to provide a year end. We expect international
bookings to be 28% to 30% for the year and the sales as Dave mentioned to be around 26%, which means the volume
will be up about 3% to 5%, and on the classified side so far this year bookings have been running about 21%. We
expect the year to be around 15%, but we expected the growth in classified to be about 20% so we're feeling pretty
good about the classified side of the business.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And the classified in the second quarter, was that up also about this 20% you're expecting
for the year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, George, from just a pure sales standpoint the classified was down about 2.5% in line
with the other domestic business but again we expect that to pick up in the back half of the year. We booked just under
$1 billion in classified sales at two businesses in the second quarter so again that business continues to remain healthy.

The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Dave, I wanted to spend a few minutes on pension. I think you mentioned in your prepared
remarks that perhaps as much as a third of the EPS guide up was related to pensions. I was wondering if you could
provide a bit more detail on that. And then the second question also on pension is just some commentary from you
around FAS harmonization. The ruling went into effect at the end of last year. We've got since February 27, the ability
of the industry to begin passing on higher rates to the government. So I was wondering if you could just give us an
update on how that process is working for you and whether you're passing those higher FAS costs on and everything is
going as planned.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. So in 2012 the FAS/CAS adjustment is expected to be just under $285 million.
Looking further out, there are a number of variables that impact the adjustment and the funding requirements. As you
know these include the discount rate, the return on assets and some other actuarial assumptions and the new CAS
harmonization rules as well as the new pension funding stabilization law. So while the discount rate environment is
currently lower than it was at the end of 2011, the FAS/CAS is not adjusted for 2012 and it's difficult at this point to
predict how that plays out in 2013.
As a general rule of thumb, for Raytheon every 25-point basis point change in the discount rate has roughly a $60
million impact on the FAS/CAS adjustment. It's probably important to note as well that the retimed contribution levels
resulting from the pension funding stabilization law do increase the FAS/CAS expense adjustment by between $60
million and $80 million. But again a lot of these variables, other variables have to be considered when you're projecting
that out.
So let me just get a little more specific. Like I said a moment ago, the 2012 FAS/CAS adjustment doesn't change. For
2013, given the 8.75% return on asset assumption as well as a 5% discount rate assumption, we see the FAS/CAS
adjustment going from what we had projected before at about $45 million to just over $100 million, and it's difficult to
predict after that at this point. Again this will all be subject to change as we close out the year.
From a cash standpoint these are essentially retimed contributions into the pension plan. On a gross level, that impacted
the contributions by roughly $500 million in 2012 and about $400 million in 2013. After you take into account the
contract reimbursement and tax impact of those contributions, it impacts the company from a cash flow standpoint of
about $100 million in 2012 and about $300 million next year.
Lastly, you asked about CAS harmonization. That impacts us favorably by about $200 million in 2014 and improves
from there over the next few years, 2015, 2016, 2017. We are continuing to focus on our cost efficiencies and
productivity. I spoke about that earlier, Bill addressed it earlier, and we will remain very competitive from that
perspective.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. And just a follow-up, I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned that this year's
EPS guidance grew. A third that was related to pension? I'm not sure that I caught exactly how that might be.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, yes, from the tax standpoint, the cap on the domestic manufacturing deduction is
adjusted as a result of the pension contributions. Following that, the tax posture from the company was improved.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.

The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk about one of the businesses in particular, which is SAS, in
terms of just what's going on that's different there in that you saw year-over-year growth there where everybody else
has been declining? And the margins are coming in well ahead. Really why should they soften as we go into next year?
And they also had a nice increase in orders as well. So just talk a little bit about what's happening at SAS.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, sure. This is actually something we've been talking about for a while. The demand
for our international tactical radar programs continues to be strong and there is increasing demand for the ISR sensors
that support the growing requirements for full-motion video in theater. So the product lineup at SAS is healthy across
the board. The classified business continues to be strong, and from an operational perspective, Rick Yuse and the team
out there continue to do an excellent job from a contract execution standpoint. There's nothing new from a perspective
of where we were seeing the business about six months ago.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Dave, you talked about that we were going to see a
moderation in the buyback activity as the year progressed. Is this a good run rate that you're comfortable with the
remainder of the year? Or do we see it step down further as we start to head into the risk of a CR in the sequestration?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So we've updated our full year diluted share count guidance. I'd rather not get specific on
the dollar spend on buyback. I think what's important is that we continue to have an overall balanced capital
deployment strategy. Bill and I see that as the best approach for driving shareholder value over the long term. We do
continue to see strong cash flow. We've performed well historically. If you look at the two-year average, we're still
about $2 billion a year from an operating cash flow generation standpoint on a normalized basis, and we continue to
invest in all the right areas from a company perspective. It's probably worth noting again that we did increase the
dividend in the first quarter 16% and that was our eighth consecutive dividend increase here at Raytheon.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure.

The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Bill, you mentioned allusion to what happened in the early 1990s at the last [ph] defense center
(44:54). We saw quite a lot of defense consolidation in that period. I was wondering if you had seen other people
maybe in a distressed situation looking to sell [indiscernible] (45:05) whether you might be interested in picking up
some things.
<A - William H. Swanson>: For us our M&A strategy has been about the same. We continue to pursue targets –
technologies that augment our strategic position, and we continue to pursue this strategy. For us we think it's the best
one for shareholders. The difference between now and the 1990s is the 1990s had a lot of consolidation at the top, and
our customers have been pretty explicit on what they expect on the top. The mid tier and lower tier, there hasn't been –
I think your question is more on the reflection of the prices and what's out there. I think most companies still view that
they have beachfront property and that it hasn't moved into suburban property yet.

The next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Could you give us an update on DDG 1000? I think you guys had talked about it coming
down pretty significantly this year but then ramping back up in 2013 and 2014. Is that how things still look?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. I think so. We're working with the Navy now to finish out the third ship and get that
under contract. I think that the good news is the lead ship is doing well. The software, the hardware, at least from our
end has come together nicely, and up at the shipyard they're making progress building this first ship. And all of us
associated with it feel pretty good about where it's going. We think it's a game changer. What people need to remember
is the manpower on this ship is about a third of what we're using today. So in a constrained environment having a ship
that operates with 150 personnel plus or minus a few and has the capabilities of the DDG 1000 is a good thing. And so
we can't wait for it to get in the water and do its thing. And the new CNO has spoken very highly about this ship, given
what the environment we're staring into. No change in plans other than we see a reaffirmation of what we told you by
the actions of the Navy.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Sorry. So up $100 million to $200 million for the program the next couple years?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: From where we are in 2012, I would say if you look at it over a three-year period that's
about right.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Dave, in terms of – you have this slide where you break out
sales and EPS expectations by quarter. Could you specifically comment on the fourth quarter? Obviously you're talking
about sales bouncing back there. I know the comp's easy but then it looks like you're implying a pretty low margin in
the fourth quarter. Is there anything special that's going on in the fourth quarter that would see margins drop off as far
as what you're implying?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, it's really addressed with the timing of these cost improvement actions that we had
talked about. When we began the year we had scheduled some of these to be completed as we closed out 2012, and we
were able to pull those forward into the front half of the year. So there's nothing remarkable going on from an
operational standpoint and it's really timing within the four quarters.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse North America.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: I have a couple of questions. Bill, if I could throw one to you and then one to Dave. I think
the Secretaries, Secretary Panetta met with industry leadership on Monday. Did he have a message on a one-year
sequestered delay? Meaning that is he in fact looking to shift toward near-term relief in lieu of a compromise on a more
difficult to negotiate 10-year plan?

<A - William H. Swanson>: I think the – he outlined a number of scenarios. One of those scenarios could be could we
take the time, depending on what happens in November, to be able to think through this issue. And one way to do that
is to pay down part of the first year. If you pay down part of the first year that buys you 12 months. The Secretary
would like a couple years to be able to redo the strategy to fit into the funding that this is what we're going to go do.
The problem is that, and I'll say it this way, sequester is self-imposed. We put this crisis on ourselves. It's not a natural
disaster or something that happened. We picked a date and we picked a process that was horrible to both sides.
What people haven't written about is what happens outside of DoD, what happens to Education or Labor or the State
Department of the other agencies in the government. And people have not realized that in aerospace will probably
affect about 2 million jobs out there, our own plus jobs that have the multipliers. Our economy doesn't need another
reset just when we're trying to get through this.
So the Secretary's philosophy is that we need the time to go through this thing; 24 months would be nice, but if we
could do 12 months, that gives us the time and lets us buy down part of the requirement early. So he just laid out the
various options and reiterated that this affects the industrial base as well as affecting the department. Both of them are
outcomes that he doesn't want because the strategy that we have today, he can do what he's been asked to do. You take
$55 billion out; that gets split the way it's defined, it affects him, it affects others and we need to think through this
horrible thing that we've done with sequester.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Was there any sense that this other approach is getting any traction?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes. If you go to Washington and you talk to the leadership, my take is the
preponderance if not all don't want this to happen. The real problem is when you ask what the solution is, you don't get
it, but I think more and more people are thinking through can we get to the $1.2 trillion or $1.4 trillion; if we can't get
there, can we at least get to the first year and buy it down and give us some time to think about it. And the hard part is
come November people aren't sure about the results, and so that kind of keeps everybody from doing something. And
then if you think of the period between November and January, there aren't that many working days in Congress, and
what's on their plate is a full year's worth of work that has to be done in 18 or 20 days.
So the probability of that happening isn't there, and so my opinion we're going to see a CR. CR will probably be like
last year's CR, at least that's the way we plan for it. But within that CR they can do things in an ominus bill that could
take down and pay down the first year's worth of savings that are needed. So it's still a jump ball. I wish I could tell you
the answer. All I can tell you is the discussions are more along the line that nobody wants it to happen, but I can't give
you the solution.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. Thank you. And the CR comment leads me into the question for Dave, which is – and
this came up in a prior question, which is there's a lot happening here in the back end of the year. You've got potentially
fewer days but a lot of cash flow coming. And if you could speak to that, is there any risk here that cash has difficulty
flowing out of the Pentagon and receivables billed? And if you could speak specifically to your revenue guidance on
MTS, because given the Army pressure, I'm wondering how that recovers so that you get better than half your sales in
the back end of the year.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. From a cash standpoint, we are confident with the guidance we provided this
morning. We continue to work very well with the customer, and I don't see any meaningful risk from a cash flow
guidance perspective for the back half of the year.
NCS is performing fine. We do have expectations for the back half of the year with respect to international bookings, as
well as domestic. Some of the international specifics Bill spoke to earlier. There's a C4I program that's currently being
finalized, and we expect that award here in the near term. There's virtual simulation programs that we've discussed and
some other homeland security programs. The book-to-bill, and this is important, we expect to be in the range of 1.05 to
1.1. Again, we remain confident with the guidance for NCS. Strong leadership there from Dan Crowley, and we from
an overall company perspective are very comfortable with what we addressed earlier today.

The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Dave, first a clarification question and you answered a pension question
pretty fully, but just wanted to kind of wanted detailed clarifications. The December/January slide you put out at about
$1.5 billion required pension contributions in 2013 and 2014 each. What happened to that as a result of the
transportation bill?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So the – it's difficult to speak beyond 2013 but from a gross basis, the contributions
came down in 2012 by about just under $500 million and just under $400 million or say around $400 million for 2013.
It's probably more important to see how that ultimately impacts the company. So when you take the contract
reimbursement and the after-tax basis of the contributions, the shift is an improvement of about $100 million in cash
flow for 2012 and $300 million in cash flow for 2013. So just one more note here: pension contributions from a tax
standpoint are on a different timeframe, so you address 2013 pension contributions that are made through September in
your 2012 tax return.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: And I thought that was a straightforward clarification. That's a good answer. Bill, the
real question for you is on the planning the DoD would do if they looked to submit essentially their initial qualms to
OMB for passback. What kind of scenarios are they going to get from OMB? And what kind of trial balloons rhetoric
do you expect to have to deal with over the next three to six months? Or are they simply not going to plan to the
sequestration as a scenario?
<A - William H. Swanson>: OMB has basically stated, I think, that they are not going to provide guidance until after
the election. So for us, we're going to be in I guess you might call it the Never Never Land and have to react to the
press of what's written on the subject. But until there's guidance from OMB in the interpretation of the law, then it
makes it really hard.
So from our standpoint, we've read the law, the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control Act actually goes back to
1985 for those of us that been around that long, to Gramm-Rudman, to when that was implemented. And if you look at
it, it basically says that at the controllable level at the R1s and P1s there's probably 2,500 programs that are
controllable. After that stage, probably the department has discretion. But that's my opinion, that's not OMB's opinion,
so we look at it, that's why I said it's probably a combination of a percentage cut and then it's discrete after that. But
that's Bill Swanson's opinion and OMB will tell OSD what to do.
What I think people lose sight of, and this is also my opinion, this is not a DoD issue. This is a federal issue. It's a
federal issue in the sense that it affects all the government and the cuts come out of the entire governments. DoD is just
more active because they do and have a real budgeting process that goes through this because of the size and the nature
of labor and material that they control, and other agencies don't have material, they have labor.
So the cuts will have to be interpreted in how they do it. So it is a complicated problem and my bottom line answer is I
don't expect anything on guidance until after the election. That's why I think the Hill is talking more about what do they
do and do we buy some time here so we can think through this, if that helps.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Yes, sounds great, thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
Todd Ernst
Okay. Thank you. We're going to have to leave it there. Thanks for joining this morning. We look forward to speaking
