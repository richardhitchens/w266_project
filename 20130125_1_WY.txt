Turning to our business segments; my comments reviewing the fourth quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the third
quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, charts two and three. Timberlands contributed $95 million to pre-tax
earnings, $15 million more than in Q3. Earnings from non-strategic land dispositions were $20 million, a decrease of
$5 million.
In the West, log price realizations increased 8% and volumes rose 5% driven by strong export in domestic demand.
Southern log price realizations increased 3% and volumes rose 9% as log demand began to tighten. Fee harvest
volumes were 13% higher in the South and 5% higher in the West, these increases were due to seasonal factors and
market demand.
Wood Products, charts four and five. Wood Products contributed $38 million to pre-tax earnings in Q4, $21 million
less than in third quarter. Commodity products benefited from tight inventory channels. Price realizations increased 2%
for lumber and 8% for oriented strand board. Lumber volumes were 1% higher, and oriented strand board volumes rose
6%.
Engineered wood products volumes were seasonally weak. Solid section volumes declined 12%, and TJIs 14%.
Increased log and raw material cost and maintenance downtime resulted in higher operating cost.
Cellulose Fibers, charts six and seven. Cellulose Fibers contributed $61 million to pre-tax earnings, $17 million less
than in Q3. Pulp sales-price realizations declined 2%, and sales volumes rose 6%. Liquid packaging board price
realizations declined 6%, and volumes were 7% lower due to operational issues at a production facility.
Chemicals and energy costs increased in the quarter. These cost increases were partially offset by lower maintenance
costs. During the fourth quarter, there was one scheduled maintenance outage of 6 days versus 13 days maintenance
outage in the third quarter.
Real Estate, charts eight and nine. Real Estate contributed $81 million to pre-tax earnings, $64 million more than in Q3.
Earnings from non-strategic land sales were $65 million. Earnings from single-family home sales were $16 million.
The average closing price increased to $381,000 from $372,000 in the previous quarter.
Gross margins declined to 20.2% due to mix.
The backlog of homes sold but not closed was 774 at the end of Q4, an increase of 80% from the number of homes in
the backlog at the end of 2011.
Unallocated Items, chart 10. The foreign exchange loss of $2 million in Q4 was due to a weakening of the Canadian
dollar. This was a negative swing of $13 million. The elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO was
income of $8 million, primarily resulting from lower lumber and oriented strand board inventory. This compares to an
expense of $10 million in the third quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?
Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
Over the past several years, we've laid a foundation by implementing initiatives and positioned the company to capture
the benefits of an improving U.S. housing market. 2012 marked the clear beginning of that long-term recovery.
This market improvement, together with our progress in implementing our own improvement initiatives is evident in
our fourth-quarter and annual results. Revenues rose 13% during the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year.
Our fourth-quarter earnings increased 22% over the third quarter due to strong results from our Timberlands and our
Real Estate segments. For the year, our net earnings before special items increased 78%, led by improvements within
our Wood Products business.

Our performance has improved steadily throughout the year allowing us to continue to invest in our business, pay down
debt and increase our dividend. As a result, our total shareholder return for the year was over 50%. I'm excited about
the opportunity to build on the momentum of 2012 as we enter 2013.
Before I discuss the performance of our business segments, I'll provide a brief comment on economic conditions that
affect our company. First, the U.S. housing market. The housing market certainly turned the corner in 2012. Total
starts, both single and multi-family totaled 781,000, nearly a 30% increase from 2011.
We began the year with stronger-than-normal spring selling season. This momentum continued through the fourth
quarter, when we were pleased by the surprising strength of new home sales and wood-products commodity prices. As
we've noted in many fourth-quarter reviews, both of these typically tail off at year-end.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, December housing starts jumped to a 954,000 annualized level. This is the highest level
of housing starts we've seen since June 2008. Further evidence of a strengthening market is seen in home prices, which
have increased year-over-year according to all major price indices.
Another sign of improvement may seem counterintuitive. It's the declining level of existing home sales. At this point in
the cycle, the cause is not lack of demand, but record-low levels of supply.
Uncertainty in the home mortgage market has been a drag during this recovery. However, long-awaited new rules
governing qualified mortgages add needed clarity to the process, and fence-sitting potential home-buyers are finally
moving back into the market. These changes are good for the housing industry and for the overall U.S. economy.
To help you compare your own modeling and forecasting with ours, we're planning for just over 1 million total housing
starts for 2013. Those starts are comprised of 675,000 single-family and 335,000 multi-family. This is roughly a 30%
increase over 2012 after similar percentage increases last year, but off of a higher base.
Market conditions are much improved from one year ago, though today's level of housing starts is still low by historic
standards. But we are at last on a clear path to recovery to long-term trend levels.
I'll comment briefly on global economic conditions since approximately one-third of our revenues come from exported
products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands, and Wood Products segments. Compared with conditions at the end
of the third quarter, we're slightly more optimistic.
In the Eurozone, the extreme crisis conditions of 2012 seemed to have abated, and the euro has strengthened. A
stronger euro should improve the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fibers business as well as our Asian log
exports.
The Canadian dollar remained strong, which should maintain the relative competitiveness of U.S. manufactured wood
products. This may be offset somewhat by reduced softwood-lumber tariffs.
In Japan, the new government seems ready to implement a stimulus package to jumpstart their economy. This should
increase export demand for all three of our forest products businesses. And in China, our export activity went through a
period of adjustment in 2012. During 2012, the Chinese economy slowed, while they also went through a political
change.
Export volumes for our logs, lumber and Cellulose Fibers products improved during the fourth quarter as well as for the
full year albeit at lower levels than we had seen in the more frothy days of 2011. While these markets will likely remain
somewhat volatile, we look forward to continued growth in Chinese demand.
Now, I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the fourth quarter. In Timberlands, our earnings
increased from the third quarter due to stronger domestic and export demand for our logs. Price realizations improved
as a result of domestic price increases in the West and the South and the shift in the mix in the West as the higher
percentage of our logs were exported.
Fourth quarter export shipments increased as a result of greater demand from all of our primary export markets: Japan,
China, and Korea. In addition, as I mentioned on last quarter's call, some shipments that had been scheduled for the

third quarter slipped to the fourth. Harvest volumes increased from the third quarter despite some challenging weather
conditions. Our operations were affected by high wind and rain conditions in the West during November, and wet
weather in the South at the end of the quarter. For the full year, harvest volumes increased 13% as we flexed in
response to improving market demand.
Minerals activity increased slightly during the quarter as continued softness in gas prices was offset by revenue from oil
leases in the Tuscaloosa Basin. As we look forward to 2013, we expect continued strong markets for logs and minerals
activity should remain steady.
In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter was a tale of two markets. We anticipated weaker demand for all of
our products as we moved into the late fall and in early winter months, when we typically see a seasonal slowdown.
The market surprise this year was the continued strong demand for our commodity products, lumber and OSB. This
demand was caused by tight supply channels and the increasing strength of the housing recovery.
Engineered products, which still suffer from low operating rates, did not benefit from the pricing strength of
commodity products. Fourth quarter activity for these products that are related to distribution activity was a negative
drag on the positive results in lumber and OSB. As demand improved for lumber and OSB during the quarter, we also
experienced higher manufacturing cost. We had higher cost for logs, veneer, OSB webstock, maintenance and energy.
We also incurred increased labor cost as we began to step up to meet an anticipated increase in operating postures in
2013.
We continued to focus on effective execution of performance improvement initiatives across our entire Wood Products
segment. The combined benefit of these initiatives and improved market conditions is apparent in our year-over-year
results. Fourth quarter earnings improved nearly $100 million compared with last year and annual earnings increased
over $300 million. Over half of this increase is attributable to our performance improvement initiatives.
As we enter 2013, we're well positioned to respond to the increased demand from new housing starts as well as the
repair and remodel market. We've come a long way in this business and we have more opportunity in front of us.
Moving to WRECO, we finished the year with an exceptional quarter and we're well-positioned to improve market
conditions in 2013. A notable event during the quarter was the sale of non-strategic land in San Diego, which generated
$65 million in earnings. This land, which is part of our Pacific Highlands Ranch master plan is designated for very high
density residential and mixed use. As a large-scale land developer in California, our master plans include a wide range
of land uses. Sale of these properties is consistent with our long-term strategy and intent.
Let me turn to our single-family homebuilding business. Earnings from our single-family homebuilding business were
comparable to the third quarter as single-family margins declined primarily as a result of mix. The encouraging news
from this year's fourth quarter was that our home sales increased nearly 40% from one year ago. This quarter marked a
significant turnaround for our markets in Southern California and Las Vegas.
Our Pardee president described the change as though someone turned on a switch. For the quarter, our California sales
were up over 80% over last year, and Las Vegas sales nearly tripled. This long-awaited California recovery is good
news for WRECO, but it's also a strong signal of future opportunity for our Western Wood Products and Timberland
businesses.
At yearend, all WRECO indicators point to improving buyer sentiment. Our backlog is up 80% year-over-year. The
average home price in backlog is 13% greater than one year ago. Our traffic count was up over 60% in December
compared with last year. And our cancellation rate through the year was the lowest since 2004.
With this improving momentum, we'll be opening a significant number of new communities during the year, which will
enable us to meet our growing demand. New communities allow us to present a fresh new face to our customers to
capture the emerging enthusiasm of buyers. Many of these new communities will be opened during the first half of the
year capitalizing on this year's spring selling season.
My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers segment. Cellulose Fibers segment earnings declined from
the third quarter. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased fluff pulp realizations and lower than anticipated

earnings from our liquid packaging business. Worldwide pulp inventories declined during the second half of the year.
Prices now seem to be stabilizing as we move into the new year. As I noted earlier, improvement in the Eurozone and
government action in Japan may improve market conditions for us in 2013.
In addition to our core Cellulose Fibers products of fluff pulp, NBSK, and liquid packaging board, innovative specialty
products continue to provide opportunity for us to differentiate our products and improve margins.
Sales volumes of our Pearl product to China continued to increase. In Poland, we've begun production trials of our
crosslink modified fiber product. We're on track to enter full production in the second half of the year. Longer term, we
expect that our new THRIVE cellulose-based composite product will open new markets for us.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook – first quarter outlook, I'm sorry, and
provide financial highlights.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year.
Well, we are looking forward to 2013, but as Dan said, I will focus my comments primarily on the first quarter of the
year. So, the outlook for the first quarter of this year is summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin the discussion with
Timberlands.
Export markets in the West are expected to continue to improve throughout the quarter. Log demand from our Japanese
customers is strong, as a result of the improving housing market in Japan, and the supportive stance of the new
government to implement policies to encourage growth.
China log demand is expected to start somewhat slower due to the Chinese New Year Holiday period in February, but
then continue an upward trend later in the quarter as residential and commercial construction kicks up. As a result,
export prices are anticipated to increase during the quarter. Stronger export demand as well as an improved domestic
lumber market have also contributed to rising prices in the domestic log market.
In the South, realizations for logs are expected to be slightly lower due to a smaller diameter log size. Fee volume will
be seasonally lower primarily in the South and may also be affected by recent wet weather logging restrictions. Before
the effect of non-strategic land sales, we expect that earnings in the Timberlands segment for the first quarter will be
comparable to the fourth quarter. Earnings from non-strategic land sales will be lower, likely less than half of the $20
million earned in the fourth quarter. As a result, overall earnings in the Timberlands segment will likely be lower in the
first quarter compared to the fourth.
In Wood Products, market conditions for the first quarter are anticipated to be strong as the housing recovery continues
on an upward path. We expect volumes to increase across all product lines. Sales realizations for lumber and OSB are
expected to improve and engineered wood products realizations will likely be flat due to mix. We have announced
price increases for engineered wood products beginning in March, but most of the effect will be in the second quarter.
Log costs are rising especially in the West as the demand for export logs increases and the seasonal risk of
weather-related restrictions is greater. Unit manufacturing costs should be lower as operating rates improve in response
to increased demand and less holiday downtime.
In engineered wood products, the benefit of higher operating rates will be mostly offset by higher input costs especially
for OSB, which is used for webstock.
Given the strong market and our continued emphasis on operational improvements, we expect earnings in the Wood
Products segment will increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth. In Cellulose Fibers, sales
realizations for both pulp and liquid packaging are expected to increase slightly with a modest decline in pulp sales
volume.

The biggest variance in earnings compared to the fourth quarter will be in the area of maintenance. We expect to have
approximately $20 million more maintenance expense in the first quarter as a result of an increase in the number of
annual shutdown days, as well as a number of major maintenance projects. As we've discussed on prior calls, we are
preparing for a transition to longer time between planned shutdowns moving from a 12-month schedule to 18 months.
We expect maintenance expense for the full year of 2013 to be similar to 2012 as we begin to implement this change,
which should be fully in place by 2014. Progress on the startup of our Poland converting facility is on track, as we
continued the qualification process. We expect that overall earnings in the Cellulose Fibers segment will be lower in
the first quarter, compared to the fourth.
Home sales in our Real Estate segment have continued at a robust pace. Typically, we would not expect activity to pick
up until after the Super Bowl. However, as Dan mentioned, we are seeing increased activity in most of our markets on a
year-over-year comparison. Although it is early in the quarter, sales for the first three weeks of this year are up 125%
compared to last year. These sales will become closings later in the year.
At the end of 2012, our community count declined to 62 open communities as sales activity was brisk. At the end of the
first quarter, we anticipate our community count will increase to approximately 80 communities.
Our plan for community openings could change depending on market dynamics. We expect to close fewer homes in the
first quarter, compared to the fourth, as the first quarter is traditionally the weakest quarter for closings.
In the fourth quarter, we closed 842 homes and expect that number to decline to just over 500 closings this quarter.
However, it is a sizeable increase over the 349 closings we had in the first quarter of 2012. Margins should be
comparable to the fourth quarter at just over 20% and approximately 3% higher than the first quarter of 2012.
Selling cost will decrease during the quarter as a result of fewer closings and G&A cost should be lower as we will not
see the year-end catch up for incentive comps that affected cost in the fourth quarter.
We expect Real Estate segment results from our single-family homebuilding business in the first quarter to be slightly
profitable and increase over the loss of $8 million in the first quarter of 2012.
Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. We ended the year with cash of just under $900 million,
strong cash flow from operations, as well as the receipt of cash associated with the maturity of a timber monetization
note from 2002 were the major contributors.
Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter including Timberlands' reforestation approximated $66 million. The total for
the full year of 2012 was $285 million, and in 2013, we expect to spend a similar amount.
We ended the year with total debt of $4.3 billion. In 2013, we have debt maturities of just over $400 million, $156
million of which will be paid in the first quarter. Following our 2013 maturities, we will not have any significant debt
payments until 2017. In addition, our $1 billion credit facility has no borrowings outstanding.
I'll close with some comments regarding our benefit plans. At the end of 2012, the underfunded status of our pension
and other post retirement benefit plans increased by just over $400 million on a GAAP basis. This increase was driven
by the lowering of discount rates. For example, in the U.S. qualified pension plan, our largest plan, the discount rate
declined from 4.5% to 3.7%. The negative effect of this change in discount rate was to increase the plan's liability by
over $540 million. Declines in discount rates have a significant effect on a plan's funded status. For example, if the
discount rate was 5.4%, which was the rate in effect just two years ago, this plan would be in an overfunded status.
Cash contributions for all of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans in 2012 was $145 million. We expect a
similar amount in 2013. The expense for these plans in 2012, excluding special items, was approximately $80 million.
In 2013, we anticipate total expense of $98 million, $64 million is for normal service cost, which will be charged to the
business segments and $34 million is non-operating expense, which will be included in unallocated items.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.

Daniel S. Fulton
Thanks, Patty.
Since 2008, we've had a steady drive to sharpen our focus on our core businesses and improve our competitiveness. We
committed to improve profitability despite challenging market conditions and to maintain this discipline when the
markets eventually recovered.
I commented at the beginning of my remarks that we've laid a foundation that positions us to capture the full benefits of
an improving U.S. housing market and an improving global economy. The evidence is now in that we're in the midst of
a housing recovery. As the market improves, we'll have the opportunity to grow, increasing timber harvesting, wood
products manufacturing, and community development and homebuilding.
In our Cellulose Fibers business, we'll continue to grow with our global customers as we are doing in Poland. With this
increased activity, we'll face challenges, such as the availability and cost of skilled labor, inflationary pressure on
manufacturing input costs, and increasing land and materials costs. We're confident in the ability of our talented teams
to meet the opportunities that an improving market brings and we're absolutely committed to maintain the discipline
that has brought us through this unprecedented period.
And now, we welcome your questions and your comments. Kathy?
Kathryn F. McAuley
Yes. Brent, would you please open the floor to questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Gail.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: I guess, starting off within WRECO. Can you talk a little bit about what sort of mix
changes might come with the increase in community count because it seemed like 2012 mix was a little bit weak.
Would you expect to see that shift a little bit or remain kind of where it was in 2012?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, the mix is dynamic. In talking about the fourth quarter mix, Gail, we had in the fourth
quarter an increased percentage of homes that are affordable dwellings. We had talked about that on our last call. These
affordable units come with an overall master plan approval process. That was in the Washington D.C. market. And then
we had a shift between third and fourth quarter away from higher percentage of sales in closings in San Diego to other
markets.
So we would expect, as we look at the first quarter, as Patty commented, we expect the mix to be about the same. We
have adjusted our product in every single market in response to evolving market conditions. And we've had significant
response in the Inland Empire area of California in developing a new more affordable product. But in other markets,
we've actually moved up market because that's where the demand has been in the last year to 18 months.
As the overall market conditions improve, we will continue to find the opportunities where we have the greatest margin
potential. With all of these new community openings, we have opportunities to adjust our product mix. And so, what
we will do throughout the year is try to give you some guidance on how we would expect that mix to be changing from

quarter-to-quarter.
But as we look from 2012 to 2013, we should not expect a significant mix shift other than this resurgent demand from
California can have a positive impact on us as we move throughout the year. It takes some time for those sales to
convert to closings. But we have good visibility as we look out in the houses that are in our backlog, we know what
those margins should be, and I think we'll just continue to update you on a quarterly basis.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And – can I sneak one more in?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, okay.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Log price developments, can you help us understand kind of the developments that you saw
in the fourth quarter and currently how much might have been due to weather and how much you think is due to true
underlying kind of supply demand tightness because it does seem like in both the West and the South there were
weather impacts?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: There was a little bit more weather impact in the fourth quarter in the West than there was in
the South. In the first quarter, likely they will have more weather conditions that'll impact us because of wet weather.
What we are seeing in the log market is the impact of some recovery in U.S. housing, both in the West and in the
South. And in the West, continued increase in demand for exports. So, we expect some upward pressure on log prices.
We have weather events every quarter that may impact us a bit, but, I think, generally, we would expect that the impact

Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Two general areas of questions, one in Wood and one in
Real Estate piggybacking on Gail, I guess, in Wood Products, Dan, inflation offset a lot of the pickup in revenue that
you saw in the segment. I guess that's to be expected this time in the cycle. If we look out the next year or so, would
you anticipate that your realization should be at least able to keep up with inflation? And then, taking a different take
on it, if we hold raw materials and pricing constant, what kind of incremental margin do you expect you should be able
to see out of Wood Products over the next one to two years?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: What we would expect is that, as the market recovers, we certainly have different products.
We have our lumber business, we have our OSB business and we have engineered wood products. As market demand
picks up, there is pressure on log prices and so, the relative margin between logs and lumber shifts over time or logs
and oriented strand board, but more related to logs. The impact in our engineered business comes through, as you
noted, OSB input cost. So, I can't answer your question specifically because it's a function of what supply is available
on the market for logs and what production capacity comes back online in the Wood Products business. It is that
dynamic of supply and demand and it's a function of production capability across the system.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: All right.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: So, quite frankly, I can't give you a specific number as I look out a couple of years.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: So, if we...
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: What we believe is that with a recovering market in the U.S., we should see increased demand
for Wood Products, which will then translate to demand and ultimately pricing on logs. Plus, in on our case, we have
significant export market off the West Coast and that plays into the pricing dynamic also.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: George, the other thing that you saw in those margins in Wood Products in the fourth
quarter was we had some downtime for the holidays and downtime for maintenance and implementing some capital
projects. So, as we see utilization rates improve, that will significantly impact that margin going forward as well.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. I'll leave that general area to the side for now. If we switch to WRECO, it was nice
to see the increase in pricing in the backlog. Can you speak to what's been driving that, is that what you're seeing in
California or Las Vegas? And I guess again just back to Gail's question, you had called out the mix issue in the fourth
quarter and you were more or less what we had expected you, but also it seemed like Las Vegas, Nevada were stronger
than we would have expected in the fourth quarter regionally, broadly, not just Weyerhaeuser specific and I'm curious
why you didn't see more of a mix effect in the quarter? Thanks and good luck in the first quarter.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thanks, George.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: You're talking about sales prices, which don't translate into the quarterly closing numbers and
so there's a lag, George, when we write those sales and when they are delivered.
We were encouraged and have been encouraged not just by the fourth quarter, but as Patty noted, sales early this year
had been very strong, which is atypical. We joke a bit about the Super Bowl being a turning point in the early year
selling season. So this year is a bit of an anomaly. We're seeing prices moving up in every single market for
similar-type products. So that is – that is not even addressing the mix issue as to whether or not it's a first time product
or a move-up product where there maybe some additional pricing power.
So, we think that what's happening is certainly the existing inventory has diminished significantly. Home buyers are
going back into model complexes and making the commitment to buy new homes in part because they have more
confidence in the economy, in their jobs and they can obviously see that the market is [ph] bottomed (37:05) and there's
more likelihood of upward pricing movement, as well as perhaps some uncertainty about where mortgage rates are.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: So the backlog price increase was broad not region specific, is that what you're saying?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Yes.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Chip.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: First question is just to make sure I get this right. On the pension funding status, I believe last
year it was about $1.1 billion under, and so you're saying based on the discount rate change it should be about $1.5
billion, $1.6 billion?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah. As you look at the total underfunded status for the pension plans as you said, this
would be for the U.S. plan as well as our nonqualified plan, we were, I think, about $1.150 billion, and at the end of
this year that will increase by about little over $400 million.

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: That's just for the pension, Chip, that doesn't include the other post-retirement benefit
plans, but if you're talking just pension those were the right numbers.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Well, actually on that, I noticed that drop from about $0.5 billion to $400 million from 2010 to
2011. Did that change the other things that much in 2012 or did they stay flat?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: When you say the other things...
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: The other post-retirement benefits.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yeah, they were fairly flat. The biggest change was in the pension plan.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay, that's great. And then one quick one in addition, when you go back in past cycles you can
see – and I know the footprint is different, but you often see a pretty substantial seasonal or often have increase in the
operating income in the Wood Products segment. And as you know, prices today are way above their fourth quarter
averages and notwithstanding the, I guess, last night's report that there might have been a little bit of a back off in
lumber. I mean could we see a triple-digit operating income number in the Wood Products segment, is that what you
mean by significant?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, when I say significant, Chip, remember we're talking about the first quarter when
you talk about a triple-digit, but that's what we're working toward.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Got you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, it will be a multiple of the fourth quarter and pretty close to that triple-digit.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Dan, just one question. Two years ago at Investor Day, you talked about the opportunity
from being long land in your homebuilding business and the opportunity to sell land to homebuilders that were short.
Has that process met your expectations and is it reasonable for us to assume that we would see a significant ramp in
that kind of activity in 2013?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Our strategy has not changed, Mark. And we have – we are not long land everywhere, but we
are long in certain markets, especially where entitlement processes reward a longer land position.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Sure.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Where we have master plans, we have the ability to not only build those lots, but sell to
others. We took advantage of that more in 2011 than we did in 2012.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Right.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: In 2011, there was a resurgence of activity, builders found themselves to be lot short, and we
took advantage of that in certain regional markets. We look for opportunities in those master plans where we have
excess land to sell to others on a profitable basis. We did some of that earlier this year or in 2012 when we sold the
Cross Creek Ranch property in Houston, and so we have that opportunity in front of us, and we'll look for opportunities
where we have pricing and margin potential to take advantage of that as compared to building out those lots ourselves.

Your next question comes from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Hi, good morning. Can you talk about how the company thinks about refinancing the 2013
maturities, and whether we should look for potential new issuance in the public bond market or whether Weyerhaeuser
would prefer to pay it down with cash?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Carly. It's still early in the year, but what we have said in the past is that we think
that $4 billion of debt is about the right amount of debt for the size of the company today, we've been working that
down. So, when we pay off our 2013 maturities we'll be right at maybe just a little below that target. So, I think the
point will be what other uses we may have for any additional debt in the future, but where we are right now we have
said in the past and that would still be our view that around $4 billion in debt is the right amount for the size that we are
today.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up question, have you had discussions with the rating
agencies about, and particularly Moody's, about your – the high BB rating that Weyerhaeuser has? And how does
Weyerhaeuser think about the difference between being a crossover credit or a full investment grade credit? Has that
view changed at all?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, Carly, we have ongoing conversations with both rating agencies as you might well
imagine, and we have historically been an investment grade rated company from both rating agencies, and Moody's
moved us down years two ago when the markets in wood products especially were much more challenged than they are
today. So, we'll look forward to moving back into that investment grade area at Moody's given the increase in the
profitability and cash generation of the company, but I'll have to wait for them to make that move.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Alex.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: In the Wood Products business, can you just provide more color around what the impact was from
the maintenance downtime during the fourth quarter?
And then as we look to 2013, is there any color you can provide on how we should be thinking about the change in the
maintenance expense as you work our way through the year? I think in the pulp business in the past, you've been kind
enough to provide that type of color, and to the extent that you can in the Wood Products business, that will be very
helpful.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Alex. As we think about the seasonality in the business in the fourth quarter, we
typically plan to be down implementing – that's when we target to do our capital-project implementation and we plan
maintenance. So it was more a quarterly statement as opposed to an ongoing piece, as you think about the first quarter
and second and third quarters.
So I don't think there's anything big about that that's different. It's just that the market was very much stronger in
lumber and OSB especially. And we probably didn't take as much downtime – we didn't take as much downtime as we
typically would in a normal year. Most of that would've come as well in Engineered Wood, where the operating rates

And then did you have a question about sale of fibers?
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: No, just the question really was if you guys can just put out a number for what the maintenance
expense was in the Wood Products business for the fourth quarter, relative to the third quarter? How that changed?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes, I don't have a number for you and the actual maintenance for the fourth quarter for
Wood Products. Let me see if we can pull something together, and maybe you can check back with Kathy.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Okay. And just a follow-up – thanks very much. And then the follow-up question – as you know,
wood products – what does the current profitability level in that business look like? Is it EBITDA-breakeven at this
point? And as you guys look at that business over a nice couple of years, at what U.S.-housing-starts level would that
business really begin to generate meaningful profitability for the company?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, the Wood Products segment is generating cash, Alex.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Well, I'm speaking about Engineered Wood Products, not the entire segment.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Oh, okay.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Just the Engineered Wood products sub-segment.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Engineered Wood Products, in terms of the operating rate for the fourth quarter, were still
about 40% to 45% in that business. So really what we need to do is to get that operating rate up.
And as we look forward in that business, it is a late-cycle recovering business in Wood Products. In other words, of the
three technologies that we have, Engineered Wood Products, because it is more exposed to single family housing – or
new housing, rather, as opposed to repair and remodel – it recovers a little bit later in the cycle.
I can tell you that, as you might know, the builder show is going on this week. And the talk at the builder show is
concern about being able to get capacity or to get product as the cycle continues to recover.
So we look very much forward to getting to that point. And I think as we move forward to increase housing starts, as
Dan mentioned in his outlook, that we will see much improved results in that business.

Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Just following up on the sale of lots. Given San Diego has historically been one of your
stronger regions from a margin perspective, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the decision to sell that
land rather than develop it yourself. And to the extent you can, can you talk about where the sale sort of leaves your
land position in San Diego?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Sure. Anthony, the property that we sold is part of a master plan in North County San Diego
called Pacific Highlands Ranch, where we have a significant number of entitled single-family lots that we would build
out over time.

That's a market, as you comment on, that has been very good to us in the past. We have high margins in our
single-family business in San Diego. But the particular land that we sold is zoned for high-density residential – I would
say very high-density. So multi-story product in mixed use.
So it is not our core product that we build. That is the kind of property that we would typically sell to other builders and
developers who specialize in it. Some of that will be rental. Some of that perhaps could be for sale, but likely more
rental housing. And so it's consistent with our strategy to sell the property that is zone for other than single-family to
others, and that was the decision.
So as we think about our land position in San Diego and our lot count, doesn't affect really our lot count at all, because
it's not a product that we would build. And so it's totally consistent with the way we manage that business.
The good news is that multi-family market has been very strong, and so it was an opportune time to sell it. The
purchasers of that property will still have to go through some of their own entitlement process over a one-to-two-year
period before they break ground.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just maybe one last one, switching to Timberlands. I'm
wondering how much your log exports to China were up or down year-over-year in 2012. And as you look forward to
2013, from a volume perspective, do you expect kind of a meaningful change in log exports to China?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: For the year, our export volume to China was up. We expect it to increase as we go forward
into 2013.
The mix that we've talked about in the past is not significantly changed. So about 70% of our exports go to Japan,
roughly 20% China, and the balance to Korea.
And as we look forward to full-year 2013, I can't give you specific numbers on what the China volume is, because it's
not that predictable. But we see recovering demand, and we expect to be in a position to be delivering logs there, as
well as into our traditional markets of Japan and Korea.
We have seen a pick-up in activity in Japan. That's generally a more profitable market for us. They buy higher-quality
logs. We have much longer-term relationships. But the relationships that we built to China are encouraging for us. And
so we see it as an opportunity.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Dan, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about sort of your positioning in the Wood
Products business. It seems like over the last few months, we started to not only see a pick-up in housing and building
products activity, but we started to see more M&A with the GP deal and then this Interfor deal that was announced the
other day. I'd like to get a sense of how you feel about your footprint in the business.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, we've seen that activity, Mark. And I would say it's not surprising. As the market starts
to pick up, you'd expect to see some more of that activity.
We like the position that we have. So we have good balance in our lumber business between the west and the south. As
the market picks up, especially in California, we're excited about the opportunity to see improvement in our western
lumber system.
OSB business, we've got six mills that are operating. We've increased production in that business over the last year.
And we're moving, even as we speak into 2013, to increasing operating posture. I think in the fourth quarter, we were

operating at about a 85% level in OSB. We expect that to increase. So we're well-positioned to serve both the southern
and the western markets.
The Engineered Wood products, Patty talked about it. It is a late-cycle business. We've got the leading brand in that
business with our Trust Choice brand, and if single-family housing picks up, the opportunity there is that we do have a
lot of operating leverage because we are operating at well less than capacity today, but we're positioned in the west and
in the east to serve the broad needs of recovering single-family as well as the multi-family sector.
As we look forward, there's still some question about the relative mix between singles and multis. As we move
forward, I'm wondering whether there's change in patterns and increasing density. But we like the position that we have
in every one of those products.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Would you want to expand in any of these businesses?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We look at opportunities. And fundamentally, as we look at opportunities, it's a function of
how it would fit with our existing system and in relative financial opportunities.
So I think we're active all the time in looking, but we have no immediate plans that we're prepared to discuss.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. Just as a follow on...
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: But I think it's fair to say that our focus really is on improving the operations that we have,
and we aren't operating the operations that we have today at full capacity. So we have room to continue to grow the
business with the existing facilities that we have. So that's really our focus.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay, that's fine. Can you just mention where you're at, in terms of kind of maximizing with
kind of oil and gas and mineral revenue from the land? And you do have a lot of land down in Louisiana, and I just – I
wonder where you're at in terms of extracting all of the subsurface value that you might from your holdings.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Our average earnings over the last year or so have been about $10 million a quarter – revenues
coming from our minerals operation.
There's been a bit of a shift in mix, Mark, between oil and gas. If we were to go back three to four years ago, when the
gas shale activity took off, I think our minerals business at that point was generating about $60 million. Some of that
was coming from these upfront lease payments as well as royalty payments. So on a steady-state basis for the next 12
months or so, I think $10 million a quarter is probably a predictable number.
Production levels are down in that business because of prices today for natural gas. Drilling costs for shale oil have
been relatively high. We have land that's well-positioned, both in Haynesville Shale gas area and the Tuscaloosa oil
shale region.
So we have active drilling going on in our properties. And I think it's really a function of pricing of the end products for
oil and gas that will dictate how much additional activity there'd be in the next 12 months.

upward – just overall Wood Products production up throughout the year?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Well, when we talked about it in – I mentioned briefly with respect to OSB, we're increasing
our operating posture. And we have been doing some hiring, bringing people back to work in order to add shifts. As the
market expands for lumber, we have the same ability to add hours, and in some cases to add shifts.
So we respond both to demand, but primarily pricing. And over the past 12 months, most of the hiring that we have
done in the company has been production employees that we've been putting back to work, in order to be able to ramp
up and respond to the increased opportunities for Wood Products.
In WRECO, our general staffing level has been relatively stable. As we add communities, we would certainly add
production superintendents and sales teams. But in the WRECO business in particular, most of the activity is
subcontractor-based, and so it doesn't have a significant impact on our head count.
Did that answer your question, or did you have a different focus to your question?
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: No, no, I think that's helpful. When we look at the Timberlands business, you guys had
mentioned also – and it seems like the southern log harvest went up pretty nicely in the fourth quarter. How much
below, I guess, sustainable harvest or how much above your sustainable harvest could you harvest in the coming years,
if there was a very strong recovery? And what could those levels go to from where they are today?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: During the recession, we went through a period of a couple of years where we took our
harvest levels down. And we have been bringing them back over the last two to three years. So you've seen a fairly
significant ramp-up in harvest activity 2011, 2012.
We are managing our Timberlands on a sustainable basis. Over the next 12 to 24 months, you should not expect to see
significant increase in harvest activity because we are operating today at a sustainable level.
In any given market situation, we have the ability to flex a bit, say plus or minus 10%. It's a little bit – it takes a little bit
longer to increase in the west because of road requirements and permit requirements. But we have shared projections in
the past – in our May conference – of long-term harvest levels, in terms of how that would ramp up over time. That's a
more of a function of the maturity of the timber rather than responding to specific market conditions.
So we have some limited ability to flex short term, as we've done in the last year or so. So we'll respond to market
conditions.
<Q - Joshua A. Barber>: Okay. That's helpful. Patty, you touched on the pension obligation and how that went up on
a GAAP basis. Could you give us – I know that may not be finalized yet, but could you give us an idea of where that
went on a PBO basis at year-end?

revenue from a taxable jurisdiction into an untaxable jurisdiction?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The latter is not the case. We sell logs to our lumber business or conversion businesses at
market. The difference in pricing is more likely a function of our Japanese trade, Steve, and the quality of the logs and
the long-term relationships that we have with customers there, where we are being rewarded for the quality of the logs
and the consistency of delivery over a long period of time. And I think we have that same opportunity emerging in
China because of the quality of our fiber, the predictability and sustainability on the logistical side. I think we're fairly
compensated for the value that we deliver.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Perfect. And one other quick one. Across the WRECO footprint, do you feel that you have a
need to reload your land position anywhere across that, in any of your geographies?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We are always purchasing new land in our WRECO system to replace the lots that we are
selling with the houses that were delivered. So, that is just an ongoing function of managing a pipeline of future lots.
We are very strategic in where we have a land position, the length of that position varies by market depending upon the
challenge of entitlements and how we are able to control it. So, our focus is on efficient management of our cash,
allocation of resources within that business to, number one, be sure that we have a pipeline, but also ensure that we are
earning maximum possible returns on use of our capital. So, it is a region-by-region decision, but in fact we are always
in the market looking for lot positions for future deliveries.
<Q - Steven Chercover>: Great, well thanks for taking my call. I'm glad that the cycle is moving in your favor.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: Thank you.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thanks, Steve.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thanks Steve. Next question?

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: You talked about housing starts potentially being up 30% this year. And I wanted to
understand what type of flexibility you have in your lumber business in particular, given that potential. If one were to
assume that might mean lumber demand, and if you have a different view on this, please share. But let's say lumber
demand might be up about 15% or so, would you expect to have the capability in your system to increase your
production by at least 15%? You talked about having already started that process and where are you in that process,
how much increased production have you already started to achieve?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: We've had a steady increase in production as the market has begun to recover. In our Lumber
business in the fourth quarter, we're operating at about an 80%, maybe mid-80%s production rate, so we have room to
move beyond that in response to increased market demand.
Also in the Lumber business, Mark, our typical shift posture is two shifts. And so, we have the ability to add hours to
those shifts on a selected basis and we have the ability, in some cases, to add an entire shift. We've got one facility in
Cottage Grove, Oregon that operates 24/7. That's not typical in the Lumber business.
But we do have a fair amount of flexibility in lumber to respond, and the response obviously comes from not just
volume, but we have to look at where customers are and what pricing is. And so, at the level of starts that we are at
today, we've got a fair amount of room. As I pointed out, the level of starts in 2012 is very low by historic standards.
We've got a lot of room to move between now and getting back to trend levels which were sort of $1.5 million to $1.7
million.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: I guess what I'm trying to understand is that given your view of the world, presumably,
you're positioning yourself to be able to produce a good deal more product this year. And what I'm – I'm trying to

understand whether or not those actions have already been taken and we are already seeing that production or whether
you are in the process of taking those actions and the increased production will show up in a month, two months, three
months.
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: The increased production should show up as demand increases, so we're not producing excess
inventory and we're not producing inventory of prices that don't give us the margins that we think are appropriate. So
we have the ability to respond as the market picks up. There's some delayed response. It's a little bit longer-term
response when we're ramping up, let's say, adding an entire shift to an OSB mill. That takes a little bit longer time. And
so we've gone through some of that activity over the last year in our Wood Products business, but more likely related to
our OSB facilities.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: So basically, you feel that you can be very quickly responsive and so you do not
necessarily need to be building log decks getting more worked out, you don't have to like plan a month or two ahead of
time just so I can understand?
<A - Daniel S. Fulton>: No, we're always planning ahead of time. So we have actually fairly robust staffing plans
where we look out at potential demand and we're filling those positions, but I can't give you specifics on a by-mill
basis. We are – the head count that we've increased over the last year, as I mentioned, has primarily been related to
Wood Products production.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Mark, when you think about lumber, we don't have huge log decks. We don't carry a huge
log deck in our supply chain. So, the things that – and that's just a function of the way that we operate on an efficient
basis. So, the things that would provide hiccups in that to being able to meet that demand are more things like, if we
were to have a weather-related event in the west that would drive out-of-log downtime. So it's not – if you go back a
few years and you think – and some competitors still do today, carry a lot of inventory in the yard. We have really
worked on our supply chain between our Timberlands business and our Lumber business, so that we can respond as
market conditions do increase.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Okay. Thanks so much.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes.
<A - Kathryn F. McAuley>: Thank you, Mark. And we have time for one question.

Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Hey. Thanks very much for taking the question. Nice to squeak in there. Just a easy question,
just on log pricing, looks like prices are up in the Pacific Northwest and I can understand the sort of the rally in Japan
in events of tax hikes in 2014 and higher Chinese demand. I'm really concerned with the log prices in the South. And if
I look at it historically, I mean it seems to be a correlation of, after six months of a lumber price hike or six to 12
months, you've seen log prices come up. And we've seen that gap expand out and lumber prices are up sort of 30% to
40% year-over-year. So, the question is, when do you expect the log prices to start to move up significantly or
materially in the U.S. South?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Paul, we are starting to see log prices move up in the South, so I would say more on a
modest basis. Our own sales realizations for logs in the Timberlands segment, as I spoke to, will actually be down just
slightly, but that's really more a function of the diameter size of the logs that we're logging this quarter, and that's not
atypical for us. We're looking at settings that we can access, especially as it relates to this wet weather. So, that's just an
isolated incident. But we would expect saw log prices to start to move more significantly in the South as we go through
the year, assuming that would be our assumption that housing continues to recover.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Thanks. Good luck.
