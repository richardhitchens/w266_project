       " 'Jeanette Ourada, General Manager, Investor Relations': \"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 4, I will compare results of the second quarter 2010 with the first quarter 2010. As a reminder, our earnings release compares second quarter 2010 with the same quarter a year ago. Second quarter earnings increased about 850 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were 180 million lower due to unfavorable tax charges and higher OpEx, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency variance. Second quarter downstream results saw significant improvement of nearly 780 million. Earnings benefited from stronger U.S. margins, favorable foreign currency and timing variances, as well as the absence of first quarter charges related to planned employee reductions. The other bar largely reflects a favorable swing in corporate tax items and lower corporate charges. On Slide 5, our U.S. upstream earnings for the second quarter were 66 million lower than the first quarter's results. Realizations in the second quarter were down 95 million. Natural gas realizations drove the decline, dropping 24%, slightly higher than the 20% decline in Henry Hub spot prices. U.S. crude oil realizations were essentially flat between quarters. Lower production volumes decreased earnings by 40 million between periods, primarily due to down time and normal field declines in the Gulf of Mexico. The other bar represents a benefit of 69 million, which is comprised of a number of unrelated items, including lower DD&A rates and exploration expenses. Turning to Slide 6, international upstream earnings were down 116 million compared with the first quarter. Higher realizations benefited earnings by 70 million. Liquids realizations rose 2% between quarters, in line with the increase in average Brent spot prices. Natural gas realizations were a slight offset, declining 5% between periods. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by 210 million. First quarter results included a 100 million loss that was effectively offset by a 110 million gain in the second quarter. An unfavorable swing in tax items across multiple jurisdictions decreased earnings 220 million. Second quarter charges of about 120 million effectively offset a 100 million earnings benefit in the first quarter. OpEx increased 120 million in the second quarter, which included higher turnaround costs in Kazakhstan and Canada. The other bar reflects higher exploration expenses and DD&A rates. Slide 7 summarizes the quarterly change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production. Production decreased 37,000 barrels per day between quarters. Price changes had a modest effect on volumes under production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts in the second quarter, about 3,000 barrels per day. Base business production decreased 47,000 barrels per day between quarters, largely due to planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan and Canada, partially offset by higher demand-driven production in Thailand. Incremental production from major capital projects increased second quarter production by 13,000 barrels per day, primarily driven by the continued ramp-up at Frade in Brazil. George will discuss our current year production outlook in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 8, U.S. downstream earnings improved 350 million in the second quarter. Indicator margins strengthened between quarters, increasing earnings by 170 million. Refining margins improved from the depressed levels of the last several quarters. Actual margin capture from advantageous crude mix and product yields increased earnings by an additional 90 million. Chemical results were 50 million higher, mainly due to improved margins for olefins and aromatics. The absence of an employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter benefited earnings by 50 million. The other bar is a negative variance of 9 million. On Slide 9, international downstream earnings also improved significantly, increasing about 430 million from first quarter's results. Margins were 45 million higher, with improvements in Europe partly offset by declines in Asia. A favorable swing in foreign currency effects benefited earnings by 230 million. First quarter included a 100 million loss compared to a 130 million gain in the second quarter. Timing effects represented a 155 million positive variance between quarters, reflecting favorable mark-to-market effects on derivatives tied to underlying physical positions. WTI prices dropped about $8 per barrel from the beginning to the end of the quarter. The absence of a 100 million employee severance charge recorded in the first quarter also benefited earnings. The other bar is comprised of several unrelated items, including planned maintenance impacts at our Cape Town refinery in South Africa. Slide 10 covers all other. Second quarter net charges were 108 million compared to a net 368 million charge in the first quarter, a decline of 260 million between quarters. A favorable swing in corporate tax items resulted in a 220 million variance. Corporate charges were lower in the second quarter and included the absence of a 25 million severance charge related to workforce reductions recognized earlier in the year. We believe our quarterly guidance range of 250 to $350 million for net charges in the all other segment is still appropriate going forward. George is now going to provide an update on our Upstream business. George? George Kirkland, Executive Vice President, Global Upstream & Gas Thank you, Jeanette. It's good to be back to discuss upstream performance and our production outlook for the remainder of the year. I'm very pleased with our progress at the first half of 2010, especially around our safety and production performance. Let's begin by looking at our second quarter competitive position on earnings margins. Please turn to Slide 12. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per barrel were $19.50, over $3 higher than our nearest competitor. In the second quarter, upstream margins were $18.74, another excellent quarter, reinforcing the strength of our oil-weighted portfolio and the quality of the new projects we're bringing online. Based on competitor results disclosed this week, we have sustained our competitive advantage. We led our nearest competitor by over $4 per barrel this quarter, and this is our fourth consecutive quarter in the top position on this metric. Now I'll turn to production. Please turn to Slide 13. Our first half production averaged 2.76 million barrels a day at an average WTI price of $78 per barrel. At the fourth quarter call in January, we set full-year production guidance at 2.73 million barrels a day, based on the 2009 actual price of $62 a barrel. Using the same price basis, our year to date production would be 60,000 barrels a day higher than the original guidance. Remember, a portion of our net production is sensitive to price through entitlements. At current oil prices, this is about 2,000 barrels a day for every dollar price change. Our full-year production outlook at year-to-date prices of $78 per barrel is 2.75 million barrels a day, almost 2% higher than 2009 levels. At $62 per barrel, this translates to 2.78 million barrels a day or about 3% growth, significantly higher than our original guidance of 1%. The higher growth forecast is driven by stronger base business performance, our focus on reliability and system optimization, as well as increased gas sales in Thailand. Our annual base business decline is now estimated to be in the 4 to 5% range. Incremental production for major capital projects remains close to the original forecast. Most projects are performing as planned. Better performance has been seen at SGI/SGP in Kazakhstan, Frade in Brazil, and Mafumeira Norte in Angola. This improved performance is offset by delays at some non-operated projects, particularly Perdido in the deep water Gulf of Mexico and the first expansion of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Canada. Now please turn Slide 14. I would like to spend a moment to discuss the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf and the follow-on impact on our operations. First, our deepest sympathies go out to the families of the 11 individuals who lost their lives and also to others along the Gulf coast impacted by this tragedy. We are very pleased that this well has been successfully capped. The drilling moratorium has impacted our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations in several ways. We expect some lost production in 2010 due to permitting delays on the shelf and a slower ramp-up at Perdido. The full-year impact is expected to be less than 10,000 barrels a day. When the moratorium was implemented, we were completing a Tahiti development well and drilling the Buckskin appraisal and Moccasin exploration wells. The Tahiti well is due to come online soon, but other development drilling activity is now on hold. Buckskin and Moccasin operations are suspended, and our other two planned deepwater exploration wells are delayed, negatively impacting our 2010 exploration program. We have three deepwater rigs on contract. One is currently working for BP to assist in the spill response. The other two are on stand-by, waiting for approval to resume drilling operations. Although the longer-term impact of the moratorium remains unknown, we are focused on progressing our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Tahiti 2, Jack-St Malo, and Big Foot projects remain on track to reach FID later this year, assuming the moratorium is lifted. Chevron is a leader in safety performance and we're very confident in our abilities to safely drill and develop our deepwater projects. Our safety and environmental focus is to prevent incidents from occurring. We believe the investigations of this tragedy will show that it was preventable. We are participating in joint industry task forces, working with the national commission to determine the appropriate path forward on drilling safety, with particular attention on prevention, containment, and spill response. The Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater basins remain very important in meeting the energy demands of the U.S. and the world. A continuation of the suspension of operations in the Gulf of Mexico will reduce supply and influence energy prices. We believe the moratorium should be lifted, and we believe that deepwater drilling can be done safely and reliably. Turning to Slide 15, I'd now like to discuss some of our significant achievements during the second quarter. First, a short update on Gorgon. We continue to make good progress. Site preparations are underway, dredging has begun, the construction camp is being built, and we have awarded over $24 billion in contracts. As a reminder, we assigned sales and purchase agreements for approximately 90% of the equity LNG off-take from the Gorgon trains one through three. We recently signed a heads of agreement with Cogas for delivery of almost 2 million tons per annum of LNG from the Wheatstone project. Cogas will also acquire a 5% equity interest in the project. This is another successful step in early capture of market share for this project. We now have approximately 80% of LNG off-take from Wheatstone's train 1 and 2 tied to long-term agreements. Also in Australia, we have announced two deepwater natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin, Clio-3 and Sappho-1, moving us closer towards our goal of additional LNG trains at Gorgon and Wheatstone. I'm very pleased with our continued exploration success in Australia. In Indonesia, we sanctioned the 13th expansion of the Duri Field, where we have 100% working interest. This latest expansion will leverage existing steam and production facilities to increase production from the field by approximately 20,000 barrels a day. We made good progress in capturing new opportunities. In the unconventional shale gas area, we have captured 675,000 acres in Romania and almost 200,000 acres in Western Canada. We expect to bring – we expect to begin appraisal of the Canadian acreage by the end of 2011. As a reminder, we recently added a million acres in Poland. In Venezuela, we have formed a consortium that will work toward developing the Carabobo 3 heavy oil project in the Orinoco Belt. And in Russia, we assigned a heads of agreement with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company, to pursue a deepwater opportunity on the Shatsky Ridge in the Russian portion of the Black Sea. In summary, I'm very pleased with our accomplishments in the second quarter and the first half of this year. With that, I'd like to turn it back over to Pat. \",\n",
       " 'Patricia E. Yarrington': '',\n",
       " 'Patricia E. Yarrington, Chief Financial Officer & Vice President': \"Thank you, Shaun. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are George Kirkland, Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President of Global Upstream & Gas and Jeanette Ourada, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our focus today is on Chevron's financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2010. We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's web site. Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement here on Slide 2. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The second quarter earnings were $5.4 billion or $2.70 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2010 earnings more than tripled compared with the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2010 earnings increased 19% compared to the first quarter of 2010, which Jeanette will discuss shortly in more detail. Return on capital employed for the trailing 12 months was about 16%. The debt ratio was 9.5%, with cash balances exceeding debt balances by $2.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Jeanette will take us now through the quarterly comparisons. Jeanette? Okay. Thanks, George. Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to wrap up our prepared remarks with a recap of Chevron's strategic progress through the first half of the year. Strong operational momentum continued in the second quarter, and our safety performance remains at record levels. The Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico has heightened investor interest in operator safety and environmental record. We're very proud of our safety culture and our industry leading performance in this area. We publish historical statistics annually in our corporate responsibility report, which you can find on our website. Our businesses are continuing to run well, our major refineries are operating reliably, and upstream production efficiency remains at a high level, which contributed to our strong first half production performance. We are sustaining our cost management efforts. For the first half of the year, excluding one-time employee severance charges, operating and SG&A expenses were up 5% versus the comparable period in 2009. Half was related to higher fuel and transportation costs. The remainder is in line with a 4% production increase over the same period. As George mentioned, our upstream business is growing, and growing at an industry-leading level of profitability. He also highlighted several new opportunities that expand our set of portfolio options to continue to grow our resource base. In the downstream, we are executing our restructuring plan. Portfolio exit and market reviews are under way, and specific actions are being taken to de-cost our operations. We anticipate the new organizational structure will be in place by the end of the third quarter. The same drivers expanding upstream earnings margins are contributing to our robust cash position. After paying dividends and funding our capital program, we generated about 2 billion of cash flow in the second quarter. This strong cash flow and a low net debt position allow us to maintain our financial strength and flexibility. I'd like to close with a few words on capital intensity. It's a frequently heard question that I believe should be laid to rest. We have invested more than 60 billion in upstream in the last four years. We have brought on many capital projects during this period that grew production 7% last year alone, and production is still growing. And we have had the highest earnings per barrel now for four consecutive quarters, and the gap is large. This should be solid proof that our investments are attractive. We're expanding at the right parts of our portfolio. We are making the right choices on individual projects, and we have shown that we can profitably grow. Looking forward, we're headed into another period not unlike the last four years. We're taking on world-class projects to reap the production and cash rewards when those projects come online in the middle of the decade. We are very comfortable with this profile, as we have proven that disciplined capital intensity is a good thing, if the projects are the right projects and you can afford it. They are, and we can. Now that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take on your questions. So Shaun, I'd ask that you open the lines for questions. Thank you. \",\n",

       " \"Good morning, hopefully you can hear me okay. There's a lot of static. I guess it was a good quarter. You had favorable mortality, good morbidity, good investment results, good expense control across the board. I think if you looked at a core number, it's somewhere in the 1.10 to 1.15 range. I guess what I'm really interested in is how should we think about this level of earnings and whether we should be trending off this number or whether we should be thinking about a little bit lower number just given the level of favorability in the quarter.\": \"Hi, Mark, it's Bill. Yes, we did hear your question. I always hesitate say whether $1.11 is a good run rate or not, but I'll give you some sense of the pluses and minuses. You're right, underwriting was very strong, and so I think a lot of that is sustainable. Some of it was probably just good fortune. But I also think, by the way, like the improvements in dental underwriting margin are very sustainable. In fact, they might get better from here. And the other interesting fact is disability underwriting margins were roughly flat on a sequential quarter basis. But there's potential for a lot of improvement there as early \\x96 it may be in the third quarter, maybe not. But the guys who are very close to that business are encouraged by some of the signs they saw in the second quarter. So, certainly there are headwinds or there are things which might not be repeatable in the second quarter results, but there are further opportunities. I would also \\x96 just a couple other things to keep in mind is I think the expense picture only gets better, okay, as Operational Excellence continues to execute, though probably the drop in the equity markets at the end of the second quarter is probably a modest negative as we think about third quarter fees and the retirement business. And then finally, I think the low interest rate environment that we're in, though I don't think it will be a very large impact in terms of our operating impact, operating EPS, it will probably slice a little bit off of investment margin in the future quarters, but I think it will be very modest. So that's the color on what's sustainable and what might be in the future. And I come away from that little dialogue as currently yes, that $1.11 current run rate is a number that I think you can think about as a reasonable projection going forward. Could it be a little lower? Sure, but not materially.\",\n",
       " 'Great color, and do you want to give a little specifics or quantify that?': \"I think there's a number of things that will factor into that, including how quickly the economy recovers, and how that will impact disability. So, at this time, I don't think I'll get any more specific than what I said before.\",\n",
       " 'Great, thanks. And it was clearly a strong sales quarter, building momentum around the variable annuity product. Can you give us a sense of how much the Fidelity relationship might have contributed to that? And are there any other I guess new sales relationships that could potentially keep that momentum going?': \"Hi, John, it's Bill Mullaney. First of all, yes, we did have a good sales quarter in variable annuities. We had about a 4.5 million \\x96 or billion-dollar level of sales, which we were very pleased with. It continued to come from a broad range of channels. The traditional channels where we sell variable annuities continues to be strong. Rob did mention in his comments the Fidelity relationship, and that has continued to grow and to give us an alternative way to distribute the products. We do look and are in discussions with other potential parties that we would partner with to distribute RVAs through some alternative channels. And as those things get finalized, we'll certainly make you aware of them.\",\n",
       " 'Great. And then I guess finally, on capital, in a sense, have you guys made peace with S&P with the strong quarter and the strong book value growth?': \"We love S&P. Look, I hesitate, certainly in the public, to speak about what S&P thinks. So, they put out a research report on us, it was about a month ago I think. I thought that was a pretty accurate reflection of where they're at. And so that's, I would say, our current state of affairs with them.\",\n",
       " 'Have you received it, actually?': \"Not to my knowledge. Why, do you have some other information? No, we have not received it. I would comment just generally. Obviously, we strongly disagree with the misleading and incorrect statements, certainly the initial statements coming from the press. Subsequent to that, of course, those with correct knowledge of the situation, including the National Organization of  Life Guaranty Association , the NAIC, the ACLI, we and other insurance companies have provided a lot of well written clarifications. And I would say that certainly most of you on the call have made very clear that you understand how the accounts function, and I think you've provided a real public service, quite frankly, for putting together reports that demonstrate very ably your understanding of these. And I think that as more comes to light that that's the direction things will go. The beneficiaries have full access to their funds. They earn guaranteed minimum interest rates. They exceed what they could in other money market type accounts. Our account holders tell us they love it. It's consumer friendly, on and on. One of the interesting things, as you probably know, in terms of guarantee funds and whatnot, in the course of business we actually are prohibited from talking about guarantee funds and whatnot in the insurance industry. I think that has to do with moral hazard issues, and so forth, which we certainly wouldn't disagree with. But since NOHLGA did the way in \\x96 by the way, you may recall back in 2008 during the crisis, they clarified the Guaranty Association coverage, which in this instance goes as if it were any kind of life insurance death benefit. And most states in the U.S., all 50 have coverage. Most are at 300,000. A handful like New York are at 500,000. None of them are below 250,000. So, now I can say that because I'm just commenting on a comment from the Guaranty Fund Association. They came out with a reaffirmation of that just this week. So, I think there's nothing better than having good, solid, clarifying, correct information when it comes to financial products. So, that's about all I have to say. But we haven't \\x96 I can't say anything about the Attorney General's office.\",\n",
       " 'Have you received it?': 'Pardon me?',\n",
       " \"Hey, good morning. I wanted to just color in around the edges of some of the questions that we just heard. For example, on the net non-medical benefits ratio, you had an improved 87.8%. And then I look back to the good old days, which were back in '06 and '07, and the ratios were slightly under 85%. So, the first question is just, is that where we get back to as things improve, and do you have any time trajectory for that?\": \"Hi, Andrew. It's Bill Mullaney, let me comment on that. First of all, the improvement that we saw in the non-medical health benefits ratio this quarter, as Bill mentioned in his comments, was primarily driven by dental. We saw the increase in utilization in dental claims early in 2009. We took some steps as part of our 2010 pricing, both for new business and renewal pricing, to adjust our prices to make sure that they reflected the higher cost of claims. And so I think you're starting to see the impact of those pricing changes working into our financial results. And as a result, the loss ratio in dental has come down, and that is the primary driver of the non-medical health benefits loss ratio. And that's one of the reasons why we created the new ratio, because the dental business has grown significantly over the past few years relative to the disability business. So, when you think about comparing the benefit ratio today versus the benefit ratio a few years ago, we have seen a change in the mix of the products that are there, with dental becoming much more significant, and that's one of the reasons why we adjusted that ratio in the first place. We still think that we have some opportunities for us to bring that ratio down. As I talked about before, I think the dental \\x96 or the disability ratios continue to be high, reflecting the downturn in the economy, though we are seeing some improvement there. And we haven't yet seen the full impact of the dental pricing changes working through into the benefits ratio. So, over time, our expectation is that that ratio will continue to trend down.\",\n",
       " \"I knew you wouldn't.\": \"...forgot you were on the call. In the first place, I can't really say anything specifically about the Attorney General because even though we've read in the press, just like everyone else, about a certain subpoena activity, we haven't seen anything nor have we talked to anyone from the Attorney General's office, so I really can't comment.\",\n",
       " 'Just a couple questions for Steve; I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of those gross losses on the investment portfolio that were realized, where they came from. And I think you indicated along the way that you might be reducing some of your sovereign holdings, and I wonder if any of that activity occurred during the quarter.': \"Hi, John. Actually, we did not decrease our sovereign holdings. We didn't have very many sovereign holdings. You may be remembering some comments I made earlier when we talked about the Alico transaction. And as you know, in pre-closing we don't control how they manage their portfolio. So, I can't really comment on what is going on, on that side of the ledger. In terms of gross losses, it's a fairly varied group of sectors that are contributing to that, so there's no one item that's jumping out where I can say this sector is underperforming on the realized losses. On impairments, it was more in the area of structured financed assets, and there were some in CMBS, some in ABS, and that was the main driver for the impairments.\",\n",
       " \"Okay, and then I guess just a quick one for Rob. You haven't said anything about the New York Attorney General investigation. I can't believe you're going to let that pass without some comment, so perhaps you can update us on your thinking about that.\": 'I just lost a bet. I thought maybe somebody would let it go through and not mention it at all, but then I...',\n",
       " \"Okay, and then I had a couple questions. One is on disability claims. Obviously, your margins held up really well. A few other companies have reported an uptick in claims, and maybe it seems like there is a business mix issue. But what's the possibility that if the economy stays the way it is that you actually see another uptick in claims over the next few quarters? And then the second question is on interest rates. With rates like 10-year sitting around 3%, could you maybe quantify a little bit on if the 10-year stays at this level for the rest of the year, how much of an impact would it have on your earnings? And maybe even if it were to drop another 50 basis points, what sensitivity would you have on your results?\": \"Hi, Jimmy, it's Bill Mullaney. I'll start out by talking about what we're seeing in disability. As Bill Wheeler talked about in his opening remarks, we saw a modest improvement this quarter in disability results relative to prior quarters. Incidence was down slightly. Recoveries were up \\x96 improved slightly, and so that has brought the loss ratio down a little bit. You commented on what some of our competitors are seeing. I can't really speak for them. And I'm not really sure why we saw the impact on our disability business more quickly. As you know, we've been talking about this issue for some time. Some of it may have to do with the mix of business that we have. We have a book of business that focuses on large companies. It's also got a significant percentage of those, meaning financial services companies. And I think when the economy started to turn down, I think those companies acted more quickly in terms of adjusting their workforces. That may have had some impact on how quickly we saw claims coming into our operation. We also have taken some price increases over the last couple of pricing cycles, and I think that has helped us in terms of our overall results for the quarter. But what I would say just to summarize is that the performance of the quarter in disability was moderately encouraging. And I would say as the economy continues to slowly recover, we think that we'll begin to see a recovery in our disability business as well.\",\n",
       " \"Okay, fair enough. Then just shifting over to Operational Excellence, and Bill mentioned an expense ratio of 22.4%. And then the low end of I guess the guidance is 21.8. Maybe, Bill, just I guess you had gotten an additional 200 million of savings. I think that's all done, and maybe give us a sense of when you could get to that 21.8%?\": \"Yes, you bet. We were actually at 21 \\x96 in the first quarter, I think we were at 21.7, I think that's right, so we were right at the bottom of the range. Obviously, it's a ratio, right, so you've got to look at the numerator and the denominator. In terms of expense control, we're ahead of our plan. We're doing better than our budgets and our plans this year, so we're very good about that. Of course, what we can't control very well is the denominator, which is revenues, and obviously, what popped \\x96 made the ratio go up a little bit this quarter is not because expenses went up. It's because we had less closeout sales, which are obviously lumpy. That smooths over a year period, but in the short run, you can have lumpy quarters like the one we just did. So in terms of real expense control, we put out guidance that we raised our Operational Excellence guidance to $600 million at Investor Day 2009 last December, and we're going to exceed that number. It's hard for me to say how much, but we're going \\x96 as you would hope, a number we put out we would like to beat, so we're doing very well there. And now of course, after this year I think we start shifting our focus on to the Alico acquisition and taking costs out of there. But I don't know if we'll have an OpEx 2 necessarily, but we're going to be continuing to drive expense control around here. I think that's not just only through Alico, but through the rest of the company, so I think there's more good news there to come in the future.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, so sometime after AIG reports?': \"I said there's no update yet.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, thanks.': \"Andrew, this is Rob. It's hard for me to be quiet on this topic. Steve is absolutely correct in everything he said. I would say though that he's reflecting, because the question is about our portfolio and our mortgage holdings, and so forth, I just wouldn't want to hasten to say that our experience is necessarily reflective of the entire marketplace. It hasn't been in the past and it won't be in the future, and I say that because we have very high quality properties, an extraordinarily strong real estate history and team. And so I think he's being a little modest, so I would just put it that way. Don't project that as a proxy to the entire marketplace, which is full of a lot of secondary market problems still and might even trend a little bit worse in some of those markets.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, thanks. I think Bill said in the past you have about 3 billion in those accounts. Is that still the right number?': \"No, there was a report \\x96 it's north of that. I don't have the exact figure in my head, but it's north of 3 billion.\",\n",
       " 'Okay, yeah, a couple quick questions. Any update on the timing for when you guys might file those pro-forma historical financials that show Met and Alico on a combined basis?': \"No, no, there's no update yet. I'm not actually sure when AIG actually announces earnings for the second quarter. But there's \\x96 I should probably know the answer to that. But there's no update yet.\",\n",
       " 'Okay.': \"And Jimmy, with regard to interest rates, we have run a sensitivity \\x96 or done a little projection I guess by saying if the interest rate environment that we're in now, the 10-year roughly at 3%, continues for the rest of this year and through 2011, what would happen to our results? And I guess I would say the answer's not much in general. By that, I mean, we would see \\x96 we would probably see a little lower earnings than otherwise expected in 2011. But it's not \\x96 it would be enough to mention, but not that significant. I think some people have talked about impairments of DAC or goodwill or things like that, and I wouldn't think that that's likely in this timeframe. You also mentioned what would happen if we dropped the 10-year to 2.5%. I have to admit I haven't run that scenario, so I can't give you any real precise answer, but I would give you a general response. You followed us, and I think most of the analysts listening to this call followed us for a long time. We've talked about the low interest rate issues, and what we do to protect ourselves. And we've said that from time to time, well before obviously the current situation, we have a history because this is part about risk management. We've often talked about a Japan scenario and how we protect ourselves against that risk, and we buy very long interest rate floors, sometimes with deferred start mechanisms, to push out, protect ourselves as long as we can, and we have a pretty good portfolio of those. So, as interest rates continue down here, those things, they obviously come into the money and start paying, but obviously they're increasing in value as we speak. Or obviously even in the second quarter, we saw an increase in value of those contracts. So this is something we've thought about for a long time, and have I think prepared ourselves pretty well for; and spent the money, frankly, over the last five years to do. So, this is \\x96 I think that's being smart about risk management and understanding where your real risks are. So, I think we're in relatively good shape here.\",\n",
       " \"Okay. And then \\x96 all right, so here's my bigger picture question for you. Your capital levels continue to grow. The investment portfolio is clearly recovering, showing good strength, very manageable credit-related investment losses and impairments. I guess I'm just curious as to whether we should expect the mix of your financing for Alico to maybe shift a bit from your original expectations when you announced that deal.\": \"That's a good question, John. I think probably the right \\x96 the prudent thing for me to say is you'll just have to wait and see. Obviously, this has been a source of considerable discussion for us. And we obviously wanted to see how \\x96 we wanted to get through this quarter. And obviously \\x96 so we'll have to just see I think is the only answer I can really give.\",\n",
       " 'Right.': \"So we're clearly building statutory capital versus our RBC at year-end 2009, which was 432%. So, we feel good about our capital levels, and our cash levels at the holding company haven't changed, so I guess I feel that capital position is in good shape.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you very much, okay, just a couple of questions. One with respect to what's going on in the U.K., I guess a couple of your more legitimate competitors have pulled out with AXA leaving and Aegon putting their business up for sale. Is there any update on your thoughts on the U.K. pension market and where you're at? Second, I didn't catch what you said the sales were for the variable annuities through Fidelity. If you could just give us a sense of that, it would be very helpful. And then also with respect to I guess two other things internationally, your ongoing discussions I guess with Sumitomo Mitsui and where you stand on the JV, if that is no longer going to be a JV; and can you give us any update on your negotiations with Japanese regulators to start taking capital out of Alico early next year instead of having to wait until 2012?\": \"It's Bill Mullaney. I'll talk about the first two parts of your question. As it relates to the U.K. closeout business, we had lower U.K. closeout sales this quarter than we had in the first quarter. As we've talked about in the past, closeout sales are lumpy and they do vary from quarter to quarter, so I think you're seeing the effect of that. In addition, though, I do think the low interest rate environment in particular, is having an impact on the closeout market in both the U.S. and the U.K. I think companies that would be thinking about transferring their pension plans to us are moving more slowly here because of the fact that interest rates are so low. And so I think that will continue to provide a challenge for us in that business until we see some improvement in the interest rate, in the longer term interest rate environment. So, I think that's how we're thinking about the U.K. And the U.S. closeout market. In terms of the Fidelity relationship, you didn't hear the sales number because I didn't say what it was. And because it is a relationship that we have with another company, we don't disclose that publicly. But it has become an important part of the overall sales story, but I will tell you it represents less than 10% of our total VA sales. And then I think the third question is to Bill Toppeta. Hi. On the Japan JV, we are in discussions with Mitsui Sumitomo. I would say that the discussions are very positive and moving along well. We don't have any conclusion yet, and as soon as we do you'll be the first to know.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you, good morning. Just to clarify be on the previous question, isn't the amount closer to 10 billion in those accounts, Bill?\": \"It's something like 10.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. I guess two questions, maybe both are for Bill Wheeler. First, in terms of some of the normalization adjustments that we talked about last night, in particular, I'm not used to backing out positive earnings in quarters when the equity markets are down, and obviously, that was part of last night's drill. So, as it relates to thinking about Met's exposure to equity markets, especially considering some of the hedges, would you consider the second quarter to be particularly abnormal in that you actually did well as markets came down because of some phenomenon in terms of how the markets traded in the second quarter? Or are you at a point where you're so over-hedged right now that to the extent that markets recover in the third quarter, we might actually see a little bit of earnings pressure because the hedges would underperform? That's question number one. Then question number two is, I guess Met has been fairly involved in the FASB-IASB joint accounting project. I think you and your team, Bill, have talked to them about some of the industry's issues and concerns there. Any updates in terms of where we are and what things might look like as we progress through the year? Thanks.\": \"Okay. With regard to the \\x96 I'm going to turn into the accounting expert here. With regard to the second quarter phenomenon, that positive earnings adjustment, we had an interesting situation this quarter. And I'm not sure we've completely diagnosed why it came about, because I think it is unique. You had a pretty substantial drop in both equity and interest rates right at the end of the quarter, and so for most of the quarter, we were at one level, and then we had a pretty big drop near the end, or in June. And the way GAAP works and when it reflects those macro events, to put it simply, there are \\x96 sometimes GAAP smooths results with some things like mean reversion formulas and such. And this was one of those occasions where there was \\x96 it ended up being a fairly big smoothing. At the same time, our hedging program, which we use to protect against these sorts of events, doesn't smooth anything. And so effectively, we became over-hedged at least on an accounting basis. Certainly not on an economic risk basis; I think that we feel our hedging worked quite well there. And it was meaningful enough that obviously we felt we really had to call it out in the financials and talk about it because it represented roughly a nickel overall for the company of earnings per share. So, now the interesting question is \\x96 so that's what happened. What happens if we get a reversal? It doesn't I don't think magically goes the other way and there's a $0.05 adjustment going the other way. It doesn't work that simply. I do think that these things do balance out over time because, of course, that's the whole point of mean reversion. It's a smoothing mechanism that will spread out the adjustment over a longer period of time, as much as, frankly, five years. So, that's how the mean reversion works. It also has to do with the fact that we were very much in the middle of the mean reversion corridor, as opposed to being at one end or the other, which is good to be in the middle, but I think that creates \\x96 that has smoothing impact. So, you could smooth a little bit the other way, but I think obviously if the stock market goes up, we would live with a little smoothing, that's okay. Now, with regard to accounting, you know what? I'm going to introduce Pete Carlson, who is our Chief Accounting Officer. Rather than me \\x96 I remember what he told me yesterday about what was going on. But rather than me just trying to repeat it, maybe I'll let him speak and talk a little bit about what's going on with these accounting initiatives. Thanks, Bill. Suneet, I think you referenced the insurance contracts project that's a joint project between the international accounting board and the U.S. board, the FASB. What has happened, the international board actually overnight did release an exposure draft. They had a June \\x96 or July 30 goal, and they've released their exposure draft for this project. That would apply to people under international financial reporting standards, which obviously is not what we currently follow. The U.S. board, because there already are existing standards for insurance contracts, we have much more industry-specific guidance here in the U.S., actually is on a little bit slower path and is not expected to release an exposure draft for another month or two; and actually may not even do it in an exposure draft and still do \\x96 so the stage of the discussions are much more preliminary on the U.S. side. That being said, the boards have recently, in discussions, reached a general consensus between both boards that acquisition costs actually would be considered in cash flow, so there would be some deferral of acquisition costs, and that's been one of the two key issues we've been monitoring as an industry.\",\n",
       " \"Thanks for letting me on. I'm just interested in any thoughts we can get on the Dodd-Frank bill specifically related to Volcker. And then derivatives, on Volcker there was a broad carve-out for the insurance industry, but at least we're still not clear on whether or not your holdings of hedge funds and private equity might be affected; and then just more broadly, how you think derivatives might carry a higher cost going forward.\": \"Let me provide a little color and commentary, Randy. Last call and I think the one before that, I talked about \\x96 at least it was helpful for me to differentiate thoroughbred racehorses from camels. I made that comment and at least some of the people down in Washington liked it and said it was actually reflective of what it was all about; so whether or not that's helpful for normal people, I don't know, but it seemed to help people in Washington. Let me just give you a little flavor. As I said, all along, the bill passes. And now relative to the insurance companies, the work is far from over, which is a good thing because the bill is full of bank language, full of bank processes, and so forth, and so the clarifications then work to differentiate the insurance marketplace. And so it's literally hundreds of rulemaking and regulatory projects that are going on. To give you an idea, there are 199 separate rulemaking initiatives. There are 68 studies underway. There are 355 issues on which lawmakers have given regulators the authority to issue the regulations, even if the regulations are not expressly required. And keep in mind that some of the studies are done by agencies that do not even now currently exist, like the Financial Services Oversight Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, et cetera, et cetera. There's a lot of work to be done in the details. And because it is so important to us, other people may think that we would relax a little bit, and this is a time that we really have positioned ourselves both as a company directly and through the ACLI as a resource to all of these rulemaking initiatives and wordings, and so forth. And so when it comes to things like \\x96 and this covers the Volcker rule, it covers derivatives. It covers things like resolution authority, fees, taxes, this and the other. We're all very, very focused and very active here at MetLife in Washington. So, that's probably the best way to answer that question because it's very difficult to be more clear than that. But we're not discouraged; we're not discouraged. We like this kind of slogging through. That's what we do very well.\",\n",
       " \"Thanks. But I guess the bigger issue, at least for me, is the whole marking to market of liabilities, which I think had caused your earnings to swing around pretty dramatically for non-economic reasons. Is that still where their heads are, or has there been enough communication with investors, or perhaps they're taking another look at whether or not that makes sense in terms of improving transparency? Any thoughts on that would be helpful, thanks.\": \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're going to \\x96 there's going to be some \\x96 this IFRS insurance contracts exposure draft is going to include some mark-tomarket liabilities. The key is not whether or not they're going to do that. It's how they do it and the kind of discount rates they use. There was some discussion that they might consider using a risk-free rate. We think that would be a bad idea. We think that the discount rate should really mimic as closely as possible what's going on with spreads or the mark-to-market of the assets. So, ergo, if you're a well-matched company, which we think we are, and others, that that would minimize the volatility of marking both sides of the balance sheet together. I think they're a lot more aware of that than they used to be. I would also say I think \\x96 I'm not necessarily \\x96 there's this whole interplay between what goes on in AOCI  and the movements there and also, net income versus operating income. And I think those distinctions, a lot of I think the mark-to-market in AOCI as opposed to \\x96 obviously, including now liabilities, is not going to just flow through a real income statement. But we're going to have to look for \\x96 looking at operating income and being able to call that out is just only going to get more important, as opposed to the mark-to-market and the balance sheet that goes on every quarter. So, it will probably confuse newspaper reporters, but I think the analyst community will get it. Also one last thing on this, since we're on this topic; our expectation is this isn't going to be the law of the land until 2013 or '14, and they have pushed this date back a little bit, and we might not be done pushing it back. So, this is quite a ways out before this is going to hit us.\",\n",

Now, the denominator changes, right, because the business \\x96 the balance sheet is a little bigger and things have changed a little bit.

We've seen, I'd say at a minimum, a bottoming out of certain sectors of the commercial real estate market, and even a slight improvement. And certainly, there are far more lenders going back into the arena right now. Mortgage rates are coming down fairly significantly. So, you're seeing activity pick up. You're seeing improving lease-up rates, and so on of buildings. I don't want to overstate it. I'm not saying that there won't be other problems coming down the road because there's always a lag in this sector regarding a borrower who eventually can't pay off a mortgage, but I'd say the fundamentals of the business itself have improved slightly. I think where things go from here will be largely driven by what happens in the overall economy. So, if we do have a slow recovery here, which I think is our position in terms of the most likely outcome, then you would anticipate that the market overall will improve along with the economy.

Therefore, the definition of what a proprietary account was, was not clarified.

Randy, there is carve-out language in the Volcker rule component of the bill. It's somewhat vague, and there's a six-month study that has been ordered by the bill. But we think that when people really work through the analysis here, they'll realize that for us to invest in private equity funds, for us to invest in hedge funds with the capital requirements that are imposed upon us through our existing regulatory regime, certainly still make sense.

       " \"It's Bill Mullaney. I'll talk about the first two parts of your question. As it relates to the U.K. closeout business, we had lower U.K. closeout sales this quarter than we had in the first quarter. As we've talked about in the past, closeout sales are lumpy and they do vary from quarter to quarter, so I think you're seeing the effect of that. In addition, though, I do think the low interest rate environment in particular, is having an impact on the closeout market in both the U.S. and the U.K. I think companies that would be thinking about transferring their pension plans to us are moving more slowly here because of the fact that interest rates are so low. And so I think that will continue to provide a challenge for us in that business until we see some improvement in the interest rate, in the longer term interest rate environment. So, I think that's how we're thinking about the U.K. And the U.S. closeout market. In terms of the Fidelity relationship, you didn't hear the sales number because I didn't say what it was. And because it is a relationship that we have with another company, we don't disclose that publicly. But it has become an important part of the overall sales story, but I will tell you it represents less than 10% of our total VA sales. And then I think the third question is to Bill Toppeta. Hi. On the Japan JV, we are in discussions with Mitsui Sumitomo. I would say that the discussions are very positive and moving along well. We don't have any conclusion yet, and as soon as we do you'll be the first to know.\",\n",

Obviously, it's a ratio, right, so you've got to look at the numerator and the denominator. In terms of expense control, we're ahead of our plan. We're doing better than our budgets and our plans this year, so we're very good about that. Of course, what we can't control very well is the denominator, which is revenues, and obviously, what popped \\x96 made the ratio go up a little bit this quarter is not because expenses went up. It's because we had less closeout sales, which are obviously lumpy. That smooths over a year period, but in the short run, you can have lumpy quarters like the one we just did. So in terms of real expense control, we put out guidance that we raised our Operational Excellence guidance to $600 million at Investor Day 2009 last December, and we're going to exceed that number. It's hard for me to say how much, but we're going \\x96 as you would hope, a number we put out we would like to beat, so we're doing very well there. And now of course, after this year I think we start shifting our focus on to the Alico acquisition and taking costs out of there. But I don't know if we'll have an OpEx 2 necessarily, but we're going to be continuing to drive expense control around here. I think that's not just only through Alico, but through the rest of the company, so I think there's more good news there to come in the future.\",\n",

       " \"Let me provide a little color and commentary, Randy. Last call and I think the one before that, I talked about \\x96 at least it was helpful for me to differentiate thoroughbred racehorses from camels. I made that comment and at least some of the people down in Washington liked it and said it was actually reflective of what it was all about; so whether or not that's helpful for normal people, I don't know, but it seemed to help people in Washington. Let me just give you a little flavor. As I said, all along, the bill passes. And now relative to the insurance companies, the work is far from over, which is a good thing because the bill is full of bank language, full of bank processes, and so forth, and so the clarifications then work to differentiate the insurance marketplace. And so it's literally hundreds of rulemaking and regulatory projects that are going on. To give you an idea, there are 199 separate rulemaking initiatives. There are 68 studies underway. There are 355 issues on which lawmakers have given regulators the authority to issue the regulations, even if the regulations are not expressly required. And keep in mind that some of the studies are done by agencies that do not even now currently exist, like the Financial Services Oversight Council, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, et cetera, et cetera. There's a lot of work to be done in the details. And because it is so important to us, other people may think that we would relax a little bit, and this is a time that we really have positioned ourselves both as a company directly and through the ACLI as a resource to all of these rulemaking initiatives and wordings, and so forth. And so when it comes to things like \\x96 and this covers the Volcker rule, it covers derivatives. It covers things like resolution authority, fees, taxes, this and the other. We're all very, very focused and very active here at MetLife in Washington. So, that's probably the best way to answer that question because it's very difficult to be more clear than that. But we're not discouraged; we're not discouraged. We like this kind of slogging through. That's what we do very well.\",\n",
       " \"And Jimmy, with regard to interest rates, we have run a sensitivity \\x96 or done a little projection I guess by saying if the interest rate environment that we're in now, the 10-year roughly at 3%, continues for the rest of this year and through 2011, what would happen to our results? And I guess I would say the answer's not much in general. By that, I mean, we would see \\x96 we would probably see a little lower earnings than otherwise expected in 2011. But it's not \\x96 it would be enough to mention, but not that significant. I think some people have talked about impairments of DAC or goodwill or things like that, and I wouldn't think that that's likely in this timeframe. You also mentioned what would happen if we dropped the 10-year to 2.5%. I have to admit I haven't run that scenario, so I can't give you any real precise answer, but I would give you a general response. You followed us, and I think most of the analysts listening to this call followed us for a long time. We've talked about the low interest rate issues, and what we do to protect ourselves. And we've said that from time to time, well before obviously the current situation, we have a history because this is part about risk management. We've often talked about a Japan scenario and how we protect ourselves against that risk, and we buy very long interest rate floors, sometimes with deferred start mechanisms, to push out, protect ourselves as long as we can, and we have a pretty good portfolio of those. So, as interest rates continue down here, those things, they obviously come into the money and start paying, but obviously they're increasing in value as we speak. Or obviously even in the second quarter, we saw an increase in value of those contracts. So this is something we've thought about for a long time, and have I think prepared ourselves pretty well for; and spent the money, frankly, over the last five years to do. So, this is \\x96 I think that's being smart about risk management and understanding where your real risks are. So, I think we're in relatively good shape here.\",\n",

       " \"Okay. With regard to the \\x96 I'm going to turn into the accounting expert here. With regard to the second quarter phenomenon, that positive earnings adjustment, we had an interesting situation this quarter. And I'm not sure we've completely diagnosed why it came about, because I think it is unique. You had a pretty substantial drop in both equity and interest rates right at the end of the quarter, and so for most of the quarter, we were at one level, and then we had a pretty big drop near the end, or in June. And the way GAAP works and when it reflects those macro events, to put it simply, there are \\x96 sometimes GAAP smooths results with some things like mean reversion formulas and such. And this was one of those occasions where there was \\x96 it ended up being a fairly big smoothing. At the same time, our hedging program, which we use to protect against these sorts of events, doesn't smooth anything. And so effectively, we became over-hedged at least on an accounting basis. Certainly not on an economic risk basis; I think that we feel our hedging worked quite well there. And it was meaningful enough that obviously we felt we really had to call it out in the financials and talk about it because it represented roughly a nickel overall for the company of earnings per share. So, now the interesting question is \\x96 so that's what happened. What happens if we get a reversal? It doesn't I don't think magically goes the other way and there's a $0.05 adjustment going the other way. It doesn't work that simply. I do think that these things do balance out over time because, of course, that's the whole point of mean reversion. It's a smoothing mechanism that will spread out the adjustment over a longer period of time, as much as, frankly, five years. So, that's how the mean reversion works. It also has to do with the fact that we were very much in the middle of the mean reversion corridor, as opposed to being at one end or the other, which is good to be in the middle, but I think that creates \\x96 that has smoothing impact. So, you could smooth a little bit the other way, but I think obviously if the stock market goes up, we would live with a little smoothing, that's okay. Now, with regard to accounting, you know what? I'm going to introduce Pete Carlson, who is our Chief Accounting Officer. Rather than me \\x96 I remember what he told me yesterday about what was going on. But rather than me just trying to repeat it, maybe I'll let him speak and talk a little bit about what's going on with these accounting initiatives. Thanks, Bill. Suneet, I think you referenced the insurance contracts project that's a joint project between the international accounting board and the U.S. board, the FASB. What has happened, the international board actually overnight did release an exposure draft. They had a June \\x96 or July 30 goal, and they've released their exposure draft for this project. That would apply to people under international financial reporting standards, which obviously is not what we currently follow. The U.S. board, because there already are existing standards for insurance contracts, we have much more industry-specific guidance here in the U.S., actually is on a little bit slower path and is not expected to release an exposure draft for another month or two; and actually may not even do it in an exposure draft and still do \\x96 so the stage of the discussions are much more preliminary on the U.S. side. That being said, the boards have recently, in discussions, reached a general consensus between both boards that acquisition costs actually would be considered in cash flow, so there would be some deferral of acquisition costs, and that's been one of the two key issues we've been monitoring as an industry.\",\n",
       " \"Hi, Mark, it's Bill. Yes, we did hear your question. I always hesitate say whether $1.11 is a good run rate or not, but I'll give you some sense of the pluses and minuses. You're right, underwriting was very strong, and so I think a lot of that is sustainable. Some of it was probably just good fortune. But I also think, by the way, like the improvements in dental underwriting margin are very sustainable. In fact, they might get better from here. And the other interesting fact is disability underwriting margins were roughly flat on a sequential quarter basis. But there's potential for a lot of improvement there as early \\x96 it may be in the third quarter, maybe not. But the guys who are very close to that business are encouraged by some of the signs they saw in the second quarter. So, certainly there are headwinds or there are things which might not be repeatable in the second quarter results, but there are further opportunities. I would also \\x96 just a couple other things to keep in mind is I think the expense picture only gets better, okay, as Operational Excellence continues to execute, though probably the drop in the equity markets at the end of the second quarter is probably a modest negative as we think about third quarter fees and the retirement business. And then finally, I think the low interest rate environment that we're in, though I don't think it will be a very large impact in terms of our operating impact, operating EPS, it will probably slice a little bit off of investment margin in the future quarters, but I think it will be very modest. So that's the color on what's sustainable and what might be in the future. And I come away from that little dialogue as currently yes, that $1.11 current run rate is a number that I think you can think about as a reasonable projection going forward. Could it be a little lower? Sure, but not materially.\"]"

      "Good morning, and welcome, I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2010. Joining me on the podium today are Sheri McCoy, Worldwide Chairman of our Pharmaceuticals Group; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. A few logistics before we get into the details, the audio and visuals from this presentation are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the third quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the third quarter financial results and guidance for the full year of 2010. Sheri will then provide an update on our Pharmaceuticals business. We will then open the floor to your questions. We will conclude our formal presentation at approximately 9:30. And following Q&A with some final remarks by Dominic, we'll conclude the meeting around 10 AM. Distributed with a copy of the press release that you just received is a schedule with actual revenues for major products and/or business franchises. For the listening audience, these are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is a copy of the press release. Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this meeting may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2009 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online. Last item, during the call non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available in the press release or on the Johnson & Johnson website. Now I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2010. If you refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $15 billion for the third quarter of 2010, down 0.7%, as compared to the third quarter of 2009. On an operational basis, sales were up slightly, and currency had a negative impact of 0.8%. In the U.S., sales declined 2.5%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 2.6% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported sales by 1.5 points. Our strongest performing region was the Asia-Pacific-Africa region, which grew 1.4% on an operational basis. Europe grew 1.8% operationally, while the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 1.7% operationally. If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.4 billion, compared to $3.3 billion in the same period in 2009, an increase of 2.2%. Earnings per share were $1.23 versus $1.20 a year ago. I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. Cost of goods sold at 30.7% of sales was 130 basis points higher than the same period in 2009, primarily due to the cost associated with the impact of the recalls and related remediation efforts in the Consumer business, and the impact of price reductions in our Pharmaceutical business and certain MD&D businesses. Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses of 31.4% of sales were down 20 basis points versus last year due to cost containment initiatives. Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 11.1%, 40 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2009 due to timing of spending on projects. Interest expense net of interest income of $95 million is $19 million less than the third quarter of 2009, with lower interest expense on lower average debt. Other income net of other expense of $292 million was $196 million greater than the same period in 2009. Taxes were 19% in the third quarter of 2010 versus 21.2% in the third quarter of 2009. Dominic will discuss other income and taxes in his commentary. Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the first nine months of 2010, consolidated sales to customers for the first nine months of 2010 were $45.9 billion, an increase of 1.3%, as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales were flat operationally, and currency had a positive impact of 1.3 points. On the consolidated statement of year-to-date earnings, I'd first like to draw your attention to the boxed section. Adjusted net earnings of $10.4 billion in 2010 compares to net earnings of $10.1 billion in 2009. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 were up 3.3% versus the 2009 results. Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting major products or business franchises. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the third quarter of 2010 of $3.6 billion decreased 10.6%, as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales declined 10.2%, while the impact of currency was negative 0.4 points. U.S. sales were down 24.5%, while international sales were up 0.4% on an operational basis. The Consumer sales growth in the quarter was impacted by the OTC recalls, currency devaluation in Venezuela, and certain divestitures. The OTC recall impacted operational growth by approximately six points, while the devaluation and divestitures impacted operational growth by just over one point each. For the third quarter of 2010, sales for the over-the-counter or OTC pharmaceuticals and nutritionals decreased 19.4% on an operational basis, compared to the same period in 2009, with U.S. sales down 40.2%, and sales outside the U.S. up 3.5% on an operational basis. Sales were impacted by the voluntary recalls announced earlier this year and suspension of production at the McNeil Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility. As an update on the products included in the January recall that are produced at our McNeil Las Piedras, Puerto Rico facility, we are at normal levels of production. Restocking commenced in the second quarter and continues to ramp up to normal trade inventory levels for key products. Regarding the Fort Washington facility, operations at this plant were suspended in connection with the recall of infants' and children's liquid OTC products manufactured there. The suspension of manufacturing also impacted adult solid OTC products manufactured at the facility. We remain on track with our plans for ultimate supply of these products from within the Johnson & Johnson manufacturing network. We began shipping a small amount of product. And beginning in the first quarter of 2011, shipments will ramp up and continue to expand throughout the year. McNeil submitted its remediation plan to the FDA on July 15th. The plan applies to all manufacturing facilities McNeil operates to supply the U.S. market, and addresses governance and management controls, training programs, process assessment, and process improvement. We are committed to regular and detailed communications with the FDA as we implement this plan. Now moving on to the other businesses, Skin Care business declined on an operational basis by 4.9%, with the U.S. down 15.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.7% on an operational basis. In the third quarter, we began implementing enhancements to equipment that will continue into the fourth quarter. This has resulted in a temporary reduction of shipments for certain products. Baby Care products achieved operational growth of 3.3%, with the U.S. growing 2% and sales outside the U.S. growing 3.6% on an operational basis, when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Powders and cleansers were the major contributors to the sales growth outside the U.S., while BabyCenter.com contributed to the growth in the U.S. Women's Health declined operationally by 7.9%. Sales in the U.S. were down 14.8%, while sales outside the U.S. were down on an operational basis by 5.1% due to increased competitive pressure. Sales in the Oral Care franchise were down 6.8%. In the U.S., sales were down 12.3%, while sales outside the U.S. were down 2.2% operationally. Sales were impacted by the divestiture in the U.S. of the EFFERDENT and EFFERGRIP brands, as well as lower sales of toothbrushes and slower category growth in mouth rinses. That completes our review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide net sales for the third quarter of $5.5 billion were up 4.7% versus the same period last year, with operational growth of 5.9% and a negative impact of currency of 1.2%. Sales in the U.S. increased 6.9%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 4.6%. The third quarter sales were negatively impacted by U.S. healthcare reform, as well as European austerity measures estimated to be approximately $150 million. Now reviewing the products, contributing to the results were a number of the core products, which I'll discuss in a moment; and importantly the new products recently introduced, STELARA, SIMPONI, INVEGA SUSTENNA, and NUCYNTA. With the successful launches of STELARA and SIMPONI, we achieved U.S. market leadership in immunology in 2010. Sales of REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases, were up 18.6%, when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Sales growth in the U.S. was 4.3% due to strong market growth, partially offset by lower market share in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Strong market growth and an increase in inventory levels contributed to an increase in export sales of 75.5%. The international market growth is estimated to be over 20% in the quarter. As an update on the arbitration with Merck, the evidentiary portion of the arbitration has been completed, and oral argument is scheduled for late this year. It is possible we could have a decision in the first half of 2011. PROCRIT/EPREX declined operationally by 22.9% during the quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year, with PROCRIT down 31.8% due to an decline in the market, and the impact of the recall announcement in September. EPREX sales were lower by 11.9% operationally due to increased competition and a slowdown in certain European markets. RISPERDAL CONSTA, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, achieved third quarter sales growth of 11% on an operational basis. Sales in the U.S. were down 16.3%. However, solid growth was achieved in the combined market share of long-acting injectables, including INVEGA SUSTENNA. Sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA outside the U.S. were up 26.6% operationally, with very strong growth in Japan. Sales of LEVAQUIN, our anti-infective, were down 8.1% on an operational basis, when compared to the same period a year ago due to the decline in the market and increased penetration of generics. The U.S. anti-infective market is estimated to be down approximately 4% in the quarter due to a lower incidence of respiratory illness and flu. CONCERTA, a product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was up 5.8% operationally in the third quarter, as compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. were up 4.4% due to double-digit market growth offset by the impact of healthcare reform. Sales outside the U.S. were up 9.3% operationally, with strong growth seen in most major regions. VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma for which we have commercialization rights in Europe, and the rest of the world outside the U.S. Operational sales growth was 10.1%. Timing of shipments related to tenders impacted the rate of growth in the quarter. ACIPHEX as it's known in the U.S. market and PARIET outside the U.S. is a proton pump inhibitor or PPI that we co-market with Eisai. On an operational basis, sales were down 5.3%, with U.S. sales down 11.5%, and sales outside the U.S. up 0.8% operationally. Scrip share in the U.S. was down 1% due to increased competition from generics in the category. PREZISTA, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, grew operationally 55.9%, with the U.S. growing 30.8% and sales outside the U.S. growing 82.7% due to very strong momentum and share. INVEGA, an atypical antipsychotic, grew operationally 2.7%, with growth in the U.S. of 3.3%. As an update to our pharmaceutical pipeline, during the quarter CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] adopted a positive opinion for INVEGA for the treatment of psychotic or manic symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Additionally, in October we submitted to the FDA the pediatric supplemental NDA for INVEGA for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents ages 12 to 17 years of age. I will now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $5.9 billion grew 1.9% operationally, as compared to the same period in 2009. Currency had a negative impact of 0.6 points, resulting in a total sales increase of 1.3%. Sales in the U.S. were up 1.2%, while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 2.6%. Now turning to the franchises, starting with Cordis; Cordis sales were down 6.6% operationally, with the U.S. up 5.6% and sales outside the U.S. down 13.5% operationally. Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of CYPHER, our sirolimus-eluting stent, partially offset by strong growth in our Biosense Webster business. CYPHER sales were approximately $135 million, down 36% on an operational basis versus the prior year. Sales in the U.S. of approximately $45 million were down 12%. Estimated share in the U.S. of 13% was up one point from a year ago and flat on a sequential basis. Sales outside the U.S. of approximately $90 million declined 45% operationally. The estimated market share in the quarter of 14% was down one point on a sequential basis and down 11 points from the third quarter of 2009. Increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S. CYPHER estimated worldwide share for the quarter was 15%, flat sequentially and down six points from the third quarter of 2009. Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved strong double-digit operational growth in the quarter due to increased market share. The successful launch, and the continued expansion of the installed base CARTO 3 made a strong contribution to the results. As an update on the clinical development of our NEVO stent, we submitted NEVO for CE Mark at the end of the first quarter using the data from the RES-I trial, which has demonstrated NEVO's superiority to Taxus Liberte at both six and twelve months. In August, we began limited patient enrollment in NEVO II. While the stent itself is performing extremely well, we have decided to suspend enrollment so that we can improve the performance of the balloon catheter. We will restart NEVO II once these improvements have been made. We are currently evaluating the impact that this delay will cause in our European launch, which is subject to CE Marking; and our U.S. submission, which requires data from NEVO II. We will not launch in any market prior to the restart of NEVO II. Moving on to our DePuy franchise, DePuy had operational growth of 2.6%, when compared to the same period in 2009, with the U.S. growing 1.1%, and the business outside the U.S. growing by 4.8% operationally. Pressure on pricing continued as a result of the economic trends. However, positive mix due to continuing product innovation has mitigated some of the impact. Operational hip growth on a worldwide basis was approximately 2%. U.S. sales declined 1% due to lower volume in the metal-on-metal bearing business and intensified pressure on price net of mix. The growth outside the U.S. of 7% operational was driven by the success of the Acetabular and cementless systems. As of the second quarter, DePuy had maintained its worldwide market share leadership position in hip. On an operational business, worldwide knee growth was approximately 3%, with U.S. growth for the quarter at 2% and outside U.S. growth at 4% operational. Spine was flat on an operational basis, with the U.S. down approximately 3% and sales outside the U.S. up 7% operationally. Pricing pressure in the category and softness in procedural volume impacted the growth in the U.S. The diabetes franchise was up 1% operationally in the third quarter of 2010, with the U.S. business up 1.8%, and the business outside the U.S. up 0.2% operationally. Macroeconomic pressures, such as increase in co-pays and out-of-pocket expense continued to pressure volume growth in the category. Animas sales outside the U.S. continued to grow double-digits due to continued development of the international market. Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 6%, with the U.S. up 9.3% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.4% operationally. The acquisition of Acclarent this year contributed to growth in the quarter. Growth was also driven by biosurgicals and Mentor products, as well as increased penetration of anti-bacterial sutures outside the U.S. Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 3.3% in the third quarter of 2010, with the U.S. sales down 3% and sales outside the U.S. up on an operational basis by 8.4%. Growth was impacted by the divestiture of the breast care business. Excluding this impact, worldwide sales grew operationally by approximately 6%. Growth was driven by advanced sterilization, Endo, Harmonic, and SurgRX products. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics was down 0.4% in the third quarter, with the U.S. down 7.7%, while sales outside the U.S. were up 9.2% on an operational basis. Growth of VITROS 5600 and 3600 was offset by lower sales in donor screening with the move to selected testing for certain diseases. Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care franchise achieved operational sales growth of 3.1% in the third quarter, compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. increased 1.3%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 4% on an operational basis. Growth in both astigmatism and daily lenses were driven by the strength of the underlying platforms and new product launches, partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses. That completes highlights for the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2010. I will now turn the podium over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic? So we'll now begin the Q&A session; if you could wait for a mic before you ask your question because we are  Thank you, Louise. I'd like to add my own welcome to members of the investment community who have joined us here today, and also, to those who are listening in via webcast and conference call. I will keep my remarks brief to allow ample time for the update on our Pharmaceutical business and for your questions. I would like to provide a few comments about our third quarter results, update you on some positive developments in the quarter, and then wrap up with our guidance for the remainder of the year. In the third quarter, our business performance was solid despite a general softening in the global healthcare markets. We maintained or grew many of our market share positions. Our broad base of healthcare businesses continues to be a core strength that enables us to manage through the challenges that sometimes arise in markets where we compete. In the third quarter, we saw a deceleration of growth trends in overall healthcare spending related to the economy, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Our third quarter reported results of $1.23 per share include approximately a $0.06 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate, resulting from changes in the mix of our business, as well as favorable tax adjustments in various jurisdictions. Excluding this impact, our adjusted earnings per share still exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. Additionally, we had a lower level of pre-tax operating margin, as compared to the prior year, due mainly to lower gross profit. This was a result of pricing pressure across both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics businesses, as well as the impact of not shipping the OTC products from our McNeil Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility, and the ongoing cost of remediation at that facility. During the third quarter, we also increased our level of spending in R&D. And although SG&A expenses were leveraged as part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts, these costs were not as low as you might have expected, as they also reflect some increased spending, as we continued to invest in new growth platforms and product launches. These higher costs were essentially offset by an increase in other income and expense that reflect some gains from divestitures, principally from the previous announced divestiture of our breast care business. As is our practice, when we make decisions to reshape our portfolio with divestitures, we typically use any gains to make additional investments or enable other business decisions that would enhance our long-term growth. That was certainly the case in the third quarter, and we expect that a higher level of investment spending would continue into the fourth quarter. In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to see the impact from the European pricing pressures we mentioned on our second quarter call, and the impact of U.S. healthcare reform measures that were implemented earlier this year. Despite these impacts, our Pharmaceutical business produced solid sales from its core products and successful new launches. We continue to invest in areas that we believe have significant growth potential. And as you know, two weeks ago, we announced an agreement to acquire Crucell. We expect that deal to close in 2011, and be dilutive to earnings per share in 2011 by approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share. We want to make Crucell the center for vaccines in our Pharmaceutical business. Sheri will be covering several positive developments in our Pharmaceutical business in just a few minutes. Our Medical Devices and Diagnostics business continued to show growth in five of seven franchises on an operational basis. In this quarter, however, that growth was tempered by a slowdown in the pace of surgical procedures, particularly in orthopedics. This is consistent with observations that many in the analyst community have recently shared. There appear to be several factors contributing to this slowdown in the market. We believe the effects of the weaker economy, and the uncertainty that some patients face about their ability to take on additional medical expenses are prompting some patients to postpone elective procedures. One factor making this more pronounced in this quarter is the recent discontinuation on extensions for COBRA healthcare benefits that are available to the unemployed in the United States. However, based on the latest data that we have, we believe we have maintained or improved market share in most areas of our MD&D businesses in the face of this lower level of healthcare spending across the markets where we compete. Our view is that in the long term, demographic trends, emerging market expansion, and advances in technology that can make a significant difference to patient outcomes will provide strong tailwinds for continued growth in the global MD&D market. We also continued to work through the DePuy ASR hip implant recall, assisting patients and healthcare providers by providing information, as well as paying for the cost for any follow-up monitoring and treatment associated with the recall. We are still defining the extent of this program, after which we will assess the financial impact and provide you with additional information once that assessment is complete. This quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Micrus Endovascular, which strengthens our neuro-device business for the treatment of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Regarding our Consumer business, the third quarter results reflect an approximately $240 million negative impact to sales, and an approximately $0.05 per share negative impact to EPS from the McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalls, and shutdown of the Fort Washington, Pennsylvania facility. I am pleased to report we have begun shipping one of the McNeil children's medicine products to our customers. Although it will be available only in limited quantities at first, we have been able to achieve this step by working closely with the FDA and our Canadian affiliate. Nearly 1 million bottles have been released, and we expect to distribute a total of 4 million bottles in the United States by the end of this year. Meanwhile, in the remainder of our Consumer business, we saw solid results in emerging markets, and continue to build on our iconic brands with new products. For example, Tylenol Precise is a new pain product launched in the third quarter, which offers new insights on the science of touch, and how it can help relieve muscle and joint pain. And Listerine Zero, a less intensive alcohol-free mouthwash that uses the same proven ingredients found in regular Listerine antiseptic, was launched this quarter. I'd like to now provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2010. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. As you know, we raised $1.1 billion of cash through a debt offering in August. We saw a market opportunity to increase our financial flexibility with favorable terms, and achieve the lowest rates on record for 10 and 30-year corporate bonds as one of the few AAA-rated companies. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $10 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $22 billion of cash and investments and approximately $12 billion of debt. This is an improvement of nearly $3 billion in our overall net cash position from the second quarter of 2010. This past quarter, we also continued our share repurchase program. to-date, we have purchased $9.6 billion of our stock under our $10 billion share repurchase program. We expect to complete the balance of the repurchase program by the end of this year. For purposes of your models, assuming no additional major acquisitions during 2010, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between 300 million and $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income, as well as one-time gains or losses arriving from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corp, or asset sales and write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast. But assuming no major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2010 as a net gain ranging from approximately $450 million to $550 million, which is higher than our previous guidance, reflecting the recent divestiture gains. This excludes the impact of net litigation matters, which we have treated as special items, such as our settlement with Boston Scientific earlier this year. And now a word on taxes; for the first nine months of 2010, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was 22.2%. This does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit because that legislation has not been enacted. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2010 in the range of 21.5% to 22.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the impact of the favorable tax adjustments we've recorded in this third quarter, and while it is not yet enacted, it is our expectation that the R&D tax credit legislation will be enacted later this year and made retroactive for 2010. And as always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon the rate throughout the remainder of the year. Now turning to sales and earnings guidance, our guidance continues to be-based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations assuming that average currency rates for 2010 will be the same as they were for 2009. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this operational view provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2010 with the impact that current exchange rates could have, and we'll use the euro as an example. Turning to sales, given the factors that we outlined earlier this year and reflecting the impact of the lower trends in spending across many of the healthcare markets in which we compete, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting flat operational sales; that is on a constant currency basis, as compared to the prior year. This would result in estimated sales for 2010 on a constant currency basis of approximately $62 billion. And while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2010 were to stay where they were as of last week, that our sales growth rate would be positively impacted by currency for the year due principally to the recent strengthening of the euro from $1.29 in July to nearly $1.40 as of last week. This would result in a minor positive impact on the average rate for the full year, as compared to the prior year, so that the expected level of reported sales would also be approximately $62 billion. And now turning to earnings, given the lower effective tax rate that we now estimate for the year, we believe that we will be able to offset the impact on earnings from the trends we are seeing in the lower level of spending across healthcare markets, and the resulting change in our estimated sales for the year that I just outlined. Also as I noted earlier, we expect increased investment spending for the year, which will be offset by higher gains and other income. With that as context, I suggest that you continue to consider full-year 2010 EPS estimates excluding the impact of special items of between $4.70 and $4.80 per share on an operational basis, which assumes the same average exchange rates for 2010 as we saw in 2009. This represents an operational EPS growth rate of 2% to 4%. And while we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you the idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for the balance of 2010 were to remain where they were as of last week, as an example with the euro nearly at 1.40, the impact of average currency movements for the year, primarily the euro, would be very minimal, and therefore, our reported EPS excluding special items would also be between $4.70 and $4.80 per share, an increase from our previous guidance, reflecting changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We would be comfortable at the midpoint of this range. That concludes my comments on our operating performance this quarter and on our guidance with respect to your models. Now, let's move on to the next portion of our program today. As you know, we regularly communicate with the investment community about our long-term strategy and prospects for growth. Many of you joined us in June last year for a comprehensive review of our Pharmaceuticals business. And today we are going to bring you an update on the exciting progress and new developments we have made since that time. Sheri McCoy, Worldwide Chairman of our Pharmaceuticals segment, has been leading an important transition of our Pharmaceuticals business since she took that position nearly two years ago. She has helped lead that business through a period of major patent expirations and change, and they have been launching important new life-changing medicines and making important pipeline investments to ensure we can continue to meet the needs of patients and healthcare providers. It is my pleasure to introduce my friend and colleague on our Executive Committee, Sheri McCoy. Sheri? Sherilyn S. McCoy, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals Group Thank you, Dominic, and good morning. I'm delighted to provide you with an update on our Pharmaceuticals business. What I'm going to talk to you about today, I'm going to provide with you an overview, and I'm going to start with perspective on the pharmaceutical industry, and what you'll hear is that we consider the pharmaceuticals industry a very attractive segment, recognizing it's undergoing historic change. With that said, there is terrific opportunity to innovate and reach patients with meaningful solutions. We will talk about our Pharmaceuticals business, and what I'll provide you with is perspective on our business. We're building momentum, driving growth, and importantly, advancing our pipeline and revitalizing our portfolio. We're executing well against our strategic priorities, and it's really driven through our strong talent and capabilities throughout our organization. So some comments on the pharmaceutical landscape, certainly it's a very large and growing business. EvaluatePharma estimates that it's a $650 billion market projected to grow between 3% and 4% over the next several years, with modest growth in the developed markets and double-digit growth in the emerging markets. The 3% to 4% is lower than what we've seen historically, and this really takes into account the pricing pressures, loss of patent exclusivity, and the various healthcare reform initiatives going on around the globe. With that said, there's still tremendous opportunity with large therapeutic areas, unmet needs, an opportunity to serve patients given the demographics, and the change in the environment. So, there's an opportunity to continue to make sure that we innovate and focus on this market. Taking a look at our business, we characterize 2010 as the year of our pipeline advancement. We are building momentum, revitalizing our portfolio, moving away from some of our older products to a new generation of products. We're executing against our strategic priorities, focused on accelerating the growth of our launch products. Those are the products we launched in 2009, and I'll spend some time talking about those. We'll have a number of key filings the second half of this year, and we could be in a position to have five compounds in registration by the end of this year. We're focused on critical geographies, and I'll provide you with a brief update on some of the initiatives in these areas. And we've been focusing on our organizational effectiveness and efficiencies both on the R&D side of our business, as well as our commercial and supply chain, focusing on how we can get products to patients more rapidly. I talked to you about revitalizing our portfolio, and I think this chart depicts it well. If you take a look at the right hand side of this chart, you see the red bars. And that really looks to the loss of sales due to patent exclusivity, so the RISPERDAL, and the TOPAMAX, as well as the impact of healthcare reform. On the other side of the chart, what you see are the green bars. This is reflecting the growth of our new products, as well as some of our key prioritized products. And if we look at the growth of those products, that represents a growth rate of 26%. So, for the first nine months of this year, we've added $1.4 billion in sales, essentially offsetting the loss due to loss of patents exclusivity and healthcare reform. Importantly, as we move forward, we want less red and a lot more green and bigger green. So, that's our focus as we look to revitalize our portfolio. We have four strategic priorities, and I'll walk you through each of them. In the area of innovative products, we'll talk first about our launch products. We're very pleased with the success of our four key launch products, STELARA, a product for moderate to severe psoriasis with a novel mechanism of action, opportunity for three-month dosing. Off to a very, very good start; for the first nine months of this year, our share is up 7.6 points in the dermatology market in the U.S. We also see very, very strong performance in markets around the world. It has very high patient satisfaction, very good awareness with derms [dermatologists], particularly given the New England Journal of Medicine's article which talks to the superiority versus ENBREL. I'm very, very pleased with the performance of STELARA. SIMPONI is a product that we entered into the sub-cut [subcutaneous] area in immunology. What we see there is that we're making good progress in terms of getting access. It's a very competitive market. And one of the things that we see is about 25% to 28% of the patients are biologically na�ve patients. What we're seeing is the other 75% or so are people that have switched from either ENBREL or HUMERA and tend to in many cases have failed other anti-TNFs, so a more difficult patient population. We're continuing to work through that. We're also filing a � we just filed a structural damage claim in the area of rheumatoid arthritis, and we'll be filing later this year for psoriatic arthritis. SUSTENNA also off to a very good start in the long-acting injectable arena; good patient satisfaction and clinician satisfaction, and we're making progress from a formulary status perspective. This is an area where we have the opportunity to really increase the market penetration for long-acting injectables, and that's where we're focusing our efforts. NUCYNTA for the treatment of acute pain; we introduced the IR version in June of last year into a very competitive market with a lot of generics. We have an 8.1% share, up over three points for the past nine months. This is an area we continue to get good progress, and we're making inroads both in the PCP area, as well as with pain specialists. We will be introducing � we actually just recently received a NUCYNTA ER Complete Response letter from the FDA. We're in the process of working with them on that. There's no additional clinical data that is required. It's really questions about the bioequivalence of that compound. If we now look at our robust pipeline, just a couple words on the pipeline; as we look at the market that we're in today, it's a changing landscape. We recognize the cost to get new drugs to the market is increasing, a lot more risk. And it's important that we focus our approach from a pipeline standpoint. So, we've identified five therapeutic areas. We have one individual that manages that therapeutic area, and they have responsibility for end to end, going from discovery all the way to commercialization, looking at both large molecules and small molecules. They also have opportunity to do internal development, as well as look at opportunities to build the pipelines through external partnership or external acquisition. Importantly, these areas are also trying to understand the stakeholder insights, looking at what is going to be happening in the next five to 10 years to make sure that we're building our development programs with that insight and understanding the importance of biomarkers and personalized medicine as we develop these different therapeutic areas. We also take a look at our pipeline from a total perspective to understand the risk profile. And that's an area that we continue to focus on as we make investments in the various therapeutic areas. What's absolutely critical for our pipeline is to have very strong scientific expertise and commercial insights, and this is an area that we continue to focus on. We have five therapeutic areas, all large, with significant unmet medical needs. And we've looked at these both from an internal development standpoint, as well as an external. And just to give you some perspective as we think about this in terms of bolstering our pipeline, we have looked at external opportunities in the area of oncology. We acquired Cougar Biotechnology for abiraterone acetate. In the area of Alzheimer's disease, we entered a collaboration with Elan and Pfizer to look at how we can take bapineuzumab to the market. In the area of HIV, recognizing there was a broader opportunity if we had a fixed-dose combination, we partnered with Gilead. And in the area of vaccines, it was really the identification of the opportunity to get into prevention to strengthen our emerging market capabilities. And also, strengthening our infectious disease, we entered into a collaboration last year with Crucell, and then recently this year, we just announced the intent to acquire the additional 82% of the shares in that, and hope to close that acquisition in 2011. I think this gives you a perspective on the flexibility, and how we're thinking about building our pipeline, whether it be an acquisition or a partnership or internal development. When we look at our pipeline, it's a very robust pipeline. We have a lot going on in the various therapeutic areas. If we take a look at line extensions and other areas to build our pipeline, what you can see is that we also have some very meaningful line extensions for our pipeline. We have a very, very aggressive fourth quarter if you see the list of planned filing. So, we have a lot going on this second half of this year. Now what I'd like to do is spend a few minutes talking about some of the key assets, first of all, abiraterone acetate. This is a product that we acquired through the Cougar Biotechnology acquisition. It has a tremendous opportunity to make a difference for people with prostate cancer. We have actually two clinical trials. The first was chemo-refractory patients, people who have failed chemo for advanced metastatic prostate cancer. We had the review of interim data by an independent advisory committee. This trial was stopped because the overall survival was significant. So, what we're seeing is that in the case with the treatment arm of abiraterone, significant improvement in overall survival versus the placebo arm. We are very aggressively working to file by year-end. We have a second trial for chemo-na�ve patients, and what we're planning there is potentially filing in 2012 based on an interim review by an independent panel of the overall survival data in 2012. Bapineuzumab is for the treatment of Alzheimer's. Obviously, it probably has the greatest potential for disease modification. It will be the first in class. This is an area that we have a tremendous opportunity to make a difference for patients. If you look at the cost associated with Alzheimer's disease, it's estimated in the U.S. to be about $150 billion, so a tremendous opportunity. We have four trials underway in partnership with Pfizer. We are running the U.S. trials. We essentially completed the enrollment in the main study, and we're continuing to enroll in the biomarker sub-studies, and we anticipate filing in 2012 to 2013. Rivaroxaban, we're very excited about this compound. It has an opportunity to make a huge difference in people's lives. This is an area where we've invested significantly in partnership with Bayer. We have about 60,000-plus patients enrolled in clinical studies. We're focusing on five indications, and I'll briefly talk about the first three. The first one is VTE prevention. This is for hip or knee replacement surgery. And we had data last year where we showed superiority versus enoxaparin. We had a Complete Response letter, and we are right now in the process of responding back to the FDA for the Complete Response, and we'll have that filed by year-end. VTE treatment, we have three Phase 3 trials underway or are in the process of these being completed or underway. We just recently announced the DVT trial, where we showed non-inferiority versus standard of care, which was enoxaparin followed by vitamin K antagonists, so very good results, and we're in the process of completing the EINSTEIN-PE study, and we'll file in 2012 once we have all Phase 3 trials complete. Stroke prevention is a very large trial. We have 14,000 patients enrolled. We plan to present the results of this in November, November 15th at the AHA meeting; and very excited about this opportunity and plan to file later this year. This is a double blinded product test versus Warfarin. We are very excited about this opportunity. And again, we hope to present the results in November at the AHA meeting. And we have two other indications for medically ill and ACS, both on track. Canagliflozin is an opportunity in the area of diabetes, treatment of Type 2 diabetes. It's an SGLT 2 inhibitor. We presented Phase 2B data at the ADA meeting earlier this year. We have nine ongoing Phase 3 studies, and we have over 10,000 patients enrolled at this point. And we'll be planning to file in 2012 both in the U.S. and Europe. Telaprevir is a terrific opportunity in the treatment of hepatitis C. We're partnering this asset with Vertex. It's a potential first-in-class protease inhibitor. We have all Phase 3 studies completed at this point. All have met their primary objectives, importantly both for treatment na�ve patients, as well as treatment failure patients. They all showed significantly higher SVR rates. We also had a very low rate of discontinuation. And we're seeing that there's a significant reduction in treatment time, particularly for the na�ve patients. We'll be filing in Europe at the end of 2010, this year. [TMC] 435 is also a product in the treatment of hepatitis C. This is one that we think is a next-generation protease inhibitor that has the potential for increased patient satisfaction and potentially better adherence. We've completed three Phase 2B studies. We've got two that were enrolled for na�ve patients. And we showed very, very strong viral load reduction, as well as a good safety profile, and we're in the process of completing the treatment of the failure segment of this study. TMC 278 is for the treatment of HIV. This is an oral combination. It's an NNRTI, once daily. We also are working with Gilead on this for a fixed-dose combination. We've had two Phase 3 trials with treatment na�ve patients. And both trials have met study objectives, which is non-inferiority versus efavirenz, and we're also seeing very strong tolerability versus efavirenz. We've filed the single agents in Europe, and the U.S. in third quarter. Gilead has filed the fixed-dose combination in Europe and plans to file the fixed-dose combination in the U.S. in fourth quarter of this year. So as we think about our portfolio, one of the things � I talked a lot about compounds. But what's really important is as we look at our portfolio is to understand the pipelines from a therapeutic are a perspective. As we look at infectious disease, it's a matter of going from HIV. We've built it based on resistance and our understanding, broadening into 278 and going beyond that into hepatitis C and going even more broadly into infectious disease, whether it be tuberculosis or in the area of vaccines. And so that's how we're thinking about our pipeline and making sure that we're continuing to have the scientific capability, and the commercial expertise to broaden. In the area of immunology platform, another good example where we've gone from REMICADE, where we've built out indications; we've gone to new targets, as in the case of STELARA, which was a new mechanism of action, and continuing looking at other areas of unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases. So if we think about our pipeline and look at it from this perspective and we go across the five different therapeutic areas, it's making sure that we continue to build our capabilities in all of these individual areas. Now talking about geographic presence, just a couple comments; I'm going to focus on emerging markets and also, talk briefly about Japan. Emerging markets, our key focus is on China. We are focused on developing market appropriate products, whether we do that internally or through partnerships. We're also working closely with government and other key stakeholders to ensure that we're working through the major healthcare reform initiatives in getting our products to patients. In the area of emerging markets, we're also looking at partnerships in places like India and MEWA where we're working with branded generic manufacturers to actually increase our local product portfolio. So, we're bringing in our existing global products, but also working with other partners that have local products that address key needs. In the area of Japan, a very, very large market; you can see a $128 billion market, strong growth rates. If we look at our pipeline there, we have an unprecedented number of new products in 2011. We have a very strong pipeline, and we're working both on our own, as well as in partnerships with people like Takeda, where we're working in collaboration on VELCADE, as well as galantamine. This just gives you a snapshot of our pipeline in Japan. One of the key points is not only are we looking at products that are specific to the market, we're also in our global clinical programs as we're developing new products making sure that we have Japan in early. So, we're developing global clinical programs to ensure that there's not a lag between our launches in the western world and Japan. So if you look at our pipeline and think about the areas of focus, what the key takeaways are is that our Pharmaceuticals business is an attractive business. We're building momentum and revitalizing our portfolio; executing well against our strategies, both driving share and growth of our launch products; accelerating growth in key areas for emerging markets; and importantly, spending time focused on building our pipeline. And all of this is achievable and is through our foundation, which is the strong people that we have throughout our organization throughout Johnson & Johnson. Thank you. \n",
