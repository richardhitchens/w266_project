Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger earnings conference call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant.
Please go ahead.
Simon Farrant
Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results
conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting
yesterday.
Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial
Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and
then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.
However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the
statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause
our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filings
and other SEC filings.

Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represents decreases of $0.13
sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year.
During the quarter, we recorded $2.1 billion of pre-tax charges. These charges are the direct result of the very
challenging market conditions we are operating in and include severance, impairment and restructuring charges. The
asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business which, as you know, has been the hardest hit
during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release.
Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately one-third of the revenue decline
was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax
operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and
proactive cost management across the entire organization.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2
billion decreased 7% sequentially while margin decreased 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to
decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted Wireline International. We also did not see the year-end surge
in multi-client and software sales that we typically experience in Q4.
Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines
internationally that have mostly affected Drilling & Measurement and M-I SWACO. As the result of strong cost
management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%.
Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10%, primarily due to the continued decline in land activity and
further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group margins were essentially flat at 11.3% as SPM projects
and higher earnings from our investment in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing
pressure.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 18.2% in the fourth
quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the
geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world, as well the favorable resolution of certain
tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter. Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016
to be around 20%. On a pro forma basis, we expect the combined company ETR to be in the low 20%s, although this
would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.
Our tax flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from
operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making
severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter. In light of
our strong tax flow generation, yesterday our board of directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program.
This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is
exhausted.
During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated $343 million to $5.5 billion, as we continue to invest in future revenue
streams. During the fourth quarter, we spent $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SPM
projects and $150 million in multi-client projects. Full-year 2016 CapEx, excluding multi-client and SPM investments,
is expected to be around $2.4 billion.

During the quarter, we spent $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite
being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about one month prior to the Cameron
shareholder vote.
Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital
structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S. subsidiary that we also refer to as
SHC, is the legal entity that will acquire Cameron. SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common
stock from its parent and transfer these shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also take cash of approximately $2.8
billion in connection with this transaction.
During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have a weighted average interest rate of
approximately 3.15% and have maturities ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use the proceeds from this debt
issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 137 million shares from the parent company.
SHC will then use a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowing to finance the difference between
the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger. As a
result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger's pre-tax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as
compared to Q4.
As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur merger and integration-related costs. These will include
transaction costs, the costs of the integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustment as well as one-off costs to
achieve the synergies. These amounts will be more significant in the quarter the transaction closes and the quarters
immediately following the merger. We will separately call out these charges for you as are incurred.
And now, I will turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with
global overproduction of oil continuing, extending the various trends in global oil inventories and causing a further fall
in oil prices which reached a 12-year low in December. The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the
deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompted operators to make further cuts to the already
low E&P investment levels.
For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the halfway point of the
fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancellations, creating an operating environment that is
increasingly complex to navigate and where the traditional year-end product and multi-client seismic sales were largely
muted. As planned, we implemented another significant adjustment to our cost and resource base during the fourth
quarter, including the release of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overhead, infrastructure, and
asset base.
In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were in some areas impacted by
events that were either outside of our control or where we chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending
availability of additional customer budgets in the new year. However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we had
made the necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we are well positioned to continue to deliver
solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year
for our industry.
Looking closer at our fourth quarter results, global revenue fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig
activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations, together with a broad range of activity
disruptions, project delays, and cancellations. In North America, revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is in line
with the reduction in the drilling rig count and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows together with the
extended holiday period.

Our North American pre-tax operating margins remained very resilient at 7.1%, driven by proactive cost and resource
management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution, and new
technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program.
On land in both the U.S. and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product
lines and in particular in pressure pumping, where pricing levels dropped further into unsustainable territory for both
operating margins and cash flow. We also saw continued pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico, as the drilling rig count dropped by another 2% sequentially and where year-end multi-client seismic sales
were largely muted.
Turning to the international markets, revenue was 6% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts, the start of the
seasonal winter slowdown, and the absence of the traditional year-end product and multi-client seismic sales all
impacted results. Our fourth quarter international operating margins dropped to 22%, driven by further pricing pressure
and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.
In Latin America, revenue declined 1% sequentially, with pre-tax operating margins improving by 229 basis points to
23%. In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by further budget reductions in Colombia
and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact on our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina. Margins
remained resilient across the area, as the cost and resource base adjustments made during the previous quarter took full
effect and as we continued to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent
pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base.
In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to
20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble, the start of the
seasonal winter slowdown in Russia, and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region all impacted
the results. In Europe, activity in Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in
Continental Europe and the UK. While in Africa, solid activity in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the
further weakening in Central and West Africa.
In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially while pre-tax operating margins decreased by 448
basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, where we saw a general weakening in activity
throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where projects ended and customer
budgets were cut further. Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where solid activity in Kuwait and
Iraq was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region.
In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partially offset by adjustments to our cost and
resource base and where project cancellations, delayed startup of new projects, and activity disruptions due to 2015
budget limitations all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins.
Our fourth quarter results cap a year where we have faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years but where we,
through proactive management and strong execution, have shown that we can navigate the challenging operating
environment better than most, and produced solid financial results while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and
capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the company.
So as we prepare for another very challenging year, I would like to summarize what we have delivered in 2015, as this
sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come.
Looking first at the top line, full-year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America, where
we have further strengthened our market position in spite of our decision not to pursue work that falls outside of our
financial return requirements.
Our international revenue fell by 21% in 2015, which is comparable to the drop in E&P investments. Included in this
revenue drop is both the impact of our higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater, and seismic markets, where
E&P investments saw significantly higher reductions and also included the impact of a strong dollar against a number
of foreign currencies. These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our

international business a highly compressed coiled spring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and
customer activity starts recovering.
In addition to this, we have in the past year significantly increased our tender win rate, which further strengthens our
very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward.
Looking at 2015 profitability, full-year global operating margins fell by only 342 basis points to 18.4%, as we
maintained our wide margin lead in the international markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap
in North America. We have managed to protect our margins due to a very proactive approach to cost and resource
management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together, these actions have delivered
decremental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns.
Turning next to cash, our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents net income conversion rate of
114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of D&A, in addition to investments of $1.4
billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SPM and multi-client seismic. Our ability to generate free cash in this
part of the cycle is unmatched in the oilfield services industry and gives us a unique ability to capitalize on the
significant business opportunities that the current market conditions present.
From our free cash flow, we have returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend
payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buybacks. In addition to this, we have spent about $500 billion on M&A,
where we continue to target smaller disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future
workloads and deploy through our extensive global organization. The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen
from our net debt level, which has only increased by $160 million on a full-year basis, driven by the financial
performance I have just described.
With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed and we are fully
ready for day one. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016 and we have already received
antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia, and Brazil. The fact that we structured the deal to include 78% of
stock provides us with the necessary insulation from the ongoing market turmoil and during the fourth quarter, we also
secured the required financing for our U.S. entity that will make the acquisition.
Turning next to people, we have in the past year unfortunately had to release more than 34,000 employees, which
represents an unprecedented number for the company, and where we all have been impacted as we are going through
the disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the company. I am at this stage optimistic
that we have completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn and I look forward to being able to shed
focus throughout our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work
through the remaining challenges of this downturn.
In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capabilities and ensure
the progress of all our key projects. In the past year, we made solid advances on several new technology fronts through
a combination of organic and inorganic efforts, and we look forward to update you further on this in our external
communications in the coming year.
And lastly, in 2015 we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment
levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and
granular three-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units with specific deliverables and business
impact goals set at all levels in our organization. In parallel with this, we have delivered noticeable cost savings and
efficiency gains that can be seen in our 2016 financial results, together with a 23% reduction in our customer NPT
rates, which is a largest annual improvement we have ever achieved.
In summary, while 2015 has been an extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we have clearly
demonstrated our ability to navigate the complex landscape and capitalize on the opportunities the current business
environment presents, and we are fully prepared to repeat these efforts and achievements in 2016. So while we all look
forward to a recovery in the oil price and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current
market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a company relative to our competitors when the upturn

ultimately comes.
Turning next to the market outlook, we still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to
tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are
starting to take effect. In North America, shale oil production is declining more or less as we expected and was in
December below the levels from one year ago.
The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is in many cases driven by producers
opening the taps wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see higher decline rates after
these short-term actions are exhausted. So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by fears of reduced
growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional Iranian exports and the continued various trends in global oil
inventories, we still expect a positive movement in oil prices during 2016, with specific timing being a function of the
shape of the non-OPEC decline rates. This means that the market outlook for oilfield services in the coming quarters
will remain challenging, as the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue. It also means that 2016 E&P
investment levels will fall for a second successive year and that any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a
2017 event.
Still at Schlumberger, we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings,
and through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we are
currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior
earnings and margins, and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow.
Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much and congrats with another relatively great year with free cash flow and
solid performance.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you, Ole.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Thanks.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: When it comes to the macro outlook that you just painted, how should we think about the overall
oilfield macro cycle, and relative to the internal momentum that you're creating within Schlumberger with respect to
the ongoing transformation process, I presume that a lot of the lowest-hanging fruit has been picked on transformation
process, so if you could just bring us up to speed about how we should think about earnings projections over the next
couple of quarters, several quarters, with respect to those two kind of factors?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at our earnings trajectory in the coming quarters, it is obviously largely going to be
driven by what continues to happen in the market around us in terms of spend from our customers. But if you look at
our ability to, I would say, counter the significant pricing pressure as well as the activity reductions, the transformation
is indeed playing a significant role.
I think it's fair to say, like you say, that a lot of the low-hanging fruit we have already picked. But we are now getting
into the deeper part of the transformation where we are making significant structural changes to how we go about doing
our work and conducting our business. And this is basically laid out in the three-year plan that we worked on in 2015,
which is going to take us from 2016 all the way out to 2018. And here we have broken down all the initiatives into
specific actions and plans and targets for all the various business units we have around the world. And I think with this
I would say formalized way of driving performance, I think we should look to put even more impact into our results in

the coming three years than what you've seen in the previous years.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay, I'll take that. With respect to the free cash flow that you generated and clearly having a
strong balance sheet today is, I would imagine, worth an awful lot when it comes to the bargaining power that you have
around the world. So how should we think about the opportunity around generating that or putting that to work as
internal CapEx versus SPM, which I saw you just picked up a bit now again in the fourth quarter and versus
acquisitions?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: First of all, we continue to have a very strong focus on generating the cash. And I think 2015
was another solid year. It was not perfect. There were several things that I think we could have done better, but $5
billion of free cash flow in this environment is not bad. Now, how we go about spending the cash, there's really no
change to the philosophy that we've had in any part of the cycle. The first thing we look to is to reinvest into the
business and that is CapEx for the service and product segments that we have.
In 2016, we are going to keep CapEx flat with 2015, and that you may ask why. If you look at the base business, it is
indeed coming down but we have certain new activities that we are looking to invest into, in particular the land drilling
market for the regular future, and there's a few other strategic investments that we are looking to make when it comes
to our internal CapEx.
In addition to this, we continue to invest in future revenue streams, both multi-client seismic where we have a
significant program going on in Mexico, and at this stage of the cycle there are also significant SPM opportunities and
we have really stepped up our efforts in screening and evaluating these opportunities, and we will capitalize on them
when they need our internal requirements.
Beyond this, we review dividends annually. We are not increasing dividends this year and then beyond that, for the
coming year, it's going to be a balancing of the opportunities we have on M&A and the opportunities we have to buy
back our stock. That is how we are planning to spend the cash. Simon, you want to add something?
<A - Simon Ayat>: No, I think you've summarized it very well. I guess 2016 is going to be marked by the big event of
integrating Cameron and there is a lot of transaction as I described. We borrowed $6 billion and we will be paying for
the acquisition. We're also issuing shares but we have the $10 billion in new programs that we will commence as soon
as we exhaust the previous one.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - James West>: Hey, good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - James West>: And congratulations also on just excellent execution really all year for you and your management
team and all your employees, especially in the fourth quarter.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you very much.
<Q - James West>: I wanted to follow up a little bit on what you were talking about there in the second part of Ole's
question about really the SPM business. It seems – I did notice the pickup in the fourth quarter that's probably project
timing, but at this point, are you chasing more projects? Are you getting more inbounds? And you talked a little bit
about or you mentioned that your screening process had been updated or upgraded. Could you talk a little bit more
about that and how you see this plan out over the next couple of quarters, couple of years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, we are seeing significantly more SPM opportunities at this stage of the cycle given our
ability to generate cash and given the status of our balance sheet. So we haven't changed our screening process, but we

have put more resources into it so we can process more of these opportunities, and we are prepared to step up our
investments in SPM.
As you noted, there was a step-up in Q4, and it might not be at that level every quarter going forward, but I would say
that going into 2016, SPM is an area that we are interested in investing further in. It provides us with solid long-term
contracts. It provides us with the ability to deploy our entire capability set and generate good returns and good cash for
the company, so it's a very interesting opportunity set for us that we are actively pursuing.
<Q - James West>: Okay. And then maybe another follow-up. The press release was littered with technology success
stories. And it seems like the technology adoption rate has picked up significantly during the downturn. I know you've
given out numbers before on sales – percentage of sales on new technologies. Could you give us an update there on
what you're seeing on the adoption rate and if that percentage has improved?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: During this downturn, the level of new technology sales, which is basically technologies that
we have commercialized in the past five years, is at a significantly higher level than what we've seen in previous
downturns. The new technology sales as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 is 24%, which is markedly higher than
what we saw in the previous downturn in 2008 – 2009. This is partly down to the broad range of technologies that we
have and the fact that a number of them are focused on driving, I would say, cost and efficiency for our customers. And
these type of technologies are as valid in terms of being bought and being operated during the downturn as they are in
the upturn. So strong sales, and we continued to commercialize new technologies during 2015. So this obviously has
had a very good impact on our financial performance in the past year, and I expect it to continue to do that in the year
to come.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: I echo the sentiment of a very solid quarter for the quarter and for the year given business
conditions, so well done. Maybe, Paal, we can go a little bit more granular on thoughts. And obviously 2016 is a
question mark, but thoughts into Q1 on a geomarket basis, and walk us through where you're thinking on the revenue
and margin side, if you will.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I'm not going to review detail by area, Angie. What I think we're going to do – if you're
looking for an indication of what we plan for and how we see Q1 shaping up, it's going to be another very challenging
quarter, both from an activity and a pricing standpoint. The recent new lows in oil prices is going to be reflected in
lower rig count and more activity disruptions, we believe. This is going to be continued budget pressure throughout the
first half from all customer groups, where they now have to operate within cash flow. In addition, we're going to see the
winter slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere in Q1, which is going to be another activity headwind.
So I would say that rather than going into margins and revenue, if we focus in on EPS, I would say that the current Q1
EPS consensus is probably a best case scenario from what we can see today in terms of Q1 earnings.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, that's helpful. And then on Cameron, I know there's only so much you can say at this
point, but if you have any further color you can talk about on the opportunity set within Cameron as you move forward,
but also talk us through or walk us through the integration of Cameron within Schlumberger, both operationally and
how it will show up in the financials.

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Right, so on the status of the integration, we are largely ready with our integration plans.
We've had a sizable team made up of both Cameron and Schlumberger employees working diligently on preparing
these plans since we announced the transaction back in August. We reviewed all the plans in December and they have
been approved, and we are basically ready for day one at this stage. Closing is now basically pending a few more
countries in terms of antitrust approvals, and we do expect that we will close during the first quarter.
In terms of synergies, the detail work that we've done has really confirmed the numbers that we put up at the
announcement. Lots of opportunities, which initially are going to be cost focused. But this transaction is largely a
revenue transaction, and we are very excited about what we can do by joining the R&D forces of the two companies
and creating the integrated drilling and production systems that we have laid out earlier.
In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it will actually be a fairly simple task because Cameron as it is
today will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger, together with Characterization, Drilling, and Production.
And Scott Rowe, the CEO of Cameron, is going to join us and continue to head up Cameron in its present form. So the
main thing we will focus in on in terms of integration initially is going to be to coordinate the customer interface and to
streamline the back office and also then morph or merge over time the R&D organization. So it is a relatively simple
integration, because Cameron will slide in, in its present form into Schlumberger as a fourth group.

Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Good morning. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions and some discussions with
investors around the SPM dynamic, and in that context, Paal, just given the decline in oil prices year to date and the
write-down on the project in Colombia, there are some questions out there just relating to potential incremental risk
around existing SPM projects. And maybe you could put that into the context of maybe how you assess risk on varying
projects and maybe how you look at it from a portfolio approach.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Right, so if you want to, let's start off with the write-down we did in Colombia, which is really
an isolated event. This is a project that's been going on there between 10 and 15 years. We're in the later years of the
project, and it's really the only project at this stage in our portfolio that has our compensation directly linked to the oil
price. So with only a few years left and the oil price being at a very low level, this is what caused the impairment of the
remaining balance we have.
If you look at the rest of the portfolio and the new contracts that we've entered into in recent years, these are all
fee-per-barrel type of contracts, where obviously the project economics are linked to the oil price, but where our
compensation is basically an isolated fee-per-barrel setup. So as with any of these projects, they do carry a higher risk
than what our base business does. But we are, I would say, very comfortable with being able to, I would say, identify
and manage these risks. And with the screening process we have with the internal approval process that we have, I'm
very comfortable with the setup we have in terms of the projects that we take on and that these all will generate very
good returns for the company. And I would also say that the project in Colombia overall provided also very good
returns and good cash flow throughout the life of the project.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Right, that's great color. Then maybe if I could follow up just on the margin front, if I understand
correctly, you guys are trying to manage your business such that you can maintain a 20% margin maybe internationally
here at the trough and maybe 5% in the North American market. I know a lot of that is being driven by your
transformation process. Given the drop that we've had recently in oil price and the impact that will have on E&P spend
drop in 2016, how much harder do you think it's going to be to maybe maintain those targets?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Obviously, fighting the margin pressure with both dramatic reductions in activity and
significant pricing pressure is tough. We have the added tool in our toolkit, which is the transformation, on top of a
very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing. But it's tough to maintain margins at the levels that we
currently see. I'm very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year, and
7.1% in Q4, I think, is excellent. It's going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels, but with the energy and the
focus our team on the ground in North America has, I'm optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the
rest of the field there.
If you look at the international margins, they are actually holding up reasonably well. We are now six quarters into the
downturn internationally and we are only 253 basis points down, which is basically half what we saw in 2009 in the last
downturn, but it's a very dynamic environment and there's always going to be quarterly variations driven by unplanned
events. And if you look at land for an example, we had a big drop in Q3 and we managed to close that back in Q4 as
some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect.
Now in Q4, we did see a significant impact on our MEA margins and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent
activity reduction, but there is also a significant part which is temporary, which is down to delays and stoppages. And if
you look at the team we have on the ground, they have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order
to offset some of these margin headwinds. So I can't promise you that we're going to get all the margins back in MEA,
but I would say that the MEA team is clearly unhappy having been surpassed by the LAM team as the most profitable
area, so I really look forward to the internal competition between these two.

open. Check your mute button.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Great, thank you. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Paal, you mentioned a couple of times the three-year transformation plan and I imagine
you'll go into more detail in April, but can you just broad-stroke the key categories that were identified as new areas of
opportunity in the three-year plan?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: There are no new areas that we have identified. What we're doing with the three-year plan is
that in the past couple of years, there has been a lot of work done in the central theme, formulate the detailed concepts
and principles of how we want to change – how we operate our business. And these initiatives and these concepts are
all now fully mature and they come together with the change management process that we have also put a lot of effort
into designing. And what we're doing with the three-year plan is basically formalizing how each of these initiatives will
now be translated into actions and results throughout the global organization.
So in the past couple of years, we have been pursuing the low-hanging fruit. We are now going into the structural
changes of our business that would also provide an additional set of savings and improvements in the years to come.
But the focus is around asset and inventory management, it's maintenance and repairs, transportation distribution,
supply chain, back office, quality assurance. It's all the things that we've talked about in previous years, but it's now
being formalized and itemized down to the business unit levels. We have around 600 business units down to the
country level, and they all now have specific actions and targets on each of these line items to implement the changes
that we have been preparing centrally for the past few years.

<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Okay, and as we think about the financial impact, is order of magnitude similar to the
low-hanging fruit? It's just the timing in terms of the flow-through of the impact may take a little longer? How do we
think about the implications on the financials?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I would say the impact of the transformation going forward will at least be as big as it's
been in previous years and probably even higher in the years to come as we really start changing fundamental parts of
how we conduct business, right? So this is not decreasing. I would say it's stable to increasing in terms of impact going
forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Obviously the Cameron-Schlumberger-OneSubsea JV has been a big success that led to
marriage and now you're doing an MoU with Golar and looking at gas monetization solutions. Can you talk about how
far the breadth – how far this takes you, the Schlumberger Octopus grabs another segment of business? Can you talk a
little bit about where this should go and why you did it?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: This is an MoU where we had good discussions about the concepts of how we can combine
some of our capabilities and efforts with the capabilities that Golar has and this is something that we will continue to
work with them going forward. It is an interesting, I would say, combination and I don't have a lot of comments beyond
this at this stage other than that it is a partnership that we are looking to establish and to grow going forward.
<Q - James Wicklund>: Okay. And just again, breadth you've got now subsea, you've got equipment, you're doing gas
monetization. Kurt and James asked about the SPM business. You had said before in previous conference calls that
you'd embrace a number of different business models. Is this the fruition of those kind of statements?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I would say it is. But with all of this, it doesn't change the fact that the main part of our
business is, I would say, oilfield services and products and equipment. So we will continue to focus on leading each
individual market that we participate in for individual products and services, but with the integration capabilities and
with the ability we have to pursue different type of business models, we are also looking to combine all of these things,
like you indicate, Jim, to create more business opportunities for the company. So we are not pursuing only these. We
have a huge focus on making sure that we stand out and we continue to drive performance in the base business, but
when you combine all of these things, there is a broad range of opportunities for us that we're also pursuing.
<Q - James Wicklund>: That's very helpful. And my follow-up, if I could, are we willing to take the chance and say
that 2016 could be the bottom of the cycle or do you guys think today that 2017 will be worse than 2016?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think it's too early to say, Jim, but I don't currently think that 2017 is going to be worse.
But with that said, I'm still not ready to say that we are troughing in 2016. We're focusing in on executing basically
quarter-by-quarter. I'm still optimistic and I would hope that 2016 is the trough, but I'm not ready to rule on it yet.
<Q - James Wicklund>: We'll keep our fingers crossed as well. Thanks, sir, very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Back to SPM, I'm curious with regard to the projects that you're seeing. Is there any
change with regard to the kind of projects that you're seeing now on a leading-edge basis, more offshore versus
onshore? And then moreover, with regard to as you evaluate these projects recognizing they're fee-per-barrel on the one
hand, there must be an embedded oil price assumed as you're looking at these projects in terms of threshold oil prices
required for the NSC to commit capital if it is an NSC partner on these. So can you talk about the mix of projects, how
it's changed and embedded oil prices associated with the capital allocation?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Right. So on the projects, there is no shift in what the projects are. We are looking at a certain
set of projects. These are relatively small compared to what our customers would be interested in. And they are
generally late-life fields where we can come in and try to change the decline curve and add reserves and production to
the field in late life. We are generally focused on land and the only thing I would say is that the opportunity set has
increased, there are more customers that are coming to us now that have these type of fields and are interested in doing
these type of business models with us. So there is not a dramatic shift in the type of assets that we're looking at, but it's
generally just more of them.
And for the fields that we enter into contracts on, obviously we will have to look at the total economics of the field for
the lifetime of the contract, which is generally, I would say, at least 15 years. So in that, it's obviously important that
the total project is economical, and then the way we set up our contract is today generally on the fee-per-barrel, where
we are, I would say, insulated against variations in oil price. That being said, if it goes down, we don't get hit at all, but
again, we are leading the upside to our customers if oil prices are higher than what is in the assumptions. So we have a
very, I would say, solid process of evaluating this, and like I said earlier in the call, we are actively pursuing these type
of contracts where we can get the terms that we want contractually and where we are satisfied that the reservoir holds
the upside both in production and reserves.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay. And another one for me. Sort of an extension of Jim's question in terms of
testing the boundaries as to how broad – how plausibly broad your business model extends to, and that is, are you
contemplating or evaluating anything on the clean technology front?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, not at this stage. I mean we continue to – I mean if you look at minimizing the
environmental impact of what we do as a company and our carbon footprint, absolutely. We have several programs in
place, both in terms of how we conduct business as well as how we develop new technologies on this. But in terms of
venturing outside of our current base, which is oilfield services, there's no plans of doing that at this stage.
<Q - William Andrew Herbert>: Okay, thank you.

<Q - J. David Anderson>: Great, thank you. Question on kind of your Middle East, Asia-Pac business. Obviously,

going on. Asia-Pac is also probably down, probably also getting hit pretty hard as well. Can you help us understand
some of those and how much of this one-time you think on the quarter?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I tried to answer that earlier, David, on the call. And I would just say that yes, MEA margins
dropped a fair bit in Q4, but there are variations in terms of operations, of activity, that you will basically get some
variations in the margins going forward. I gave LAM as the example.
Now, there is significant pricing pressure. There is lower activity in parts of MEA, but there are also some temporary
aspects of what happened in the quarter, with delays of big projects in terms of the startup, where we had significant
resources standing by. And there were also some customers that stopped activity during the quarter because they were
running out of annual budgets. And these budgets are going to be replenished now in January, in which case we
decided to carry the cost and the resources. So I cannot promise you that we will regain all the losses in Q4 in terms of
margins, but lots of actions in place to try to repeat what we've done in LAM over the course of 2015.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Those operational disruptions, do you think a lot of those are going to come back in the
first quarter?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Some of them will, yes, and we know which ones they are, and those are the ones we carry the
resources for. And for the ones that aren't, we also know what they are, in which case we have been cutting the
resources.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: And then on the pricing concessions part you've been talking about and you talked about
last quarter as well, is this on new work that's being tendered, or is this pricing concessions on existing contracts?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's a combination. When you tender for new work, you will need to assess what the going rate
in the market is. And in some cases you get the opportunity to hang on to the existing contracts or even extend them,
provided there are some concessions given. So this is a combination.
<Q - J. David Anderson>: Okay, and with the transformation, does the transformation you think offset pricing over
time, largely?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at internationally in 2015, we have managed to offset internationally quite a lot of
it. Can we do all of it? That's probably going to be tough. But it is a significant counter to the pricing pressure that
we're seeing, yes.

<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Paal, I was hoping before we ended the call that perhaps you could just speak generally about
customer expectations internationally in terms of CapEx for 2016. Do you guys have a bottoms-up view yet at this
point in terms of the size of the decline we could see as we try to think about calibrating your overall top line
international revenue declines potentially for 2016?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at 2015, international spend was down about 20%, and then there's a range of
surveys out now from third parties. And you average a consensus from these surveys, it's about, I would say, more than
a 10% reduction in international spend. So if you go by these, then yes, it will be another challenging year. But also, I
think when we look at full-year numbers, I think it's also important to keep in mind the five or six-quarter slide we have

seen now in international E&P spend, where we have had a significant drop in our revenue from Q4 of 2014 to Q4 of
this year and into Q1 of 2016.
So while the year-over-year numbers for full year matters, I think it's also important to look at the quarter levels we
have now, which is obviously significant down. And actually, if you do the Q1 revenue consensus for us, based on
what you guys as analysts have done, four times that is already 17% down overall in revenue for us. So in that sense,
the current level of activity in spend is already way down on a full-year basis going forward.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay, thanks for that. I guess, Simon, one for you. Given the pending Cameron acquisition
here in first quarter, is there any blackout period on Schlumberger being able to buy back stock as we approach that
close?

And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Hey, thanks, guys. I have a question for Simon, and more on the currency side as continuing
there. It looks like you've done a really good job so far this year on managing the currency risk, so I'd just like to
understand. How do you manage the currency risk in SPM projects, especially as you ramp those? And then if you
could, just help us. You quantified the revenue impact from currency this year. Can you help us with the international
margin impact from how well you manage the currency?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Okay, thanks, last question. But let me just take overall the currency situation. As far as our
international operation, overall we have a natural hedge, which what it means is basically we match the revenue that we
get in local currency. It is in line with our local costs in local currencies. It varies between jurisdictions. So in some
areas, we lose a bit on the currency but then gains in other places compensate for it.
In 2015, you've seen the numbers. We've lost a lot of revenue because of currency. Almost 20% of the reduction of
revenue between 2014 to 2015 was currency, but actually did not impact the margin significantly. So it is all
international, yes. There is a bit of Canada, but the rest is outside NAM. And we manage it, as I said, it is natural
hedge. We prevent ourselves from taking more local currency than we consume locally for local cost.
As far as SPM is concerned, normally most of our SPM projects actually are dollar-based revenue-wise, and those that
have local currency, they will basically reflect the same policy that I just mentioned to you, that we don't take more
than what we locally require for our cost and the third party that it is also bigger in SPM project. So naturally, we are
naturally hedged. Is that good?
<Q - Daniel J. Boyd>: Yes, so that are you saying that your margins didn't benefit from the currency? If your EBIT
held up this year, you could have a few hundred basis point benefit in your margin. Is that accurate?
<A - Simon Ayat>: No, look, the currency, the big impact of the currency this last year was one, because of Venezuela
because we changed the currency rate, but otherwise did not impact us on the margins.

Thank you, Simon.
So before we close this morning, I'd just like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed.
First, the business environment in the oil industry weakened further in the fourth quarter leading to additional
reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 the worst industry downturn since 1986. In spite of this,
we delivered strong full-year performance compared to previous downturns, generating $5 billion in free cash flow and
returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition, we spent $500 million
on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio and yet we increased our net debt by only $160 million.
Second, 2016 will be another challenging year, during which we will aim to continue to deliver superior financial
results in parallel with pursuing and capitalizing on the broad opportunity set the current market environment presents.
We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term and continue to believe that the
underlying balance of supply and demand is tightening, driven by growth in demand, weakening supply as the massive
cuts in E&P measurements take further effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge.
Lastly, we look forward to closing our merger with Cameron International during the first quarter where the integration
planning is largely complete for day one and with antitrust approvals all progressing on track. We are excited about
what the combination of our two companies will bring and look forward to joining forces with the more than 20,000
Cameron employees.
Overall, we remain confident in our ability to continue to weather this downturn better than our surroundings through
our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and the extent of our corporate transformation program. That
concludes the call. Thank you very much for attending.
