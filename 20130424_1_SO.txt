information we released this morning, as well as the slides for this conference call.
Please note that today's call and webcast are audio only, which means we will not be displaying slides during the
presentation. You can follow along by accessing the slides posted on our Investor Relations website at
www.southerncompany.com.
Tom will open today's call with an update on Plant Vogtle and the Kemper project and Art will then provide an
overview of our first quarter financial results, as well as a discussion on sales and the economy. After closing remarks
from Tom, we'll move to Q&A.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. During the first quarter of 2013, Southern Company continued to fulfill
our primary mission of providing clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy and doing what's best for customers in the
communities we serve. An important component to this work is the progress we're making with our major construction
projects. At Plant Vogtle unit 3, we recently completed the placement of basemat structural concrete for the nuclear
island, pouring approximately 7,000 cubic yards of concrete in 41 hours. At unit 4, the nuclear island foundation is now
complete and column setting is underway. The full outlines of both nuclear islands have been completed to grade level
and overall construction on the units is more than 40% complete. As you can see on the slide over the next quarter, we
expect to install rebar for unit 3 auxiliary building walls and also set the containment vessel bottom head and structural
steel for unit 3. We further expect to complete installation of the upper mud mats and begin nuclear island rebar for unit
4.
Georgia Power also received unanimous approval from the Georgia PSC on its seventh construction monitoring report
and recently filed a date report, which included the following: a request that the PSC verify and approve all costs,
totaling $209 million, incurred between July 1 and December 31 of 2012; a request to the PSC amend the existing
certificate to reflect revised commercial operation dates for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2018 for units 3 and 4
respectively, and a request that the PSC amend the existing certificate to reflect an increase in the projected total capital
cost from $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion, with the associated increase largely driven by schedule related costs as opposed to
brick-and-mortar costs, which remained stable; a projection of total impact on customer rates of between 6% and 8%,
once the units are in service; and finally, a determination that the extended construction schedule will not increase costs
to customers.
Meanwhile, progress continues at the Kemper project in Mississippi as we continue with startup activities. Last month,
consistent with the settlement agreement we reached in January, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a
two-step rate increase associated with the Kemper project. The settlement agreement contemplated a seven-year plan
with no further changes to base rates for Kemper project through 2020. And Mississippi Power recently made its
necessary filings with the Commission. This rate mitigation plan is expected to be addressed by the Commission this
fall.
We continue to make tremendous progress at the Kemper site. With most of the major components in place, the
combined cycles, gasifiers, massive gas absorbers and Iignite dome as well as a 75-acre reservoir, the facility's
appearance reflects our progress with startup activities, which are now 40% complete.
With the final engineering almost complete, the activities leading up to commercial operation includes a very
meticulous work of bringing the installed components together through sophisticated piping, cabling and control
equipment. Our current cost estimates for the project has increased, based primarily on matters related to piping. We've
improved the quality and increased the quantity of the pipe and increased the amount of labor needed to achieve our
in-service dates. Art will speak to the financial implications of the current estimate in a few minutes.
While disappointed with the estimated cost increases, we remain accountable to customers. In light of our agreements
with the Mississippi Public Service Commission, we will not seek recovery of these increased costs, which exceed the

$2.88 billion cost cap, established in the Commission's 2012 certification order, net of the DOE grants and cost cap
exceptions included in that order. Our current plan is only to seek recovery of the capital and variable cost components
already reflected in the seven-year rate plan recently filed with the PSC.
The revised construction cost estimate reflects the company's current analysis of the cost to complete the Kemper
project. We continue to believe that the scheduled in-service date is achievable. As with any project of this magnitude
and complexity, we will continue to evaluate the estimated project cost and schedule as we proceed towards completion
over the next year. We are proud of the TRIG technology being implemented at the Kemper project. This facility is
expected to produce energy, with a variable cost approaching the cost of nuclear, and with a carbon footprint less than a
similarly sized natural gas plant. We remain focused on bringing this 21st century coal project to successful completion
for the long-term benefit of our Mississippi customers. We will keep you posted as startup activities continue.
Meanwhile, we continue to expand our use of renewable energy sources with two major announcements taking place
just this week. The first of these is the acquisition by Southern Power and Turner Renewable Energy of our largest
solar installation to date, the 139-megawatt Campo Verde Solar Project, the partnership's fifth solar acquisition and its
first in California, Campo Verde more than doubles the Southern Company's system solar capacity. The project will be
built, operated and maintained by First Solar, a leading global provider of thin film photovoltaic systems and is
expected to begin operation this fall.
The second is an announcement by Georgia Power that it has entered into an agreement to purchase energy from two
wind farms in Southwest Oklahoma, with capacity totaling 250 megawatts, beginning in 2016. All of these projects
represent key elements in our ongoing effort to build a truly diversified generation portfolio, all for the benefit of the
customers and communities we serve.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for our financial and economic review.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. For the first quarter of 2013, we earned $0.09 per share, compared to $0.42 per share in the first quarter
of 2012, a decrease of $0.33 per share. Included in these results is an after-tax charge against earnings of $333 million
or $0.38 per share related to the current cost estimate for the Kemper project. As Tom mentioned, Mississippi Power
will not seek recovery of these estimated costs to complete the facility above the $2.88 billion cost cap, net of DOE
grants and exceptions to the cost cap.
Also included is an after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease
investment. Excluding these items, we earned $0.49 per share compared to $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2012,
an increase of $0.07 per share. Earnings drivers for the first quarter of 2013 can be viewed in detail on this slide.
However, two factors in particular influenced our year-over-year adjusted earnings: weather and retail revenue effects
at some of our traditional operating companies. Weather in the first quarter of 2013 added $0.05 per share to our
earnings compared with the first quarter of 2012. Weather is actually $0.01 per share below normal for the first quarter
of 2013 but that was compared with $0.06 below normal for the first quarter of 2012. Heating degree days during the
first quarter of 2013 were 54% higher than the first quarter of 2012. The other significant driver for the first quarter of
2013 was retail revenue effects at several of our traditional operating companies, which contributed $0.04 per share as
compared to the first quarter of 2012.
Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales results for the first quarter of 2013. Total weather normal retail sales for
the first quarter of 2013 decreased 0.9% compared with the first quarter of 2012. Weather normal residential sales
decreased 0.9%, weather normal commercial sales increased 0.4%, and industrial sales decreased 2.1% compared with
the first quarter of 2012. If total weather normal retail sales were adjusted to reflect one less day in the first quarter of
2013 due to the leap year in 2012, overall retail sales growth would have been closer to flat. If applied to each of the
respective customer classes, residential sales growth was essentially flat, commercial sales growth was more positive
than reported and industrial sales growth was roughly half as negative as the reported results.

Residential sales were affected positively by 13,000 new customers added in the first quarter of 2013. About half of
those new customers were new connects, further evidence of a rebounding housing market and a strengthening
economy across our four state service territory. Our economists have produced a recent analysis suggesting that 88% of
any shift in residential usage is accounted for by three factors: weather, the price of electricity and changes in personal
income.
In the first quarter, we saw weakness in personal income and we believe the biggest contributor to that may have been
the increase in federal payroll taxes. We believe this factor could have limited growth in our first quarter usage per
customer metrics. The increase in commercial sales represents the strongest growth in this customer class in a number
of years and yet another signal that the economic recovery continues. This is also consistent with retail expansion
activity in the region. As previously noted, industrial sales declined in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the first
quarter of 2012. This result is consistent with reports indicating that exports from the region declined during the first
quarter of 2013.
However, a number of declines in sales resulted from temporary outages associated with new planned investment as
well as unplanned maintenance and other short-term factors. Some customers have indicated to us that they expect to
return to normal operating levels of production for the remainder of the year. The outlook for future industrial sales and
growth in the industrial economy are supported by a number of factors. For instance, manufacturing employment in the
Southeast thus far in 2013 has grown at almost twice the national rate and regional indices of manufacturing activity
are much stronger than they were just a quarter ago.
Additionally, our pipeline of economic development projects remains robust. Recent job announcements of greater than
1,000 jobs include Home Depot which is creating 2,200 customer service jobs in Kennesaw, Georgia; General Motors
which is creating more than 1,000 high-paying IT jobs in Roswell, Georgia; the Navy Federal Credit Union, which is
adding 1,500 back-office jobs in Pensacola, Florida; and Medient which is building a new $90 million movie studio in
Savannah, Georgia that will employ more than 1,200 workers.
Sales results for the first quarter of 2013 were consistent with our expectation that GDP growth in 2013 would be 2%
and would occur primarily during the second half of the year. Despite the headwinds we've mentioned earlier, we
continue to see positive signs of emerging economic growth, such as increased expansion of retail stores, continued
renovation and expansion of food service locations and continued growth in sales tax collections. However, the
uncertainty in the overall economic outlook continues.
Turning again to company financial news, our Board of Directors voted earlier this month to increase Southern
Company's common dividend to an annual rate of $2.03 per share. This marks the 12th consecutive year that our
dividend has increased. In fact, since 2002, our dividend has increased a total of 51%. This 12-year trend is a direct
reflection of the positive outlook we continue to maintain for our business and the region that it serves. We remain
steadfastly confident that the business fundamentals of the Southeast provide a solid foundation for a promising future
and Southern Company is proud to be a part of it.
Finally, I'd like to share with you our earnings per share estimate for the second quarter of 2013, which will be $0.68
per share. As a final note, in light of the Kemper charge, we remain committed to our annual guidance range and our
long-term EPS growth target.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. In closing, I'd like to talk for a moment about our nation's economy and the great opportunity our industry
has to help make things better. As you know, Southern Company's business is all about doing what's best for our
customers. It's a philosophy that goes all the way back to our founding and it's an area in which we continue to excel. In
fact, Southern Company was just named the top-ranked major electric utility in the 2013 American Customer
Satisfaction Index.

Down through the generations, Southern Company employees have always focused on making life better for the
families and communities we serve. Our customers deserve that commitment. It's central to our legacy and it's an
especially crucial role for us today given the difficult economic climate faced by many of our customers. By now,
everyone knows the issues with the economy, low sustained growth and unacceptably high unemployment. The
problem isn't solely tied up with reduced spending or higher taxes, the real solution lies in promoting sustainable
economic growth that will support more job creation and personal income growth and make American lives better. Our
industry is uniquely suited to support that outcome. In fact, since 1970, nearly 80% of the growth in energy
consumption has been driven by the electrification of the American economy. Energy producers are central to the
economy and central to the lives of American families.
In short, energy is growth capital and we need to do everything we can as a nation to ensure a clean, safe, reliable and
affordable supply. With that in mind, we have been promoting an industry initiative across the energy complex, which
includes oil, natural gas and electricity to address the issue of North American energy security. The goal is to develop
and market our vast supply of energy resources so that by the end of this decade, North America can become a net
energy exporter, and perhaps later, the largest producer of energy worldwide. Think about it. Our current energy policy
is predicated on the concept of scarcity. In fact, we can turn that premise to one of abundance. Southern Company is
committed to playing a leadership role to help North America, and particularly the United States, achieve that
aspiration. I will keep you apprised of our progress.
In the meantime, Southern Company will continue to excel at the fundamentals of our business, finding the best ways
to serve our customers in the Southeast, while building better communities in a better country.
We are now ready to take your questions. So, operator, we'll now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Dan.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey. Listen, I guess this is going to be the topic of the day for a little while, but just on
Kemper, can we discuss a little bit more, what caused the 20% increase effectively in project costs from where you
guys most recently thought it was going to be to where you are today? Just maybe explore what's driving that a little
more than just a piping comment?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. So as we approached these last 12 months essentially, we were looking over
our estimates of what it's going to take to complete and to make the in-service date. There were kind of a number of
different issues we outlined broadly, but with respect to the piping, we made the decision to essentially improve the
quality of it, improve the thickness, improve the metallurgy. We think that will provide the best long run answer to the
reliability of the plant and serve Mississippi customers for decades to come. So we improved that.
Secondly, we misestimated the amount of piping that we would need. So we increased the amount of piping that was
associated with this project. And then I guess finally, we have added another shift, essentially an overnight shift, to
getting the work done by the in-service date. So it really is kind of a function of more labor and a revision of our labor
productivity estimate.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And, Tom, when you think about, I guess, the first question on that, is there any ability for
money to come back from the E&C guys so you're not going to take the full tab on this? Or is this kind of thing to sit
on your cost level?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, this is our best estimate of what it's going to take in order to complete by the
in-service date. To the extent we under-run then, yeah, there would be an adjustment at the end of the process.
Likewise, if it takes more, there would be another adjustment over, but that is our best estimate currently.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: But I guess with Vogtle, there's some debate over whether the E&C providers are responsible
for some of the cost overruns and the delays. Is there a similar recourse or debate of recourse with Kemper that you
guys could try and get some of the $500-ish million covered by your E&C guys rather than you guys paying for it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, remember, Kemper and Vogtle are completely different, right? So let's think about
Kemper. Remember, this is our technology, our design, our construction effort. We certainly have subcontractors but
this is our responsibility. And recall, we already have a settlement agreement in place with the Mississippi commission
that provides for in total about a 19% net increase.
When you look at Vogtle, we have a completely different arrangement. That is, we have a turnkey contract with the
consortium; that's Toshiba, Westinghouse, and Chicago Bridge & Iron. And while we have made modifications to that
contract over time to the benefit of our customers, we feel that it is a completely different relationship than in Kemper
where we are solely responsible for executing on the project. We are responsible for Vogtle, but we have a commercial
relationship with the consortium.
Further, when you consider the cost impacts on Vogtle, it's pretty clear it's a different matter. When we originally
certified the plant, we thought it would be 12% increase. Now, with the additional cost, but moreover the
overwhelming additional benefits, we think that price increase now is reduced to somewhere between 6% and 8%. And
while in VCM 8 we did increase the schedule, there will be no costs that will show up in rates to customers associated
with that change in schedule. And further, when we think about the remaining price increases associated with
completing Vogtle to in-service, we believe those price increases are somewhere less than 1% per year. So it's a totally
different ballgame. Kemper, we already have a settlement agreement; Vogtle, we have a process in place with the VCM
hearings and a variety of other things, a different commercial arrangement, a different price impact. We just think
they're completely different.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. I guess one last question then I'll let somebody else talk,
but, Art, on the – with the charge, do you guys need to change your equity proceed expectations for this year and next
year, just to balance out your balance sheet?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we've – we kind of outlined on the last call that we had plans for $0 to $300 million,
but that was kind of contingent upon Southern Power's projects. Let me say first off that we're committed to the credit
quality that our customers enjoy the benefits of. We will support Mississippi Power in their – getting their cap structure
in a shape that was contemplated in the seven-year rate plan that they filed. So how we finance that, how we
downstream cash to Mississippi Power is a function of what we – how we do it at Southern. And our intention is to
address that over a period of time such that we're not going to issue a slug of equity immediately to make up that delta.
And when you look at Southern Company's ratio, it would drive our ratio down a little bit below 43%, so we're not that
far away from the target ratios that we established for Southern Company. So we'll get back to that over a period of
time.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And even the ongoing net impact of additional shares, whenever we decide to issue
shares, is really pretty minor. I think the sustaining cent per share impact is like $0.03 per share associated with this, if
we sold all the amount of shares right away, which we don't intend to do right away. So – and just recall, last year we
had negative $0.11 of weather. I think when Art says that we're committed to our annual guidance and our long-term
growth aspiration, I think we can manage this circumstance quite well.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet. Thank you.

And now our next question over the phone lines is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hi. Hey, Tom. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: So just same topic, just in the event that Kemper comes on after May of 2014, is there any
issue if it doesn't mean its targeted startup with your settlement or anything like that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Steve. This is Art. There are, yeah, certainly the issue around investment tax credits is
time sensitive. So that represents roughly $133 million and it's contemplated in our seven-year rate plan that has been
filed with the Mississippi Commission. There may also be some issues around the AFUDC especially with the –
certainly the portion that would exceed the $2.88 billion where we would not continue to accrue AFUDC on that
portion, but then a question about the remaining balance of AFUDC and whether or not you'd be able to continue to
accrue on that balance as well.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And is this – this is just any time after May of 2014 these questions come up or is it a
certain time after that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. We think it would be that. I mean...
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...in other words, the structure that we have will probably accrue AFUDC up to $2.88
billion. Beyond $2.88 billion with – given the higher cost increase, that could occur earlier than, say, May. So you
could see that effect going on. As Art mentioned, the ITC effect would be something that you would see ratably over
the seven-year period and within that structure there's a true-up provision and a variety of other things, so we'll just
have to see how that would work out.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And just...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: As with the ITC – hey, Steve, the ITC would be reflected over 30 years. So there would be
the annual effect of that over 30 years. So we think it would be kind of small.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then in terms of the remaining kind of risks in terms of the current budget, is
there a certain area that we should be most watchful of where there still could be risk of cost pressure in these last 12
months?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, I mean recall this is a first of its kind technology, although we're confident of our
ability to deploy it. What we have said before, probably the larger risk in front of us right now goes to the
instrumentation and control equipment; harmonizing the operation of the plant from the fuel intake of lignite to the
gasification, to the stripping out of the CO2, to the remaining synthesis gas going on to the combined cycle units and
producing electricity. Harmonizing the operation of the plant, I think, is probably that what we are most focused on.
Now, we have put in place for some time now a simulator where we have modeled how this is supposed to work. We
mentioned before that we're already 40% through startup activities. Those startup activities have been mostly focused
on the combined cycle units of some of the other ancillary areas around the plant. So the big effort is going to be startup
around the gasifier and the carbon capture equipment. It'd be those issues. I would say instrumentation and control
would be the biggest single issue.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then one last question just on the variable costs of the plant in the future based
on any of these changes, does that affect whatever you expected the kind of variable cost of the plant to be in the
future? Either good or bad...

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, we think on a GAAP equivalent basis, you're going to be somewhere between $1 and
$1.25 per million Btu. High capital cost, but cheap energy and recall the energy is influenced by the value of the CO2
which is indexed to the price of oil, which pays for substantial portions of the lignite fuel. The net effect is a very
promising energy cost for decades to come for Mississippi's customers and we had great certainty. We don't think
there's going to be much volatility at all in the fuel price because we own the mine and it's right there. This is
essentially a mine-mouth operation. So low volatility...

And now our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Greg.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Greg?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Greg, are you there?
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Yeah, I'm here. Sorry about that.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No problem.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I had two questions, but you answered the first one on the financing costs of the write-down. The
second one is just looking at the appendix when you show your generation portfolio capacity factors in mix.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Natural gas prices have run up quite a bit in the first quarter.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I'm surprised to see that you saw such a dramatic increase in Powder River Basin coal burn. I'm
not necessarily surprised that your non-PRB coal burn is about the same. Can you talk about what the dynamics were in
the quarter that led to that and then maybe extrapolate out into the next quarter – the rest of the year based on where gas
and coal prices are now?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. Look, me and Art will tag-team this one. The way to think about kind of our
coal to gas energy is really this. PRB is going to come in to dispatch somewhere in the $3 range, $3 to $4. So at $4.25
spot gas, you're running your PRB units now, right? So that's Scherer, that's Miller. And interestingly, as we evaluate
other kind of mixing of PRB in with regular coal, that will happen. Now, the other thing is, we're moving away from
Central App coal more to in Illinois Basin coal. When you look at those units, the Illinois Basin coal, they're going to
start dispatching at about the $5 range. Central App will still be kind of in the $6 range. So that would be the spread in
which you should look to see coal and gas switching.
Art, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I'll just point out, Greg, that at – right at the end of the month, if you look at our
dispatch curve, all the Miller units and at least three of the Scherer units were ahead of our most efficient gas unit. So
that gives you an idea about how sensitive those PRB units are to the gas price in the marketplace.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And the other thing is – go ahead, Greg. I'm sorry.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I was going to ask how do your coal piles – in relation to finishing up the answer to this question,
how your coal piles look? And how flexible are your contracts that you can have the practical ability to cycle as these

prices move against each other?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, well, they're higher than we want, but we have plans in place to work on them by
certainly 2014 and into 2015. We have plans in place. We've done all sorts of different things to manage this situation.
Normally, we would be about kind of a 40-day supply right now and we're kind of in the mid-60s. It varies by plant to
plant to plant, but we have plans to get it all down in place by the right time.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: With gas where it is now that's going to bring your PRB piles down pretty fast, right?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It sure will. It'll help us manage them faster, that's for sure, relative to where we were last
year. Hey, interesting data, interesting data. In the first quarter of 2012, average gas price was $2.50. In the first quarter
of 2013, average gas price was $3.50, spot price $4.25. Remember, our cautionary kind of statements about gas and
while we've made the big bet to gas we remain convicted that it was more volatile than other fuel sources. I think the
data just bears that out. And one of the things I was going to add was one of the other blessings we have by the people
that came before us was deploying a lot of combined cycle technology so that we have great flexibility in being able to
move between coal and gas in a short amount of time. When we think about it, we could go as high as something like
57% gas and 22% coal and as high as – so I don't know, 35 – 45% – 30 – wait a minute, 35 – 45% coal, 35% gas if coal
gets cheap relative to gas. So we can swing significantly here.

And now our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. My first question on demand. I know you've been saying that
you anticipated the first half of the year would be slower than the back half.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: But the 2% decline you saw in industrial having seen an up quarter, I guess, in the fourth
quarter. Was that sort of what – kind of what you had in mind? Or more severe than – yeah, less good than the outlook
you gave three months ago?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'll answer you first and then Art fill in. Look, 2% I think adjusting for leap year is 1%. If
you adjust for the outages that we saw with a variety of kind of big guys like Mercedes-Benz, like Chevron like others,
we were probably nearly flat on industrial which is not far off of what we thought.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, that's true. There were some other impacts we had with cogeneration going on at some
of our paper – large paper customers. So that had an impact year-over-year as well. And that's still a function of gas
price and where that goes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I guess the other thing I would say is going back to this kind of economic
development and the new announcements, those are really the headlights on kind of where we see our industrial sales
going. That's awfully bullish. Gee whiz. Four projects with 6,000 new employees, good jobs. When you look at our
manufacturing employment being 1.8% versus the national average of 1%, it looks bullish to us. So I would just say,
look, adjusting for all these things, it's generally in line with our expectations and we look forward to seeing how it
unfolds. If I had to say, is there a weakness? I would watch out for the global economy in exporting.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Tom.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: And then just on the way you presented the numbers generally, you obviously have this
item you excluded on a leveraged lease. Can you just talk us through what – why you're pulling that out? I mean in the
past, you've – typically, there's been a pretty high bar for Southern Company to exclude a one-time item from numbers.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, that was – I'm sorry, Jonathan. That was a – go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: No. You go on, I've stated the question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Okay. That was a leveraged lease that we were the equity and tax owner of. We entered
into that lease back in 2002. The lessee had significant operating performance problems with the plant and was unable
to get cash flows high enough to make the debt payments. So we had disclosed this in the 10-K, I think as long as a
year ago, describing our options here. We could have written off the entire investment at about $90 million or get the
bondholders to agree to a restructuring, which is what we've done. We're actually going to put some additional
investment into the plant. We are going to act as a general contractor to the new lessee and we believe that the
accounting rules required us to book a restructuring charge of – after-tax of $16 million or so, and that's basically the
long and short of it.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. Can I just throw one more issue?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, absolutely.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Of the – on – there was a – I think there was talk before of some securitization angle
around Kemper. Is that...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Still something you're contemplating? And could you just remind us what was going to
happen there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure. That was part of the regulatory settlement we reached earlier this spring. So in
essence, additions to rate base are $2.4 billion of the plant, the mine and the CO2 pipe. Beyond the $2.4 billion of the
plant, up to $2.88 billion of the plant is plus AFUDC and some other items, goes to securitization. And we have
estimated that amount to be between $700 million and $800 million. Recall, we had legislation passed that provided for
an amount of about $1 billion. So we currently contemplate using somewhere between $700 million and $800 million
of the $1 billion securitization available to us.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Right. And then obviously as you're eating everything above $2.88 billion on the plant,
that's not part of that discussion.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right. We're very clear though that there are exceptions to the cap which remain in
place. And remember those are force majeure change in law, beneficial capital or project development allowances,
essentially actions we take on this – on the plant site while we're building it to improve its performance. Those things
remain exceptions to the cap.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So you've talked about in the answers to what's going on at Kemper that some of these
things were improvements designed to enhance performance. So how much – can you give us a number of what the
exception piece is likely to be, your view of it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, we don't – anything that we've talked about so far, it does not apply to the regulatory
agreement that we struck so far. So when we struck that settlement agreement, remember there was a settlement
agreement and there were two pieces of legislation passed through the Mississippi House and Senate and there was a
vote by the commission to approve all of that. And then we have remaining in front of us the approval of the seven-year
plan, as well as prudent hearings. Given all of that work, when we came up with the increased estimate, we felt bound
by the settlement agreement we reached and all the agreements we reached with the parties involved, and elected
ourselves not to charge customers for any of these cost increases.

open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hello?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello? Hello?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey. It's Julien here. Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, absolutely.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: There we go. So I wanted to ask you guys about coal ash here and what your
expectations are as far as it goes with respect to the latest that came out of DC?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So you know we'll see. There's still a lot of work to go. Our expectation is that at the end
of the day, they'll find it non-hazardous would be my simple answer, and that the kind of effective period in which we'll
be able to adjust to whatever new regulations we'll have some time to do that well into the future. There are some
significant capital costs associated with whatever EPA has us do with coal ash. At one time that was in our three-year
budget. Our sense is now that there won't be any significant capital in the three-year period that we disclose in our
estimates to you guys. In the aggregate, however, depending on how these rules come out and we're going to be as
engaged as we always are, these could easily result in compliance costs that exceed our incremental cost from that. We
just believe these costs including coal ash, effluents and 316-B will likely be outside the three-year estimate period
now.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then does the – what came out here on the effluent side, does that change
what you're talking about at all? Or just in terms of the time when you talk about three years, in what kind of timeframe
are we ultimately talking here?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, it's way early to assess kind of where we are. We're still evaluating all that stuff. We
think we have something that is workable and it's a 400 page rule and we're going to just dive through it as we do here
at Southern and we'll respond back to EPA in due course.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I just had a question kind of what's still open at Kemper? And if there was further escalation,
where could we see that happen?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's kind of what we chatted about already. The regulatory process I described, still in front
of us is approval of the seven-year rate plan, which was contemplated in the settlement. And the other things still in
front of us are prudence questions, okay?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we'll do a prudence review of building the plant.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I guess I was asking, what engineering is not done? I mean could you – are there like other
piping issues that could arise?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I really think the issue there goes to kind of what I described before. It's going to go to as
we complete startup activities, recall we're 40% complete right now, so what startup remains goes to the I&C question,
instrumentation and controls; and then recall one of the big cost drivers going forward here that gave rise to our new
estimate had to do with labor and productivity and meeting our in-service dates. So we've got to hit our productivity
levels.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And with regards to the ITC, when does the plant have to be up to still qualify for that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, there are several phases of ITC involved here. Phase I is a time sensitive phase and it
has to be in service by, I think, May of 2014 in order to qualify for those. The second phase relates to the amount of
carbon capture that we're successful with, and those, I think, expire sometime in 2016, April of 2016. We have also,
Paul, applied for some additional phase III credits, but that would require that we exceed 70% carbon capture, and
we're just not sure that we're going to qualify for those particular credits, but we have applied for them.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then can you just talk, you gave second quarter guidance, kind of the drivers to think
about, the ins and outs of what's going to happen between the two quarters?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, if you think about just the revenue effects, you'll see more revenue effects in the first
quarter than you will in the second because you had some increases in the second quarter of last year related to
McDonough primarily and some issues, I think, at Gulf Power. So those will probably reduce somewhat. It's mostly
based on our low growth and our experience around what we expect on the O&M side be the drivers that I can think of
off the top of my head.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: What was weather like last year, do you recall?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think weather was $0.01 positive in the second quarter of last year.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But of course, the second quarter is not a big weather month anyway.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And the weather's been so screwy. We actually had more revenue in March than we did in
January for the first time in anybody's memory around here. It was really weird looking. Our heating degree days,
January was warmer than February, which was about equal to March. It was a very strange quarter, even though in the
aggregate it was normal probably.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Got it. Thank you very much.

And now our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Michael, how are you?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Just a quick update if you don't mind. I remember last year, there was some
litigation or, I think, mediation regarding the contractors, the Shaw/Westinghouse consortium...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, sure. Right.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: ...and Vogtle. Can you just give an update where that stands in the resolution process and
kind of what investors should be looking out for that going forward?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I'm afraid it's going to be a short answer. I wish I could give you more here, I just
can't update it a whole lot. I would argue that there has been positive developments and I think one of the positive
developments has been that within the consortium, right, so the consortium is Toshiba, Westinghouse, and it was
formerly Shaw, now Chicago Bridge & Iron has essentially bought Shaw. We think that is marginally a positive
development in working through the commercial issues related to this.
We've looked at a variety of different things. We went through mediation. And after mediation, we go through
litigation. We've filed lawsuits. We still haven't determined venue whether that is Washington, DC or Augusta,
Georgia, so that remains in front of us. But look, we have – we've met with management of both Westinghouse, Shaw
and Toshiba, all of them, and we have a great relationship. And so we'll see how it goes. I can't update you with any
specificity as to when we're going to resolve it or whether we'll go to litigation or whatever, but that's where we are.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And one follow-up totally unrelated to Vogtle. When you look around the system, I
mean, you've got Kemper coming online next year, you've got Vogtle coming online in the back end of the decade. But
when you look across the system, whether it's Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, et cetera, when do you start seeing a
need for new gas-fired generation?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, that's a great question. I'm going to guess – what do you think, Art, about 2023?
That's what our models would say. Of course, a lot of that depends on economic growth and a variety of other things.
But assuming kind of what 2% GDP growth, 1.3% electricity sales growth, you get a number like 2023.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. So in other words, the McDonough plants as well as the Vogtle and Kemper plants
kind of meet your – really, your baseload and intermediate load supply needs for the better part of a decade.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And throw on there, I think it's easy to forget about, but Alabama brought in from
wholesale, sales out of its Miller units...
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ... which is one of the most efficient coal units in the United States, and is now using those
units to serve retail in Alabama. So I would argue you got Vogtle, you got McDonough. Georgia has procured some
PPAs from competitive generation providers. We have Miller. We have Kemper. We have some megawatts out of a
solar initiative in Georgia. I think that will all speak to our needs through the end of this decade and perhaps into very
early the 2020s.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Thank you, Tom. Much appreciated.

<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Dynamite. How are you?
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Good, good. I just – I had a couple of questions to go through. First of all, I didn't see in the
slides any updated CapEx numbers, and with the higher costs at Kemper County and some of the activity at Southern
Power, I was just wondering if you could address that.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we're – Carrie, this is Art. We did not update that slide. We're still evaluating the
timeframe around which those dollars will be spent. So we will probably address that in the 10-Q and you'll see some
more detailed information there.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: And in terms of Southern Power, you had a number of $900 million. Do you think that is
going to be higher than that this year? Or is that still a good number for all of 2013?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think that is still a good number. It contemplated some placeholders and we've announced
the acquisition of the Campo Verde project. So there's also some other elements in there from a capital perspective
around maintenance capital and things like that. So I'd still stick with that number.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Okay, great. And then I was just wondering if you had spoken to the rating agencies with
respect to the Kemper County overruns and had any updated views from them?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We have spoken to all three of the rating agencies. We have reviewed the situation with them
and they've given us a response that – yeah, of concern, but again, our commitment to the Mississippi to maintain their
ratings and we'll address the Southern ratio over time as we spoke a few moments ago.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And as part of our Southern Company financial dogma. We believe that financial integrity
is as important as return. That's what really drives value. We'll maintain that posture.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Well, just so I can follow up. So I believe that Mississippi Power is A3 negative outlook at
Moody's. Do you maintain – I don't know if I've ever had to ask this before, but kind of a limit on how low you would
like the OpCos to be rated? Like would you like them kind of all in the A category? Or you're indifferent? Just how
should we think about your credit quality commitment for the operating companies?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we'd like for them all to be in the single A category. So A3 is kind of as low as we
want to go with Moody's.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Okay. And just so I understood that commitment, so your discussion is the parent will push
funds down into Mississippi Power to get it back up to its regulatory capital structure?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. So as Art described earlier, we'll make a capital contribution down there to preserve
their financial integrity. How we do that at the Southern level, we'll see over time.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Yeah, okay. But do you envision doing the infusion down in the Mississippi Power
sometime sooner this year? How have you thought about that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, that's a function of the CapEx and when they spend it. And so that will over the next –
by the time it goes into service, we'll be back to a closer level.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Okay. What is their allowed equity structure down at Mississippi Power?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It's basically a 50-50 and that's consistent with what they filed for in their seven-year plan.
<Q - Carrie Saint Louis>: Okay, great. All right, thank you very much.

And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Ali, how are you?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good. Good afternoon. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good. Hey, Tom, as you look at Kemper County today as an investment, given the cost overruns and
where the budget is coming out versus where you thought it would when you went in, how do you see the economics of
this project? And ...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks. It still is terrific. Now, obviously, we're disappointed. Nobody
wanted to have this overrun and certainly for our account. We take that very seriously and we're disappointed with that.
That being said, it is so important to serve the long-term interests of our customers to provide a balanced portfolio of
generation resources. Failing to do Kemper would have put a much bigger bet in natural gas for the account of
Mississippi's customers and that doesn't make sense.
When you think about the energy production profile of Mississippi Power going forward with Kemper, they are about a
third coal, a third Kemper, a third natural gas. And recall the energy equivalent dollar-per-million Btu of Kemper is
going to be somewhere between $1 and $1.25 per million Btu with very low volatility. Unlike natural gas and we
pointed out before a quarter ago, $2.50 per million Btus, first quarter, $3.50 per million Btu and spot $4.25. And if any
of you live in the Northeast, especially New England, you can see how volatile gas can be still.
Now, I say all that to say we've already made a big bet in natural gas. We have great optionality to swing between coal
and natural gas. We are very bullish on natural gas. But that does not mean that we put all our eggs in that basket.
Economic dispatch Kemper looks like a nuclear plant. High capital cost, cheap energy. We think it makes sense.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Fair enough. Second question, I wanted to clarify – I know for planning purposes you talked
about 2% GDP growth, 1.3% or so weather normalized demand growth. Wanted to be clear – is that what you're
assuming in your 2013 guidance as well, that demand growth number?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And my last question and you talked a little bit about some of the additional projects that are
coming in within the Southern Power footprint renewables, et cetera, but also I thought, Tom, you talked about
expanding the Southern Power business model. Maybe I thought you were talking also about more greenfield projects
outside the Southern footprint. Can you just give us an update on your thinking on Southern Power's model?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it is where it was. I would just pick at just a couple of words. We're not expanding
the business model per se. The business model for us would be essentially long-term bilateral contracts, credit-worthy
counterparties, little or no fuel or transmission risk. We earn our money based on the brick-and-mortar investment that
we get in a capacity price that we put in our contracts. The second contract typically we associate would be essentially
energy which is mostly fuel, and there's some upside in those contracts, but very little downside. That's the way we
structure Southern Power so that it has a risk profile similar to our retail regulated business. And we've been awfully
successful. So the idea was we've been able to do that in the Southeast. The Southeast is pretty well flushed with
capacity. And we have been approached by other people. We've gone outside the Southeast really in order to do
renewables, right?
So the biomass fuel in Nacogdoches, the solar deals we've done now in New Mexico and Nevada and now California.
So those are the reasons why we ventured outside the Southeast. We have maintained the same business model. Along
the way, we have been approached by people, particularly our target customers, which I would say are particularly
focused on munis and co-ops and maybe other large IOUs outside the Southeast to do other business. So far, we've
been turning that business down.

What we have suggested in prior calls is that maybe that's some business we could do effectively. We would keep the
same business model in place in pursuing anything if it's outside the Southeast. And to the extent that the expiration of
the contract, recall that we tried to do these long-term contracts. I don't know specifically what the latest kind of
average tenor is, 12 to 14 years for Southern Power. But I would say that if you're taking risk on re-upping a contract at
the expiration of a long-term kind of contract, we would probably price in a risk premium to the return to make sure
that we were covered on that risk. But that's our thinking. It remains.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey, good morning. Hey, how are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Just a couple of quick questions. I know it's a little bit early and you can't get too in detail about
it but with the Georgia filing – the rate case filing that you'll be doing a little later, are there any kind of big kind of
structural changes that you might be looking at maybe a change from the three-year cycle in that filing? Or is it too
early to comment?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, it's really very early to comment. Until we file, we're not going to have a whole lot to
say about that.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah but what we've done in the past, we typically file a traditional one-year rate filing
and then we file – we've been under since 1995 a series of three-year accounting orders, which generally have a much
more fluid structure. So what we've had with the Georgia regulatory process, the Georgia Commission particularly is a
constructive relationship in which we can evaluate and manage regulatory structures to accommodate the needs of the
day. And I think that has served Georgia Power's customers so well for so long. So we'll file a traditional rate case and
we'll file probably some other alternatives to that and we'll see what makes sense for Georgia's customers.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. And just one quick question on the Bowen explosion. I saw that you had a filing to close
one of the units there. Is that related to the generator incident? Or are you going to be fully repairing? I mean I just
want to get a little clarity on what's happening around that unit?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we don't have any filings associated with the Bowen problem there. What we have –
the filing that was made was the sale of a CT associated with unit 6. Here's the issue. We're really not prepared to talk
very much about Bowen yet. Any event like that, we do what's called a root cause analysis. That root cause analysis has
not yet been completed, and we're very careful, even internally, talking about that until we see what the facts are. That
is a very disciplined, rigorous process that we follow. And so once we see that, we'll evaluate what to do now in terms
of returning units 3 and 4, to in-service unit 1, and what to do about repairs associated with unit 2.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. I appreciate that. Yeah, I had seen that filing and I just didn't open it. Just wanted to make
sure it wasn't related.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. It's really a minor issue and really doesn't apply to Bowen 1 through 4.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Great, thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hey. How are you guys?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: I don't really have any, I guess, I have one or two questions left. Just a clarification, I guess I
could ask this to IR, but just on these sales growth forecasts that you gave, could that – that you gave on the fourth
quarter call, you gave guidance. That includes the effects of the leap year or did it include? I'm just not sure on that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, it contemplated the leap year effect.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. So the sales that you're showing here for the quarter are really versus your guidance and
we wouldn't strip out?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, they're actual to actual.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: [indiscernible] (65:30)
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The way I would think of it, it's year-over-year, so.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Right, right. But we compare it to your guidance not stripping out the leap year and going back to
flat, right? So...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we're just giving you color on the year-over-year comparison is all we've done.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. And, Andy, when you think about it, so the leap year effect really occurs in the first
quarter, then it diminishes as the year goes on. So you have essentially 1/90th, which is about 1.1% difference.
Afterwards, once you get to 360, the leap year effect almost washes out on any year-to-date comparison. So it kind of
washes out by the year. That's why you've got to kind of account for it in the first quarter.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Yeah, got it. Okay. Thank you. And then is there a way to get a breakdown on Kemper as far as
the $550 million, how much was for piping, how much was for labor, productivity, whatever?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, no. We don't have that. Well, we have it but...
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay, that's...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...that's for our account.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Got it. Okay. And let's see here. I guess that's it. Thank you.

<Q - Ashar Khan>: I'm sorry, I was off a little bit, I don't know this question got addressed or not. The announcement
that was made yesterday on buying the solar facility, is there any more information regarding the purchase price
attributable to Southern? And if I am right, the plant comes into operation, if I'm right, end of this year, so are there
going to be some kind of ITCs that are going to be recognized as part of earnings? Sir, I don't know if you discussed
this already or not or is there anything you can provide?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Ashar, this is Art. You'll see more information on that in our 10-Q. We have an agreement
with, in the purchase agreement where we've agreed not to disclose the purchase price until we have an obligation to do
so, and that's when we'll do it in the 10-Q.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So we're going to honor that agreement. But there are ITCs associated with it that, that will
be recognized and our guidance contemplated the projects.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: This was one of the placeholders I was referring to. So it fills one of the placeholders.

And now our next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Big Dan, how are you?
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Good. How about you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: You mentioned that you'll provide more info on the revised CapEx in the Q but I was –
would it would be the same for the financing? Can you give us any color on how financing plans would change given
the higher Kemper costs and so forth?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, the financing cost, we talked about this earlier, Mississippi's additional cost to – for the
$540 million will be financed with a mix of capital. We'll then load some capital from Southern to support the equity
side and they'll issue more debt to support some other expenditures. In terms of how we handle that at Southern, again,
is something that we'll deal with over time. For Southern, it's a much less – much smaller impact on the Southern level
than it is at Mississippi. So we'll deal with that equity issue over time.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: How about on the debt side, though, so you'd expect more debt issuance on – for Mississippi
Power, I would assume?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, it depends on the timing of the expenditures and right now we're – we don't have a feel
for exactly when they're going to spend that money. So we can update you later on that.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then going back to your appendix ratio, the capacity factors and generation mix,
just wondering if you could give us what the capacity factors were for the nuclear in 2012 and 2013? What Q1...

<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Sure. And then somewhat related to that, just the generation mix, the decline in nuclear, I
assume, that's related to additional outages. Is that correct and what were...

And now our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Your line
is open.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: All right, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hey. How are you doing? Can you hear me?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, sure.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Pretty quick, just there's this footnote that says also reflects reclassification of January
2012-kilowatt hours, sales among customer classes with consistent with actual advanced meter data. And the use of the
advanced meter data, I guess, was implemented in the first quarter of 2012. What does that mean? Does that have any
impact on any of this data or anything that we should know about?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No, it's merely a way to make the data more comparable and more meaningful. Basically it's
an improvement in the reporting results. At the end of 2011, we were using a much more rough estimate of what the
allocation of unbilled would be between classes whereas at the end of the – end of last – end of the first quarter last
year, we were using a much more accurate – using the AMI meters to calculate, which was a much more accurate. So
we didn't want that to do – disrupt the reporting numbers. So we normalized for those effects.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: And that didn't have – did that have an impact on the year-over-year of weather normalized
numbers?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, it did have an impact but it normalized them in a way that we think is more
meaningful.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So I guess it's more meaningful but I guess – in that it's more accurate, but I mean does it
– would the numbers be substantially different, I guess, if that hadn't happened?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Let me say it this way. The total number that we reported, the 0.9% for total retail sales
would have stayed the same, the allocation between the classes would have...

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then in terms of just if I understood everything the GDP forecast and sales forecast
and everything hasn't changed from last quarter. Is that correct?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just I guess at Kemper, it does seem that, I mean, I'm just wondering, is there
some specific design issue with IGCC that we should know about? Or that you guys have – I mean it just seems that
this thing – not just you guys. Duke had a problem as well with the cost overruns and what have you. I'm just sort of
trying to get a sense as to what we've sort of what you guys have learned in this process as to what this – what's going
on or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Paul, I would argue that our circumstance is completely different than what Duke
has experienced. Duke is buying a very different kind of gasifier. They're buying it with that contractual relationship.
This is our own technology. The gasifier behaves differently. I went – you may remember I went through a protracted
explanation as to why we were different than Duke. Look, when we do the feed study, the final engineering and
economic design of Kemper County for everything that we did the feed study on which is all the kind of electricity side
and the proprietary technology, the gasifier, the fuel handling and all that stuff? We are right on the money in terms of
that estimate. Where we missed it, just to be clear, is on the piping. And you think about the piping associated with a
plant like this, it really is a pretty big effort.
Because remember, we're taking gas off of the gasifier, we have all these byproducts including CO2 and a variety of
other chemicals and by improving the quality, quantity and then by adding more labor including adjustments to
productivity on the site, to deploying that piping, that's what's given rise to the big increase. That's a different situation
than what Duke raised and probably has nothing to do really with the technology associated with the IGCC itself. It's
the piping coming out of the IGCC.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Just with respect to the – you guys mentioned that you thought that the cost – this is your
best estimate at this time and obviously that could change. But it would seem to me that as you guys got closer there
should be less variation. I mean I know that you're obviously being cautious. But I mean can you give us any sense? I
mean is there – I mean you mentioned that there were several other steps that still have to be taking place. I mean is
there a potential for another big – I mean is there something significant potentially that could happen here with this? In
other words, could we see another write-off like this potentially or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I certainly hope not. Listen, you know how conservative we are. This is our best
estimate...
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...with everything that we know right now. So that's what we're doing.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Now, the ITC that you're talking about with Paul Ridzon that would mean that the plant would
have to be available by 2014. If, for some reason, it wasn't available in commercial operation by 2014, would that –
what kind of exposure would we'll be talking about?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, it's – ITC would be ratably given to customers over 30 years.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So what would say, $133 million over 30 years...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...that would be the annual effect. The other thing that Art mentioned just to add back is
this. Additional ITC that's associated with a 70% capture, we can't guarantee we're going to get there or not, but if we
got that, that would be additional $90 million. So that could serve to offset if we missed some of the other. So we'll see.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And that goes to customers, is that right?

Thomas A. Fanning
Well, let me just close out by saying I appreciate everyone's participation on the phone today. Look, this Kemper
situation is something that we're disappointed in. I do want to say to you all and also to the thousands of employees that
are involved in this; this is not representative of the kind of performance the Southern Company delivers year-in and
year-out. When you think about our engineering and construction services group, we have engineered, constructed and
put into service well over $20 billion of a gas generation fleet in an environmental control fleet under budget on-time
and better functionality than what we expected.
This is unusual performance for us and it's something that we're going to work very hard not to repeat. So I just want to
say to you all we've got our heads down. We are focused on this and we're going to do everything we can to improve
performance going forward. Thank you very much for your attention this afternoon. We appreciate it.
