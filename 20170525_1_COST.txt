In today's press release, we reported our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal year 2017 operating results for the
12-week and 36-week periods ended May 7. For the 12-week fiscal third quarter, we reported earnings of $1.59 a share,
$0.35 a share above last year's third quarter reported earnings of $1.24. As noted in this afternoon's release, the $1.59
reported EPS figure included an $82 million, or $0.19 per share, income tax benefit in connection with the $7 a share
special cash dividend that the company declared on April 25 and which is payable tomorrow, May 26. The realized tax
benefit related to the special dividend payable to company 401(k) plan participants, as it is considered compensation to
employees under U.S. tax law. There's about a little over 30 million Costco shares held by employees among other
investments in the 401(k) plan. In addition to this one-time earnings benefit, here are a few other items of note when
comparing year-over-year results.
Number one, our co-brand credit card, as was the case in both the first and second fiscal quarters of this past year, the
Citi Visa co-brand card program positively impacted year-over-year margins by 16 basis points and SG&A expenses by
20 basis points, and our overall bottom-line in Q3 benefited earnings by $0.14 a share. By comparison, I believe in Q1
and Q2 the numbers were $0.01 or $0.02 less than that per share, but still significant, as we're still in the first year of
the program change.
Number two, gas profitability. Our profits from gas during the quarter, as compared to last year's third quarter, were
higher by $37 million pre-tax or better year-over-year by $0.05 a share.
Gross margin, last year's third quarter earnings included a $19 million pre-tax benefit from a non-recurring legal
settlement. This represented an improvement to gross margin of 7 basis points year-over-year, or $0.03 a share, which
was in last year and not this year.
SG&A, this year's third quarter earnings included a $14 million, or $0.02 a share, hit to SG&A this year related to two
non-recurring legal items. So whereas last year had a benefit, this year had a detriment.
IT expenses as a percent of sales, was actually flat year-over-year as a percent of sales and in line with sales growth
during the quarter.
Number six, FX. The two FX items, as compared to a year ago during the third quarter, foreign currencies where we
operate were mixed relative to the U.S. dollar, from an aggregate weakened versus the U.S. dollar, most notably in
Canada, the UK and Mexico, and this resulted in foreign earnings in Q3, when we convert back into U.S. dollars for
reporting purposes, being slightly lower by about $5 million, or about $0.01 a share, than if the exchange rates had been
flat.
Conversely, we had a gain reflected in our interest income and other line related to foreign FX contracts and U.S. dollar
holdings by our international subsidiaries. We do that when they use to pay for U.S. dollar denominated merchandise
payables. In Q3 that benefited the P&L by $9 million, or little over $0.01 a share, year-over-year.
LIFO, there was no LIFO charge or credit in this year's third quarter results, whereas last year in the quarter we had a
LIFO credit of $13 million, reflecting deflation in our LIFO indices. That represented an amount of $0.02 a share
benefit last year – to credit last year versus nothing this year. While we do have deflation, there's no LIFO reserve to
draw from and essentially you can't go below zero.
Income tax rate, as previously discussed, our third quarter tax rate was very favorable due to the treatment of the
special dividend. As a result, the reported tax rate in Q3 was 26.8%. Excluding the impact from the special dividend,
our normalized tax rate would have been 35.3% for the quarter.
Turning to our third quarter sales. Reported sales were up 8% and our 12-week total company reported comparable
sales figure was up 5%. For the quarter, the plus 5% comp sales figure was helped by gasoline price inflations to the
tune of about 140 basis points and offset or hurt from FX by about minus 60 basis points.
By segment, the comp increases were as follows; U.S., 6%; Canada, 2%; and International 4%. Excluding the impacts
from gas and FX, the 6% in the U.S. would have been 5%; the reported Canada of 2% would have been 3%, and the
International reported at 4% would have instead been at a 6%, still totaling up to 5% overall.

In terms of new openings, our opening activities and plans, we opened 12 net new locations during the first two fiscal
quarters, the first half of the year. In Q3, we opened a net of two new units, three total and one relo. So, including our
37th location in Mexico and our first business center in Canada, in Ontario.
For all of fiscal 2017, we have current plans to open a total of 12 more locations, so 26 net locations for the year. Of the
26 for the entire fiscal year, 13 were in the U.S., 6 in Canada on a base of 91, 1 each in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico
and Australia, as well as our first openings both in Iceland, which occurred two days ago on there on Wednesday, and
France coming towards the end of next month in June.
This afternoon I'll also review membership trends and renewal rates; the upcoming membership fee increases planned
for the U.S. and Canada, those become effective next week on June 1; an update on the Citi Visa Anywhere Card
program; additional discussion about our margins and expenses in the quarter; e-commerce results; and quickly the
recent special dividend and the related $3.8 billion debt offering that we completed recently.
So starting with third quarter results. As I mentioned, sales were up at $28.22 billion, up 8% over the last year's $26.15
billion in the quarter. Again, on a reported basis, and on an ex-gas and FX basis, comps were up 5%. For the quarter,
our 5% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction increase of 2% and an average shopping
frequency increase of a little over 3%, and that little over 3% is companywide. There was 4% just in the U.S.
In terms of sales comparison by geography, Texas and Midwest regions were the strongest, with Northwest, Southeast,
and California not far behind. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries included the UK, Korea,
and Mexico.
In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the third quarter within food and sundries, it was up in the low
single digits. Spirits, deli, and candy were the leaders. Tobacco continues to be a negative year-over-year and, as I've
mentioned – we mentioned in the last two or three quarters, that will anniversary itself by the end of June, the tobacco
component.
For hardlines, overall in the mid single digits, strongest department sales were in tires, hardware, and health and beauty
aids. Our consumer electronics overall were down low singles. Softlines also were up in the mid-single-digit range,
with apparel, housewares, and domestic showing us the best results. And in fresh foods, comps were up in the low
single digits.
Within ancillary, gas had great comps in the quarter, aided by, of course, the higher average sale price per year, $2.42
this year versus $2.08 a year ago, as well as strong comp gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the
mid-teens in terms of comps, followed by optical in the high singles and pharmacy in the low to mid singles.
In the third quarter, at the U.S. front-end basket, units were just under – up 1 percentage point, while the average basket
value was slightly positive. These results are notwithstanding that we're still seeing a little deflation in the core
business.
Lastly, in Q3, the number of MVM promotional days, they were the same year-over-year in Q3, quite a change from
Q2 when year-over-year during the 12-week second quarter there were 17 fewer MVM promotional days. And as we
mentioned on the last call, we had made changes so that the lack of promotional days wouldn't impact the companies
much as it had in the quarter.
Moving to the line items of the income statement. The membership fees reported came in at $644 million, up 4% in
dollars, or $26 million, and down 8 basis points as a percent of sales. FX had a little to do with the dollar increase and
also just the number of new openings year-over-year in the quarter. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy
strong renewal rates, 90.2% in the U.S. and Canada, 87.5% worldwide on a fully captured basis, and we continue to see
increasing penetration of the Executive Membership in those countries where we offer that.
At the end of the quarter, we had 37.8 million Gold Star members, up from 37.5 million 12 weeks earlier at the end of
the second quarter; Business primary 7.4 million, the same quarter-over-quarter for 12 weeks; Business add-on 3.4
million and 3.4 million. All told, we had 48.6 million member households, up from 48.3 million 12 weeks earlier,
notwithstanding the fact while we just had a few openings in the quarter. Total cardholders came in at the end of the

quarter 88.9 million, up from 88.1 million at the end of the second quarter.
Also at the end of the third quarter, paid Executive Membership stood at 18.3 million, an increase during the 12 weeks
of 345,000 new Executive members, or about 29,000 a week increase for the quarter. Executive members now
represent about 38% of our member base and about two-thirds of our sales, closer to 70% of sales based on the
countries where it operates.
In terms of renewal rates, Business members renewed – and these numbers would be U.S. and Canada, which is about a
little over 80% of our business. Business came in at 94.1% at the end of the quarter, down from 94.3% at the end of the
prior quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the U.S. as we're still in the process in first year of year-over-year
from moving the card over to the new Visa – Amex into Visa Citi card.
Gold Star remained both at second quarter end and third quarter end 89.5% and its total was 90.2%, both quarter end.
So, again, we're rounding [indiscernible] (12:09) some of that, but those are the numbers, 90.2% both at the second
quarter end and at third quarter end. Worldwide, which include outside of the U.S. and Canada, at the end of the quarter
it was 87.5%, and rounded up to 87.7% at the end of the second quarter, which had been up from 87.5% at the end of
the first quarter.
Regarding the increases in annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, these going to affect again next week on
June 1. Recall that we had taken fee increases in several other countries this past September 1 at the beginning of our
current fiscal year. Our primary membership will increase $5 to $60, and Executive Memberships will increase to $120,
up $10.
And with regard to Executive Membership, the 2% reward cap associated with the Executive Membership is being
increased from the current $750 per year level to $1,000 per year level, based on eligible purchases by the Executive
members.
In all, the fee increase impacts – about 35 million member households will be impacted by it. About half of whom are
Executive members and half who are primary members, so $10 or $5. Note that the membership fees are accounted for
on a deferred basis, so in terms of when it will benefit the membership fee income line of the P&L. The full P&L
impact would be over a 23-month timeline, based on the fact that it's over the next 12 months that renewers will get
their first increase, and then it's deferred over a year-period from the time that they originally pay it.
Before continuing down the income statement, a quick update – few updated stats on the Citi Visa Card offering, which
began last June, early in our fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Recall that we began last year with approximately 11.4
million co-branded cards, which represented 7.4 million accounts that were transferred to Citi at the conversion. As of
Q3 end, we now have about 1.5 million new approved member accounts, which represents about 2 million new cards
since last June 20, and that 1.5 million represents about 290,000 additional accounts over the past 12 weeks since Q2
end.
Overall, we're seeing the Citi Visa co-brand portfolio total spend higher year-over-year both organically from cards
converted to Citi last June and from these new accounts. In terms of the conversion, the usage, and new sign-ups for the
card, I think as I've said a quarter ago and a quarter before that, so far so good.
Going down to the gross margin line. Gross margins reported were up 8 basis points. I'll ask you to do our little matrix
here, four columns, and there'll be two columns for Q2 2017 and two for Q3 2017. Column one will be reported Q2
2017 year-over-year, column two will be without gas inflation, and then columns three and four again will be reported
for Q3 2017, and then Q3 without gas inflation. So those will be the year-over-year basis points change.
The first line item is core merchandising. In Q2 year-over-year, it was plus 1 basis point and ex-gas it was plus 9 basis
points. And in Q3 reported, plus 7 basis points and ex-gas plus 20 basis points. Ancillary businesses, minus 20 basis
points and minus 18 basis points in Q2, and the two columns of Q3 would be plus 15 basis points and plus 19 basis
points. 2% reward, 0 and minus 1 basis point, and then minus 2 basis points and minus 4 basis points. LIFO, minus 5
basis points is across the board. Again, having some deflation this year, but comparing to a deflation last year to credit,
but nothing to credit since we're below zero there. Other, 0 and 0 basis point in the two Q2 columns, and minus 7 basis

points and minus 7 basis points in the two Q3 columns. So all told, year-over-year in Q2, we reported gross margins in
Q2 down 24 basis points, and ex-gas they were down 15 basis points. This year in the quarter, it was plus 8 basis points
reported and plus 23 basis points ex-gas.
Now, if you take the numbers that I talked to you about on the benefit from the change to Citi Visa as compared to
what it would have been had we had the old program, we benefit, as I mentioned, by 16 basis points year-over-year in
Q3, and I believe in Q2 we also benefited year-over-year by 16 basis points. So, again, if you just simply look at the
total on just two Q3 here, the reported plus 8 basis points would have been minus 8 basis points ex that single benefit of
the Citi Visa, and the plus 23 basis points would have been plus 7 basis points ex that, and that's how it shook out.
Overall, Q3 reported gross margin, again, as I mentioned, was higher by 8 basis points on a reported basis, 23%
excluding. As I usually do, I'll go through the core merchandise component, which is about 80% of our sales, food and
sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods. The core merchandise component gross margin was actually higher by 7
basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points excluding gas price inflation. Excluding the benefits of Citi Visa,
minus 9 basis points and plus 4 basis points, so again the plus 4 basis points excluding gas inflation would be the
number that we will look at here.
Subcategories within core – I'm sorry, I said something wrong. The plus 7 basis points was the one that I already told
you about the whole company. In terms of the subcategories of the core, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and
fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were actually positive year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points,
with food and sundries and hardlines both higher year-over-year, while softlines and fresh foods a little bit lower
year-over-year, but the net of all four on their own sales was up 12 basis points.
Second, ancillary and other businesses gross margins were up by about 15 basis points and up 19 basis points ex-gas
deflation. About two-thirds of that year-over-year increase was due to higher gas profits, as I mentioned earlier in the
call. But even without the – ex that, the other ancillary businesses net year-over-year were up a little bit. 2% reward, the
minus 2 basis points, or minus 4 basis points ex-gas. That basically means more usage by members who get the 2%
Executive member reward and who tend to spend more. LIFO, I talked about twice already. And lastly, the other, that
minus 7 basis points, if you will, was the fact that last year it was a $19 million non-recurring legal settlement, which,
of course, zero this year, so that's a minus 7 basis points year-over-year comparison.
Overall margins we felt were good, with solid results in the quarter to plus 12 basis points on core sales and gas
margins, again, also positively contributing not only in terms of higher gross margin within the gas, but in sales as well,
offset by negative year-over-year comparisons from LIFO and the one-time settlement from last year.
Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in Q3 year-over-year was lower or better by 14 basis points. And actually
that plus 14 basis points would be flat or zero without gas inflation, coming in – but the plus 14 basis points was
basically 10.44% versus 10.30% last year. Again, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit from effectively lower fees related
to taking the new card versus our old program year-over-year would have been better by 20 basis points and those
numbers are in here.
So again, I'll ask you to do the little matrix with the same four columns, Q2 2017 reported and Q2 2017 ex-gas, and
then Q3 2017 reported and Q3 2017 ex-gas. In terms of core operations, reported in Q 2017, we were up 8 basis points
– I'm sorry, better or lower by 8 basis points year-over-year. Without gas, better or lower by 1 basis point. And then in
Q3, reported lower or better by 21 basis points, and ex-gas lower or better by 9 basis points. Central, minus 2 basis
points and minus 3 basis points. So, in other words, higher by that amount year-over-year, then minus 1 basis point and
minus 3 basis points.
Stock compensation, pretty much grew in line with sales, but it was always a big impact in Q1 when we do our big
grant each year. Stock compensation was minus 1 basis point and minus 2 basis points, or higher year-over-year in Q2,
the two Q2 columns. And minus 1 basis point and minus 1 basis point, again, a little higher in the Q3 columns. Other is
0 and 0 basis point in Q2. In the two Q3 columns, minus 5 basis points and minus 5 basis points. And again, that relates
to the $14 million, the two legal items that were nonrecurring that impacted this year's Q3.

All told, last year in Q2, SG&A reported was lower or better by plus 5 basis points and again, ex-gas inflation higher or
slightly higher by 4 basis points. This year, reported better by 14 basis points, ex-gas 0 basis point, basically flat. And
again, I'll just use the two Q3 columns. If you take out the benefit from the Citi Visa conversion, that was 20 basis
points of the 14 basis points, if you will. So ex that, it would have been higher or minus 6 basis points. And again, the 0
basis points would have been higher or minus 20 basis points.
Now, within that, excluding the Citi Visa, central year-over-year was higher by 1 basis point reported, and 3 basis
points without gas. Nothing unusual in the quarter. Depreciation expense was slightly higher year-over-year. Again,
stock compensation expense was 1 basis point higher, and other was minus 5 basis points.
Next on the income statement line, preopening expense, $3 million lower this year coming in at $15 million versus $18
million. Quite a few less openings, eight last year in the quarter and three this year, but that has to do with the timing of
locations to – all the preopening doesn't actually happen in the quarter in which the actual opening occurs. And
certainly, this year's figure also includes some of the preopening expenses related to our entry into two new countries,
Iceland and France.
All told, operating income in Q3 came in at $968 million, or better by $110 million, which is 13% higher
year-over-year. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at $21 million. Interest expense in
Q3 this year, that's a quite a bit of a lower improvement from last year's Q3. It came in – that $21 million is $9 million
lower than last year's reported $30 million figure. Virtually all of it is due to the payment back in March of the $1.1
billion 5.5% fixed rate note that was a 10-year note that we paid it off on March 15. So that is about $60 million a year
annualized interest savings since that March 15 date.
As we reported last week, we were successful in completing the new debt issuances totaling $3.8 billion, and that was
done in four tranches. There was an $800 million five-year tranche, and then three $1 billion tranches at 5, 7, and 10
years. The details of that can be found in the press release dated May 9, but with the new debt having a blended rate of
a little over 2.6%. As well on May 15, we gave notice of early pay-off of our December 2017 $1.1 billion 1.125%
notes. The expected payoff date will be June 15, 2017.
Next line item on the income statement, interest income and other. It was higher year-over-year by $11 million, coming
in at $18 million in Q3 as compared to $7 million a year earlier. Now, actual interest income for the quarter was better,
but better year-over-year by $2 million. In addition, we benefited by about $9 million, I mentioned that earlier, in
credits mostly relating to the various FX items that I discussed at the beginning of the call. So, adding these two line
items to operating income, overall pre-tax income was higher by $130 million, or 16%, coming in at $965 million this
year during the 12 weeks as compared to $835 million a year ago.
Again, in terms of income taxes, a reported tax rate this quarter of 26.8%. Normalized that would be 35.3%, and that
compares to last year 34.2%. And we'd expect it to be in that 35.3-ish range for the year. Overall, reported net income
came in right at $700 million, and that's compared to our reported $545 million a year ago.
A quick rundown of the other usual topics. The balance sheet is included in this afternoon's release. A couple of quick
items that I always go through that one of them is not on there is depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled
$320 million, and year-to-date $929 million. One of the metrics we always look at is accounts payable as a percent of
inventories. As for the balance sheet, it came in at 97%. It was 99% a year ago in the third quarter.
We also then take out all the non-merchandise payables and recalculate it, so it's merchandise payables as a percent of
inventories and that, too, came down 2 percentage points from 89% a year ago to 87%. So still a vast majority of our
inventories being trade balance funded.
Average inventory per warehouse was up $693,000, coming in at $13.4 million compared to $12.7 million a year ago.
Almost – not quite 40% of it was majors, electronics. We're seeing a big shift – finally a big increase particularly in
TVs, kind of the next generation of bigger, more K and you name it, and as well as some other electronics areas.
Small increases in various other departments, as well some buildup in inventories related specifically to our
e-commerce, as just in the last year we've gone from 7 to 19 e-commerce fulfillment centers in the U.S. year-over-year.

Now, most of those are connected to our depot operations. We're not out there building a lot of new warehouses just for
that.
In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $670 million, in Q2 $515 million, and in Q3 $538 million, so year-to-date we're at
$1.723 billion. And overall for the year, we'd probably be in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range, probably it's maybe
$100 million less than we had estimated a quarter or so ago. Just a couple – as you saw in the number, we're expecting
[ph] $2.6 billion (26:53) for the year, just a few delays, nothing terribly different.
In terms of e-commerce, where we continue in the locations where we were 12 weeks ago, U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico,
Korea, and Taiwan, and we expect to do additional countries over the next one-and-a-half or so years.
For Q3, sales and profits were up. Online sales were up 11% in the quarter, as well as comps. It's the same locations.
Within the 12 weeks, we look at four-week periods ourselves, that came in at 11%, which represented a 13% or 14% in
the [ph] seven-week. The seven (27:27) was weak in part due to the shift in both Easter and Mother's Day, but overall
the number for the quarter was 11%.
We continue to improve our offerings and enhance our member experience. We continue to add new areas of
merchandise, improved in-stocks on high-velocity items, as evidenced by the additional inventories in those areas and
more locations of it. In April, we launched something new, GE Appliances along with their self-services delivery
schedule. It's starting off well, but again it just started off and we'll continue to add additional names.
In terms of online Kirkland Signature items, we recently launched Kirkland Signature maternity apparel. And have also
expanded some of our KS groceries and consumables items on dotcom. And if you're in the mood for A4 Wagyu
Center Cut New York Strip Steaks, we apparently have a great deal on four 12-ounce steaks for $499.99.
In terms of improving the experience functionality, we have improved search, streamlined the checkout process, both
mobile and desktop, improved the members' ability to track orders and have automated much of the merchandise
returns process. Now, many people have that. We're newer to it, but we've done a good job, I think, in the last six to
nine months of getting that member experience and functionality a lot better on the site.
Overall, good things are happening online, both in terms of member experience and expanded products and services,
and certainly the great values to our members. We still want you to come into the warehouse, of course.
Next discussion, expansion. As I mentioned, for the third quarter we opened three locations including one relo, so a net
of two. Quite a lot of openings in Q4, 12 total including Iceland just a couple of days ago. In fiscal 2016, if you recall,
we opened 29 units, so about 4.5% square footage growth. This year with the 26, a few of them being delayed into this
fall. With 26 for the year, that would be about 4% square footage growth. Of the 26, half, 13 are in the U.S.; a quarter,
six are in Canada; and then one each in those countries that I mentioned earlier. And again, of course, those include our
first location to open in France, which is scheduled for, I believe, June 22. And again, Iceland just opened.
Total square footage is something you ask about, at Q3 end it stood at 105.4 million square feet. In terms of buybacks,
in Q1 we bought back $122 million worth; Q2 $66 million; Q3 $45 million, so a total of $233 million of stock, or 1.486
million shares at an average price of about $156.50.
Regarding dividends, in addition to doing the special dividend, we increased our quarterly dividend, and that was
announced also on April 25. The new amount is $0.50 per share per quarter, so $2 a year. That's up 11% from the prior
$0.45 a share. Then again, that will also be paid tomorrow, May 26, the $0.50 quarterly amount. The $2 share
annualized dividend represents a total annual cost to the company of about just under $900 million. And as I mentioned
earlier, the $7 share dividend, that will be paid out to shareholders tomorrow as well.
Lastly, our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter scheduled earnings release date, and this is for the 17-week, this is an extra week
in the year, for the 17-week fourth quarter that ends on September 3, we'll do the earnings release after the market
closes on Thursday, October 5, with the earnings call that afternoon, again, at 2:00 PM Pacific Time.
With that, happy to open up for questions and answers, and I'll turn it back over to Samantha.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: So, Richard, first topic expansion and business centers. So, you've added some more. There's
a couple coming here in the next month or so. How do you think about business centers versus regular clubs? Number
one. And when you think about – is there a big potential business center expansion here? And then lastly, on expansion,
when you think about – is it too early to think about 2018 and we sort of get back to 30 openings worldwide next year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, with regard to the business centers, I think we started the year with 14 and
signed up in 4 this year, so 18 – I could be off by one – and our first in Canada. Recall that we had business centers for
– I think we've gone from four or five to seven or eight over about 10-plus years, and so we continue to tweak it.
Needless to say, we found something that seems to work now and there is a little method to that madness. But it's
corollary to what our primary business is, is opening full Costco membership warehouses.
We would have continued to open more, but I think – again, this is a guess at this point, but assuming the base at the
end of the year is 18, I could be off one, using that two to seven or two to six or three to five, I mean, it'll be in that
range for the next couple of years. We're not looking to go from 14 to 18 to 28 in a year, but so far, so good. I think a
couple of years ago we said to ourselves, one day could there be 30 or 40 of these, who knows? I remember we said
years ago, one day could we have 100 Costcos in the U.S. and we're approaching 500. So it's by no means the same as a
regular warehouse clubs in terms of capacity, a lot lower than that, but I just look at what we've done in the last couple
of years and extrapolate that for the time being.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. And is it too early for next year when you think about...?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's probably too early. I mean, it is. I mean, our goals will be to get towards that, but that's
always – it seems to be a challenge each year, but we keep working towards that end.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly on gross margin. So if I look at ancillary, ex-gas ancillary is up
maybe 6 or 7 basis points. So was that – any one department drive that and sort of – how's pharmacy doing within that?
And then the major categories within their own sales, so that was improved about 5 basis points versus last quarter. Is
there anything to that or that was fairly broad-based?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's more broad-based than anything. I mean, pharmacy was fine, notwithstanding
all the challenges that that industry has and we've continued to – knock on wood – do pretty well there. No, I don't see
there's anything specific. I think it's more back to the call a quarter ago when we said things were okay and it's not like
it changed a lot, but these numbers are going to fluctuate some basis points up and down periodically.
<Q - John Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks. Hey, Richard. And thanks for the color on those bigger, more K TVs. A serious
question is, first, the gasoline gross profit dynamics for Q4. Can you just give us a sense, relative compare? And then I
have one follow-up.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, as everyone knows, when gas – when oil prices go up, we make a little less or when
margins come down, we make a little less, and when they go down, we make a little more. Year-over-year Q3, that
12-week period gas prices generally were going down and that was good. In fact, I think the direction when asked on
the second quarter call, which Q2 hadn't been a great comparison, it was the other way, we didn't think it was going to

be this good, but we also didn't know that gas price will continue down. They've gone up lately, so we'll see.
We had very good profits last year in Q4. Some of that has to do as it trends down towards the end of the summer
prices in general, ex what's going on in the market, but that's why we share with you every quarter, because there are
going to be fluctuations that are dictated by what oil prices are doing.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up is on the credit card. Can you share with us – we're
about, I guess, almost a year away from cycling the initial changeover. Can you share with us – I know there was a few
buckets of margin that were helping. Some of it's new sign-ups, some of it's the spend outside of Costco. Can you give
us a sense, as we lap the initial benefit from last year, what accretes, what's additive year-over-year versus what goes
away? I'm guessing the bounties on the new sign-ups will probably fade, but can you just share with us how we should
think about it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I mean, generically, the biggest bang for your buck is in the first year. Is there a little
extra? On the one hand, there's a little extra because maybe there are some transition challenges right around there for a
few weeks. Okay, that's good news going forward for a little bit longer. But there is also more incentive and a bigger
bang for your buck. The first time you offer it, you get more sign-ups in the first week than the second week than the
third week. No more sign-ups mean more bounty. So, generally speaking, we still think it will be a net accretive, if you
will, or additive to the company in the second year, but the big bang is in the first year. And if you look at...
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If you look at Q4, Q4 there's five or six weeks of the big bang, if you will, before June 20,
and 10 or 11 weeks afterwards. So there is a little bit of both, but two-thirds of it's after that anniversary.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on e-commerce
growth, which was in the low double digits in the quarter. Richard, are you mindful of maintaining your relevant
online, especially at a time when other traditional retailers are aggressively growing their e-comm presence. You had
one of your big box competitors talk about 69% e-comm growth in the most recent quarter, and I believe your 11%
came on an easier comparison and it sounds like it slowed throughout the period. So, are you mindful of that at all?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I get to use my phrase that I used several times on the last call, not to be arrogant or
cavalier about it, but we feel good about what we're doing. We've got great brick-and-mortar comps. We are doing
things offensively in our view, not defensively online. And we've got lot of things going on on the online side, but
we're not really worried about what others are doing. And there's a lot of good things about online and there's
challenges, and we're trying to do more of the good things. But again, we'll continue to do the way we do it. Don't
expect us to increase by 69% partly through acquisition, and we're going to keep doing organically. I think we've got –
we've made a lot of changes in the last year, probably more than we had in the last several years online, that will show
some good results.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: My follow-up question is on the core gross margin being up 20 basis points. That's on
the heels of you making some investments in everyday low price in the prior quarter. So did you get the intended effect
of those price investments and is there now an opportunity to do more, especially as your gross margin continues to
float up?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think the 20 is 12 basis points on the core. I've returned that sheet to the side, but –
look, we're going to always do more investing in price. Just when you think it's safe to go outside, you guys, we're
going to drive sales on top line. And certainly the fact that our margins are strong, that we've got upcoming fee increase
that's just starting, that we've got additional monies from the credit card, all those things allow us to do things in an

offensive way and drive our business. And so we kind of think we can do both, have decent margins and drive our
business, and lower prices.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: I've just a follow-up on that, because you mentioned the upcoming fee increase in your
response to answering about price investment. Do we expect that a good portion, more than half would be – of the
benefit you get from a fee increase is going to go back into price?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I can't really tell you that, but we're known for being – for giving lots of things back
to the consumer, to our member, and it's not completely formulaic, but we're going to constantly try to excite our
members and drive our competitors crazy.
<Q - Michael Louis Lasser>: Thank you very much and good luck.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line Charles Grom.
<Q - Chuck Grom>: Hey. Good afternoon, Richard. A couple of questions here. First, curious the penetration on the
new Visa card as a use of tender here in the third quarter and relative to the first half of the year, and also curious to
where it was relative to when you had the agreement with Amex.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think we're now – we're talking U.S. dollars, because this is a U.S. program. I
believe we're in the 46% range currently, and that's trended up since its inception a year ago. I think we were – the
highest we were on Amex, and that was both Amex co-brand – by the way, that number I'm giving you is all Visa, not
just any Visa, because we accept all Visas. And we accepted all Amex cards, not just the Costco co-brand one. I believe
we got up to the 43%, 44% range, and so we've exceeded that. But we wouldn't expect it to, given the improved value
proposition to the member and the fact that there's just more market share out there and more places for our rewards
card to be used, and again, more incentive for that card to be used everywhere, which helps us as well.
<Q - Chuck Grom>: And has the basket changed at all?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know. I don't know if there was some anecdotal items at the very beginning, at the
transition on big ticket items, like hearing aids or big screen TVs or furniture. But I think the answer is, yes, it probably
has a plus sign in front of it instead of a minus, but not huge. And again, more anecdotal stories I've heard. I haven't
heard anything big. The biggest thing in terms of the whole card is the fact, the inside and outside spend. We were very
successful under our old program over 14 or 16 years, getting the outside spend on that card up to – I forget, 2.5 plus
for every dollar spent inside, and that's where these issuers – all of the issuers on it, wherever the co-brand card is, they
want more spend on that card, because that creates APR and it creates carry balances and late fees and everything else,
and it's just a bigger portfolio. And as one would expect, given the greater market share presence that a Visa has in the
market, there's going to be more users. If we can get that member to have that as a top wallet, there's going to be more
usage on it, and that's exactly what's happened.
<Q - Chuck Grom>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The expectation has been a little bit better than planned on that.
<Q - Chuck Grom>: Okay. And just switch gears a little bit to Michael's question on e-commerce. I think you said
11% growth. Can you just remind us where the penetration is today and also the number of SKUs that you guys are
offering online? I fully realize you don't want to have the 350 million that Amazon has, but how big do you think you
can grow that? And then also on the margin profile of your e-commerce business, I do believe it's better than your
brick-and-mortar margins. I just wonder if you could clarify that directionally.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, the sales are about little under 3.5% of sales. Again, this is a year that we're going to
end up doing – just extrapolating the first three quarters – something in the mid-120s. We have an extra week in there
too this year. And so, again, it's well over $4 billion now. That's pure e-commerce online. We do have delivery online.

We don't include that. We have travel online. We don't include that. It's just the normal online that we started with.
And in terms of profitability, nothing has really changed there. Generally speaking, the gross margin of dotcom
compared to the gross margin of the warehouse ex-gas, the four walls of the warehouse, the warehouse is a little higher.
The SG&A on dotcom is a lot lower, so the pre-tax earnings of dotcom is higher, and nothing has really changed there.
<Q - Chuck Grom>: Okay. And just number of SKUs and if you have the percentage overlap of those SKUs relative
to what's in store?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't see [indiscernible] (45:26). I think the SKU count ex-office supplies, because that's
done through a third party and there's 8,000 or 10,000 office supplies, I believe. I think we've got about 8,000 or 10,000
items, and that's exclusive of like about 2,000 of the roughly 4,000 in the warehouse are online.
<Q - Chuck Grom>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And needless to say, fresh food is not online, other than through third parties, like Google
– like Instacart and the like, not Google.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short.
<Q - Karen Short>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just actually trying to get a sense on the gross margin in
terms of the MVM. How much of the change in the MVM from 2Q to 3Q – or how much of the year-over-year change
in merchandise margin in 2Q versus 3Q would have been a function of the MVM changes? And then just wondering
what's the number of days on the MVM we can expect in 4Q 2017 versus 4Q 2016. And then I just had another
follow-up.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay. Well, first one, in terms of number of days, I think it's like four less this coming year
versus a year ago, three or four. It's a few days, so not totally meaningful. I mean, the big meaningful was in Q2, when
it was 17 less on 84 days. And I'm sorry, the other question, Karen, the first one you had asked?
<Q - Karen Short>: Well, when we just look at how the merchandise margin in 2Q versus the merchandise margin
change in 3Q, I guess, how much of the difference in the improvement sequentially was due to the MVM changes, like
the pressure that you had in 2Q versus what we're looking at in 3Q?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the biggest change from Q2 year-over-year and Q3 year-over-year was the number
of MVM days. We're still being pretty aggressive on the MVM being fewer items with better savings, and it costs a
little more, if you will, than have a seat at the table there from a vendor merchandising standpoint. But we're also
cognizant of the fact that we need to – we're not here just to drive margins down. We've got lot of buckets of stuff. And
when you have increasing penetration and some higher margin areas like fresh foods or some of the higher margin
areas like pharmacy, those things help as well. But there's so many little pieces that can affect it. Overall, we felt pretty
good about the Q3 comparison versus the Q2.
<Q - Karen Short>: Thanks. And then...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: But the answer is there's no material change. There's no material change.
<Q - Karen Short>: Okay. And then I guess just as obviously we're kind of getting out of a deflationary period and
into flat or maybe slightly inflationary, there's just been a lot of questioning as to how deflation impacted your P&L
versus how inflation will impact your P&L. And I guess I just wanted to talk through that a little, because it would
seem to me that deflation, because you had so much tonnage, it actually is a double hit because you have so much more
labor involved in meeting the demand. So I don't know if there's any way you could try to talk through a little bit of
how much more easing, I guess, you'd have on the P&L as we're no longer in a deflationary period [indiscernible]

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think for low margin retailers, and certainly we're at the low end – in the lowest end
of margins, but the supermarket is slow on the food side. A little inflation is good, a little deflation hurts you a little bit.
And so, yes, we've been up – and the fact that deflation has modified a little bit, it still has the de in front of it, not the
in, and so it's still impacting us some. It hurts you most in items like – I think the example I gave last quarter was fresh
meats, where year-over-year – it was either second quarter or first quarter end – year-over-year per pound beef was
down like 10%. And we were selling more than 10% more tonnage and certainly having lower gross margin dollars
because of it. And so as that changes, that will help us a little bit.
<Q - Karen Short>: Well, I guess presumably higher gross SG&A dollars too, because of the labor content. That's
kind of what I'm getting at. It seems like [indiscernible] (49:53)
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, absolutely, on the fresh foods, you have higher – yes, you have higher labor.
Inflation will help all those things.
<Q - Karen Short>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: Hi. Good evening. So, Kirkland Signature continues to perform pretty well. Just to what
extent is this growth coming at the expense of branded items, if any? And when you think about positioning the brand
going forward, are there any areas where you think Kirkland is underpenetrated and worth pursuing expansion?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I'm sure some of it comes at the expense of branded. Some of that, though, in some
cases it's the branded manufacturers that's supplying us, not always, by no means not all the time. But it's another
competitor. And again, we're pretty transparent about it. We want brands and private label, and so we'll continue to see
both of those. It really is an item business. And some of the success on the – all the big items, I mean, paper towels,
water, giant items that are hundreds of millions of dollar – we have several items that are $1 billion a year in sales,
several KS items. In some cases, we have $1 billion plus on the branded side of the same item, whether it's Charmin or
Bounty, and Kirkland Signature on those two items, whether it's various regional brand names of water works as
Kirkland Signature water, and it works for us and we'll continue to do that.
Our new categories – well, I think in the last year or two, I think the thing that has done very well for us is wine and
spirits, and that continues to have some legs, substantial legs. And the good news, like other KS items, when the brands
lose some market share, they get sharper on their own prices, which with us – not with everybody hopefully, which
makes us even more competitive on the brand.
So all that stuff works – in our view, works to our benefit and having the brand loyalty certainly helps with membership
and wanting them to come back to Costco. Other areas, I've always – apparel still has legs, if you will, and arms I
guess. You've got cosmetics, organic items, and there's been several organic items. Probably every month at the budget
meeting we see new organic items, whether its chicken broth or beef broth or some candy, caramel, chocolate things or
nuts, clusters. And these are $10 million to $25 million full margin items for us without a competitor, in terms of it's
not replacing a branded item necessarily.
We've done very well in some of the other snack items and energy bar items. We have items where – if a bar – I won't
name names here, but if a retail bar retails for $2, meaning we would sell it for $1.49, we're out there sub $1 on a great
item and a full margin for us and driving some real volume. So I think apparel, cosmetics, health and beauty aids,
organic food items, not fresh, but packaged food items, all those are areas where we continue to I think have some
room to grow.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: Okay. Thanks for the color. So, Richard, could you – I know – not to beat on e-commerce
again, but could you provide some early color on the Instacart and Shipt partnerships? And is there anything notable
you'd call out regarding customer response or basket sizes versus an in-store shop? And then just going forward, how

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it's still a very small piece of our business, but it seems to be working in the sense
that it's growing for them. We have Google Express, which operates out of five cities with several markets, but they're
in the process out there of offering several items, one to three-day delivery. And we're participating in that with them,
so that should be a positive for the program.
Instacart has continued to grow dramatically. They currently operate in 40 of our cities, up from 26 a year ago, utilizing
240 of our warehouses, up from 132 a year ago, so that's growing. And then there's a few others I mentioned. [ph]
Shipt, Dolly (54:46) was one and somebody else.
<A>: [indiscernible] (54:50).
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Boxed, I don't know if we're doing [ph] – that's back east (54:54). Look, the two big ones
are Google and Instacart, and there's not a whole lot of other color. They're working. We want to sell merchandizing
and they help us do that. But again, don't expect us to be doing anything giant and big in one fell swoop.
<Q - Zachary Fadem>: Got it. Thanks, Richard. I appreciate the time.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, Richard. Good afternoon.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: First question is a follow-up on inflation. We are seeing overall CPI start to recover, but
we've seen the Producer Price Index, PPI, come back a little bit faster. Are you concerned at all about any kind of gross
margin squeeze? Is what you're seeing on the cost front resembling what some those macro indicators indicate or
should we just think about the fact that pricing is moving higher in general as being a net positive [indiscernible]
(55:57)?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Pricing move in general is a net positive. If anything, though, I think that we create some
of our own deflationary pressures, because we're good at – look at the MVM example. Greater values to the member
means lower prices, which means us and our vendor lowering the prices some. And most of that is driving prices down
from our suppliers with the anticipation of significantly more unit volume. And the good news is most of the time, that
happens. And that's what we do. But that does drive – those things work – don't always work in concert with the
immediate bottom-line improvement.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Understood. And then a second question just relates to competition. As Amazon takes tens
of billions of dollars of retail share annually and clearly the biggest share gainer by far and the biggest one we've seen
in a while, are you seeing any – obviously, your comp overall are increasing at a faster rate than most of the space. Is
there anything you all are seeing in the mix that we might not catch through some of the commentary that would
suggest the changing complexion of how the consumer is really using your stores? Is it more consumables focused than
it had been or is it kind of business as usual with no sign of the change in the backdrop?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, so far – and there's not guarantee in the future, but so far it's been business as usual.
There's a number I read a few months ago about how Amazon, if the entire U.S. sale – increase of sales or whatever
was $50 billion, they were half of it. Well, they were. They were $25 billion, but they're – 25 divided by 50 is half. But
we were also up. The fact is, is there's others in the industry that were down $50 billion, and so they were a quarter of
100, minus 50 to plus 50. That $25 billion is still incredible and formidable. But in our view is – we are fortunate that a
lot of the impact if it's impacting some food items or some even packaged food items, it's traditional food retail that is
getting hit more than us.

We have to keep driving our member into our warehouse and we do that with great – of course, great prices and great
items. Certainly fresh foods, certainly gas station traffic, which brings them into parking lot, if you will. And certainly,
the loyalty program, which they have one too. All those things help us, and then the treasure hunt. We love it when we
hear from someone that they heard that we had something, they went the next day and it wasn't there. Well, we're still
pretty good in all that stuff and I think, again, the Kirkland Signature has helped that as well.
Now, so far so good. When we look at the specifics, even in markets where there's Amazon or somebody else is taking
share, a lot of what they're taking, on fresh or something, fresh is hard. And even they would acknowledge and others.
There will be more competition in the future, but who's going to get – we're asked a lot about Lidl coming into the East
Coast. They're going to take share, but they're going to take share from everybody else a lot more than they can take
share from us. So we haven't really seen a big change, like people are buying less something at Costco because of other
formats out there.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell.
<Q - Paul Trussell>: Hey, Richard. On SG&A, we've recently cycled some labor investments made a year ago. Could
you just outline for us some other puts and takes we should keep in mind that's going to impact the P&L in 4Q and
beyond?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
<Q - Paul Trussell>: On SG&A, on the expense front, really just want you to help us think about some puts and takes
on the expense side of things in 4Q and beyond, especially since we just cycled some of the labor investments you
made a year ago.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right. Well, look, the biggest put and take is sales. If we can get another percentage point
or two in sales, that's always good and that solves a lot of things. When you look at some of the line items, payroll is
the next biggest one, yes, we've just anniversaried some of that at the end of March. That helps a little bit. Healthcare is
still a challenge in the U.S. Increasing penetration outside the U.S. helps that number just by a higher penetration
within the total cost of the company and a lot less everywhere else. But again, that's going to happen slowly over time
in a positive way.
And in some quarters, the inflation, the U.S. does more than any small offset to that. IT expenditures, somebody
internally said, we'll probably get the question asked about it. Is the zero year-over-year basis point is an inflection
point? Probably not. We got lucky. Sales were a little higher. We had a lot of expenses last year leading up to the end
of the fiscal year, day one of the new fiscal year when we installed the new main accounting platform on which other
things will be built. And so we had a lot of third party contractors, lot of training, which you write-off, you don't
capitalize. So there's a little help there. In fact, it will come down over time, but it's not going to be zero.
I think we're still doing – e-commerce helps you a little bit to the extent even 11% last quarter or 13% or 14% in the
first two-thirds of the quarter before Mother's Day and what have you, that's a higher growth rate than the rest of the
company, so that's a much lower SG&A. So that helps you a little bit. But I think we do pretty well in trying to drive
the things in the right direction, but not touching certain things. We're not going to tweak wages a little bit less or have
an increase that's a little bit less.
We don't do big things like some of those incremental things that anniversaried in March, like bottom of scale. We
haven't done that I think in six years, but every three years we look at everything formally, and so we're still couple of
years away from looking again in terms of a big way. I still vote for a sales increase. If you get some extra sales,
everything else will fall in place.

<Q - Paul Trussell>: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just could you speak to Gold Star and overall household
membership growth? The growth has slowed a little bit. Just how are you thinking about membership count in the U.S.
and also what you're seeing on the international front?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Part of it has to do where we're expanding. Several of our units in the past couple of years
in the U.S., for example, have been in new or small markets, where you don't get the biggest bang. I think we had one
big bang. I gave the example of Tulsa in the new market, but that's not as small as some of the markets we've gone into.
When we opened another Seattle unit, which we have two in the last couple of – two and a half years, or in the Greater
LA market, it's a great success, net of cannibalization, but you only get a few thousand extra members, because
everybody is already a member. They just come more frequently because we're 20 minutes drive from their home, not
40.
We also – part of the growth depends on how many units we're opening overseas. When we open a new unit in Asia, as
of opening day sign-ups – paid sign-ups over the 8 or 10 or 12 weeks prior and through opening day, you could have
25,000 to 40,000 new members. Iceland, although there's only one location in Iceland, as of opening day we had, I
think, over 35,000 members. Is that right?
<A>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, over 35,000 and it's national news. And so I don't really look into the numbers. Just
it's as much based on where we've opened. It's not like, a like opening compared to two years ago is getting fewer
sign-ups.
<Q - Paul Trussell>: Fair enough. That's helpful. Thank you. Good luck.
Operator
And your next question comes from Scott Mushkin.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I actually want to follow-up on the last one, because it
just made a question jump into my head. Are comp memberships actually rising in the U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Comp memberships? In comp billings?
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Yeah. Are the membership going up in...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think they are, but very – it's probably a very small number. I mean, closer to zero than
the number above it. And part of that is when you're opening in a – let's say, we opened in Redmond, where Microsoft
is headquartered. That cannibalized knowingly three locations, two of them doing in the low to mid-300s a year and
one doing in the mid-200s or low-200s a year. We signed up several thousands new members, but not 20,000 new
members. If we average roughly – if you're just adding to our membership number of households divided by number of
locations, it's about 61,000 or 62,000. In that next year of that opening, the comp of those three locations is down,
because some of those members now are allocated to the new warehouse.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So [indiscernible] (01:05:48) I want to ask, just popped into my head. So how do you think
about that as your business matures in the U.S.? I mean, does that make you want to slow down your center growth? I
mean, how should we frame that? Maybe the number eventually goes negative.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, maybe it does. I don't think we're there yet. For 25 years, people have asked what's
your next whatever. What's your next fresh foods? What's your next gas station? What's your next pharmacy? What's
your next geographic market? Five years ago, I don't think any of us thought about – lot of seriousness, about going
into New Orleans and Baton Rouge and Mobile and Rochester and Toledo and Tulsa and the like. And we know, by the
way, on average, they're going to be a little slower, you take a few extra years, but they still have good metrics to them.

We have slowed. I think using the two examples in the Greater Puget Sound, Seattle area, in the last two-and-a-half,
three years, we've opened Lynnwood and Redmond. We waited on Redmond for 10 years to do, knowing that we – we
actually owned land in Redmond 15, 20 years ago. But as we opened Issaquah, Kirkland being the first one on the East
side of the city, and then several years later opened Woodinville, which north of that, north of Redmond, we kept
holding – we actually sold the land years ago, and finally – so we are – we try to be pragmatic about what we do.
But over time, you're right. We haven't found the bottom, that's the good news, in terms of – again, anecdotally, I
remember years ago when we concluded we needed a minimum of 0.5 million population to serve the warehouse. Then
there it was 450,000, and then it was 400,000, and we have some very successful warehouses that you divide the
number of households in the community and the population, it's in the very low 200s and a few in the high 100s.
So, hopefully, we'll keep making that – go in that direction. That will give us a little more life. Hopefully, the business
centers creates life, and hopefully that comp continues to improve, and hopefully, we find a couple of more countries.
So we think we've got plenty to go and until that changes, we'll let you know.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. So then my follow-up question, my real question was, I noticed BJ's, a competitor
of yours, is offering some pretty significant discounts on their memberships. I think you get the first three months free,
if I remember in the commercial correctly, and which means it's $40 for the first year. How do you – does that matter to
you guys? I mean, you're putting a fee increase through, but a competitor in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, Southeast
is offering significant discounts. I just wanted to get your comments on that, and then I'll yield. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. I think, first, if they advertise it good – we don't advertise. We don't spend money on
that. We love seeing TV and print ads still from both other competitors. And we're not concerned about it. We think
that the value at Costco is still a significantly higher price or without a free three months is a much better value. And
we think that's evidenced by our success of what we've done over time and the fact that even when we've done it in the
past, renewal rates have not really been impacted by it.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure.

And your next question is from Brian Nagel.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: Hi. Good afternoon.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Brian Nagel>: So, I apologize, I jumped a little late, so if you addressed this already. But on the gross margin,
Richard, it was definitely a better performance here than the prior quarter. And going back to the discussion we had on
the conference call last quarter, how much of the better performance reflected a, I guess, more stable gas price
environment? Was that a significant contributing factor to the gross margin this quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, gas helped the margins, as did ancillary – other ancillary business as well. But again,
to quickly cut to the chase, the roughly 80% of our sales, which is food and sundries, fresh – food and sundries,
hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, year-over-year on their own sales, they were up 12 basis points. So it was a lot of
different things. Okay?

<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Two questions. Number one, in terms of the e-commerce business,
as you guys reach a certain scale, do you need to change your processes or do you continue to go with kind of a
drop-ship philosophy?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'm sorry. Related to what? I didn't hear the first part.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Your e-commerce.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, as I mentioned earlier, part of the inventory increase in the company – because we
just take inventory divided by number of warehouses to give you a number and we'll maybe change that over time, but
we had an increase in inventory for e-commerce-related stuff not at the warehouses, but we went from 7 to 19
distribution points in the last year. So we're getting closer to the customer.
We're also working with third parties. I mentioned in the call the GE scheduling system. There's other scheduling
things that we're doing. And I mentioned the thing we're testing right now at our Bedford, Illinois business center I
mentioned last quarter, where in addition to this 50 or 70-mile radius where we deliver with Costco truck through third
party, there is one to three-day delivery to 17 states all the way to Pennsylvania and New Jersey. And so, if anything, I
think we're getting – it's getting quicker and cheaper to do these things for us.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And maybe we started off high to begin based on how we did it, but we're improving it.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Okay. Understood. And then second question is, hopefully, this is an easy calculation here.
When you look at the debt redemptions, the debt issuance, looks like you guys would be incurring about $25 million
more a year in interest cost, call it $6 million a quarter. Should that just be a pretty straight calculation or is there
something else we should keep in mind as we kind of work on our models?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I did a back-of-the-envelope this morning and I came in with a number that's a few million
higher than that, but still has a two in front of it. No, it's pretty straightforward. I mean, you've got $3.8 billion times
somewhere between 2.6 and 2.7, call it 2.65, it's a rounded number. You've got the pay down of the March debt that we
did, which was a $60 million a year savings. You've got the recent – the call, which we'll do shortly, of the $1.1 billion
1.125%. That's on the interest expense line, a little bit of an offset will be the cash. As you know, we borrowed $3.8
billion. Well, roughly $3.1 billion is the dividend. The other $700 million is cash earning less than net interest rate, and
even less than the 1.125% that's coming up. But it all melds out to something like you said. If you go back to the March
– where we had in place the March 2017 5.5%.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.

Your next question is from Oliver Chen.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thanks a lot. Hi, Richard. Our question is on the multi-vendor-mailer. How are you feeling about
what you've been doing in terms of testing and learning and the MVM product versus the product that you're offering at
everyday values? I know you're thinking about how to optimize that appropriately, so I'm just curious about the status
of that. And the second question was about the mobile app, and Amazon has a really good mobile app. So what features
do you want to have in your mobile app over time that you don't have now? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay. I want to get to you back on the latter question, just because I don't have something
ready to help me on that one. On the first one – I forgot now, what was it? It's late in the day here.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: The multi-vendor-mailer, the MVM and how you're...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, I think – we feel good about it. I think I said on the last call, some things we
enhanced the value and kept in the multi-vendor-mailer, items. Some of the things we took out and did everyday low

pricing on. Sometimes it's still better values based on us and the vendor working towards that end and to have it more
prominent. So there's lots of different things. It was 12 weeks ago that I said to many and to you on the phone, things
are fine. There's a few things that impacted us a little more or something that didn't work. I think we've improved on all
those things, but we'll continue to do that. This is, by no means, we haven't solved – found the answer to everything,
but we feel good about what's happened in the last 12 weeks as it relates to that question.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay. And, Richard, lastly on traffic and store traffic, you've been able to do a great job on a
multi-year basis with physical store traffic. What are some of the opportunities ahead or what are some of the plans you
have that just aim to sustain that in a sustainable healthily growing manner? Or should we be more cautious, because
it's been so good on a multi-year basis? Just it's something we monitor and it's been impressive for you to achieve such
good store traffic in a tough environment.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, and this is where we go, aw shucks. And I think we're going to keep focusing on
driving value of items and identify the items that make sense. And I mean it. As many of you who've known us for
years, as we've said many times, the good news, it's a lot of little things. Even gasoline is a lot of little things today,
because it had a big help for several years in the U.S., now we did in Canada for a few years. We now have what, a
dozen-plus gas stations in countries like Japan and Australia and soon a couple of other countries. And not everywhere,
but it's now a lot of – it's a little extra thing in some of those countries.
I think the wine and spirits thing has caught us off guard in a positive way that what started as a few wine items a
number of years ago were actually receiving rewards on price points that are – nobody could match and the trust in the
Kirkland Signature brand. On the spirits side, we never thought we'd be successful, and it's a double positive, because
it's not only selling us a full margin private-label item, but the competitors – the brands don't like losing market share to
us and they want to look better on pricing at Costco, so all those things that helped us.
I think the apparel area, as I mentioned, has been something [indiscernible] (01:17:02). We hadn't thought about it. But
over the last two or three years, it's a $5 billion plus business that's been growing at 9%-plus compounded for
three-and-a-half years, and that has more legs even though retail apparel is weak. And so we'll keep coming up with
stuff. I think the first time that our traffic went from a boring 4.2% compounded for seven calendar years, 2009 through
2015, and then it hit 3.8%, 3.5%, 3.3%, 2.8%, and everybody is saying – Bob and I and others were the first to say, this
could very well be the new normal, not to just punt on it, but 4.2% is pretty hard to do.
That being said, we still feel pretty comfortable. We've got some things for traffic drivers and fresh fruit still has legs.
KS still has legs. Gasoline still has legs; Executive Membership, so – the credit card, extra value, so we feel pretty good
about – that's it. In a way, a non-quantitative answer, but all things I think are relevant to the story.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Richard, you have very talented merchants. Does Amazon try to hire them? Is that something that
comes up in terms of that capability being such a competitive advantage?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I would hope not. We haven't – to my knowledge, we haven't – we've lost one or two
merchants, but not in the last few years. We lose a few IT engineers, several of whom 18 months in a day call us back
after they hit their cliff vesting, but that's everywhere. I mean, look, Amazon is in our town and they hire a lot of people
from every company in town and out of town. We've been fortunate, people have chosen to stick around, but that's – we
have – the answer is no, we haven't. But we cross our fingers that will continue in the future.

those are. And really just what is the pricing strategy with online versus in-store for those items that I think you said
2,000 items that cross over? I mean, should we expect prices are the same or is there a difference in pricing strategy
online versus in the club? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sometimes online, they're a little higher for delivery. Sometimes – as we tried some, what
I'll call, the velocity apparel items, socks and shirts and things, we did to some of that ourselves in terms of shipping,
because we want to get people comfortable ordering velocity items, whether it's apparel or health and beauty aids or
sundries like K-Cups. And unfortunately, I don't have the list in front of me of some of the new items. There have been
several KS items, but other brands as well. Again, give me a call after the holiday on Monday. I still have that
information with me.
<Q - Kelly Ann Bania>: Perfect. And then, can I just ask one more, just a clarification on gross margin. I think when
you talked about the core gross margin, the up 7 basis points, up 20 basis points with and without gas, that includes the
16 basis points from the Citi Visa, but the up 12 basis points – or the 80% of the core business up 12 basis points, that
excludes the Citi Visa, is that correct?

concerning you?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The biggest issue is three openings in the quarter, actually, two net openings, one was a
relo. So, no, nothing that's terribly disconcerting.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. And then – sorry, go ahead.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Nothing that is disconcerting. I shouldn't have used the word terribly.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Second question, the lift in comp that you've seen over the last several months, kind of
recovering the comp trends. Has there been anything in terms of Business members versus Gold Star or anything like
that that has kind of disproportionately driven that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. No, not really.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Got you. And then my last question is just around the e-commerce fulfillment centers, you
said you've got 19 of those. Where do you see that number going in the next few years? And then could the clubs
actually be used for the – you said 2,000 items that are in the clubs that are also offered online. Can the clubs be used to
facilitate delivery of those?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, going from 7 to 19 is a lot. And again, we're more than saving on that, because
we're getting the stuff to you quicker. We're spending less on freight. We did it somewhat inefficiently to start with.
There'll be more. I don't know if somebody has – I just know those two data points for 7 and 19.
The other question was will we ever use the warehouses as fulfillment centers. Sure, and I'm saying that not suggesting
it's going to happen tomorrow. One of the things we're doing with the Bedford, Illinois business center, in a way, is
e-commerce related. You order online and it will be delivered one to three days via a third-party carrier, certain items. I
mean, I think the items have certain weight and size limitations. We're not going to be delivering sofas to New Jersey

from there, but probably we'll be delivering that.
But using the business center is like using a warehouse. They're different set of items, but it was easy to do it because it
was set up in some ways to accommodate them fast. And you will see. But it's logical to think that we do you have
some locations around the country that could do some things at night when they're closed or low volume unit that could
help out, but don't expect anything on that front for at least the next year, and I'm only suggesting the next year,
because we haven't really talked about it a lot rather than could we.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, sounds good. Thank you.

And your next question is from Greg Melich.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Hi. I had two questions. One, Richard, could you fill us in on what gas was the percentage of
sales? And I think you said the gallons comped positive, and if you had the number that would be great. Then I had a
follow-up.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Do you know what it was? Okay, we're almost there.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Should I go with the next question?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay. So the other question, I just want to make sure I get the timing of Visa Citi and how that
came in last year. So, it's 36 bps of help to the EBIT margin, if I got this right. And in the fourth quarter we should
probably get another four or five weeks of that benefit. Am I thinking about that right or is there some other thing at
work? If I remember correctly, as you were running out the Amex program, you were sort of not signing up people or
not getting the payments for signing up people for the card, or is it just a straightforward think about that got a few
more weeks of it, but then it cycles?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think it's like six weeks, not just three or four. But then you get...
<A - Robert D. Nelson>: Jim told me that we had some disruptions last year.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, there was June 20 that we had some disruption around it.
<A - Robert D. Nelson>: And we also [indiscernible] (01:25:29).
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Bob is feeding me the information here. We're also conservative on some of the
assumptions. I mean, look, it's not going to be nearly as big as it was in the last three quarters, but it's not going to be a
quarter as big – only a quarter as big.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Got it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In terms of the gallon comps, it's a very strong number. The guys are laughing here. It has
two digits, but not – it's very low two digits, so I can't tell you anything.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Low two digits. Okay. And gas as a percentage of the total company sales?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, hold on a second. Do you have the line item report?
<Q - Greg Melich>: And maybe while you're digging that out, since I got you, the membership fee growth in local
currencies, how much the FX hit that line?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes, that's an easy one. First of all, gas is a little under 10%.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Okay.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And the other one was membership fees, that was in my figure...
<Q - Greg Melich>: 4%, in dollars.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I have it here. Membership fees reported was up 4%, in dollars were $26 million,
and 5% without FX. FX was a $3.6 million hit to the number.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Perfect.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If FX had been flat, it would be – the number would have been $3.6 million higher.
<Q - Greg Melich>: Higher, got it. Thanks a lot.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The 4% would have been 5%, yeah.
Operator
And your next question is from Edward Kelly.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Yeah, hi, Richard. Just couple of quick ones for you, sort of detail on here. On the gross
margin in Q4, is there any extra leverage from the extra week in Q4 that we should expect that's meaningful at all?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Nothing on the margin; very little, very little on the expense side, almost nothing.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on fresh foods. Could you provide maybe more color on
what's teed up here in terms of the things you've been talking about, particularly in organics, and is this any kind of step
change or just continuation of what you've been doing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Continuation, global sourcing being the largest purveyor of USDA prime beef in the
universe. We're now – in the U.S., we're something like a third of all U.S. prime beef sales. Before 2008, the vast
majority of all prime beef sales went to restaurants and hotels.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: And how are you doing on capacity in some items on produce from an organic standpoint that
maybe you struggled with in the past?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think overall – and not just us, but everybody has benefited from the fact there is more
supply out there. I think we feel competitively from the standpoint that we're well positioned, because I think we've
used a number on produce. We source produce from 44 countries. Nobody does that, and that gives us some additional
advantage in that area. But it's gotten less hard, but it's still organic as there's more demand than there is supply. But if I
look at the price points of organic versus conventional, on most items the premium is still a premium, but not as big a
premium as it was two years ago, because of the fact that there's less of a supply/demand imbalance.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And there are no further questions.
Richard A. Galanti
Well, thank you, everyone. Have a good afternoon and evening, and holiday.
