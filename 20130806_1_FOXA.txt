John P. Nallen
Thank you, Reed, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing the fiscal 2013 results, I'd like to highlight some of
the changes that you will have noted in today's earnings release. On June 28, the company completed the separation of
its business into two independent, publicly traded companies, 21st Century Fox and the new News Corporation.
Following the separation, the company does not hold any equity interest in the new News Corp. As a result of this
transaction, the new News Corp's historical financial results are reflected in the company's financial statements as
discontinued operations. The new News Corp. will be providing further detail on their own financial results when they
file their Form 10-K with the SEC. At 21st Century Fox, we are reporting our results in five business segments,
including the segment now named Other, Corporate and Eliminations.
This segment primarily reflects the company's corporate overhead costs, as well as the aggregation of all inter-company
eliminations for all periods. Prior to the separation, the old News Corporation these eliminations were reported within
the individual operating segments, primarily the film segment.
I would also note our use of segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA as we refer to
it, as our primary performance metric. The company now evaluates and will be reporting performance of its operating
segments based on segment EBITDA. And finally, the historical information reflecting all of these changes are
presented in the back of today's press release for your convenience
So with that housekeeping covered, let me turn to 21st Century Fox's full-year results first. Annual total segment
EBITDA was $6.26 billion, 9% higher than the $5.76 billion generated a year ago. This increase was driven by the
continued growth at the company's Cable and Television segments, partially offset by declines at the DBS segment.
The Film segment's contributions were consistent with the prior year. Overall, the 21st Century Fox businesses
delivered growth in-line with our expectation range.
Reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $6.82 billion, or $2.91 per
share, which included $3.76 billion of income included as other net, relating to gains on the acquisition of additional
ownership stakes in Sky Deutschland and ESPN Star Sports, as well as the gain on the sale of NDS.
Additionally, full-year results include gains of $306 million from the company's participation in BSkyB's buyback
program and $48 million in restructuring and impairment costs related to the company's digital games business, which
we sold this past February. Excluding the net income effects of these items and comparable items in both years,
adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to shareholders was $1.36 compared to the adjusted
year-ago result of $1.20. This 13% improvement principally reflects our net income growth and the impact of our share
repurchases during the year.
Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. For the quarter, the company reported total segment EBITDA of $1.49
billion, a 14% increase over the $1.31 billion reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. This increase reflects continued
strong growth in our Cable Networks segment, partially offset by lower contributions at the company's other operating
segments.
The company reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders in the fourth quarter of $977
million versus $596 million a year ago. This growth primarily reflects the increased contributions from the company's
Cable segment, as well as the impact of restructuring and impairment charge recognized in the prior-year fourth
quarter.
Current year quarterly results also include gains of $89 million from the company's participation in BSkyB's buyback
program and $81 million of income in other net, reflecting net gains on various asset sales and acquisitions. Excluding
these gains, and the restructuring and impairment charges, and comparable items in the prior year, fourth quarter
adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to shareholders were $0.31 per share as compared
to $0.27 per share in the prior-year quarter.
Now let me provide some comments on the fourth quarter performance at a few of our businesses. Let's start with the
Cable Networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results, generating close to three-quarters of the

company's total segment EBITDA. Fourth quarter EBITDA contributions increased over 25% from year-ago levels to
$1.08 billion, reflecting strong domestic growth led by Fox News and the National Geographic channels, and
significant increases at our international channels led by the Fox International Channels in Latin America and in Asia.
This growth continues to be primarily top-line driven, with segment revenues up 16%. Affiliate fees at the Cable
Networks increased 17% over year-ago levels with domestic channels' affiliate fees up 9%, driven by our affiliate
renewals earlier in the fiscal year. Our reported international affiliate fees were up 41% with half of this growth
reflecting comparable strong, organic growth led by FIC and the other half relating to the international sports channels
and foreign exchange.
Fourth quarter advertising revenues for the segment were up 10% over year-ago levels with domestic ad growth of 4%
and international growth of 20%. At our international channels, local currency organic advertising growth was
approximately 10%, after excluding the effects of the sports channels and foreign exchange. Fourth quarter expenses at
the Cable Networks increased 12% over year-ago level, primarily reflecting the costs associated with the new
international sports networks at FIC and at Star.
At our Television segment, EBITDA in the quarter of $213 million declined $22 million versus the fourth quarter a
year ago. This is largely due to the impact of a 7% advertising revenue decline driven by lower American Idol ratings
and by lower base ad markets and political revenues at the stations. These reductions more than offset higher
retransmission revenues.
At our Film segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $117 million, a $23 million decline compared to a year ago.
Primarily reflecting a $35 million provision we took relating to some older library product, specifically the Mary Tyler
Moore library, which we acquired in the 1990s. This quarter also included continued contributions from Ice Age:
Continental Drift and The Croods for DreamWorks Animation, offset by comparably higher launch costs from the
timing of this year's theatrical releases, including Wolverine and Turbo for DreamWorks Animation.
Our DBS segment reported EBITDA of $156 million in the quarter, as compared to $168 million in the prior-year
quarter. This decline reflects the positive impact from the consolidation of Sky Deutschland's EBITDA results being
more than offset by lower contributions from SKY Italia. Our results included $490 million in Sky Deutschland
revenues, which reflected ARPU gains of 5%, and a year-over-year increase in their subs of 320,000.
At SKY Italia, lower profit contributions are primarily the result of the current challenging economic environment in
Italy that continues to impact subscriber additions, with Sky reporting a net loss of 27,000 subs in the quarter. Local
currency revenues were below those of a year ago, with a slight increase in ARPU being more than offset by the
reduced subscriber base, yielding lower subscription revenue. So from a 21st Century Fox total segment EBITDA
basis, we ended the year up 9%, and the fourth quarter up 14%. We also ended the year with approximately $6.6 billion
in cash, and $16.5 billion of gross debt.
Since the date of the separation, we have been consistently repurchasing Fox A shares, resulting in approximately $320
million of repurchases from July 1 through today. We will provide further specifics around our capital plans, including
our dividend and share repurchase plan at the Investor Day on Thursday.
So now let me address our guidance for fiscal 2014. The base for our guidance that we will measure ourselves against
is the fiscal 2013 total segment EBITDA of $6.26 billion that we just reported. In 2014, our growth will be impacted by
several strategic initiatives, most notably the launch of sports networks here in the U.S. and in Asia, as well as the
launch of FXX. Additionally, we are expecting adverse currency effects to impact 2014 growth, principally from Latin
American currencies and the Indian rupee. Considering these items, and based on all the assumptions inherent in our
projections, we are anticipating our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for 2014 to be in the high single to
low double-digit range above the $6.26 billion base level for fiscal 2013.
Now the overall growth will be driven by our Cable segment, which represented two-thirds of our EBITDA this past
year. This segment will post continued solid growth, even after absorbing investments of $200 million and change in
2014 for the launch of the new channels and a comparative negative currency impact of approximately $100 million.
These factors will impact our company-wide growth by around 4%.

We are expecting the Television segment to post strong growth in 2014, even after factoring in over $150 million in
increased programming and marketing investments at the network to support ratings leadership. Growth at this segment
will be under-pinned by continuing increases in re-transmission consent revenues. While we will also benefit from the
broadcast of Super Bowl XLVIII, this benefit will be largely offset by reduced political revenues at the TV stations
from the record level we had in 2013.
On the content side, we are expecting the fiscal 2014 results at our Filmed Entertainment segment to be down a touch
to this past year as we prudently would not forecast our releases to have the level of contribution that Ice Age 4 had
during 2013. And finally, our DBS segment will benefit a bit from the inclusion of the EBITDA results from Sky
Deutschland. So overall, our businesses are well positioned for continued growth and we look forward to sharing
considerably more details with you at the Investor Day this Thursday.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chase for some additional comments.
Charles G. Carey
Thanks, John. I'll be reasonably brief in my comments today in light of our Investor Day upcoming this Thursday.
In many ways, the last year has been one in which we put in place the foundation for which we will grow 21st Century
Fox over the next three to five years. Obviously, the defining event for that foundation was the split in News
Corporation to enable us to streamline our operations and bring an enhanced focus and alignment to 21st Century Fox.
However, we achieved much more than that.
Our U.S. channels, we continue to build on our leadership position in key channels like Fox News and FX, while
strengthening emerging channels like National Geographic and Fox Business with stronger distribution and improved
programming. We displayed the ability to continue to successfully navigate the regional sports arena by strengthening
that business with the addition of an equity stake in YES and a new Ohio regional.
We successfully renewed affiliation agreements and drove advertising growth with continued momentum in our brands
and programming. Most importantly, we positioned ourselves to add critical new networks in sports and entertainment
to strengthen our overall portfolio and drive long-term growth.
Internationally, we also built on our leadership in our core entertainment area. Our success in launching series on a
global basis like Walking Dead, The Americans, and most recently, The Bridge, added an exciting dimension to our
business and really began to distinguish our entertainment networks as the first truly global ones.
The most significant event has been building a global sports business over the past couple of years to go with our
entertainment and non-fiction channels. Some of these sports businesses, like Latin America, are a bit further along and
have already moved to profitability, while others in Asia and Europe are early days. However, they are all underway to
bringing a critical new dimension to our business.
At the broadcast network, we've largely completed our initial retransmission agreements with MVPDs and our
affiliates. While the fees still represent only a fraction of the value of our content, this provides a base to build a dual
revenue stream that will enable Fox to have the economic framework of a Cable channel and begin the process of
building a profit stream that reflects its importance in the larger universe of cable networks. And we continue to make
strides in streamlining our businesses through sales such as NDS or acquisitions to take control positions like Sky
Deutschland.
While the foundation is in place, we recognize the real work lies ahead. In the coming year our priorities include, first,
building our new U.S. sports and entertainment networks and Asian sports networks. We will invest $200 million-plus
in 2014 and a bit more in 2015 due to one-time cricket events in India. These networks should turn profitable in 2016
and will be on their way to being major profit centers for us.

Investing as well in our broadcast network and executing a plan designed for the future, not one wedded to broadcast
rules of the past. This means different order and launch practices, new development strategies and more.
As John noted, we will incrementally invest about $150 million in Fox this year and we view that as an offensive, not
defensive strategy for this dual revenue business. Hit content is more valuable than ever and this network is a launching
pad for the best-in-hit content, so we're excited to invest here.
Additionally, our guidance for fiscal 2014 includes an advertising outlook, which anticipates that the results from the
recent broadcast and cable upfronts, along with incremental viewership expected for the Super Bowl and new domestic
and international cable channels, will provide continued advertising growth in the year ahead. At our broadcast
network, we expect pricing to increase in the mid to high single-digits, led by our sports broadcasts and we project low
single-digit growth in the local ad markets.
Current scatter markets are strong with double-digit premiums to upfront pricing. Pricing trends at our domestic cable
channels are expected to be up in the high single-digits and even higher internationally on strength through Latin
America and Asia.
Another key priority is maintaining market leadership in our film and television production businesses. The guidance
John referred to in the Film segment is a reflection of the challenge of predicting these businesses, not our confidence
in them. Our Film group continues to add new dimensions like DreamWorks Animation distribution, and Fox
International Productions, while successfully taking advantage of urging digital distribution opportunities.
Our TV group just finished the pilot season as number one in new series orders. They also look to build on their
momentum, and have shown the ability to navigate opportunities in network, basic cable, premium and digital
networks. They have a multi-year Netflix deal in place, so the exciting digital arena is just up-side opportunity for this
group.
We also aim to effectively execute the plans in place for our controlled satellite platforms. In Germany with Sky
Deutschland, this means building on our current top-line momentum, and we expect this year to be one of exciting
growth. In Italy with SKY Italia, the strategy continues to be maintaining market leadership at competitive strength, our
restructuring costs for the reality of today's Italian economy. We have a number of key content agreements expiring in
the next 12 to 24 months that will enable us to achieve our goal of taking $200 million plus out of the annual cost of
this business.
Profit in 2014 will also not be up much on 2013 because these agreements only begin to expire this year. But we'll
make real headway in 2015, while getting to our goal in 2016. This plan will enable us to have a very profitable and
strong SKY Italia even in the current economic circumstances that can grow the top-line more aggressively when the
economy warrants. There are a number of other key initiatives for the coming year such as directing our balance sheet
and liquidity but we will be able to reserve comments on the rest for Thursday.
With that, I'll turn it back to Reed.
Reed Nolte
Thank you, Chase. And now Chase, James and John will be happy to take a few questions. Again, given we are hosting
our Investor Conference the day after tomorrow, we ask you to limit your questions to the results and guidance we just
reviewed, as we will be addressing a much broader array of topics on Thursday, with ample time for additional
questions then.

[Operator Instructions] We will start with the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. Chase, can you give us a sense in your budget for fiscal 2014 what
percentage of Fox Sports One subscriber base at launch will be on the new rate card versus the old speed rate card. It
seems at least Comcast and Time Warner Cable are there, and is there any way to pull forward other distribution
contracts? What have you assumed in the guidance for this year? Thank you.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I'm not going to get too deep into sort of individual discussions. I mean, look – I guess in
general I'd say, we're confident about the targets we've got for the channel. And we're comfortable with where we are in
the process. We're engaged with a number of parties, this process usually have a lot of conversations that sort of have to
occur. Some details work out last minutes. But we actually feel good about where we are, and I think those
conversations with any individual players are probably best and in private.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Doug. Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go to the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks. I'm sure I'll get into this on Thursday, Chase. But I was wondering if you could
comment on the decisions around Hulu. The fact that the business now seems to be more of a strategic asset for you
guys, and you're in investment mode. I was just curious, John, if you can give us any sense for working capital for
2014. It was actually a pretty big drag in fiscal 2013 of about $1 billion. I wondered if you had comments on sort of
why that was, and what we should think about for fiscal 2014.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, I think on Hulu, yeah, I think it's really a case where we know – I think we've always
known the importance of these digital platforms, and the opportunity specifically in Hulu. I think the real question was
that partnerships are complicated, and can we get [ph] along with that (23:51) strategy, we both believed we could
execute to be successful. I think as we went through this process, we really found all the constituencies really coalesced
around the vision of how to really build this in a way that it could be something exciting for content owners, something
that could be an exciting addition to the digital marketplace, and something that in many ways could enhance the
existing ecosystem. And so, I think we know the importance of digital, so making the capital, in many ways, would be
easiest part, once we had planned that we all are aligned around and believe we can execute.
<A - John P. Nallen>: And, Ben, to respond to the working capital. You'll see the biggest change there comes from
our buildup of inventory, which is at the end of the year we had five enormous films in production, as compared to
where we were a year ago, led by Wolverine and a few other big ones coming out this year. And likewise, on the TV
side, we've got the most new series in the history of the company under development right now. So, a lot of that is just
a production spend toward those series. Looking to 2014, our expectations are we're going to see our revenue grow
much more significantly in the fourth quarter than this year. So when you look at an overall year, we'll probably be a
touch below where that working capital is but it's all because of the growth in the business.
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Yeah, and I guess the only other dynamic I'd add to that is, as we're growing these new
channels, clearly, there's a ramp-up to invest. We want to invest in content. We want these channels to be channels that
we can be excited about. So both on the sports and entertainment side, we've been investing to ramp up in the content
to fuel FS1 and FXX, as well as the international channel initiatives.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Ben. Can we move on to the next question, please?

Our next question will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Oh. Thanks. Just one clarification and one question. Chase, you said on Sky Deutschland –
I'm not sure what you said about increasing your ownership. I know you increased it already, but did you say that
you're going to plan it to own it fully?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: No, I didn't. I didn't say anything about – I didn't touch on the ownership. But to touch on it,
we are comfortable where we are, our focus is on driving Sky Deutschland to be as successful as it can be. But I – if I
did, I didn't mean to. I didn't think I did – we did not – right now our focus is on driving it to be successful and we feel
good about the momentum in that business.
<A - Reed Nolte>: Thanks, Jessica. Could we have the next question, please?
Operator
Next question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Bank>: Thanks. Can you talk about – in the underlying guidance you just gave, the impact of some of the
lumpy syndication deals like Modern Family, Glee and Cleveland, how they impact you as well as the assumptions for
OTT revenues? And also if you could just touch a little bit upon domestic ad revenue trends, they seemed a little bit
weaker domestically than I might have expected. Is there anything interesting going – anything that could be driving
some softness there?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: I think in terms of – I mean, first, on the syndication products, it's not actually as lumpy as it
used to be. It used to sort of recognize everything on the first [ph] date avail (27:04) and now really gets recognized
like Modern Family, which obviously we think could potentially be $1 billion profit franchise. But you now recognize
it really over the sort of life of that flow. So, you don't have the lumpiness you used to in the syndication marketplace.
So there are products that are coming in and out, but it doesn't have that one-time event. Some of the franchises like
Simpsons are still a fiscal year away. So The Simpsons is fiscal 2015, not 2014. So there's some benefits, but there are
always some things – there are a couple like I think How I Met Your Mother is one that it will be less than it was. We
had something last year that we won't replicate this year. So, there are gives and takes in that but not the drama that
used to be there.
I think our OTT, we're seeing it reasonably because I mean to me that's an upside opportunity. I mean, essentially we've
got, as I said, a multi-year sort of foundation output deal with Netflix in place, and so we sort of got the base. We're not
assuming – just because we think it's difficult to predict. I think there's a lot of promise for new entrants and new
opportunities probably in both U.S. and overseas. But I think we are not going to sort of bank on those. So I think we've
made a reasonably conservative assumption based on what we know. So we think there are opportunities for a much
more dynamic marketplace as the year evolves.
And I guess, what's the third?
<A - John P. Nallen>: Domestic ad trends?
<A - Charles G. Carey>: Domestic ad trends. Well, I guess look for us in the fourth quarter it was – because network
ratings first of obviously did affect our advertising and the stations and the network. And that's – there's no question, it's
a fact that Idol did not deliver and we hope we've made some steps to put new leadership directly in place. I mean
David Hill, who has shown a unique touch in a number of places, to try and lead that, it's still a show, still a profitable
show and still a top five show. And we think there's an opportunity to re-amortize that, but there's no question Idol
affected our broadcast business, so affected it there. I think the other dynamic in the cable set is probably the degree of
political spending that you sort of saw year-on-year as you went into that quarter, obviously affects us in places like the
news arena and others were – you'd get that fairly significant swing [indiscernible] (29:26), mid-year politics from
2012 to 2013.
