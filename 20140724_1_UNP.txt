second quarter of 2013, and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 8% and the increases were nearly across
the board. We saw growth in five of our six business groups, with particular strength in agricultural products,
intermodal, and industrial product shipments.
We were pleased to see strong volume growth, which, combined with solid core pricing, drove more than two point
improvement in our operating ratio, to a record 63.5% for the quarter. On the operating side, Mother Nature did finally
release her winter grip, but we experienced numerous washouts, flooding and mudslides, which caused disruptions to
our network during the quarter. In this environment, increasing velocity and fluidity has been a challenge, but we
continue to be focused on safely improving network efficiency and service for our customers.
So with that, let's get started. I will turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack. Good morning. In the second quarter, volume was up 8% compared to 2013, as solid demand across our
franchise led to volume gains in five of our six business groups. We had strong gains in agricultural products,
intermodal and industrial products and we also saw strength in automotive and coal. In chemicals, the declines in crude
oil volume were mostly offset by gains in other commodities. Core price improved around 2.5%, which was partially
offset by mix to produce a 1.5% improvement in average revenue per car. Our volume growth and improved average
revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 10%, which set an all-time quarterly record of nearly $5.7 billion.
Let's take a close look at each of the six business groups.
Ag products led our growth again this quarter. Volume grew 16%, which combined with the 2% improvement in
average revenue per car, drove revenue growth of 19%. Strong grain demand continued this quarter with car loads up
43%. Last year you may remember, we experienced a tight U.S. corn supply and improved world production, which led
to lower exports and reductions in domestic demand for livestock feeding. The strengthened U.S. supply and lower
commodity prices this quarter drove strong demand for export feed grain. Domestic feed grain demand was also strong
across most of our franchise. The one soft spot in grain was wheat, where the smaller hard, red, winter wheat crop led
to a slight decline in overall wheat shipments. Grain products volume was up 8%, led by a 15% increase in ethanol
shipments. We had a best-ever quarter for ethanol shipments, driven by favorable producer margins, higher gasoline
demand, and low ethanol inventories. And BDG shipments grew 33%, driven by strong export shipments to Mexico.
Food and refrigerated shipments were up 3% for the quarter, import beer volume was up over 20%, partially offset by
declines in rice exports and lower produce and frozen food shipments.
Automotive revenue was up 2% in the second quarter, on a 6% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down
4%, driven primarily by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem revenue, and also by mix.
Finished vehicle shipments were up 5% this quarter. North American automotive production continued to be strong, up
4%, versus the same quarter in 2013. Also, the sales rebound that started in March continued to gain strength as the
second quarter progressed. On the parts side, volume increased 8%, driven again by strong production demand and
over-the-road conversions.
Chemicals revenue was up 3% for the quarter, with a 4% average revenue per car improvement, partially offset by a
1% volume decline. Industrial chemicals volume was up 7%, driven by demand in a variety of markets, such as shale
related drilling, inventory replenishment of deicing materials after a strong winter demand and increased demand for
chemicals used in nylon production.
Fertilizer shipments were up 2% for the quarter. Strong export potash demand, coupled with a delayed spring planting
season in the U.S., drove the increase. And crude oil volume declined 24%, compared to the second quarter of last year,
with price spreads again negatively impacting Bakken volume.
Our Coal revenue increased 1%, on a 1% increase in volume, and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car.
Southern Powder River Basin tonnage was down 2%, as demand from lower inventories and higher natural gas prices
partially offset our previously reported legacy contract loss. Volume was also impacted by network fluidity challenges.

Colorado Utah coal tonnage was up 11%, benefiting from increased demand in the western part of our network, and we
continued to see strength from other coal producing regions, where tonnage was up 12% for the quarter.
In our Industrial Products business, a 12% increase in volume combined with a 3% improvement in average revenue
per car to produce 16% revenue growth. Non-metallic minerals led the growth in IP again, with volume up 21% for the
quarter. Frac sand use and share related drilling drove the increase, with shipments up more than 25% versus last year.
Our lumber shipments were up 17% in the quarter. We were encouraged to see improvement in the housing market
driving continued lumber demand.
Finally, Construction Product shipments were up 15%, as demand for aggregates and cement continued to be strong,
particularly in Texas and California.
Turning to Intermodal, revenue was up 16% in the second quarter, driven by 12% increase in volume and 3%
improvement in average revenue per unit. Domestic intermodal volume was up 12% in the quarter. New premium
services and continued highway conversions contributed to our volume gains. Our international intermodal volumes
were up 13%. Imports to West Coast ports rebounded in the second quarter after declining earlier in the year. We
believe some portion of the strength in the second quarter can be attributed to cargo owners advancing shipments ahead
of the July expiration of the ILWU contract. So it is possible that some of our traditional peak international demand has
already moved.
Let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for the second half of 2014. In Ag Products, strength from last
year's crop is carrying into the third quarter, and early signs point to another good crop year later this year. If we have
another good crop year, we should have a strong second half in grain, but remember that our comp gets much more
difficult in the fourth quarter. We also see continued demand for ethanol. The current forecast for ethanol production is
14.1 billion gallons for the year, which would be a record for the U.S.
We expect automotive production and sales to continue to be strong in the second half of 2014, which would drive both
finished vehicle and auto parts demand. Most of our chemicals markets should continue to remain solid throughout
2014, though we think crude oil spreads will continue to be a headwind. Low inventory levels and higher natural gas
prices will drive demand for coal in the third quarter. As always, weather conditions this summer will also influence
demand. We'll be better positioned to meet demand as our operational efficiencies improve.
In our Industrial Products business, frac sand will continue to benefit from share related activity. We think the strength
in Construction Products will also continue, particularly in Texas and California, and we are cautiously optimistic that
the housing market will strengthen in the second half of the year, driving our lumber shipments. We think strong
demand will continue in domestic intermodal, as highway conversions and new product offerings drive growth.
International intermodal should benefit from an improving economy, though volumes in the third quarter could
moderate because of the advanced shipments we saw in the second quarter.
The economy got off to a slow start this year, but it is showing signs of the modest strengthening we expected. Our
strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development efforts across the broad
portfolio of business. If the economy cooperates, we expect a strong second half of the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Eric, and good morning. Starting with our safety performance, we set first-half records in two of our three
major reportable metrics, and improved in all three year-over-year. Our first-half reportable personal injury rate of 1.01
set a first half record and improved 6% versus 2013. The team's commitment to risk reduction, courage to care, and the
total safety culture overcame a challenging operating environment. In terms of rail equipment incidents or derailments,
our reportable rate improved 4% to 2.95, and also set a first half record. Continued investments in our infrastructure
and advanced defect detection technology drove a reduction in track and equipment induced derailments.

We also made progress on human factor incidents through enhanced skills training and root cause resolutions. In public
safety, our grade crossing incident rate improved slightly versus 2013. To make continued progress we are focused on
improving or closing high risk crossings, as well as reinforcing public awareness through our use of targeted safety
campaigns.
In summary, the team has made terrific progress towards getting every one of our 47,000-plus employees home safely
at the end of each day, despite adverse weather conditions and the risk that comes with a stressed network.
Moving on to network performance. In April, we discussed the impact the polar vortex had on first quarter operations.
Starting the second quarter, we generated sequential performance improvement while growing volumes. By late May,
we felt we were well positioned to continue to make incremental advancement. Unfortunately, flooding severed a
number of key corridors in June, including our east-west main line, impacting our ability to generate the improvement
we anticipated. The episodic weather events were compounded by an increase in track maintenance work and
interchange fluidity issues. And as Jack noted earlier, while we were pleased to see increased demand, the network was
challenged to absorb the stronger volumes while performing at suboptimal levels.
Fortunately, we were able to use our unique franchise to mitigate some of the impact. We adjusted transportation plans
to use alternate switching yards and gateways and moved resources to where they were most needed. Using surge
resources we've increased our active locomotive fleet by more than 800 units and our total TE&Y workforce by around
800 since last fall. And we have more resources on the way. We have roughly doubled our TE&Y hiring plan from our
original expectations and now plan to hire 3200 TE&Y employees for the full year to cover both attrition and growth.
In addition, we have added $150 million to this year's capital plan, which now includes a total of 229 new locomotives.
Our service performance fell short during the second quarter, which is reflected in the metrics we report each week to
the AAR. Second-quarter velocity was down 7%, and freight car dwell up 12%, when compared to 2013. The
interruptions and subsequent limits on network capacity also drove a decline in our service delivery index, a measure
which gauges how well we are meeting overall customer commitments. On a more positive note, we were able to
maintain local service within a reasonable range, registering a 93.9% industry spot and pull. This metric, which reflects
the tighter service commitments we introduced this year, measures whether a car is delivered to or pulled from a
customer's facility on time.
In addition to surge resources, infrastructure investments have also improved our resiliency. The team is working very
hard to handle our customers' growing volumes while restoring the service they expect from us, and I am confident we
are well positioned to do so.
Speaking of demand, as Eric noted, the volume trends we saw earlier in the year were largely sustained in the second
quarter, with volume growth in each region of our network. We realized productivity with the volume growth, despite
the headwinds we faced during the quarter. So while we incurred some incremental costs associated with the congested
network, we handled 8% volume growth with a 5% increase in regional TE&Y workforce. Productivity improved from
an increase in average train lengths in all major categories and from T plan adjustments that reduced online work
events.
Our dedicated craft professionals and managers generated these results using the five key drivers to make a difference
in safety and productivity and in serving our customers. One of those five key drivers is capital effectiveness. We
increased our targeted 2014 capital spend back in May to around $4.1 billion. Roughly $2.4 billion of that is
replacement capital, with most of that to renew our track infrastructure. We are on target for the year as roughly half of
that program work is now complete.
Spending for service growth and productivity will total around $1.2 billion. Capacity, commercial facilities and
equipment are the primary drivers. This year's forecasted new capacity includes 56 miles of double track on the Sunset
Route, and another $300 million or so on the Southern Region. The investments in the South add critical capacity and
fluidity to a historically constrained part of our network. We are also accelerating investments to support growing
volumes in our north-south corridors.

We are purchasing 229 locomotives, more than 400 freight cars, as well as 5,000 domestic containers. Spending on
positive train control will total about $450 million for the year. All of these projects positively impact safety, whether
they support replacement, service, or growth. And the growth capital projects must meet aggressive return thresholds in
order to be funded.
To wrap up, our first order of business is to safely improve network performance while serving customer demand. We
are working hard to provide customers with a value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service. As I
mentioned in April, our recovery is partly dependent on interchange fluidity, so we continue to work with our
connecting railroads to improve performance at key gateways.
We expect to generate record safety results on our way towards an incident-free environment. Our investments in surge
resources and network capacity have proved invaluable as we handle network challenges, service interruptions and
increased demand. Our focus on reducing variability in the network has never been more important to generating
sequential improvement. Ultimately, safety and service will drive our ability to leverage unit growth to generate solid
productivity, all of which creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks Lance and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 10% to
an all-time record of more than $6 billion, driven by strong volume growth, and solid core pricing. Operating expenses
totaled just over $3.8 billion, increasing 6% over last year. Although operating challenges in our recovery efforts did
increase costs during the quarter, our operating income still grew 17%, to a record $2.2 billion. Below the line, other
income totaled $22 million, down 4% from 2013. Interest expense of $138 million was up 4% compared to the
previous year, primarily driven by increased debt issuance during the first half of 2014.
Income tax expense increased to $789 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings. Net income grew 17%
versus 2013 while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share repurchase activity.
These results combined to produce best-ever quarterly earnings of $1.43 per share, up 21% versus last year.
Turning now to our top line. Freight revenue grew 10% to a quarterly record of just under $5.7 billion. This was driven
primarily by volume growth of 8%, and core pricing gains of just under 2.5%. Business mix was about a half of a
percent unfavorable, as the positive mix impact in grain and frac sand volume was more than offset by the increase in
intermodal and shorter haul aggregate and cement shipments during the quarter.
Other revenue increased 12% in the quarter. Primary drivers included subsidiary-related volume growth, as well as the
change in the way we handle per diem revenue on auto parts containers which Eric just mentioned.
Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing trends in 2014. As we pointed out on our first quarter call, 2014 is a
legacy light year. So we are not seeing the point and a half of legacy benefit which we achieved in 2013. Even without
this legacy tailwind, our core pricing gain for the quarter was just under 2.5%. This was up slightly from the first
quarter, and also continued to exceed inflation, which remains low as we expected.
We remain committed to a strategy of pricing to market at reinvestable levels that are above inflation. This enables us
to earn the returns necessary for continued investment in our franchise.
Moving on to the expense side. Slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
increased 5% versus 2013. Higher volumes and inflation were the primary drivers of the increase along with some
increased costs associated with running a less than optimal network. Looking at our total workforce levels, our
employee count was up 1% when compared to 2013. However, the reduction in the number of employees associated
with capital projects helped to offset some of the increase in noncapital-related workforce levels. If you exclude
capital-related employees, our workforce was actually up approximately 2.5%, with just over half of this increase
coming in the TE&Y.

For the full year, in total, we plan to hire about 5,000 people to cover growth and expected attrition of just under 4,000.
This total includes the TE&Y hiring which Lance mentioned earlier. Over the long run, as we hire and train new
employees for growth and attrition, we expect to see our workforce levels increase with volume, but not at the same
rate.
Lastly, we still expect labor inflation to come in under 2% for the full year.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $923 million, up 7% when compared to 2013, driven primarily by higher
gross ton miles associated with increased volumes. Compared to the second quarter of last year, our fuel consumption
rate improved 1%, while our average fuel price was flat at $3.10 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories, purchased services and materials expense increased 9% to $636 million due
to volume related subsidiary contract expenses, higher locomotive and freight material costs and crew transportation
and lodging expenses.
Depreciation expense was $470 million, up 7% compared to 2013, consistent with our 7% to 8% full year guidance.
Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $316 million,
which was up 5% when compared to 2013. Higher freight car rental expense was partially offset by lower freight car
and container lease costs resulting from the exercise of purchase options on some of our leased equipment. Other
expenses came in at $228 million, up $9 million versus last year. Year-over-year improvement in our freight damage
costs and environmental expense was more than offset by increases in our property tax expense. For 2014, we still
expect the other expense line to increase between 5% and 10% for the full year, excluding any unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance, pricing the business at reinvestable levels and strong demand continues to
drive our results. We achieved a quarterly record operating ratio of 63.5%, improving more than two points when
compared to 2013. Through the first half of the year, we have achieved a 65.2% operating ratio, an improvement of 2.2
points over last year. We also remain committed to achieving strong cash generation, and improving overall financial
returns.
Turning now to our cash flow, record first half earnings resulted in cash from operations of over $3.2 billion. This is
roughly flat with 2013, reflecting primarily the headwind this year in bonus depreciation and the timing of cash tax
payments. Capital invested totaled $2.2 billion year-to-date. This includes about $260 million for the buyout of the
finance lease on our headquarters building, which was put in place back in 2004 and is in addition to this year's $4.1
billion capital plan. In addition, we returned $776 million in dividend payments to our shareholders.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $1.1 billion, since the first of the
year, bringing our adjusted debt balance to $13.9 billion at quarter end. This takes our adjusted debt to cap ratio to
39.4%, up from 37.6% at year end 2013. We continue to work towards our targets of an adjusted debt to cap ratio of
approximately 40% and adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5.
Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role in our balanced approach to cash allocation. As you
may recall, our new repurchase authorization of up to 120 million shares post split over a four-year time period went
into effect January 1st of this year. Since the first of the year we have bought back 16 million shares totaling about $1.5
billion. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since 2007 to 228 million shares.
When you combine dividend payments with our share repurchases we returned over $2.2 billion to our shareholders in
the first half of this year alone. These combined payments represented a 51% increase over 2013, again demonstrating
our continued commitment to increasing shareholder value.
So that's a recap of the second quarter results. As we look to the remainder of the year, continued strength in the
economy, solid core pricing at reinvestable levels above inflation, and improvement in network performance will help
us achieve margin improvement, record financial results and strong returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn it
back over to Jack.

Okay, thanks, Rob. As we move into the second half of the year, our network velocity and fluidity are improving,
which will better position us to serve the strong demand we're currently seeing in the marketplace. With our increased
capital budget of $4.1 billion, we are committed to invest in the resources necessary to run a safe, efficient and reliable
railroad which supports our value proposition for our customers, and we are optimistic about the second half of the
year. As always, we are closely monitoring the economic landscape along with the major drivers across all of our
business segments including the potential impact that weather could have on grain and coal.
As the economy gradually continues to improve, the power of our diverse franchise is providing business growth
opportunities in all of our commodity groups. The men and women of Union Pacific are committed to safely improving
our network performance, allowing us to provide customers with the excellent service they deserve, while rewarding
our shareholders with increasing returns. So with that, we are going to open up the line for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Due to the number of
analysts joining us on the call today, we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one follow-up question,
to accommodate as many participants as possible. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan
Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: I wanted to chat a little bit more on pricing. We saw, as you show, Rob, in your slides, the core
price metric started to tick up again. Assuming that inflation doesn't fall further from here, and capacity is getting
broadly pretty tight in the marketplace, do you feel like we have seen the trough in the core price metrics?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As we've said in the past, Bill, we expect strong pricing opportunities as we see continued
strength in demand. We price for reinvestability and we price to the marketplace. We have mentioned in the past that
we do have part of our escalators that are based on A-LIFT, which is still modest, but we continue to see pricing
opportunities as the demand strength continues.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. And then, Jack, I'm curious about your views on OR. You didn't mention it, but
obviously, we know you have said this in the past, that the guidance that you have given in the past, you are already
kind of there. And if we look at third quarter, that's typically a better seasonal quarter for you than second. Of course,
you won't have any weather effects. So, it would seem that third quarter should see a nice improvement on OR. But
where do you think the wall is, if you will? Is there a limit? Is there a number you worry about, or you think that's about
as good as we can do? Or is that just really a theoretical and we are not even close?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know what, we are not seeing a wall at this point in time. Rob has said many times,
Bill, that when we reach our guidance of sub 65, we are going to move on from there and continue. Every time we look
at productivity, core pricing, the opportunities to grow our business, the reinvestment that we are making in our
infrastructure to support that growth at profitable levels, we are enthusiastic about our ability to do better on operating
ratio.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: That's great. All right. Thank you for the time.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I wanted to get your take on some of the implications of
the BN service issues, just because they are continuing, I think, longer than maybe some had expected at the beginning
of the year. And do you think this is creating more longer-term or maybe permanent market share gains, and do you
think there's an opportunity for kind of incremental share gains next year? And then, just wondering if you are seeing
any competitive response from them on the pricing side that could limit some of the pricing opportunities?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I have said BN is a strong competitor. They are a capable competitor. They have said they will
get their network back, and we are taking them at their word. We are in a competitive marketplace, and we continue to
see them being an effective competitor in the future.
We as always, we focus on business development and we look for opportunities that we can price effectively. It works
well with our network, and we are focused on that, and we are focused on that for the long term.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Yeah, that's all fair. Clearly, when we look at the volume between you and BN, clearly, there's
been some share shift. Maybe I'm not asking for specific conversations, but what are you hearing from customers? Do
you think that that's going to stick with you? And do you think – could there be opportunities for more of it?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Scott, I think you are seeing some of both. I think there are some places where we have been
able to pick up some share and, of course, the opportunity for us is to demonstrate to customers the power of our
franchise, the ability to provide safe, reliable, consistent service, day in and day out. And we're hopeful that that has
some stickiness to it and that that business will hang with us, even as the BNSF recovers. There is some other business
where, basically, our franchise isn't quite as strong as theirs to the end market location, and, in all likelihood, as the
BNSF service returns and they are able to take the business back, it's going to shift back to them. So I think you see
some of both.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That makes sense. And then, just last thing on coal. Volumes have been struggling
recently. I'm guessing that's more of a rail service issue than a demand issue. Any way of putting some numbers around
how much coal you think you are missing out on because of some of the network issues, and how much pent-up
demand there could be once the network is back up and running?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As you said, we are seeing strong coal demand, and I think, as Lance and Rob both said in their
prepared remarks, we did have network fluidity challenges. Weather and natural gas pricing will determine the demand
in the future, but at this point, we see pretty good upside demand from our current run rate of coal volumes.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Scott, If I could just jump in. This is Rob. What I would look to is, the inventory levels are
still below where the utilities would like them to be, when you look at it on a five-year average. So, as we are in the
throes of the summer air conditioning burn season, with low inventories, we think that gives us increasing
opportunities.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, in fact, Scott, if you looked at those numbers, in May, it was like 19 days below, and
in June, it's dropped to 16. So there has been some improvement in the inventory levels, but there's still lots of
opportunity for us as we see the second half of the year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That's good. All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning, guys. As a follow-up to the kind of core pricing discussion earlier,
could you elaborate in terms of where you are seeing that acceleration come? Has this been driven by the market share
gains that you have had? Any sort of incremental color you could provide would be helpful.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think we have said in the past that a portion of our business, about 30% of our business, is
really repriceable at any one period of time, and I think pretty much across the board with strong demand, we are
seeing the opportunities for price improvement.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: That's helpful. And then a clarification with regard to the hiring that you guys had
discussed. It sounded like that's a net incremental 1,000 employees, with 5,000 being hired for growth, but then you got
4,000 in attrition. Am I thinking about that right?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, that's exactly right, and it's not an exact number, but what we are basically saying is,
fairly high hiring numbers, fairly high attrition rate, and the net number will ultimately be driven by what the volume
ends up being because we still squeeze out and expect to squeeze out productivity. But it's a high class problem for us,
as volume grows for us, to continue to increase our hiring levels.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: And Rob, as a clarification, what volume are you guys expecting in the back half with that
1,000 additional head count?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, great question. We're obviously not going to give that guidance, other than, we do
see, as Eric walked through, a lot of optimistic opportunities for us. So without giving a specific number, we hope the
economy continues to cooperate, not only for the balance of this year, but as we head into 2015.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Fair enough. Appreciate the time.

Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Wonderful. Good morning. Eric, can you just dig in a little bit on the comments on
the pre-shipping and your thoughts there on intermodal, as we head in not only the next couple months, but maybe even
into the back half of the year, just given what level you felt was pre-shipped and what do you think the outcome of that
is the next couple of months?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Ken, as we said, our international intermodal was up 12% (sic) [13%] in the second
quarter. I would say going into this year, we probably would have expected a 3%, 4%, 5% improvement in second
quarter, and we clearly were above that and so we think that most of the increase beyond that was not necessarily
organically marked or business driven, but related to the pre-shipping. And so we think that that will probably impact
the volumes in the third quarter.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. And then your thoughts on CapEx. I know, Lance, you delved into a lot of the detail
of different projects, but when you think about this level of volumes and the speed and obviously CapEx takes time to
roll in, is there concern in the near term about ability to handle, whether it's pinch points or ability to keep pace with the
volume growth that you are seeing right now, given that you are kind of almost at your targets for your weekly car load
growth?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yes, so, Ken, we feel confident that our network can handle the kind of volumes that look like
they are coming our way as we proceed through the second half. You know our capital plan is targeted at specific
bottlenecks and constraints. It's coming to fruition, as we would like it to. And so going forward, we feel pretty good
about being able to handle the volumes that we are seeing.

Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the last question,
discussion, is it fair -- I know that you guys are bringing on some additional head count and locomotives but you are
also expecting network velocity to improve and benefit from some productivity gains. So if I think about incremental
margins in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, is it possible or fair to say that we could see an acceleration from the
58% that you posted in 2Q? Not that that wasn't a good number, of course.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Well, Allison, as you know, we don't give guidance on that but the entire team is focused
on, in fact, making improvements everywhere we can. I mean, if the economy cooperates, that's a great opportunity for
us to move Bill's very strong volumes; gives Eric a chance to price it right. Lance has talked about the improvements
that we are progressing and, in fact, seeing in our operating efficiency which should help us on the cost side. So we are
focused on doing that. I'm not going to give guidance on that number but we are focused on improving our margins.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. And with respect to the sequential improvement in pricing and the 30% of your book
that is sort of tariff based, what could we see in the back half of the year? Is there a potential to see another 50 basis
points or something like that, potentially by the end of the year as a result of more upward adjustments on spot
business?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Allison, that's way too specific. We are not going to go down that line. We are
going to continue as we said to price to the market and to have reinvestability as our threshold, and we've got it headed
in the right direction.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. Rob, if I could ask about the repurchase activity in the quarter,
certainly seemed to step up quite nicely, and you think out over the next several quarters and maybe into the next year
or so as you are approaching some of your leverage targets, you are getting closer to that; can we see a sustained level,
kind of in line with what we saw in the second quarter? Is that a bit of a catch-up or a true-up? I just want to get a rough
sense of maybe how you think about the pace of that repurchase activity going forward.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, and as you know, we don't give guidance as to what we're actually going to buy. But,
I would say there was nothing unusual in the second quarter other than we continued, A, it starts with generating strong
cash on the front end, which is our entire team's focus. That gives us then the opportunity to reward shareholders and
we will continue to be opportunistic with our share repurchase program as we were in the second quarter. So I can't
give you a precise number but we felt pretty good about what we were able to do in the second quarter under that
philosophy, while at the same time, reinvesting in the business with a strong capital program, and with an increased
dividend payment that you saw year-over-year.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Sure. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then if I could just get you guys – just curious
to get your take on the crude by rail rules, or the proposal that came out yesterday, just getting a rough sense of maybe

how you think about that two-year timeframe, and maybe some of the other puts and takes that are in there, it seemed
relatively okay, the timeline seemed a bit tight relative to our expectations but just curious your take on that.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: You know, Chris, I'm kind of there with you. There was really not anything in there that was
totally a surprise to us. We have been actively involved with the Department of Transportation, the AAR and others in
helping to do everything we can to make what is already a safe product safer, and so some of the ideas that are in that
MPRM have already been implemented and some that are still there, that we still need to work with, and so we want to
be a voice at the table. The two-year timeframe, the timeframe really just revolves around what is the capacity in the
industry to rebuild and to build new tank cars? And two years does feel a little tight, and if we go too far down that
path, then that says some product isn`t going to be able to move which is not the right solution. But so far, I have to say
that I think we have got a good track record of having thoughtful approaches to this and we're looking forward to sitting
down again and filing our comments, sitting down with secretary Fox and others to work through what is the right
solution here.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good morning everyone.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Good morning, Walter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Just coming back on the pricing question. Just talking a little bit more broadly; I heard, think
it was Jack, it might have been Eric saying sticking to your approach of pricing in line with inflation. A number of your
competitors have taken it a little bit – a step further now and looking a little bit more at yield management and focusing
on customers that perhaps are not pulling their entire weight and looking a little bit more on return on invested capital
as the metric by customer, as opposed to pure pricing. Eric, have you looked at doing that? And I guess I'm asking the
question in the context of intermodal specifically with the tightening truck market. Could there be opportunities that
just a blanket price in line with inflation is not the right approach, but rather looking at it from a more opportunistic
perspective, given some of the tighter capacity constraints that are going on, particularly in trucking but across your
entire book of business.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Walter, I'm not sure. Hopefully we have not given an indication that our pricing strategy is to
price in line with inflation. Our pricing strategy is to price to the market at reinvestable levels, which basically means to
make sure all of our business is generating an effective return on investment. So that's the strategy that we have had for
a number of years. We think it's the right strategy. We think it's helping to drive the financial results we are producing
and we are committed to that strategy.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And then specifically on particular markets, notably trucking, where perhaps the pricing
might have not been where you wanted it to be. Can we potentially see an uptick in pricing in those areas, driven by the
tighter trucking market I guess is where I'm going.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, we do see the trucking market tightening, the CSA drivers are tightening. The trucking
market is an effective competitor for a wide swath of our business, not just intermodal business, and certainly, as their
costs go up, that gives us opportunity to see more demand for our network and we are seeing that and we have been
seeing that and we are going to continue to price to the market based on that.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. My second question here is just more of a broader question and certainly for you,
Jack. There has been talk a little bit and I heard you reference the dependence on your partner on the other side for
turning assets, or your interchange partner. There's been talk about potentially down the road improving service broadly
for the railroad industry through a cross the Mississippi type of merger. Is that something that you just think is not on
the table from regulatory approval standpoint or is that something we as investors should think about? It might,

obviously not in the near term, but perhaps a little further down the road as a viable opportunity?

The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and congratulations on a strong quarter.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Thank you.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: A question of a different kind. I want to focus a little bit on cash. Going back historically,
you generally don't have less than $1 billion of cash on the books, and I'm just looking, you are down about $700
million from where you were cash-wise a year ago and I know a lot of that has gone to CapEx, share repurchase and
dividends. If you are going to stay within the boundaries of the growth target you are at, is there a cash level you want
to stay at and we would assume that if the share repurchase were to continue at this level, it would have to result in
more debt?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Jeff, I mean, as you know, we and most companies in corporate America are holding
more cash today than maybe historical numbers would have suggested. But I wouldn't get too hung up on quarter end
cash balances from one quarter to the next, because there's all kinds of timing issues, which really was the big explainer
of some of the changes that we saw in our second quarter, whether it was tax payments, timing of tax payments
year-over-year, that's all factored, that timing that we choose to do. So, again, our focus, the way I would answer that,
is our focus, as I said earlier, the entire team is focused on generating quality cash from operations so that we continue
to have the opportunity to reinvest in the business, continue to move our dividend up, and continuing to be
opportunistic with share buybacks, which I think we have, in fact, walked our talk in terms of what we have done over
the last several years.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. So your point is that this is more of a working capital anomaly in 2Q. But I guess my
question is, is there a certain level of cash you want to keep on the books? Should I think of this as kind of a bottom in
terms of where you want cash to be?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: No, I wouldn't look at that. It's not a hard number on the cash. Again, as you know, we are
focused on improving, which we did in the second quarter, our debt to cap ratio. We've said we want to get to the low
40s number and we have got a little bit of room or opportunity to continue to progress in that direction. I would look
more at that number.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. Guys, thanks.

<A - Eric L. Butler>: We are excited, Brandon, about our new intermodal products and services, and Santa Teresa has
facilitated us being able to put some new products and services in the marketplace, and we're going to look to grow that
even more in the future. So we view that as upside and excitement for us. Our Mexico franchise, as we've said in the
past, we have the premier Mexico franchise with six border crossings, and we're continuing to focus and invest in
strengthening our Mexico franchise with all of our Mexican rail partners. So that's going to be an area of focus for us in
the future, as you suggest.
Auto manufacturing, in Mexico, is growing. Historically, they have been, call it, 1.5 million, 2 million, 2.5 million
vehicles a year. They are projecting over the next three, four, five years, to grow to 4 million cars a year production in
Mexico, with all of the new plants. As anything, really what's going to drive the level of our auto business in the future
is sales, because wherever the car is produced, hopefully we'll have a chance to move it, given the strength of our
franchise. So growing the absolute number will really still depend on what's happening with automotive sales.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, I appreciate that, Eric. And Lance, I wanted to ask about network velocity
and obviously the favorable leverage you have been getting on your TE&Y head count. Is that going to continue, or do
you need to ramp that a little bit faster to get the network to where you want to see it? And does that necessarily mean
that you can't still get leverage if velocity is improving?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, so, Brandon, we love to get the leverage through service improvements. Service
improvements are our favorite way of kind of leveraging growth. If you look back at the second quarter, we leveraged
the growth, but we were behind the eight ball when it came to our service product. As we look forward, the addition of
resources like labor are going to help us improve our service product, and we still expect to get leverage productivity
off the volume, as we add that labor.

The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. Good morning, guys. When we look out to the third quarter, I was just curious,
when you look at your base plan for putting more locomotives into play and calling more people back to work, what's
your base plan for the ag crop? Because it seems to me, if the ag crop is good again, you could have increased demands
on both you and your western partner, and we all know that the BN hasn't had a good time of it this year. So I'm just
curious, what sort of the base outlook you have for the crop is?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So Jason, the latest reports from the Department of Ag says that the corn crop is as good as it's
been in the last 20 years. There's still weakness in the wheat crop, but if you are talking about the corn crop, we are
expecting, and I think the ag has – The Department of Agricultural Estimates suggests that we are looking at perhaps
another record corn crop year, which, again, will say that the transportation network will see strong demand for moving
that. We feel pretty good about where we are with that. We have ramped up to handle the incremental demand from last
year's record corn crop, and we are in a position to maintain that level if the crop comes in that strong. So we feel pretty
good about how we are positioned to handle that potential demand.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. Very good. And if I can go back to pricing. Given how tight the truckload market's been
and that we've seen the carriers now take the rates every chance that they can sort of get their hands on. Should we look
at sort of your core pricing here in 2Q as maybe the bottom for the year, as you get a chance to reprice some of this
intermodal business going forward?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Jason, so, again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but we are continuing to look at a pricing
environment that we think is strong, and we're going to price the market, ensuring that business is reinvestable, and
that's our focus. That will continue to be our focus.

<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Well, let me ask it a different way then. You said that about 30% of your business at any given
time may be up for pricing. Out of that 30%, how much is intermodal?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We don't go into that level of specificity, typically.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Jason, this is Rob. You know we're not going to give your pricing guidance, other than the
tenets of our strategy remain in strong force, and that is, to price to market at a minimum reinvestable level above
inflation. And, clearly, a strong demand environment is better than a weak demand environment. So, we will look to
move numbers and price appropriately everywhere across the business, whether it's intermodal or other.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thanks for taking the question. I had a question about all of the operating challenges you faced
in second quarter, which sounded fairly substantial. Yet, the operating ratio was absolutely spectacular. Do you want to
share with us, perhaps, the cost of all of that flooding and all of the congestion that remains from the winter, et cetera?
And, perhaps, what the quarter would have looked like, had you not had those operating challenges?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, John, I'm not giving the specific number, and it's hard to exactly split the hairs
between was it weather? Was it adding costs as a result of some of the challenges that Lance talked about? It was kind
of all of the above, and without giving a precise number, they were somewhat meaningful, if you will. Look at our
labor line, you look at some of the purchase services, you look at some of the other cost items. They were in there. So
your point is well taken that, had we not incurred those costs, things could have been slightly better. And I think you
are focused on the right thing, that we did a good job of improving our margins in spite of some of those challenges,
and some of those challenges clearly were brought on by a very strong ramp up in volume, so that helped, of course,
contribute towards the positive volume and margin improvement.
So, again, without breaking out the numbers, we think that does give us an opportunity, if the economy stays strong,
and demand stays as strong as it is, for us to make the improvements that Lance talked about, for us to continue to
improve our returns and our margins.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Got it. Thanks for the answer. Second question related to some of the capital investment that
you are making on the southern part of the network, where you've had some capacity challenges over the last couple of
years. That area appears to be right on top of the area that will be ultimately supporting a lot of new investment in
chemical, petrochemical plants, refineries, things of that nature. Where do we stand in the build-out of all of that
chemical industry infrastructure, and when do you expect to start to benefit from traffic emanating out of those new
facilities or the expanded facilities?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: John, I think, overall, we are really expecting that the investment in chemical industry really
starts to hit our network sometime in the 2016, 2017 kind of zone. That's when we see the bulk of it and, certainly, the
investments we're making today are anticipating some of that, as we see, not only because of the oil business and things
like that, but also everything else that's happening in our southern region. Lance, do you want to -
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, I would remind you that the beauty of the investments that we are putting down in the
southern region is that they can be broadly utilized for different commodity groups. You point out one, the chemicals

franchise. We are using them right now for our strong grain shipments down to the Gulf, and we can use them for
many, many frac sand. It's beautiful to leverage that capital that way.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, we have a very important project going on right now. It's one of the biggest
congestion points on our railroad, called Tower 55. We are about halfway through that project. We will have it done by
probably the 1st of the September or around that point. But getting that bottleneck out of our network, before this starts
to come on stream, is an important step forward to us as we look ahead.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you for the color.

The next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right, thanks for taking the question. Eric, as you think about the RPU development
in intermodal, could you talk a little bit about how mix played in there? You had very good growth in international and
domestic. Would you say mix is kind of a headwind to the RPU development, or neutral, or maybe a little bit of a
tailwind?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Mix was a little bit of a headwind (sic) [had no material impact] in the second quarter, really for
some of the new products and services that we put in place. We are shorter hauled in some of our traditional long haul,
international, intermodal business and domestic intermodal business, but it was just nominal in the second quarter.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: And within that domestic intermodal business, we hear a lot about chassis problems,
particularly around some of the international moves, and the potential for driver shortages to maybe make it more
difficult to get some of the retail products into market. Are you seeing some of those pressures as well, or you guys
been able to manage through those sort of first mile, last mile challenges without a lot of problems?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think we are seeing some of those pressures, nothing that is beyond our ability to manage
through on a tactical basis. We do have some major initiatives underway to really address making our first mile, last
mile process a lot more effective. And one of the good things about the challenges that you see kind of in the dray
network, with the driver shortage, is that it really emphasizes to go rail as long as you can and as far as you can on the
rail network. So we do think we are going to see some upside from then.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. Well, outstanding pricing on the intermodal side. Appreciate the time, guys.
Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Morning.
<Q - Justin Long>: You talked about the 229 locomotives that are coming on in 2014. I was wondering if you could
talk about the timing of these deliveries over the course of the year. And also, as you look into 2015, do you have a
rough idea right now of how many locomotives you will need, relative to this year, in terms of new orders?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So we are receiving locomotives in the second half of the year. It's a good portion of that
229. And if you look out into 2015, we have not solidified our plans yet, but we could very well be in the market in
2015.

<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. And, secondly, in June, you announced a ramp of your premium intermodal service
from Chicago to the West Coast. I was wondering if you could talk about the mix of your intermodal business. Do you
expect to bring more of your intermodal volumes in house over time, or do you think that mix between what you handle
internally versus working with the IMCs will stay about the same?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So we have hardly none of our intermodal business today that we do outside of IMCs.
IMCs are our strategy, our market channel strategy, to go to market. We do have a internal IMC that is focused on the
auto parts business, a subsidiary, UPDS. But, other than that, our market channel strategy today is to work with IMCs.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. And there's no plans to change that, going forward?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Not at this time.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, great. I appreciate the time.

Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Good morning. Thank you. I have a couple of questions around locomotive productivity and fuel
burn. We did see a modest improvement in the second quarter, and I'm wondering with the additional locomotives
being added in the second half, should we anticipate the consumption rate to tick up near term, and then possibly trend
down again longer term?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, sure, so new locomotives are actually a benefit to C rate. But there's just – I don't think
there's going to be enough new locomotives coming online in the second half to measurably show up in C rate. I will
tell you that I'm pretty proud that we got some C rate reduction, which is improvement in the first half, given the fact
that our network was a bit sluggish and we pulled out a fair number of stored locomotives that are not our most fuel
efficient locomotives. So that just demonstrates that our activity on C rate is getting traction. And I expect that to
continue.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Great. And then do you have a longer term target where you think your fuel consumption rate
would be given the newer locomotives that you are gradually going to be adding over time?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Better.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. All right. If I could just add – I had a question on your comment earlier on labor attrition.
Is there any particular reason behind it? Is it just simply retirements?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It's primarily retirements.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. And then with retirements, could we assume that with your new hires that there should be
an incremental unit labor cost to sort of benefit?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Not really. Rob, you want to comment on that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, John, given the labor agreements, no, there really isn`t a meaningful – we incur, when
we hire somebody, some training and hiring costs, but in terms of the ongoing wage, there's no real difference.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. I have a couple of quick questions on longer term capital deployment. Rob, I
believe you mentioned purchasing some leased equipment. Could you expand on this strategy? What portion of the
equipment is currently leased, and was this just optimistic or a shift in ownership strategy?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yes, it's an ongoing. I mean, where it makes economic sense for us to take advantage of
some of the markets and long-term deals. So I wouldn't read anything into that. There's no shift in strategy, it's just
where it's sort of opportunistic. We were able to take advantage of that in the second quarter.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Okay. Thank you. And CapEx longer term. CapEx to fulfill PTC mandate is still quite
high this year, rounding to $500 million, I think. Given the reality of the implementation schedule, how do you now see
the PTC spend fading over the next several years, and when PTC slips to maintenance resident build-out, do you expect
to step down in total CapEx?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, just to remind you, what we said In terms of our total capital spend for positive train
control is going to be in the neighborhood of $2 billion-ish total we're spending, to your point. Our plan is to spend
about $450 million this year, which is the high watermark thus far on our spend. The deadline -- we'll see what the date
actually ends up being, but if the deadline gets moved back, our expectation is the spend on the capital side will still be
in that $2 billion neighborhood. We don't want it to shift the deadline and result in higher spending. So we are very
focused on that.
To your point in terms of what might shift, we have said before, you perhaps have heard me say before that there will
be an ongoing expense in our OE and that shows up most notably in depreciation, which, in fact, we are starting to see
that in our numbers this year. So as we start to depreciate those new PTC assets, you will see an increase in our
depreciation expense related to that. And, again, we are seeing some of that this year.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: This is kind of a devilish question, but if you hadn't had to make the PTC spend, what do
you think you would have bought with that money, or would have CapEx just been lower?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I would just say, it's all return based. I don't have a clean answer to that, other than we didn't
back off on spending other worthwhile projects on our network where the returns were there and we were confident. So
it's not as if it was a simple trade-off there. We will always look at – as we look at capital spending, we will always
look at our business case and the expected returns that we will expect to generate out of those capital investments, and
that's all included in the guidance that we have given, in the 16% to 17% of revenue as we look forward. That's not how
we build our capital budget, but that's kind of a guiding light of how we expect to size up our capital spending as we
look forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you. Also a question on intermodal. Could you share with us your
insight into the main pockets of growth opportunity, maybe across service offerings or types of customers? Especially
with the west generally seen as a more mature market than the east, and your numbers obviously proving that wrong
this quarter.

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Cleo, we are seeing pretty good growth across the breadth of the intermodal market,
whether you're talking about motor carriers or brokers. I think the western part of the U.S., if you wanted to consider it
west of the Mississippi, probably has as much or more opportunity as the eastern part, because we have longer hauls,
which should make it easier to make the conversion from truck to rail. So I think we are seeing strength pretty much
across the breadth of our intermodal customers.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We are also hopeful, Cleo, that our investment in the Santa Teresa facility will draw truck
traffic that's moving today from Mexico into the U.S., to our intermodal facility in Santa Teresa, and then we can move
it east or west from that point. So we are pretty excited about that market opportunity as well.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. And the second question has to do with resource management. Your view on
management of resources to manage variability pricing demands, like we have experienced so far this year. Has this
experience of the winter and the shock volume led you to consider strategic changes in how you look at asset
ownership, or are you managing through it as a tactical way within the same strategic framework that you are happy
with?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think our performance through the first half of the year has been quite good, given what we
had to face, in terms of the weather conditions and the congestion it caused nationwide on the rail industry.
I think one of the things that you have seen, and I think one of the early questions about how did we get to the 63 (sic)
[63.5%] operating ratio here in the second quarter, is because over the years, we have really shifted our approach. We
have become much less reactionary and much more anticipatory. And so, as we see things starting to develop on the
horizon, we immediately start a planning phase that says we are going to mobilize materials. We are going to mobilize
people where they need to be. We are going to be doing some alternative scenario planning as the way to minimize
disruption to our network and to our customer service levels, and I think that shift to anticipating is really what's been
kind of the key behind some of our performance, certainly in the first half of the year.
And so, we learn something from every event. We learn something from everything that happens on our railroad, and
our goal is to take that and work it into our planning structure so we become even more effective and better, going
forward.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Any particular pockets of tightness across your segments that you would like to comment on for
next year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric, what do you think?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Cleo, we are seeing pretty good demand, and our first look at the 2015 forecast is pretty good
demand across our book of business. And so, I don't think there's any one place that would stick out beyond any other
places.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And Eric, if you look at it from a network perspective, Cleo, we are investing in the areas
where we anticipate we are going to be tight, and we have talked openly about investing in the southern region and also
in the north-south corridors.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you very much.

Our next question is from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much and good morning. I'm just going to ask one, because it's getting late
here. But, wanted to ask a question on interline connectivity, which was an issue in the quarter. And I think the first
half of this year has exposed the fragility of Chicago. So, I just wondered if you could give some color on how much of
your traffic touches Chicago and the extent of opportunities you think are out there to reasonably divert that to other
interchanges over time?

<A - John J. Koraleski>: So I'm going to start, Cherilyn, and say, I think, if you look at Chicago, I don't know that I
would necessarily describe it as fragility. I think Chicago got hammered with a snowstorm about every two weeks. And
frigid cold temperatures, so it never melted, it just kept building up and building up. I think that was a key problem
there. We have worked with all of our interline partners in terms of not only their fluidity but also our fluidity. We are
all in this together and so we have done a lot of redirecting out of Chicago into the St. Louis area, or down to Memphis,
in working with our interchange partners for the mutual benefit of both of our railroads as we worked through those
issues.
Lance, why don't you --
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So you had asked how much of our business. It's a fair portion, call it a quarter of our
business ultimately moves through into, out of Chicago. And when you think about our activity in Chicago, CREATE
has really done a very good job of improving the Chicago Gateway with interline partners. The gateway since the start
of CREATE has improved by about a third in terms of the amount of time it takes a car to traverse. And Jack
mentioned it as well, we have got ongoing investments in Chicago, one of which is going to be in connection with
Metro, where we add a third main line to our critical east-west route in and out of Chicago. So I'm very optimistic, both
in the level of activity and engagement with the interline partners, and in the progress that we have seen. This winter
was exceptional. It was an exceptional winter and it had exceptional impacts on the railroad. And even so, volumes still
continued to move through the Gateway.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay. Thanks for the detail. That's all for me.

Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Hey, good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Hey, Eric, I just wanted to double check, but did I hear that you guys are planning to add 5,000
EMP and UMAX containers this year? I'm just curious. It seems like a pretty big add, or was that somewhat
replacement?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so, part of it is replacement, as we discussed our business is growing and actually, as we
look into the future, and we don't talk about this in specificity, but there's a bunch of containers that are aging out and
so we are trying to do some level set planning and management strategically, but you could think of it as part
replacement, part growth, part future level set planning.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: Okay. That's perfect. And then, just kind of following up on that, but on the rail controlled side,
have you guys implemented any kind of, call it, general rate increases or maybe any tariff increases on that rail-owned
pool of containers?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So, the pricing that we're putting in our intermodal business, we are increasing our prices in our
intermodal business on -- whether they are rail owned containers or private owned containers, the pricing – because the
demand is going up, the pricing is going up.
<Q - Tyler Brown>: All right, perfect. Thank you.

<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. I will be quick. It's been long. You mentioned earlier when
you expect the network to be "normal" in the back half of the year? Did you provide a timeframe?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: No, Lance do you want to comment?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, we did not provide a timeframe. But, what we did say is we are positioned to improve.
And we expect to improve.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And we are seeing improvement right now.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: And we are seeing improvement as we speak.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay. Assuming that we do normalize before the upcoming winter, how should we think
about network utilization, given the volume level that we have seen, given some of the locomotive investments and the
container investments and other car type investments that have you made. Can you provide some sort of figure as to
what effective network utilization will be in kind of a steady state or a normal network fluidity environment?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It's pretty difficult to do that, Benjamin, if you think about it, because it depends on where
the business comes, what kind of business it is and all that. What we can tell you is at this point in time, as we look
ahead, even at the volume levels we have, we are still open for business, we still have capacity, and we are looking
forward to additional growth.
