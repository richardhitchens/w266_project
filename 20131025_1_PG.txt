MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call.
Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K,
10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ
materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of
acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less
capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure
described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website,
www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.
Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.

Jon R. Moeller
Thanks and good morning.
Before we get to results, I want to start with a few housekeeping items. Consistent with our emphasis on productivity as
well as our focus on annual versus quarterly planning periods, A.G. Lafley and I have decided to apportion our efforts
on P&G investor communications as follows. A.G. will lead our fiscal year-end call, providing perspective on the year
we just completed and outlining our priorities for the new fiscal year. A.G. will represent P&G at our most significant
investor events each year. This year, those will be the Barclays Back-to-School Conference and CAGNY. And he will
lead the annual shareholders' meeting each October. I'll head up the non-year-end quarterly calls and the remaining
investor conferences.
We will both continue to meet on a one-on-one basis with current and with potential investors. We'll continue to
involve other key executives in investor meetings and conferences, as we have in the past. Our objective is to provide
shareholders the information they want and need in a more productive manner that is consistent with our business
planning approach.
One last announcement, John Chevalier, who heads up our Investor Relations practice, will now report directly to me.
John was previously reporting to our Treasurer, Teri List, who is now at Kraft Foods. John joins me on the call this
morning.
Let me move now to our first quarter results. All-in sales grew 2%, including a two point headwind from foreign
exchange.
Organic sales grew 4%, putting us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Organic sales
growth was driven by strong organic volume growth of 4%. Pricing and mix were both neutral to sales growth for the
period. Organic sales were in line or ahead of year ago in all reporting segments. Organic sales were up low single
digits and developed markets and high single digits in developing markets.
P&G global value market share was around 20% for the most recent three-month period. We held or grew global
market share in businesses representing about two-thirds of global sales.
Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $1.04. This includes $0.02 of non-core restructuring costs.
Core earnings per share were $1.05, down $0.01 versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $0.09 per share
headwind. On a currency neutral basis, core earnings per share was up 8% for the quarter.
Core operating profit margin declined 70 basis points, as solid organic sales growth and 200 basis points of cost savings
were offset by foreign exchange and gross margin mix impacts. Core gross margin was down 130 basis points. Strong
cost savings of 160 basis points and volume leverage were more than offset by geographic and category mix of 140
basis points, foreign exchange of 80 basis points, higher commodity costs, and higher manufacturing startup costs
versus the prior year.
Core SG&A costs decreased 60 basis points, driven by overhead cost savings of 40 basis points, marketing and
spending efficiencies, and volume leverage. These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange, general wage
inflation, and reinvestments in innovation and go-to-market capability.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The combined impact from tax, interest expense, interest income,
non-operating income, and outstanding share count was essentially neutral to core earnings per share growth.
We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2.5 billion in stock, and returned $1.7 billion of
cash to shareholders as dividends. Free cash flow was reduced by a discretionary cash contribution of nearly $1 billion
to our German defined benefit pension fund. This is reflected in the change in other operating assets and liabilities line
on the cash flow statement.
Free cash flow productivity was 43% for the quarter, including a negative 32 point impact from the pension
contribution. This contribution was included in our projection of about 90% free cash flow productivity for the fiscal

year. Overall, we remain on track with each of our fiscal year objectives.
We're focused on four important areas to drive continued improvement in our results. Value creation for consumers and
shareowners is our top priority. Operating TSR [Total Shareholder Return] is our primary business performance
measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level, requiring sales growth,
progress on gross and operating margin, and strong cash flow productivity. Operating TSR drives focus on core
businesses, our leading most profitable categories, and leading most profitable markets. Our strongest business unit and
total company positions are in the U.S. We need to continue to ensure that our home market stays strong and is
growing.
We'll continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries
with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. Developing markets will continue to be a
significant growth driver for our company.
We'll continue to focus the company's portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create the most value.
We will continue to exit businesses where we've determined that potential buyers with different capability sets can
create more value than ourselves.
Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we're continuing to push forward with our productivity and cost savings
efforts. We made good progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong plans for fiscal 2014 and are
working to accelerate fiscal 2015 plans into 2014.
Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we're planning more than $1.4 billion of cost of goods savings this fiscal year
across materials, logistics, and manufacturing expense. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least
6% this year. We're up more than 8% fiscal year to date.
We're continuing the work on North American and European supply chain redesign to lower costs, reduce inventory,
and improve customer service. This work will require additional investment in both restructuring and capital, but
should generate very attractive returns. We'll communicate more details as plans are finalized.
We will deliver our 2014 enrollment reduction goals and then work to accelerate role reductions planned for fiscal 2015
into 2014. There are several teams supported by external advisors and benchmarks working in parallel on plans to
deliver these reductions. The teams span business sectors, market development organizations, and corporate functions.
We'll be working to consolidate individual team plans into one overall company plan by the end of the calendar year
and plan to discuss key elements with you at the CAGNY conference in February.
We continue to drive marketing ROI improvements through an optimized mix of advertising media, greater clarity of
messaging, and greater efficiency in non-advertising marketing spending. We expect absolute marketing spending to
increase this year, but marketing as a percentage of sales to decline modestly versus the prior-year level. We are
committed to make productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage.
We'll continue to strengthen our innovation efforts. We aim to be the innovation leader in every product category where
our brands compete. Near term, we are shipping major innovation upgrades across the entire Baby Care line in North
America, providing superior dryness, comfort, and fit, particularly overnight, to better deliver what moms want for
their babies.
The Ariel PODS launch in Western Europe is tracking well above expectations. Consumption trends on Tide PODS
have accelerated even further in the U.S. behind new trial building merchandising.
We're continuing to see strong growth in our new Oral Care expansion markets and are experiencing significant growth
behind the expansion of our 3D White innovation.
We're delivering strong market share gains in the U.S. deodorant category behind the Secret Stress Sweat innovation
and on Old Spice as we launch new scent collections in commercial campaigns.

We're also strengthening our share position in the U.S. battery business behind the Quantum innovation and recent
distribution increases. P&G battery value share is up nearly 1.5 points for the past three months.
In Family Care, our recent Bounty upgrades were recognized in external product testing. Bounty had the top three
products in the test, including a landslide victory for Bounty DuraTowel over all other products.
Recent product packaging and commercial innovations on Pantene are driving strong growth in the Latin America and
Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions. Pantene shipments were up double digits in both regions
for the quarter.
Next, we're improving execution and operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently, and
more reliably. It's not about exhorting the organization to do better. It is about rigorously following tried-and-true work
processes that deliver results. It's only airing high-ROI advertising. It's disciplined initiative launch qualification and
planning. It's about staying ahead of changing regulatory standards to ensure we maintain full supply capability. It's
about everyone playing their position and playing it well.
Our progress in operating discipline and execution is beginning to be recognized. In the most recent Advantage
Monitor U.S. customer survey, which rates retailer satisfaction with their suppliers, P&G improved its overall ranking
from the middle third of the 40 suppliers evaluated to the top third, with significant improvements in areas such as
category development and shopper insights. Our goal is to be number one, and our focus is on translating this improved
operating performance into better and more consistent top and bottom line results.
Last, we're making strategic investments in innovation and go-to-market capabilities. The budget increase in R&D will
enable us to strengthen our near and midterm innovation pipeline. Our go-to-market investments are primarily focused
on improving sales coverage in our fastest growing markets and fastest-growing channels. We believe that the focus
we're bringing to these four areas, operating TSR, productivity, innovation, and operational excellence, will enable us
to continue to improve results, which brings us to guidance.
We're reconfirming 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line, and cash. We're maintaining our organic sales growth range
of 3% to 4%. Achieving organic sales growth in the upper half of our target range would result in modest overall
market share growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of about two points, which leads to
all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year.
On the bottom line, we're maintaining our forecast for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. This translates to
constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 11% to 13%. On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect
earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower non-core restructuring costs
in fiscal year 2014 versus the prior year.
First half core earnings per share growth will likely be flat to slightly down versus prior year. Second half growth will
be much stronger.
Our second half forecast is not based on a significant acceleration in organic sales growth. The second half earnings
growth increase is driven by foreign exchange and cost structure. Foreign exchange will be a significant headwind in
the first half, but will moderate in the second half to recent spot rates. We estimate that about 70% of the fiscal year FX
impact will be in the first half of the fiscal year. We'll also annualize the operating impacts from last year's Venezuelan
bolivar devaluation in the second half.
There are several second half cost benefits. Manufacturing startup costs will largely annualize in the second half of
fiscal 2014, and productivity savings will build throughout the year.
As you prepare your sales and earnings estimates for Q2, there are a few items you should keep in mind. Recall that the
second quarter base period includes a $0.07 per share one-time gain from the sale of the Western European Bleach
business. We expect the foreign exchange headwind for Q2 to be similar to the impact we saw in the first quarter.
We're expecting a heightened level of competitive promotional spending ahead of our product initiatives launching
early next calendar year, especially in North American Fabric Care and Beauty.

We expect to deliver another strong year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending
in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, continuing to deliver on
our commitment of cash return to shareholders.
In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we continue to be transparent about some key items that are
not included. Foreign exchange continues to be very volatile. Rates improved somewhat in September and October,
largely reversing the large negative move we saw in late July and August, but this can quickly change. The guidance
we are reconfirming today is based on mid-October spot rates.
We're closely watching the unrest in Egypt, which is a large business for us and a base of export for the balance of
Africa. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products, and devaluation present risks, as do import
restrictions and price controls in Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth
rates.
We continue to operate in a volatile environment with uncertainty in foreign exchange, decelerated market growth
rates, and a rapidly developing policy environment. Against this backdrop, we have good market share momentum, a
number of strong innovations coming to market over the balance of the year, and savings from productivity
improvements that will continue to build. Our first quarter results were in line with what we expected, putting us on
track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year, enabling us to make progress toward our long-term growth objectives.
We're making targeted investments in our core business, the most promising developing markets and biggest
innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving productivity and cost savings. Above all, we remain focused on
value creation for consumers and for our shareowners.
That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and
will be available on slides which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. I'd be happy now to
take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Good morning.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hey, two quick ones. China, it seems like business is doing well market share-wise
everywhere in the world except for China. But if you look across categories, at least in the Nielsen data we have,
laundry, diapers, toothpaste, it seems like shares are under quite a bit of pressure recently. So I'm wondering what's
going on there and what the plan is to fix that.
And the second thing is, and maybe I'm making a huge deal about this, but this iMflux technology on the packaging
side, could that be a game-changer going forward in terms of how you make and buy bottles and give you a pretty neat
competitive cost structure advantage?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Way to get two questions in. First of all, China, volume market share was essentially flat in the
quarter. We did lose a little bit of ground on value share, though that continued to build sequentially and has continued
to build over the past twelve, six, three months, so we're reasonably comfortable about our position there. We've got a
very strong innovation program coming in the back half of the year and expect China to continue to be a significant
source of growth for us.
On iMflux, this is something we actually talked about at CAGNY. It's a disruptive proprietary breakthrough in the
packaging area. And when rolled out across our businesses, it should deliver about $150 million in cost savings per

year and will allow us to avoid about $50 million in capital expenditures annually. It will also bring significant
sustainability benefits. It could reduce resin usage by over 100 million pounds per year and eliminate energy usage by
over 250 million kilowatt hours. And finally, we're hopeful this breakthrough will allow us to reduce our time to market
for package development up to 50%. So it is something that we're excited about and should benefit from.
Operator
Your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Hi, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the negative FX leverage you're seeing here
in terms of from the top line to the bottom line, and particularly how your manufacturing footprint is impacting that,
whether that's a big transactional hit as you're importing products into countries like Brazil. And then to tie that in, I'll
try to make this two questions that's actually one question. Can you talk a little bit about the plan for local
manufacturing? You've got a lot of startup costs there. When can that go to being a real benefit as you look at not just
your manufacturing costs, but also the ability to be more flexible when you're manufacturing locally? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So you're absolutely right, John, on the dynamic on foreign exchange and the divergence
between the top and bottom line impact. That disparity is primarily driven by very large currency moves in countries
that have a significant dollar and euro denominated cost structure for imported materials and finished product. Just for
perspective, Japan and Venezuela, which both fall into that category, account for more than 40% of the FX-related
profit hurt on the quarter. And you're also right that as we're able to localize more of the manufacturing, not only will
we save a significant amount of money, but we will reduce – we'll in essence be operationally hedged more on the
bottom line.
Timeline, we're bringing on a number of new facilities currently, as is reflected in the startup cost figures that we've
been discussing for the past couple quarters. I would look at that to yield benefits more in our next fiscal year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, Jon.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Hi, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: First just a detailed question. Can you tell us how much U.S. organic sales growth was in
the quarter and emerging markets? And then the real question is I just was hoping you could characterize the pricing
environment you're seeing right now both in the U.S. and around the world. Clearly, you've made significant market
share progress, but you did highlight you expected heightened competitive activity going forward. So should we expect
pricing to deteriorate a bit going forward in the balance of the year? And do you view heightened competitive activity
as a big threat at this point to your market share progress?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Okay. So first on U.S. growth rate, organic sales was about 2%. And that's also consistent with
the total developed market growth rates, which were low singles. Developed markets grew about 8%.
On pricing, let me say a couple things, first relative to history, including the last quarter. If you look at price inclusive
of promotion, it was neutral to organic sales growth on the quarter. If you look further back, price inclusive of
promotion has been neutral to positive for 11 consecutive quarters. It's been neutral to positive for nine consecutive
years. We would much rather invest a dollar in innovation or equity because those benefits are proprietary and
sustainable. Promotion, price discounting, there's nothing proprietary about it, and it's typically not sustainable. If you
look at our promotion, the percentage of sales that moved on promotion in the July – September quarter, it was down
versus year ago, not up. So that's the past.

As we look forward, it's important that while we'd rather spend money on innovation and equity, it's important we be
competitive from a promotional standpoint. We are not going to be ones that are going to lead promotion escalation,
but we will be competitive. We do have a period coming up in the next quarter here that precedes pretty significant
initiative launches for us. And it's not atypical in that environment that we see a little bit of an increase in promotion
from the competitive set trying to load consumers ahead of our initiatives. So we do expect that environment to tighten
over the next three months as we head into our big initiative launch. Again, that's not something that we'll be leading.
We'll continue to focus on innovation and equity.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citigroup.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. The gross margin, I know you don't want to give too much specifics in terms of the
full-year outlook, but I assume some of the manufacturing startup costs are going to fall away. So can you, hopefully
anyway, can you comment over the full course of this year whether you expect gross margin to be up or down? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: It certainly will sequentially improve and should be positive certainly by the fourth quarter –
late third, early fourth quarter. We'll have to see where it nets out total year. I honestly don't think that much about that.
But we do expect for gross margin progress to turn positive by the end of the year.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask a bit about Beauty margins. They were up so
significantly in the quarter, and I was curious what was driving that, if it was a change in your allocation of resources or
holding back as you sort out plans for Skin Care, so questions around that. And then coupled with that was in your
prepared remarks, Jon, when you mentioned the heightened promotional environment expected in the second quarter
ahead of initiative launches, you actually mentioned not just Fabric Care, but also I think you said Beauty. And that
was new to me if there's something significant coming in Beauty. So if you could talk about that, it would be great.
Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Lauren. A large part of the quarter-to-quarter variability in profitability in Beauty is
being driven by initiative timing. And we have, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and as you referenced, we have
a strong slate of initiatives coming to market December through March in Beauty. The specifics are not items that
we've disclosed yet, and we'll do that as we get closer to the events themselves. But there is significant innovation
coming.
The other thing that's impacting quarterly variability, which is a great thing, is real progress on productivity within the
Beauty business. They're working that as hard as anybody and are frankly doing a great job.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. I wanted to ask about Tide Simply. So relative to Charmin and Bounty
Basic, it looks like the price gap there between the premium and the mid-tier segments in those respective categories is
much wider than – or not as wide as in laundry. So laundry, premium Tide versus the baseline is a very, very large gap.
So the gap between Tide Simply and premium Tide is likely to be wider than what it is between Bounty and Charmin
Basics and those mainline products. So I guess the question is can you use those two as a benchmark, and how do you
manage that? Is the thought process even correct there?

<A - Jon R. Moeller>: It ultimately comes down, Chris, to strong consumer segmentation and benefit alignment
against those segments and the benefits that they are seeking. It's more about that than it is about relative price point.
And as you can imagine, we've been working this for some period of time, as you know. And we've been working very
hard to ensure that the offering is very attractive to the consumer segment that we are targeting and is less attractive to
the current Tide consumer, which we believe we have achieved. And that is more the mark of success on things like
Bounty Basic, Charmin Basic, Luvs versus Pampers. It's that consumer segmentation and benefit alignment with their
needs that drives success.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys, so two things. One is I want to first follow up on the language in the press release and
your prepared remarks about the $0.07 I guess now one-time gain you asked us to include in your call last year,
although it felt like it was smaller than $0.07 last year. I'm just a little confused. Are you now asking us to restate that
and take out the $0.07, or what do you want us to do with that?
And then the other question I had is about the 200 basis points that you're saving this quarter. Obviously, that's good. Is
that enough relative to what your competitors are doing? It certainly sounds like you're going to be ramping up that
savings number. How much higher do you think it ramps to and for how long? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: First, relative to the $0.07 gain, what we're asking you to do is just simply be aware of it. We're
just providing that as an awareness point. What you do with that is obviously your call. But we like people not to be
surprised, and that's simply why were calling that out. It will be in our core numbers in the base and will be reported as
part of our core comparison, so we're not restating anything here.
On savings, look, there's no amount of savings that's enough. There is an amount of savings that's too much when it
starts cutting into capabilities for growth and those kinds of things. But look, we're going for everything we think is
feasible and then asking ourselves is there more after that. I'm not going to speculate on the ultimate amount of savings.
But I think as you've seen both last year and this year, generally we're exceeding as opposed to under-delivering our
savings targets. Last year we had $1.2 billion in cost of goods savings. That's about what we need to deliver the $10
billion objective this year. So far we're at $1.4 billion. Last year we significantly over-delivered the SG&A enrollment,
and this year we're committed to deliver our 2014 target and work to accelerate 2015 into 2014. We really want to
make this, as many of us have described before, an ongoing part of our business model, our culture, our ethos, and I
think there's a lot of possibility to the extent that we're able to accomplish that.

Your next question will come from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. I remember when A.G. first came back, he was talking about the cost
structure in some parts of the developed world still being too high. I'm wondering where you stand on what sounded
like it would be another more traditional type of bricks-and-mortar restructuring program that would run concurrently
with the productivity initiative underway.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Connie. That's what I was referring to in our prepared remarks relative to supply chain
redesign in both North America and Western Europe, which is underway. It's in process, and we'll talk about it more as
we finalize our plans. But that is a significant opportunity to both reduce cost, improve cash through reduced inventory,
and importantly, improve customer service. And we're pretty excited about that opportunity. Basically, our supply
chains in both of those markets have come about over years and through a number of acquisitions. And this is an
opportunity to step back and say if we were doing this over, how would we do this? What are the right levels of
aggregation in terms of number of categories that are produced at a site? What are the right locations? How do you

Your next question will come from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back to Beauty. You
talked a little bit about the innovation slate coming up and some of the margins expansion. I wanted to drill down on
the organic sales growth. You were showing signs of acceleration to year end. We've seen deceleration despite the easy
comp. And it also stands in contrast to what looks to be, in terms of U.S. consumption off-take, accelerating trends. Can
you help us understand what drove that deceleration, whether there's anything transitory behind it, and maybe what's
working and what isn't within that segment?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: First of all, this is a very competitive category. It's a category where I will readily admit we
continue to have more work to do, so we're not yet where we want to be on this business. There are pieces of it that are
working very well. Our Personal Cleansing business was up high single digits in the quarter. Our Cosmetics business is
doing extremely well. Our Deodorants business is doing extremely well. I mentioned Pantene; in several parts of the
world it's doing well. We continue to need to make progress on North American Pantene, on Olay, and we need to
make progress in our Salon Professional businesses. So those are the strengths and the weaknesses, as it were, and
we're fully focused on maximizing the opportunity behind the strengths and addressing the opportunities.

Your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks a bunch. I wanted to talk a little bit about the share improvement. Obviously, it continues.
Where do you think that that can top out at?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: As I've said several times on this call, we are in very competitive markets. Our expectation is
that when we get everything working, we should be able to build a little bit of share each year. We're never going to be
in a position where 100% of our business is building share at any given point in time. That's just not a realistic scenario
in the very competitive industries that we compete. And we've talked about targeting two-thirds to 70% of the business
growing share, holding or growing share at any point in time, and that's the level that leads to modest share growth on
an annual basis. And so that's what we're targeting.

Your next question will come from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, Jon and John, A question again on the gross profit or gross margin side. To
what extent a lot of what is happening has to do with the mix, the category mix in which basically Fabric and Baby
Care are the two GBUs that are leading the growth? And in that context, knowing that Beauty and Grooming are a
challenge, can you help us understand Health Care, why the deceleration beyond the recall of the pet food product?
Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: You're absolutely right, Javier, in terms of the drivers of part of the gross margin pressure.
There's about 140 basis points of mix impact within that gross margin comparison. About half of that, approaching half
of that is the product mix, exactly what you referenced, which is faster growth in lower gross margin businesses like
Fabric Care and our Paper businesses, and slower growth in some of our higher gross margin businesses.

In terms of Health Care, the real impact on the quarter was the recall on Pet. The good news there is we're back up
manufacturing full speed a perfectly great product, and so that should be in the past.

Your next question will come from the line of Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer.
<Q - Joseph Altobello>: Thanks, good morning, guys. In terms of the portfolio, I think one of the things that A.G. has
tried to hammer home the last three or four months has been that Procter could be more focused, and I think the word
he has used a number of times is choiceful. And so on that point, can you give us an example or examples of businesses
where you believe you're under-investing right now and where you're over-investing? And also, could you see yourself
doing something like Unilever has done the past or like Kimberly-Clark has done more recently, where you actually
pull out of certain geographies or categories in whole?
And then also in terms of a housekeeping item, you mentioned that you held or gained share in two-thirds of your
businesses. I think that was a global number. What was that number in the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Joe. The two word choices which you provided are accurate, focused and choiceful,
and that's what we're all working to do here. Obviously, you can appreciate from a competitive standpoint why I
wouldn't want to lay over many cards right here in terms of where we'll accelerate investment or decelerate investment.
But it is very much, as I said in our prepared remarks, a focus of ours which is flowing investment to the areas, both
businesses and geographies, where we believe we can create disproportionate value, and looking real hard at businesses
where we're struggling to create value and looking to see if somebody else could potentially create more value than us.
We have pulled out of regions in the past. We used to be in Asia in the tissue/towel business. We used to be in Western
Europe in the tissue/towel business, and we're now largely a North American tissue/towel business. And that was all
driven by our assessment of our ability to create value in that industry, which we viewed as low potential. So these are
things, both categories and geographies, that we'll continue to look at. And as we always have done, whether it's
pharmaceuticals or Folgers or snacks or the Western European tissue/towel business, where we determine that we can
create more value on any business in a domestic context, and there are two pieces of that. One is what our prognosis is
going forward. The other is obviously we're not going to exit businesses in a value-dilutive manner, so we need to have
somebody who is willing to monetize some of that value they can create for our shareholders.

Your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning, thank you. Hey, Jon, you had talked this morning on CNBC about Europe
and moving sideways. And I was just wondering, maybe you could give us a little more color there because, as you
alluded to, a lot of other companies are seeing pockets of growth in certain areas. And I didn't know if it's really just
straight sideways or if there's any sign of hope, or maybe just any color you have would be great.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: There are definitely areas that are stronger within Europe. I'm not telling you anything you
don't know. Northern Europe is certainly stronger than Southern Europe. Southern Europe continues to be a real
struggle. And there are markets that are pockets of hope, if you will.
I want to step back on the whole Western European thing for a second. Changes in Western Europe in the consumer
products category space have never been dramatic, and they continue to not be overly dramatic. Growth tends to
oscillate between minus 1% and plus 1%. It's a good year when it's plus 1% and it's a bad year when it's minus 1%.
We're not seeing significant departures from that aggregate picture. And so it continues to be an environment where we
think we can build sales. We believe we can build profit and create value. It's an area that we're focused on, but we just
don't see a rebound to date.

Your next question will come from the line of Jon Anderson from William Blair.
<Q - Jon R. Andersen>: Good morning. I'm interested in asking about new channels, specifically the online channel.
How important is the online channel to you today? What role does it play going forward? And are there distinct
advantages to Procter from selling online? And I'm thinking of things like increased consumption, reaching more
consumers, or perhaps it's more profitable to sell through that channel.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: We want our products to be available wherever, whenever, and however consumers want to
shop. And there is certainly a segment of consumers in some categories that want to shop online, and we'll work to be
available for them. The amount of our business that's currently in that channel varies by category. Still, as you would
expect, the vast majority of our products are sold in traditional channels. And I think the channel offers several
advantages and several disadvantages, just as our other channels do. It's a very effective way to target consumers both
from a marketing standpoint and then conversion to purchase. So we'll continue to look at it from that standpoint, but
we really want to be present and viewed as best in class in each of the retail channels.

Your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Thanks and good morning, everybody. Do you think the competitive environment is
getting better or worse relative to your expectations? And I say this in context of some of what I thought relatively
provocative comments by your large competitor yesterday that it plans to rebase costs to fund investments. And related
to that, how do you think about the spending between promotional allowances and real advertising spend? I know you
had mentioned that as a percentage of sales it would be up, but up less so absolutely as a percent.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: That's true of our aggregate marketing expense. Promotion expense in the July – September
quarter in terms of – sorry, the percentage of our sales that moved on promotion was actually down 7% versus year
ago. If you look at the total industry, it was about flat versus year ago. So there are certain categories, certain items,
certain competitors where there may be an escalation in promotion, but it's not a broad characteristic of the
environment, at least as we've seen it to date.

Your next question will come from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Hi, good morning, a housekeeping question and then something else. Can you update us as to
your category growth rates in emerging regions and the U.S.? And then could you break out the 2% organic sales
growth that you had in the U.S. in terms of volume, mix, and price?
And my other question is the 140 basis point negative hit to gross margins from mix, are you expecting that to lessen as
you go through the year and it maybe be cut by half? Is that a significant part of the gross margin improvement you're
expecting? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Alice. In terms of market growth rates, broad strokes we see 1% growth in developed
markets, about 7% in developing markets in aggregate. Developing markets range from mid-single digits to low double
digits depending on the region. And developed markets range anywhere from 2% market value growth in North
America to about a 1% decline, consistent with what I was saying earlier, in Western Europe.
Relative to the 140 basis points mix impact and how that evolves going forward, as I mentioned in my response to
Javier, about half of that is geographic and about half is product. And I would hope that over time as we get our Beauty
business growing at market growth rates, the product portion of that would largely dissipate. I do expect we'll continue

to have disproportionate growth in developing markets, and we're not yet to the point in terms of economic
development where those margins will be equal to the balance of the rest of the world, so we will continue to see some
drag on mix from a geographic standpoint.

Your next question is from the line of Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on the volume decline in
the Grooming segment. Is that largely due to category weakness, or is it some share losses? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: The category in the last three months was about flat. I think it was a 99 index. We did lose a
little bit of share in the last quarter. That was primarily driven by disproportionate growth in the disposables section of
the business, where we are at less well developed. The encouraging piece of it, though, is that Fusion continued to grow
share, and that's a good thing long term. And if you look over longer periods of time, last year for example, we built
share in Blades and Razors, and I would expect that would be more characteristic of the situation going forward.

Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Good morning, Jon. If you could just go back to the North America share question, I don't
think we got an answer, just if you could give directionally where things were strongest and weakest, and specifically
in cleaning materials. So Tide PODS, if you could just break out what happened on the PODS side versus the liquid
laundry side?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Caroline, for giving me a chance to recover there. Multipart questions and my feeble
memory sometimes get the best of me. In North America, we're holding or growing share in businesses representing
between two-thirds to 70% of sales, so that continues to hold up very nicely. I actually don't have segment level in
terms of PODS versus liquids versus powder shares in front of me here. But please feel free to call John or Katie or
Brian during the balance of the day, and they can get you that information.

We have no further questions at this time.
Jon R. Moeller
Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As I had mentioned earlier, we're reasonably happy with our first
quarter results in terms of its relation to our expectation. We know we still have more work to do. We're determined to
do that, and we look forward to connecting with each of you soon. Thanks a lot.
