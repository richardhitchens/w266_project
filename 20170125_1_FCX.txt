MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive President and Chief Financial Officer.
Please go ahead, ma'am.
Kathleen L. Quirk
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference
call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and presentation materials for today's
call are available on our website at fcx.com.
Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our
website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press
has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.
Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on
this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the

Richard, who will go through the slide materials located on our website. As usual, after our after our prepared remarks,
we'll open up the call for Q&A.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $292 million, $0.21 per share for the fourth quarter
of 2016. As detailed in the press release, the fourth quarter net income included net charges of $59 million or $0.04 per
share, reflecting estimated losses on assets held for sale and oil and gas restructuring-related charges, partly offset by
gain on the redeemable non-controlling interest in Plains Offshore.
After adjusting for net charges, fourth quarter adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $351 million or
$0.25 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the fourth quarter
totaled $1.7 billion.
As you'll see in the press release, FCX took aggressive actions during 2016 to restore its balance sheet strength and we
had an active fourth quarter. We completed $5.2 billion in asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the
full year asset sale transactions to $6.6 billion.
Importantly, our net debt was reduced by $8.4 billion during the year and currently approximates $12 billion. Our sales
for the quarter totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper, 405,000 ounces of gold, and 22 million pounds of molybdenum.
And we sold 4.65 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.1 million ounces of gold and 74 million pounds of
molybdenum.
During the quarter, we completed the Tenke sale in November and our previous guidance had reflected Tenke volumes
for the full year. Excluding that variance, copper sales were approximately 7% below the October 2016 estimates,
reflecting lower mining and milling rates at PT Freeport Indonesia.
Our fourth quarter realized copper price was $2.47 per pound. That was 13% above the year-ago average of $2.18 per
pound. Gold prices averaged $1,174 per ounce, and we're about 10% above the year-ago quarter of $1,067 per ounce.
Our unit net cash costs for the quarter was $1.20 per pound, that was lower than the year-ago period of $1.45 per
pound. That reflects the higher by-product credits and also the improved volumes and efficiencies from the Cerro
Verde project and higher volumes at PT-FI.
We generated operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the quarter, which exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly
$500 million. For the year, our operating cash flow totaled $3.7 billion, which is in excess of our CapEx for the year of
$2.8 billion.
As previously reported, we completed the at-the-market offering of common stock during the fourth quarter and raised
a total of $1.5 billion in gross proceeds through the sale of 116 million shares of FCX common stock.
Our consolidated debt totaled $16 billion and cash balance at the end of the year was $4.2 billion. Net debt was below
$12 billion at year-end. We ended the year with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.
At the end of December, we had 1.44 billion common shares outstanding.
I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be talking about our outlook and updating you on current developments
and referring to the slide materials on our website.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone. As I start thinking about my presentation today, I recall a comment that Jack Welch made
several years ago and it was, don't be giving vows for act one when the audience is looking for act two. And I know
everyone here is focused on Indonesia, it's the focus of our senior management team as we go into 2017. But having
said that, I'm very proud of what our team did during this past year.
A year ago at this time, our share price was well below $4 a share. Our credit default swaps were at 2,700 basis points.
We were announcing a plan to reduce that and sell assets. There was a lot of uncertainty about our ability to do that and

the values that we would realize. We were completing the construction of our Cerro Verde project and ramping it up,
and it was a big project, $4.6 billion and big projects and our industry have been challenging in general. We were very
pleased that we successfully executed that construction project and ramped up Cerro Verde in a very effective way and
today, it's a long-term cash flow generating asset for our company and a core asset.
We've had a year of really strong cost and capital management; a 19% reduction in consolidated copper unit site
production and delivery cost year-to-year; 56% reduction in CapEx year-to-year, 17% below our year ago estimate for
CapEx as we manage our capital spending.
At this call last year, in response to a question, I indicated a goal of reducing our debt by $5 billion to $10 billion. I
didn't really set a timeframe on it at that time. But we have reduced our net debt from last year to the end of 2016 by
roughly $8 billion. We refocused our business under the direction of restructured board of directors to focus on our
mining business and on the copper industry and we were able to come out of this process of selling assets and raising
capital with a high-quality copper portfolio that situates our company for creating long-term value that's for our
shareholders.
Kathleen mentioned our asset sales, they're detailed on page 4. In the first quarter, soon after our year-end conference
call last year, we announced the sale of an incremental interest in Morenci to our long-time partner, Sumitomo, for $1
billion. And in the fourth quarter, it was the culmination of a lot of work that went on throughout the year with the
closing of the Tenke Fungurume transaction, the resolution of uncertainties of that transaction within the Democratic
Republic of Congo and our partner, Gécamines, there. We closed oil and gas transactions to sell the Deepwater assets
in the California production at prices well below what our company paid for them, but at prices that were very
reasonable in terms of the current marketplace.
It took a lot of work. Each one of these transactions was very complicated and, beyond that, there were a lot of
alternative transactions that we've put a lot of effort into to give us the set of alternatives before we settled on doing
these particular transactions.
Page 5 looks at the management of our cost and capital. You can see the 19% decline in our unit cost, ending the year
with a unit cost net of by-product credits of $1.26 for last year. Our free cash flows increased. Our capital expenditures
decreased, as expected, as a result of the completion of the Cerro Verde project but, moreover by, in effect, the exit
from the oil and gas business where we had spent roughly $3 billion of capital in 2015 and over $1 billion in 2016.
Copper market. In the fourth quarter, all of us have been pleasantly surprised by the recovery in copper prices. As you
know, copper lagged behind other commodities. During 2016, it was up roughly 17% for last year. But as we ended the
year, we improved – improved market sentiment supported by fundamentals in China, in the U.S. and the global
marketplace, and global economic conditions improved supply, growth continues to be constrained. And by year-end,
we were seeing more impact of supply disruptions which had been uncharacteristically low during the first half of
2016.
The price required to develop new supplies is $3 a pound are better. The incentive price that Wood Mack points to is
$3.30 in real terms. So, even at these prices the industry is still not undertaking new supply development projects and
when those projects are undertaken, it takes years to get them to the point of developing supplies, so we're in an
inevitable move of reduced supply. The question mark is demand – demand has been better and that points to a bright
future.
For copper, today we have relatively low inventories. Clearly, deficits in the marketplace are – in our future, the
question is when will the timing and extent of those deficits be and that depends on the global economy and,
particularly, that's in China. But we remain – throughout all this, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for
copper and have positioned our company to take advantage of it.
The world's leading copper producers are on page 7. You can see that we rank, in terms of net interest of production,
behind Codelco. This is excluding Tenke and adjusting our ownership interest in Morenci. If you look at the operations
that we managed, we have roughly equivalent to Codelco, taken into account minority interest in the operations that we
manage.

And our assets include seven copper mines in North America where we supply roughly 40% of the downstream copper
to the U.S. economy; two copper mines in South America with the Cerro Verde project in Peru; El Abra with our
partner CODELCO in Chile, which has a potential for a massive expansion in the future; and then, of course, the
Grasberg operations in Papua and Indonesia.
You can see in terms of reserves they're basically equally distributed among those regions. So, we've got good diversity
in terms of copper resources. Our molybdenum-only mines are in the U.S. We have by-products in the U.S. and in
South America as well. And then our gold sales are associated with the very large gold by-product in our ore at
Grasberg.
Cerro Verde commenced operations in September 2015 and achieved operating capacity in the first quarter of 2016, a
large-scale, long-lived reserves, net unit cost declined 19% year-on-year. This is a great project and it's operating very
well and we're very proud of our team for accomplishing this.
Our reserves are shown on page 10. I mentioned earlier, when you look at our proved and probable reserves, they're
equally distributed by region. And beyond that, we have substantial mineralized material that we've identified in
conjunction with our existing mines of substantial amounts, 100 billion pounds of contained copper. And then beyond
that, there's potential that we are qualifying now of very large amounts.
What this shows you is that our company is situated with reserves that provide for a very long-term future in the copper
business. We will have a steady stream of growth projects that will only be initiated when the market indicates a need
for it, and we can be very disciplined about where we spend capital, looking for attractive rate of return projects and
looking for projects with relatively low execution risk because they're brownfield expansions.
So, our company is well situated. We don't have to make – enter into the M&A market. But with our balance sheet
improving and with copper price outlook improving, we'll be positioned to participate in that marketplace either as
buyers or as sellers.
Now, we have our large development projects listed on page 11. They're in alphabetical order. This is not in order that
we might pursue them. But it includes six projects with major sulfide opportunities which would be each major
expansion opportunities for concentrator projects.
Interestingly, five of the six are in the United States. And as we look at the relative economics of investing in the
United States or outside the United States, in recent years, investments in the United States have become increasingly
attractive. The energy situation here with the abundance of energy and the cost of energy, because of the shale, oil and
gas developments in the United States has provided us low cost of energy. We have a workforce in the United States
that is much more flexible. We have a non-union workforce. We have communities that support our employees.
Whereas outside the United States, often we have to provide all the community support.
So, it's an interesting situation, what a change over the last 15 years when this industry was thought to be dead here and
now it's a place for great investment opportunities.
Also, El Abra is on this list and it has got a very large resource that we're doing advanced planning on with our
partners, looking at potential consolidation of interest in the area, and it would be a very large project but potentially an
attractive one. And I believe it will be one that ultimately the industry will need to meet the world's needs of copper.
So, we've had a great act one.
Now turning back to – at Grasberg, from an operations standpoint, we have had continuing issues with – I'm going to
say an element of our workforce, and that is the workers in the Grasberg pit itself. The Grasberg pit has a known
depletion point. It has been moved out till now where it will be – we expect it to be completed in 2018. Upon
completion, we will continue mining the Grasberg ore body as a very large block-cave. It's located – the ore body
extends below the limits of the pit.

We are currently operating underground in a significant way in our DOZ mine and in our Deep MLZ mine. We have
been operating large-scale block-cave operations since the early 1980s at the Papuan operations of PT Freeport
Indonesia. And we're very comfortable about technically being able to do that.
But as we've approached the completion of the pit, workers have been raising complaints, grievances, and have simply
not been meeting productivity standards. We're taking steps to respond to that. The effect of this is not a loss of
resource. This resource will be realized through mining activities. But what's happening is we're having lower
production now, which is extending the life of the pit. And we're working with the union, with the workers, with our
management team to take steps to rectify this and in our outlook, we give you the best estimate that we have going
forward.
Now I want to spend some time going over matters that many of you are familiar with, some of you may not be, but I
think it's appropriate to do it now because the Indonesian government has just issued new regulations for mining
operators broadly, and it has implications for us, but it's for the industry as a whole. So I want to take a few minutes and
set the stage for putting this in perspective with what our situation is given our current contract with the Indonesian
government.
Freeport signed its first contract in 1967. And then after the discovery of the Grasberg, signed a new Contract of Work
in 1991 and this contract provided legal and fiscal certainty through 2041. And it was on the basis of this contract that
Freeport has made multi-billion dollars of investment and we began that on signing of the contract.
In the mid-1990s, we formed a strategic partnership with Rio Tinto to advance the development of the new Grasberg
resource. We had a major mill expansion. We undertook underground mine development and expanded the mine
capabilities for output significantly and Rio Tinto remains our partner and we have a great relationship with them.
In connection with that original contract, we had a commitment to build a smelter in Indonesia, provided that was
economic, and we fulfilled that commitment. We aggressively went out to find a partner. We found a partner in
Mitsubishi which had new smelter technology at the time. And we've constructed a smelter in Eastern Java at Gresik,
and we have an equity interest in it. The majority owners are Japanese and Mitsubishi has operated – it's operated very
effectively and safely over almost 20 years of operations. Then one of the world's best smelters has not made any
money because of the economics of the smelter industry.
In 2009, the government of Indonesia passed a new mining law and implemented new regulations over – the law was
passed in 2009 and it took time to put regulations in place and really the governing regulations were not completed
until 2012. The law provides specifically that existing COWs remain in effect until they expire. It also instructed the
government to seek amendments to the COW to make contracts of work more consistent with the new mining law
within one year.
We actually began discussions with the designated senior representatives of government in 2011. And in 2012 the
government established an evaluation team early that year to review COWs. We've been in discussions with the
government since 2011, 2012, but have never been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on reconciling the
Contract of Work with the new mining law. The law says that the contract remains in effect.
In early 2014, concentrate exports were halted for more than six months following a troubling January regulation on
exports. We didn't export for more than six months. It cost the government roughly $1 billion in lost taxes and
royalties. It cost us slightly less than that, but a very substantial amount. And in that year, we resolved the ban on
exports by entering into an MOU with the government in July that covered six main points – exports, smelter
development, divestiture – all of this was subject to negotiation of legal and fiscal certainty and an extension of our
operations from 2021 to 2041.
It was contemplated that that MOU would be the result in amendments to the COW in six months. The government
changed in late 2014. The MOU was extended in 2015 and we continue discussions with the government. That led to
the government providing our company a letter of assurance regarding extension of the COW, regarding legal and
fiscal certainty beyond 2021. And it was that assurance in that letter and in the MOU and in the COW the government
has and Freeport have honored this COW since the first one was signed in the 1960s and the new one signed in 1991

that has given us the confidence to make the ongoing level of investments that we've been making and developing our
underground resources.
Now, just in January of this year, the government has introduced new regulations. And these new regulations require
COW holders to convert to licenses called IUPK in order to export. And with a license, in and of itself, there is no
assurance of legal and fiscal certainty and we have been unwilling to give up our COW to go to strictly a license.
And so, what I want to do now is – and this is in our slides and so you can review this and follow up with questions.
But I want to point out what our Contract of Work actually says. It says that we shall have an initial term of 30 years
from 1991 going to 2021. And that we shall be entitled to apply for two successive ten year extensions of this term,
subject to government approval. And that government approval can not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. So, we
have the rights to extend the COW on this existing terms for another 20 years beyond 2021. We've made application for
this extension, and have not yet received approval.
With regard to export. There is a specific provision in our contract that says without in any way limiting the company's
basic right to export, that will be subject to reporting, administrative reporting and non-monetary provisions.
With respect to taxes, the COW says specifically, that we shall not be subject to any other taxes, duties, levies,
contributions, et cetera, except for those expressly provided in this COW, which provides for a income tax rate of 35%,
which is higher than the standard rate in Indonesia and provides for royalties.
With respect to divestment, there is a specific provision that says, if after the signing of this agreement, the effective
laws and regulations of the government's policies impose less burdensome divestiture requirements than those that were
in the COW, those less burdensome requirements apply to the parties of the COW. And what happened after COW was
signed in 1991, Indonesia, in general, adopted new laws and regulations that eliminated requirements for foreign
ownership that triggered this provision, and we have a letter from the government through its investment board called
BKPM, in 1997, saying that we have no future divesture obligations.
Then, there is general provisions that says the government will take no action inconsistent with the COW, adversely
conduct the enterprise and including, without taking any action or condemnation or nationalization of the enterprise or
any part thereunder. Failure to honor this COW is an act of expropriation and nationalization. So, that's a matter that's
specifically covered in the contract. The COW also said the agreement shall have the full force and effect of law and
the law that govern it is the law that was in effect at the time of the contract, 1991.
So, that is what our position is, is that this contract establishes rights and obligations of each party, Freeport and the
government, and that the government cannot change its obligations by adopting new laws and regulations. And this is
part of just the general rule of law, you can't do that in the United States or other countries around the world. If laws or
regulations are changed, then any government has the right to adopt laws and regulations. You can't avoid obligations
under contracts by the government by doing that. And if they do that then the government would be responsible for
financial losses or damages from the breaches of these contracts.
And so, as we enter into discussions with the government, that's the basis for our position and the government points to
the 2009 mining law and that's the element of disagreements that we've had. I'll mention this October 7, 2015 assurance
letter, and it's very important because in that letter, which was issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources,
it talks that the government warrants now this letter is in behalf of Indonesia and warrants is a term that we've
translated to – I've been advised by our people that the law itself could – you could use the word guarantee or warrants
or assures to reflect this. But it says that we would be able to submit proposal of contract extension immediately on the
implementation of the regulatory amendment and the government will not reasonably withhold or delay it. It is further
understood that the approval will ensure, and this really important, the same rights and the same levels of legal and
fiscal certainty as contained in the Contract of Work.
So, where are we today? The government issued these new mining regulations on January 12, 2017, which under
previous regulations, was the date that prohibited exports beyond that date. The regulations allow continuation of
exports subject to conditions including conversion of the COW to the special operating license called an IUPK.

We are working with the government to deal with the reconciliation of these regulations with our contract, and what
we've agreed to do is convert our contract to an IUPK subject to obtaining an underlying investment stability agreement
similar to what we have in other countries, which provides us this legal assurance of fiscal terms and other rights. The
COW remains in effect until it's replaced by a mutually satisfied alternative. And we have requested the government to
allow us to export while we immediately begin to discuss with the government this new license and stability agreement.
Our recent discussions we have not yet been given the export rights, our very recent discussions with the Ministry
indicates that we will be given that right and we will target dealing with the conversion to the license and the stability
agreement within a three-month period. So, we're committed to start working immediately on that. We've been given
indications that we will be allowed to export, but I want to note specifically, we have not yet been approved for that.
If in fact, we are not allowed to export, there's significant impacts on our company. Each day that's 70 million pounds
of copper and 100,000 – each month. That's 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold for each month.
The nature of copper concentrate is that it's bulk material and we don't have the ability to inventory this to any great
extent. We would be allowed to shift domestically to the smelter at Gresik and we would have to restructure our
business to allow us to do that, but it would be a major curtailment of our business. Unlike 2014, at this point, where
our company is not in a position to maintain the existing operations without being able to export.
So, we would have to take steps to curtail operations, curtail cost, that means very large layoffs and cutbacks in capital
spending and we have developed plans to do that. I will say we don't expect to have to do that based on very recent
discussions with the Ministry, but it still remains for us to get this exports approval and we've been given assurance that
we will.
I just want to close this discussion of Indonesia to make just some very general comments. We are one of the oldest and
largest foreign investors in Indonesia. And over the history, we have had a very positive relationship with the
government and, together, we've done great things in Papua. This is, I would suggest the most technically challenging
mine to operate in the world because of its physical setting and the nature of its ore body and how we have to deal with
environmental issues and disposals of tailings and waste material and the development of underground resources. And
we take great pride in what we've accomplished there and we take pride in the positive relationship we've had with the
government. And our goal is to remain a positive partner with the government but while we firmly represent the interest
of Freeport's shareholders.
We take pride in the benefits that our operations have provided to the government and local communities over our long
histories. We produced over $50 billion of economic benefits to the Republic of Indonesia, and our future impacts
would be even greater. Under our current fiscal terms, Indonesia receives more in taxes and royalties than any other
country would receive if we were to take this mine and put it in the U.S., Canada, Chile, Peru. The deal for Indonesia is
very fair by international standards.
In summary, it is in the best interest of both Freeport and the government to reach a mutually accepted resolution. And
I believe both sides recognize this and I have confidence that we will reach this resolution that is fair to all parties. And
we're going to commit all of our common resources to achieve that goal.
We'll answer questions, but I want to just point out our 2017 outlook is for 4 billion pounds of copper, 2.2 million
ounces of gold, 92 million pounds of molybdenum. The copper and gold presumes we will continue to export in
Indonesia. Our site production and delivery cost before by-product credits would be about in the range of $1.50. After
credits, this is $1,200 gold and $7 molybdenum, would be $1.06 for the year, this upcoming year, the year we're in and
about $1.15 for the first quarter.
At $2.50 copper, we would have $4.3 billion of operating cash flow, each $0.10 change in copper plus or minus from
the $2.50 is $385 million. Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, of which $1.1 billion is for major projects. The vast bulk
of that is for the underground development in Indonesia and then our sustaining capital is at $700 million.
Our sales profile for the next three years is shown on slide 19. Net of Tenke and Morenci transactions, we were at 4.17
billion pounds last year. This year would be 4.1 billion pounds, and roughly 4 billion pounds into 2018. And you can

see our gold increases as we complete the mining of the Grasberg open pit in 2017 and 2018. And our molybdenum
sales which we manage to a certain degree in response to the marketplace, and we've done a great job, by the way, of
processing our molybdenum in our downstream operations to reach a chemical grade where realizations are
substantially higher than for metallic molybdenum.
Our models for EBITDA and cash flows are shown on page 20. EBITDA, between $2.50 and $3.00, is $5.5 billion to
$7.5 billion. Operating cash flows are roughly $3.5 billion to $5 billion between $2.50 and $3.00 with limited amount
of free cash flow. This gives us a clear path for making our debt targets.
The sensitivities to price changes for our business is shown on slide 21 and the capital expenditure is on page 22 where,
without oil and gas now, we will significantly reduce capital this year and next, and continue to constrain capital until
market warrants moving forward with a new project.
The balance sheet slide is something that looks great to me. I mean, we went from $20 billion to $12 billion net debt
from last year – from year before last to the end of last year. And then if we look forward next year with a range of
$2.50 to $3.00, you can see our debt dropping below $10 billion and that's a big positive change for us.
And we're committed to a strong balance sheet now. A strong balance sheet in this industry allows you to be protective
of your company's shareholder values. It allows you to make investments when they're warranted. It allows you to take
into account operating risk and risk such as the one we're facing in Indonesia. We are much, much, much better
prepared to deal with those risks today than we were a year ago and it's a major accomplishment for our company to
have met the challenges of having a massively over-levered balance sheet and getting down to where we have a strong
balance sheet.
I'm really excited about our future. I mean, we're an industry-leading copper and copper, in my view, is going to be a
great commodity to be in. We got a great team of operators and developers. We've done all these different projects
spanning the globe. There's not a project in our industry that we could not do effectively. We've got this long-live
geographically diverse proactive cost structure set of resources and, now, we're financially strong to be able to run our
business in an effective way.
So, act one, we are working everyday on act two, as we work to keep our business safe and produce volumes and
control our costs. So, thank you for your attention and I felt – I know I've taken some time on the call. We'll answer
your questions. But, I felt from the circumstances, reviewing some background was needed.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question
will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Terry>: Hi, Richard and team. Yeah. A couple of questions from me. Just trying to head out a few
more details on Grasberg. Maybe just start on the underground development you're going through with the Deep MLZ
Zone and also the Grasberg Block Cave. At this point, has there been any slowdown on that? I'm just looking further
out to some of your guidance and comparing it to past periods, I think the 2019 guidance, for example, has changed a
little bit. Have you changed anything there or are you still waiting for resolution on the near term before you make any
decisions?

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's a good question, Chris. And there's two factors here. First of all, with the fact that
the pit has been extended because of the labor productivity issues that we faced, then that pushes back the ramp-up of
the Grasberg Block Cave. We are proceeding with the development of the block-cave and that has gone very well.
These labor issues and so forth have not carried over to our underground operations or our mill operations. And so, we
are on scheduled now. We've slowed things down a bit to conserve capital and to make this fit in with the startup
following the completion of the mining of the pit.
With respect to the Grasberg Block Cave development, we will not get to the point of initiating cave activities until we
get the contract issues settled, but that is scheduled to occur in the future in any event, between now and 2018. Because
once you start to caving, you got to stay with it or you lose resource.
So, we're progressing with the underground development. We're timing it to coincide with the completion of the pit.
And to a certain extent, we're looking at the contract situation before we go forward with it to get to the point of
actually beginning caving operations leading into production.
The Deep MLZ mine development is complete. We have one cave that's in operation with a number of draw-points on
that cave. We have had an issue related to underground stresses associated with the advancement of the cave and that
has caused us to have to put in more extensive ground support than we had originally contemplated. And that has
resulted in a delay in some of the production that we had originally projected for 2017, 2018 and 2019. So, we've had a
bit of a slowdown in the development of the mine itself to make sure that we're comfortable with the safety factors for
the underground support. And that's taking some time and pushing out some production.
No loss resources. It does involve some incremental cost, but it's something that once we identified this, and this
occurred during the fourth quarter, then we are taking the steps to ensure safety and the ability to produce this thing
over the long term.
<Q - Christopher Terry>: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Richard. And then just in terms of the now, so you're continuing to
produce. Can you just give us some guidance maybe on how much storage capacity you actually have? And then when
you would have to make a decision on that, so is that early Feb that you can keep operating until before you'd need to
get the license?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. Coming into this January 12 day, we schedule shipments to take into account the
potential for a delay in granting of the export license. So, by mid-January we had shipped our exports out under our
previous license authority and shipments for the upcoming weeks are scheduled for the Gresik smelter. Now, Gresik
smelter is undergoing a strike and is currently having to deal with that. So, that has an impact. We have limited amount
of storage spaces I indicated and we would need to take steps no later than mid-February if in fact we're not granted the
license. So, it is something that looms in the very short time horizon.
<Q - Christopher Terry>: Okay. Thanks. And then just the last one from me on the CapEx. Just noticed into 2018, the
part that's not the there, the growth capital. I assume that's the sustaining capital, the $0.9 billion. Is that representative
of the business now that you've divested most of the oil and gas or is that still a work in progress? Are you
under-spending there or can we look at that as more of a steady state number?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, we are aggressively constraining spending. And our team was just here last week
with all of our mine managers and necessity is the mother of invention, but we're sharing inventory, sharing equipment,
sharing people and doing every step we can do. This is not going to be sustainable at that level forever. But we're not
having to increase it in the near-term horizon. But this is an aggressively constrained level of maintenance capital
spending, but it is what – we can meet our production targets with this level of spending.
<Q - Christopher Terry>: Okay. Thanks for the color.

<Q - Andreas Bokkenheuser>: Thank you very much and congratulations on the fantastic job on deleveraging last
year. That was certainly quite impressive and I don't think it was a small thing at all. At the risk of being slightly
predictable, I also have a question on Grasberg. You've obviously highlighted your willingness to potentially convert to
an IUPK, assuming you get the fiscal and legal certainty attached to a COW.
If we assume for a second that you get the fiscal certainty but the government digs their heels in and says, look, you
still have to divest 51% ownership, would I be right in assuming that you will not commit the vast amount of CapEx to
Grasberg if you can't have majority control of the mine? Is that the right assumption?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The government currently owns 9.36% and that goes back prior to the 1991 COW. In
terms of negotiating with them over the past five years, and it was an element in the 2014 MOU, we agreed to divest up
to 30%, which was another 20% roughly over the current government's ownership with the proviso that that divestment
be at fair market value. And a year ago in January, we supplied to the government a valuation of PT-FI based on
valuation parameters at that time, consistent with the negotiations we were having with Morenci and, ultimately, with
China Molybdenum on the Tenke sale, which valued PT-FI at that time at $16 billion. We have not had any interaction
with the government to review that valuation and, clearly, today, copper markets are more positive than they were a
year ago.
The government has expressed over time an interest in having Indonesian ownership over 51%, but they have indicated
they would want to see Freeport continue as operator and to be in control of operations. And so, the thought process, as
I understand it with the government, is to have Indonesian nationals in some form owning 51% but not to be in control
of the business.
Now, we believe we have gone a very long way to meeting their aspiration with agreeing to this 30%. And at the
current time we've just noted our opposition to the regulation that requires 51% for all companies but, in our case, our
contract requires no divestiture. And we have documentation from the government supporting that. There's no question
that had we had a requirement to divest 51% from the start of this contract, we would not have invested in the way that
we did. While there has been indications that government officials, certain government officials accept the fair market
value concept, my point is you just don't develop an asset to sell it to somebody else at a fair market value at a certain
point in time.
And so, that remains a matter of disagreement between us and the government and, clearly, if that were a requirement,
it would affect negatively our future investments for this business.
<Q - Andreas Bokkenheuser>: That's very clear. Thank you very much. Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Let me just say, while I expect that we will get approval to export and some time to deal
with developing this IUPK investment stability agreement, we will still have to deal with this regulation for 51%
divestiture and the government's intention to impose export duties. The level of those duties has not yet been published.
So, we have work to do.
<Q - Andreas Bokkenheuser>: Right. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. That was good. Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Thanks very much. Hi, Richard and Kathleen. I also want to congratulate you on act one
as well. And Richard, when I listen to you detailing the articles in the Contract of Work in the specific areas, I couldn't
help but think that I was hearing increased frustration, as to be expected, in your voice. And my goodness, you look at
all these – the details in the articles and how it has been violated over time and just your response to the last question
about this 51% divestment stake and so on and so forth and the questions about operating control and all these types of
things. And I clearly heard you say earlier about this kind of very critical date as you come up upon mid-February

which is not that far away. If these issues in Indonesia persist, would you consider, in addition to reining in investment
there, could we see Freeport look seriously at perhaps restarting some of your currently idled capacity elsewhere in the
world?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I really think that those are independent decisions. And I don't think we would
start idled capacity just because something was happening in Indonesia. We're going to look at the idled capacity and
investment of developing new resources based on market conditions.
And, Tony, one of the advantages of having a stronger balance sheet, which a year ago we were really dealing with
these situations – the situation in Indonesia and other potential risk in places we operate outside Indonesia – from a
position of weakness. Now our cannons are loaded and we can represent our shareholders much more strongly than we
could have then. And that's really important.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: We have the rights to pursue claims against the government in the form of international
arbitration and our legal team advises us that our case is very strong in doing that. We have consistently represented to
the government that we don't want to do that. I don't believe that would be advantageous for us, but I also think it
would be very negative for the government of Indonesia.
So, we have and as long as we have the opportunity to try to resolve these matters in good faith, we'll continue to do it
through trying to reach an amicable, mutually agreeable situation. But if we get to that point where we can't, and that
point would include not being able to export, then we would be left no choice and we're prepared to do that.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: All right. Richard, just on the labor situation. You mentioned – I was unaware that the
Gresik smelter was dealing with a strike situation. Your own situation there as it relates to the mining operations, is
there a labor contract which expires there this year? It seems like the two year...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes, there is.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: I know it's every two years...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's every two years and we have to begin this summer beginning the negotiation of a
new CLA agreement with our labor union at Grasberg. And under Indonesian law, that's required every two years as
you point out.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Is that a – the exploration on that, Richard, is which date?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: September.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: End of September.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: End of September. And that's to all of the workers at the mine, mill, everything?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, there is – our total workforce is 30,000 to 34,000 people. Half of those, roughly, a
little less than half, are employees, and a majority of the employees are members of one union and that's the contract
we're talking about.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: The others are contractors and certain of those contract companies have separate unions
and separate negotiations. But for the major employee union, that is the contract that we've just been talking about.
<Q - Anthony B. Rizzuto>: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Hi. Good morning. More questions on Grasberg, specifically your guidance for 2017. Just
curious what throughput rate that assumes at Grasberg? Because, obviously, it has been tracking kind of below
expectations given the productivity rates that you talked about.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Orest, this is Kathleen. The big driver of our metal in 2017 comes from the Grasberg open
pit. And we are using an estimate, an average of 140,000 tons a day of mining rate. And during the third quarter of
2016, we averaged 170,000 tons roughly. We had forecast 160,000 tons going into the fourth quarter and we had some
work stoppages and some productivity issues that we dealt with in the fourth quarter, so, we averaged 122,000 tons.
The 140,000 tons that we're estimating for 2017 is very doable, but it is that risk for issues related to productivity and
work stoppages. But we think it's very much achievable and, potentially, we could do better than that.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: And is that – as your guidance reduction for 2017, is that driven purely off of the
productivity issues or is there any impact from the ban in the current – the export ban in the current change?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: It's principally related to the lower mining rate and to the delayed start up or delayed ramp
up at Deep MLZ that is affecting 2017. We do have some allowance for the concentrate delays, but we're expecting
under this plan to be exporting in February.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: I see. And just finally on Grasberg. Richard talked earlier about your relationship with Rio
Tinto. But can you just please outline, I think, to everybody, how the 40% interest is going to work with Rio Tinto
starting in 2021, and how that pertains to – whether that pertains to their stake in PT-FI at the asset level and how we
should think about that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. They do not have any stake in PT-FI. The operation, even though we call it all
Freeport, is actually a joint venture between PT-FI and Rio Tinto's Indonesian subsidiary. And so, they own those
shares of PT-FI. The numbers we present are proportionately consolidated, so it excludes Rio Tinto's interest in current
operations which is very small. But it also – when we report reserves and resources, that's net of Rio Tinto's interest.
And they have an assignment of our COW and so it is really a joint venture and they had a varying level of
participation from the time it began – the production began and the joint venture in 1998 until 2021. There has been
some extensions of that date for force majeure items. And after that date, they have a 40% interest.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: And if you, like last year when you previously talked about selling down 20% to the
government, did that – so would that have included pro rata share from Rio Tinto or was that strictly Freeport share?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: That's strictly Freeport share. We only negotiate with the government with respect to
Freeport's interest. And for example, when I referred to this $16 billion of valuation, that is exclusive of the valuation
attributed to Rio Tinto.
There is only one COW. They have an assigned interest in that COW. We cannot make any amendments to that COW
that's adverse to Rio Tinto's interest. And we've been great partners since the start of this operation and we're in very
close communication with them on all aspects of our business – technical, safety issues, government relations issues
and so forth. So, it's that partnership, and I want to be clear, we represent PT-FI. We have a joint venture partner, Rio
Tinto, that represents their interest.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: I see. And is Rio funding its proportionate share than of the underground CapEx and the
future smelter?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: With respect to the CapEx at Grasberg in the underground development, several years
ago, we reached an agreement on how those capital expenditures would be shared. Certain of those costs are deemed to
be replacement capital and they are shared on the same basis as operating cost. Some of the cost are considered to be

expansion capital and they're shared at 60-40.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Like the Deep MLZ.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Like with the Deep MLZ project for example. Certain projects that – for example, the
access – there is a common access to Deep MLZ and to Grasberg and we have an agreed upon sharing. So, the capital
that we report and all these numbers in our presentation that we report are Freeport only. They don't include cost shared
by Rio Tinto. Those cost are relatively small right now but will grow to 40% once the conversion to the 40% interest
comes into play.
<Q - Orest Wowkodaw>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Sure.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Morning, Rich and Kathleen. Thank you very much for the updates. Just got a couple of
questions. I don't want to beat a dead horse. But talking about Grasberg, again, obviously talking about mining rates in
Q4 and it probably had something to do with labor as well as the mine sequencing. Can you just give us some context
like what – how much does the work force sort of flex-down as you guys transition to the block cave?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's more of a transition than a flex-down because actually underground mining is
labor-intensive. And over time as the open pit moves towards completion, the mine rate drops removing much less
waste material now than we did in the past. So, there's less equipment, less people. And we sought to transition workers
from the open pit to the underground through training where we could.
We also will have ongoing, after the pit is completed, material-moving activities associated with the waste –
management of the waste material that has been taken out of the pit and placed around the pit. And we have to manage
that for long-term environmental reasons.
We have activities in the lowlands where we have a tailings disposal area, that's cordoned off with dikes and that there's
a constant effort ongoing to build and maintain those dikes to execute our tailing management plan.
So, I would say, Andrew, that it's more of a transition than – what was the word you used?
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Flex-down, okay.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Okay. Cool. Second question was about you guys obviously talking about a surface water tax...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: ...which was about $470 million. Can you guys just give us some color on that? And if that was
to be paid, would that come this year? I've realized you guys haven't made provisions for it. But what's the background
of that? Is that, that the government is sort of playing games?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: This is a clear-cut example of why we have to protect our COW.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Our contract says we're only subject to taxes that are specified in the COW. And what
happened here is the provincial government, not the central government has sought to impose a water tax on us that
we've resisted paying because it's not part of the COW. And we didn't pay it and the provincial government sued us. It
has gone through the tax court now and there was a very recent ruling in the tax court that was in favor of the provincial

government. And it's one of these kinds of things that we face in other countries whereas the amount of the tax I think
was less than $200 million. But there are penalty provisions in the law that are very aggressive. And so, that's where it
has grown up to the $350 million, $400 million level.
We have made – we have taken steps to appeal this tax court decision. We believe it's wrong. We are considering
submitting this matter to arbitration. But that's what would happen to us if we went to a license without having an
investment stability agreement. Under a license, you're subject to prevailing laws and regulations and any government
can come in and impose taxes, fees, import duties, export duties, et cetera, et cetera, water taxes, surface taxes, vehicle
taxes. And so, obviously, governments around the world need funds these days and an operation like ours is an
attractive target. So, we have to have some protection against this.
We have made very significant voluntary contributions to the Papuan community, beyond what we're required to pay
under the COW. We began in 1996 to voluntarily contribute, along with Rio Tinto, 1% of our revenues to a Papuan
development fund, and that has accumulated. The last number I saw was $650 million, that's one of the largest
community development funding activities in the globe. Freeport was just recognized in Forbes by being among the top
50 civic mining companies and that's part of it, the fact that we voluntarily make this contribution each year for our
Papuan community development.
So, it's not like we're trying to ignore our neighbors in the province, but we have to resist opening the door to having
taxes imposed on us that's not part of our contract. There is a real a danger of that being a never-ending stream in this.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: Richard, thanks very much. I've got one more and it's not Indonesia, how about that? Switching
to North America, look, obviously copper prices have rebounded. Is there some – is there a price in your head that you
guys will start looking now that balance sheet is pretty much fixed? You guys have done a great job there in the last 12
months. Is there – how much of the capacity do you think is in North America that you guys consider maybe flex to
maybe bring back on in time?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: You know we had an interesting situation with our scale back operations. We went
through and evaluated each project and Red Conger is here and led this effort with Kathleen looking over his shoulder.
But we review every operation, every segment of every operation when copper prices drop so low to see what would be
cash flow positive. When we talk about our cash flow positive, it includes maintenance capital as well as operating
cost.
And really we did this in 2008, 2009, adjusted some operations. And this time when we reviewed them like the
operations in New Mexico, they withstood that. We shut down production that was really reclamation activities in the
Miami-Globe area, the Miami mine. That's not going to come back on. That's done. And we've adjusted it to make it
purely a reclamation management effort.
At our Sierrita mine in Arizona, it is a very, very low grade copper deposit, but has significant molybdenum component
to it. And because both prices dropped, we started a plan to curtail production significantly. We're targeting 50% or
more.
Well, as we got into it, the team there started finding ways of reducing cost to such an extent that we never cut it back
as much as we initially intended. And so, now we're just monitoring that. We're not making plans to take steps to invest
right now, to increase it. It does have future investment opportunities. But we're just managing production to meet cash
flow objectives.
We did, in South America – I know you asked about North America, but we did cut the mining rate in half at El Abra
and that remained curtailed. And we are looking at the future development opportunity there. But we don't see stepping
that up at the copper price that's expected for 2017.
<Q - Andrew Quail>: So, it's something above $3.00?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: We have, and I think we've commented on this in previous reports, but we have ongoing
work that Red and his team are doing, looking at each site to see if we can change pit designs to reduce costs and to get
more production. That's not an easy exercise, but that's the kind of thing we're looking at, it's things that don't require

Your next question will come from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Hey, Evan.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: So, I just have a question on divestment valuation. I've heard all sorts of different conflicting
reports out there. And I know at one point, you were hoping to get some sort of clarity on whether you could use an
IPO on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, and it seem like maybe that wasn't going to work out. And today there was a
report out that kind of suggested that maybe that could be an option. I've also seen some other reports about the
government only having to pay for replacement cost and not in situ or that sort of things.
So, just wanted to get your views there. Is that something that we could see? How likely could you get most of the
required divestment done through an IPO do you think?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Evan, we believe an IPO would be an attractive step in achieving a divestment
plan because it results in a market-based valuation of the business. And the Indonesian Stock Exchange has grown to be
a fair market. And I know from discussions with investors, there would be people interested in investing in an asset like
Grasberg. So, we and others in Indonesia are supportive of that. It would not be the sort of thing that we could do a
20% divestment in one step on the exchange. Simply will be too large. And so, we think an IPO would be maybe 5% or
slightly more than that and we would work with the bankers and all that would be dependent on market conditions at
the time we launched it.
So, we think that with respect to these comments about replacement cost – there were some articles earlier this week
about somebody saying we wouldn't get any credit for underground reserves, which is a pretty wild statement. All of
those things are just press comments. As I said, we have not been approached by the government to sit down and
review our valuation with the government officials or financial advisors, and we're prepared to do that at any time.
But we are – there was a prior regulation that they had that talked about replacement cost. But our agreements with the
government and the MOU and other discussions have always included a requirement on our part that it'd be at a fair
market value and we wouldn't be prepared to enter any kind of divestment without achieving that.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Thanks for that color. And maybe just one more follow-up, if I may. Just with respect to Rio
Tinto and them taking their 40% stake as you look out past 2021. How is that kind of – how the discussions evolve
between you and Rio as far as, if you were to pursue a path with the IUPK and maybe one of the those path includes
having to divest up to 51% in the company in exchange for some of the other protections that you're looking for, how
would Rio Tinto fit into that picture? I mean assuming they take 40%, would that come out of their stake? I know it's
51% of the asset and not at PT-FI that they are looking for. So, how do they fit into the picture and have you had any
discussions with them on that front?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, the way they fit into the picture is, there is one COW, they have an assignment in
it. And for any changes to that COW, we basically have to reach an agreement with Rio Tinto on it. And we talk with
them constantly. We've had good positive discussions with them, so any decisions we reach would be with them.
I want to go back and repeat what I said earlier about divestiture. We only can talk about divestiture with respect – we
at Freeport can only talk about divestiture with respect to PT-FI and our interest apart from Rio Tinto. We can't

represent their ownership and that's their business in dealing with the Indonesian government on it.
So, the divestiture discussions that we've had to-date and the $16 billion number and all the other things strictly relates
to PT-FI which is an entity that Rio Tinto has no interest in. They're a joint venture partner, just like Sumitomo is our
joint venture partner at Morenci, and Codelco is our joint venture partner at El Abra. Rio Tinto is our joint venture
partner at Grasberg, and even though it's commonly referred to as – the total operations as being PT-FI because we
manage them, they have certain rights with respect to operations which we work with them on and reach a meeting of
minds on plans and investments and things of that nature too. So it is a true joint venture.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: And would they have say in the conversion from a COW to an IUPK, since most of their rights
are with the COW? So you'd you have to get their signoff as well. Yeah.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Absolutely.
<Q - Evan L. Kurtz>: Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll hand it over.

Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please
go ahead.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you very much for taking my question. Richard, could you clarify the production rate
at Sierrita? Is it more like half the capacity, 75% or 100%?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: It's about 75%.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: It's about 75%, John.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Could you tell us among the six possible sulfide mill projects, which one or two are more
likely to go forward first and whether we're talking about things that are [indiscernible] (1:23:39)?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. I think the first one, John, that we would pursue would be the Lone Star project
which is adjacent to Safford. This is an enormous sulfide resource with an oxide cap and the Safford operation itself is
facing the end of its resource life, although there is a deeper sulfide project there. But what we can do as an initial step
at Lone Star is mine the oxide cap using the Safford oxide production facilities and that would serve as a stripping of
the material for a long-term sulfide project which conceivably, right, Red, could include the sulfides at Safford as well
as the sulfides at Lone Star, but that would be a major mill investment. So, I think the first thing you would see us do is
move to start mining of the Lone Star oxide which would not require the kind of major capital expenditures that a
sulfide concentrator mill would require.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: So, essentially a stripping project, then we would use the infrastructure that is currently in
place at Safford.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Then beyond that, you start getting into these trade-offs between Bagdad, El Abra,
would be I think the two that would be right now competing for that first step.

<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Just a quick question on North America. How would a change in corporate tax
rates in the U.S. potentially affect your cash taxes paid out of your North American operations? And then also, would a
change in the Republican – would a new Republican administration change your decision process regarding any of
these potential expansion projects going forward? Would it make it easier or would it make it more likely that you
would go ahead with any of them?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: All right, Chris. That's a very complicated question. It has got really broader
implications than Freeport. But let me just talk about a couple of things that's applicable to Freeport. You start out by
saying because of losses that were triggered by this oil and gas activities we had, we're not paying cash taxes in the
United States, and we have a very large carryforward that would shelter cash taxes for a significant amount of time in
the future.
And so, one thing we're watching is in this tax reform, are they going to do anything with carryforwards? There's just a
lot of questions about it. But I don't want to get into this, because we could talk forever and we had a conversation at
the Business Roundtable on it. But this border adjustment provision that they're talking about could really have some
interesting implications.
Right now, we supply 40% of the copper to the U.S. market. And we pay – it results in taxable income, which right
now is being sheltered. Under the way this thing is structured, as I understand it, if we export that copper, we would
pay no taxes on it. Right now, if we buy a Caterpillar haul truck and would use it at Bagdad, Caterpillar would have to
pay taxes on that. If we bought a Caterpillar haul truck and use it at El Abra, since it is exported, Caterpillar would have
to pay no taxes on it.
<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Right.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: If we bought all the big – Kathleen is telling me to stop.
<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: If we were to buy all the big grinding equipments made in Germany, under this
cross-border thing, if we bought it for Bagdad, we would get no tax deduction for it. If we bought it for El Abra, we
could deduct it in determining taxes in Chile. So, we're just one example of this and so this debate over tax reform and
particularly this cross-border situation is really going to be an interesting one to follow.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: But the bottom line on a change in the corporate tax rate in the U.S., right now, given our
situation with NOLs, just a simple change in the corporate tax rate wouldn't impact us.
<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Right. Okay. And the border [indiscernible] (1:28:52) so complex, it's tough to
really say what the net effect will be.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And we're also not one of the companies that's affected by having cash offshore that
hasn't been taxed, repatriation issues and the unified tax structure, because we pay more taxes outside the U.S. than we
do in the U.S. A typical case is the reverse of that. So, we don't have that issue facing Freeport.
<Q - Christopher Domenic Mancini>: Okay. Okay. Great. And I guess that a new administration – I mean that in
Arizona is very favorable to mining and to expansion of mines and this kind of thing. And so, a new Republican
administration wouldn't necessarily change your mindset, I don't think, relative to expansion projects. But I guess it
wouldn't – the potential to stop them going forward might be a little bit lower or does it really matter...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, I will say we've been here in Arizona for 10 years, 10 years ago we acquired
Phelps Dodge. And Arizona is an excellent, excellent state for us to operate in. We've had a Democratic governor when
we first moved here. We've had two Republican governors now and they, through both administrations, have been very
supportive of our business. We do things the right way for communities and the way we run our mines and so they
appreciate that. So, we've got tremendous support by the state.

The area that we're watching that could have a big influence on us is EPA regulations because we inherited legacy
environmental obligations all over this country from historical operations that go back into the 19th century. And we
just entered into a settlement that you may have seen with the EPA and the Navajo Indian tribe in the Four Corners area
over some significant historical uranium cleanup sites and we were very pleased with that. The government is going to
pay a significant part of that and we're going to deal with some of those obligations on behalf of our company. So,
these EPA regulations, which is a big focus of the new administration, is important to us.

Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Hi. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, I'd actually like to start off by
saying I agree with some of the comments earlier. It's unreal to me how the Indonesian government has constantly
changed the agreements and rules over the years. But nevertheless, I guess it is what it is.
So, unfortunately, I actually have two Indonesia follow-ups, both I think are probably more clarifications. But first of
all, does the investment stability agreement that Freeport would propose to the Indonesian government which, my
understanding is will be the core to converting from their Contract to Work to this IUPK. Would that investment
stability agreement include basically the same six articles that are included in your slide deck, that are included in the
Contract of Work now? Or if not, how would those differ? That's my first question.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. We would go back to this October 7 letter that's in the slide deck as well. And in
that letter, the government gave us assurances, warranted their guarantee that under the new regulations, we would get
the same level of assurances on legal and fiscal matters that we had in the COW. So, that's the starting point and the
end point in our view of where we go with that. So, the answer is yes, it would contain all the important provisions
related to fiscal and legal certainty that are in the COW. They would now be in the stability agreement. And our
analysis shows that the government has authority under the law through its investment agreement, investment laws, to
enter into this sort of an agreement.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Okay. Great. Thanks for clarifying. And then back to the Rio Tinto discussion, just
for a second, another clarification question. I just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way. If Freeport
was required, for whatever reason, to divest down to that 49% ownership, after Rio Tinto comes in beginning in 2022,
does that essentially mean the net result for Freeport would basically be that the company goes from having the rights,
essentially 91% of Grasberg's volumes today, down to about 9% by the beginning of 2022? Or am I thinking about that
the wrong way?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, if you would look through it as to what is the net Freeport interest in this, today, as
we sit here today, PT-FI has let's just say virtually all the interest through 2021. Rio Tinto has a small piece of that.
After 2021, Rio Tinto has 40%, PT-FI has 60%. FCX owns 90% of PT-FI. So, it would be 90% of 60% would be 54%.
If we divest...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Half of our interests.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, if we divest let's say 30%...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: So it's still a 20%. Another 20%.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. So if we divest 20% in Indonesia [ph] in interests (1:34:42) would own 30%, FCX
would own 70%. So, FCX would own 70% of 60% or 42% net interest. If we divested half, FCX would own 50% of
70% or 35%.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thank you for...

<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: And David I know your question is more from a big picture standpoint. But because of
metal strip adjustments, the 60-40 split will probably be more like a 2023 event. So...
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: Got you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. Because that has been adjusted, for example, when we had the almost seven
months inability to export and we've had some other interruption in operations over the years that triggered an
adjustment to the effective date of Rio Tinto's 40% interest.
<Q - David Francis Gagliano>: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you for clarifying.

Our final question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Lucas N. Pipes>: Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question and sorry to belabor the point, but it's about
Indonesia. Richard, I think you mentioned that you are prepared to go to arbitration and I think you also mentioned that
it's a function of whether you obtain the export license. Could you clarify as to what is the timing, let's say a month
from now mid-February, you don't have an export license. Would that be the time that you go to arbitration?
And then, secondly, you also mentioned that the arbitration would have negative consequences or there are number
downsides for Indonesia. Could you tell us what those are? Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. To coin a phrase, I don't want to draw a red line here. I mean we are – if we got to
the point of where the government is just arbitrarily saying they're not going to grant us export license unless we
convert to an IUPK without conditions, then we would have no recourse other than going to arbitration. But we believe,
we – I want to tell you what I believe, I believe we will be granted exports and we will have a period of time to
negotiate these things. That's what I believe is going to happen. But the point that would trigger it, Lucas, is if the
government just said, no, we're not going to talk with you anymore, we're not going to negotiate, you either have a
choice of going to the IUPK and not exporting. Then, we're not left with any room on it. So, that's the key.
And then from the government of Indonesia's standpoint, you see advertisements here of the government encouraging
foreign investment. They had a section in the USA Today. You can see their ads on Charlie Rose most nights. The
country needs international investments to achieve its economic goals. And I've listened very carefully to President
Joko Widodo on his trips to the U.S. and at APEC and I feel very positive about his philosophy about investments and
so forth. So, here, Freeport is among the oldest and largest investors in the history of the company...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: ...country.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: ...in the history of the country and it's almost history of the company too, but I meant to
say country. And so, for us to have a very public dispute over things like this would be negative or both of us.
