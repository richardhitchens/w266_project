MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At
this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and the
instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Treasurer, Mr. Chuck Zebula. Please go ahead, sir.
Charles E. Zebula
Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to the third quarter 2012 earnings webcast of American Electric
Power. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website,
aep.com.
Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future
results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.
Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our President and CEO, and Brian Tierney, our CFO. We
will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.
Nicholas K. Akins
Okay, thanks, Chuck, and good morning to everyone, and thank you all for taking the time to join our third quarter

I really call these calls status calls, because we now have a long-term strategy that's been in place since February, and
we're committed to continuing with that strategy and really describing, taking the opportunity to describe the steps that
we've been taking along the way and moving forward with that strategy to not only redefine AEP from a
transformational perspective, but also set AEP up for the future. It's also a discussion of the environment that we find
ourselves in, and but most importantly, what we're doing about it.
Notwithstanding the derecho that certainly had an impact on our service territory, I guess the multiple storms during
that period of time were close to 1.8 million customers over two weeks. When you have that kind of customer mix with
those storms, it truly has an impact on what the electric supply was during that – during that period of time. But
notwithstanding that, there is no doubt that it was a challenging quarter.
In the past couple of years the accelerator has been pushed on the – to the floor on the industrial recovery in our service
territory and has gradually been letting up quarter-by-quarter, until now, where this quarter we're finding that the foot's
off the accelerator. Fueled by primary metals and oil and gas activity, we've made great progress in the recovery after
the recession. And now we find primary metals faltering once again due to the soft international demand, primarily in
the aluminum area, while certainly oil and gas activity continues to progress. So our industrial load dropped for the first
time in nine quarters by 3.1%, and half of that was probably in Ormet here in Ohio, where two potlines were taken
off-line. So it does show that sensitivity around aluminum prices.
In previous quarters, the industrials were compensating for residential and commercial load decreases, and now we see
commercial customer growth still continuing to improve. We saw that for the first time in a few years, last quarter, a
commercial improvement. That continues. But as we've said earlier, the economy is tenuous at best, and we really do
have to be concerned about the issues involved with that. And now we're seeing probably the end result of 2012
year-to-date load growth profile being essentially flat for the year.
So one quarter doesn't make a trend, but we have to be concerned as any time we see a slowdown in economic activity,
certainly issues such as international market conditions, needed tax and regulatory reform, and the need for a coherent
energy policy are factors that must be resolved to spur investment and enable recovery. We're hopeful that after the
election we can make some progress on those fronts.
As Brian will discuss later, despite load growth challenges and the continued loss of Ohio-related revenue due to the
movement to competition, we delivered near consensus earnings for the quarter of $1.00 on a GAAP basis per share
and $1.02 operating earnings per share for the third quarter and $2.55 and $2.59 per share respectively for the nine
months year-to-date.
How do we overcome the challenges that I just discussed? Well, I think it goes back to the February discussion that we
had, diversity of the AEP System is something that's very positive for us. We not only have been controlling costs,
which we've done a great job of, we have various other jurisdictions that have produced rate increases. So, certainly
when you look at the strength of AEP, it is in that diversity that we keep talking about. There is no sense whining about
the economy, it is what it is, but we can and do adjust to provide a level of discipline that the market expects. We know
that when the economy truly begins to recover in a sustainable fashion, the diversity of our system, of our customer
mix, of the fundamental resources such as shale gas, which is prevalent in our operating footprint, will enable AEP to
continue to reach our growth potential.
So, we remain committed to our long-term strategy as discussed with you in February 10 of this year, and I've talk
about it in all the quarterly earnings webcasts as well, but I'll reaffirm them here. Certainly, our notions have been
around these issues: movement to competitive market in Ohio with corporate separation and the formation of our
competitive generation, retail, and marketing functions; number two, investment in our regulated businesses and the
focus on ROE optimization; number three, a focus on growth aspects of the business such as transmission; and then
four, to reaffirm to you our commitment to be a regulated utility going forward. The dividend strength that we have is
generated by the regulated businesses, and we are intent on maintaining that 86%, 14% mix that we've talked about
previously, and a continued commitment to the 4% to 6% earnings growth. Transformation of our generation resources
is also a key component, particularly in light of EPA mandates and so forth.

So, as far as providing guidance, we anticipate providing guidance after we receive the final order of the Ohio ESP,
which we expect hopefully by the end of the year. By then we'll also complete the repositioning study that we've been
involved with. So, we're anticipating having an February Analyst Day to provide guidance for 2013. At that point, I
think the main risk issues that we'll have really center around the level of Ohio customer switching and load growth
that we see post-election and so forth. So, I think we'll be in a better position – much better position to give guidance at
that point in time.
Our operational performance has been excellent. When you look at the things we actually control, we've done an
outstanding job. The repositioning study, I'm very pleased with the progress there, will be completed by the end of the
year. And I'm just pleased with the degree of thoughtfulness that the teams have gone through to achieve the objectives.
And the progress being made, we've had two or three sets of discussions with the five teams that are working on this
thing. And it's amazing to me that you can have substantial process changes that reposition this company for the future
and focus on the growth areas, and we wind up providing a level of service that we continue to maintain. So it is a very
good progress there, and we fully expect to be able to talk more about that when we get to the February timeframe.
Transmission has just successfully completed a $350 million debt offering, which was fully subscribed, and there was a
high degree of interest in it. So, it shows that we're moving in the right direction from an investment profile, and we
continue to work on our capital allocation to further encourage the growth of our transmission businesses. We continue
to focus on the advancement of transcos in the various jurisdictions. We have four transcos and others are in various
levels of ongoing pending actions. So, we continue to be heartened by what's going on there as well.
Our Turk Plant is moving toward completion. We expect our first coal firing, we had natural gas firing for startup a
couple of months ago, and I was proudly showing the pictures of that. It looks like a gas burner, I guess I appreciate it
more than the others did, but nevertheless, today we should be seeing the first coal firing, we should see
synchronization to the grid of the Turk plant here in November, and then in December, we'll see it go commercial. So –
and it is a beautiful plant site, being the first ultra-supercritical pulverized coal unit in the nation, and we're very proud
of that accomplishment. And then you look at it, and you wonder why we can't do those things everywhere.
The regulatory cases related to that, obviously getting that commercial operation data is critical for us. We filed a case
in Texas, and it's ongoing in terms of that jurisdictional recovery there. And even with that filing, we still have among
the lowest rates in Texas. So, I think we stand in pretty good favor there in terms of the placement of that plant and
what it means for the future for SWEPCO customers. Other cases, such as the Indiana case, $140 million case filed
there, case hearings have concluded, and we expect to have an outcome to that by the end of this year as well.
So those things aside, probably one of the main things you're interested in is what's happened in Ohio. During the last
quarter we made considerable progress there. As many of you are aware, the Ohio PUCO provided clarity for our
transition to a competitive market by issuing ESP orders, capacity orders and corporate separation orders that enable us
to move forward with the FERC filings. And the result of those orders have been positive for us in that we can map out
a plan for the future, focus on the filings that need to be made at FERC once again and also pursue the other state
filings on the transfers of Mitchell and Amos to APCo and Kentucky Power. So we're focused on those jurisdictions,
and discussions are ongoing in those areas as well.
So we'll have six filings to make, just as we made last time around the areas of separation of the Ohio assets, transfer of
Mitchell and Amos, merging Wheeling into APCo and other termination agreements associated with approval and the
interconnection agreements in various temporary joint operating agreements and those types of things. So, those filings
will be made – we anticipate making those filings by the end of October. So we're moving forward step by step in this
process to ensure that we continue with the progress that's being made.
Also I'm pleased with the progress of AEP Energy, forming our AEP Retail business, we put BlueStar and everything
else in that business. We now have approximately 150,000 customers, and we continue to focus on margins not
quantity in a very deliberate, disciplined fashion. So we proceed with separating out our Ohio generation. We'll include
that in that part of the business, and I'm very focused on that transition to make sure that it's complete. And I'm very
happy to see that that business continues to progress, and they're actually earning their own keep, so that's a great story
early on in their function.

So while the economy continues to be a challenge, we have responded with an unwavering focus and commitment to
our strategic plan and the discipline to provide shareholder value and quality customer service. And we're very focused
on those steps, we'll be very transparent about those steps as we go forward, and like I said, this is viewed as a status
call to let you know that progress that has indeed been made and the fundamentals are there in our service territory
because of diversity that this system is ready to go.
So I'll turn it over to Brian to give you the details of the third quarter. Brian?
Brian X. Tierney
Thank you, Nick, and good morning to everyone.
Let's start on slide four with the quarterly comparison, where you'll see that operating earnings for the third quarter of
this year were $496 million, or $1.02 per share, as compared to $566 million or $1.17 per share for the last year's third
quarter. Ohio customer switching and the authorized capacity cost deferrals combined for a negative $0.06 comparison
to last year's third quarter.
In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $28 million carrying cost for the TCC stranded capacity auction true-up.
Since we securitized this true-up earlier this year, we do not have a comparable amount this quarter, resulting in an
unfavorable comparison of $0.04.
Although this was the fifth warmest third quarter in the last 30 years, last year's third quarter was the warmest during
that timeframe. This results in weather having a negative $0.04 per share comparison to last year, but is actually
positive $0.07 versus normal weather.
Off-Systems sales net of sharing were down $20 million, or $0.03, versus last year. Physical volumes and margins were
off in response to power prices that averaged 20% below last year and natural gas prices that were off by over 30%.
Trading and marketing results were $5 million lower than last year.
Non-Utility operations and parent results accounted for a negative $0.03 comparison to last year and are mostly
explained by the effect of the drought on our River Operations business. Depreciation and amortization expense
increased by $32 million and accounted for a negative $0.04 comparison to last year. This was due to the accelerated
depreciation at the Ohio plants that we will retire in 2015, increased depreciation rates on several of our jurisdictions,
as well as the amortization of the TCC securitization.
On the positive comparisons, jurisdictional rate changes net of the loss of the Ohio provider of last resort revenues
added $0.03 per share, or $20 million, compared to last year. Our continued focus on spending that Nick mentioned
several times resulted in operation and maintenance expenses net of offsets having a positive comparison of $0.04 per
share over last year. Other, including higher Transco and ETT earnings, added $0.02 per share over last year's third
quarter.
At this point I would like to provide an update of the cost treatment related to the June 29 derecho and the three smaller
storms that occurred during the restoration efforts. The total cost for these storms was approximately $217 million, of
which about $62 million were capital and removal costs. Of the remaining $155 million, about $124 million has been
deferred for future recovery, leaving about $31 million to be expensed. $4 million were expensed in the second quarter,
and the remaining $27 million were expensed in the third quarter.
Turning to slide five, I will review the year-to-date comparisons. Operating earnings for the 2012 year-to-date period
were $1.255 billion, or $2.59 per share, compared to $1.31 billion, or $2.72 per share, for the year-to-date of 2011.
Ohio customer switching, net of authorized capacity deferrals, accounted for a negative $0.19 per share when compared
to last year's year-to-date. Approximately 42% of Ohio's load has switched suppliers versus approximately 10% of load
that had switched by the end of September last year.

Weather provided a negative $0.16 per share comparison to last year for the year-to-date period. This year's mild winter
did not compare favorably with the more extreme winter of 2011. And as previously mentioned, while this summer was
warm, it was not as warm as last year. However, when compared to normal weather, 2012 year-to-date was favorable
by $0.04.
Non-Utility operations and parent results had a negative comparison to last year of $21 million, or $0.04 per share. This
is mostly explained by the drought impacts on the River Operations and by the loss of production tax credits at our
Texas wind farms.
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $101 million, or $0.13 per share, for the year-to-date period, and
the reasons for this are the same as for the quarterly comparison. Year-on-year rate increases from several of our
jurisdictions were fully offset by the loss of the Ohio Provider of Last Resort revenues, resulting in no change to the
year-to-date period for this category.
Continued disciplined spending resulted in a positive year-to-year O&M comparison of $215 million, or $0.28 per
share. It is important to remember that this line item is operational and maintenance expenses net of revenue increases
to account for rate trackers and other contemporaneous rate mechanisms. The remaining positive year-to-date
reconciliation of $0.11 per share is explained by higher transmission earnings, the 2012 reversal of a negative fuel
provision from the prior year, and a lower income tax rate.
Taking a look at retail load trends on slide six, you will see the bottom right hand quadrant that overall weather
normalized retail sales were down 1.4% for the quarter and are now down 0.30% year-to-date.
Before going into the sector comparisons, let me provide an overview of the economy in our service territory. On
several traditional economic indicators, the AEP service territories outperformed national measures. For example,
employment growth rate for AEP's metropolitan areas was up 2.1% for the quarter versus national employment growth,
which was up only 1.4%. GDP was estimated to grow at 3% for AEP's metropolitan areas for the quarter versus 1.8%
estimated growth for the U.S. in aggregate. Our western service territories experienced GDP growth of 3.4% as
compared to the 2.6% growth experienced in the western portion of our system. These different growth rates exemplify
the diversity that Nick referred to in his comments.
Despite these positive comparisons to national indicators, AEP did not escape the realities of a struggling economy.
This is evident when looking at the bottom left hand quadrant of the slide, where you can see that industrial sales were
down 3.1% for the quarter. This development is of concern because as Nick said, it's counter to the positive industrial
load trends from the previous nine quarters. Industrial sales are now positive 0.20% for the year-to-date period. We'll
explore this customer class in a little bit more detail on the next slide.
Above industrial sales you will see that weather normalized residential sales declined 0.50% compared to last year's
third quarter. We believe that about half of this negative 0.50% was attributable to the derecho. While customer counts
remain fairly steady at 5.3 million customers, average usage per residential customer declined 0.70% for the quarter
and is down nearly 2% for the year. We believe this is related to state and federal energy efficiency initiatives and to
the lingering effects of the economy.
The commercial customer class was essentially flat for the quarter and is now up 0.50% for the year-to-date period. We
believe that the growth in employment that I mentioned earlier should have a positive impact on the commercial sector
in the future.
Let's take a look at the industrial sales class on slide seven. You can see that four of our top five industrial sectors
experienced negative trends for the quarter. Nick referenced the primary metals sector, which was down 9.8% for the
quarter and is now down 2.5% for the year. Much of this decline is due to our largest customer, which reduced
production by a third during the quarter. Excluding this customer, primary metals were down 3.9% for the quarter and
1.4% year-to-date. The chemical manufacturing sector was down 5% for the quarter and is down 2.2% year-to-date.
Nationally, chemical manufacturing is at its lowest level since 2010 due to decreases in worldwide demand.

Mining, excluding oil & gas, was down in response to coal mine closures related to environmental challenges as well as
reduced coal mine production due to low utility demand and to low natural gas prices. On the bright side, petroleum
and coal products manufacturing, our third largest industrial sector, was up 6% for the quarter and is now up 6.7%
year-to-date. Our largest increase here was in SWEPCO service area, where a large refiner expanded capacity.
Other sectors showing growth are transportation equipment manufacturing, our seventh largest industry, which is up
5.3% for the quarter, related to strong U.S. auto sales, and oil and gas extraction, our ninth largest industry, which is up
2.6% for the quarter related to shale gas production.
Turning to slide eight, you can see that the company's coal capacity factors have decreased on a quarterly and
year-to-date basis, as our natural gas capacity factors have increased. Overall, our generation from natural gas has
increased approximately 50% year-to-date. For our east combined cycle units, the increase in capacity factors and
generation is even more pronounced. With the addition of the Dresden generation facility to our Waterford and
Lawrenceburg plants, our east combined cycle generation has increased 114% for the quarter and 160% for the
year-to-date period. With year-to-date capacity factors for these plants approaching 70% and with the recent increases
in the forward natural gas prices, the ability to realize incremental coal to gas switching within our eastern fleet is
minimal.
Because of the hot weather, our coal units ran more in the third quarter than in the second quarter, and our coal
inventory went from 48 days at the end of the second quarter to 45 days at the end of the third quarter. Our target is 35
to 40 days. Our coal needs for 2012 are fully hedged, and our needs for 2013 are about 92% hedged, with many units
fully hedged.
Turning to slide nine, you will find the company's balance sheet, credit and liquidity statistics through the end of the
third quarter. The balance sheet continues to reflect our conservative approach to financing the company. At the end of
the quarter total debt to total capitalization was 54.6%. In addition, our pension funding status was at 87% and includes
a contribution of $100 million made in September. Our credit statistics for the trailing 12 months remain strong, with
FFO to total debt near 20% and our interest coverage ratio at 4.8 times. In addition, our liquidity at the end of the
quarter was over $3 million and is supported by two core credit facilities with a total capacity of $3.25 billion.
Last week Moody's published their latest credit opinion on American Electric Power. This opinion positively
highlighted the company's diverse stream of cash flows and conservative financing policies, while at the same time
identifying the increased business risk due to the transition of our Ohio generated – generation to a deregulated market
in 2015. We remain committed to managing our balance sheet and credit outlook conservatively as we approach the
Ohio transition.
On page 10 you will find a number of upcoming events on our calendar through the first quarter of next year. In the
next few weeks, we plan to make filings at the FERC related to our corporate separation plans in Ohio. We believe that
making these filings this fall puts us on track to legally separate at the beginning of 2014.
These FERC filings on corporate separation will require us to evaluate the accounting recovery of our Ohio generating
assets. In the past we have evaluated the recovery of the generating assets in the east generation pool collectively as an
asset group. Prospectively, we may need to review the Ohio assets individually. Of interest are the Ohio units that we
have previously identified to you for retirement in 2015. We are currently depreciating these units to an end of life in
mid-2015, and as of the end of the quarter, those 11 units and five plants had a net book value of $284 million.
Later this year, we also plan to file with West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky to seek authority to transfer the Mitchell
and Amos capacity to Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power.
Also on the regulatory front, we do anticipate a rate order in our Indiana case by the end of the year, and we are hopeful
to get the financing orders in Ohio and West Virginia by early 2013, enabling us to proceed with about $700 million in
securitizations in the first quarter of next year.
Nick mentioned earlier in his comments about the Turk Plant becoming operational later this year, and he also
mentioned the cases that will be used to get Turk in the jurisdictional rate base as quickly as possible.

Lastly, I'm sure that we'll see many of you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. At the meeting, we
will highlight many of the drivers of financial performance of the company as well as an update on the company's
strategic initiatives. We will not be issuing guidance at that time. Once the regulatory process concludes in Ohio and
our orders are final, we plan to host an Analyst Meeting where we will address guidance, earning and dividend growth,
our regulated operations and our competitive platforms going forward.
Thank you for your time this morning. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Nick and I will be
happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Paul Fremont with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thank you very much. I guess my first question would be that you've made some really good
progress on O&M reduction. Can you talk a little bit about where the O&M reduction so far has come from, and can
you just generally talk about, based on what you've achieved already, what types of opportunity – incremental
opportunities do you think there are?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So Paul, there has been a lot of activity associated with that. Obviously, we've been
very careful as the years have gone by, and this year is no different, where we look at operating type of synergies that
exist, but also from an O&M reduction standpoint, there are things that we view as typically we have outages move in
and out, we have other things that occur as a result that changes the nature of the O&M spend. But we make sure that
those changes are sustainable going forward. It's not a matter of us not doing something and moving it into next year.
We're really focused on making sure that we're able to do it in a sustainable fashion.
So, what we really have done with the repositioning study is refocused that effort to say that we want to focus on
process changes that enable us to make sustainable O&M reductions in the future. And the teams have focused on that,
and just to give you examples, there are areas where there is reporting things that we have done internally that over the
years, reports continue to be done, they don't need to be done or they can be done in a consolidated fashion – the same
report being produced by several business units, for example. Those are synergies that we're looking at and process
changes that can occur. On the supply chain side, standardization is certainly a key for us. You'd be surprised how
many pairs of gloves, 90 different pairs of gloves that we buy. So, it's those kinds of things that we really focus on to
try to make sure that we're getting as much O&M reduction as we can, but doing it in a sustainable fashion.
Typically, I think you're going to see on a percentage basis roughly a two-thirds process-oriented reduction change, and
then when you look at changes and spans of control in terms of organizational realignment, those types of things, and
because the process review enables less resources to be performed in one area versus another, a third of that will be
more resource reduction types of activity. So, it's those kinds of trade-offs that we're seeing, but it's very focused on the
process side of things first, and then the resources fall out.
The reason why we do it that way is because we want to wind up in a situation where if we're trying to expand and
grow the transmission business, we want resources to be put in to those capital areas were transmission can be built and
also produce headroom from a rate perspective where more capital can be deployed. So that's why we're doing it, and I
think it's coming along quite well.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: And then just as a quick follow-up, in Arkansas I think you initially got a negative decision
out of the Commission, but they're giving you an opportunity to file additional testimony. When do you plan on filing
the additional testimony, and do you believe that you're going to be able to convince Arkansas that there's benefit
associated with the transaction for customers?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. We expect to get something in early December on that, and I think they've given us
an opportunity obviously, because – and we have a very good relationship with the Arkansas Commission, and

And our next question from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi. My question is on coal gas, but – and switching and the like. You mentioned you'd
reached the 70% cap factor on the CCGTs in the east and not having much room for further switching. So I guess
firstly, whether you'd expect to see some reversal of the switching dynamic in calendar 2013, given kind of forwards
and considering your contract position, which I guess is maybe less of a factor than it was this year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. Jonathan, actually we've seen switching going back the other direction. The capacity
factors of the gas units are starting to drop, the coal capacity is picking back up. For us, you get into that gas price of $3
or $3.25 per MMBtu, you're going to start that switch to, back to coal. I think for other utilities it's higher, but because
our mines are located close to the plants and they're mainly, coal comes in by the river, and we have a pretty
advantageous contracts, it certainly helps us keeping that switch-over price lower. So I think it's a very good
proposition for us, because we are able to move back and forth in that perspective, and we have the contractual ability
to adjust from that perspective as well. And it really says something good about the ongoing nature of our unregulated
business, because it will be practically two-thirds are fully controlled coal units, and as well our gas units, a third gas,
we'll be able to take advantage of those economies as well. So...
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Great. Thank you, Nick. Could I just throw in a second? Sort of timing wise, do you have
a – can you give us a sense of when on the sort of forward monthly calendar you would stop seeing year-over-year
increases in gas-fired comps? Is that sort of before yearend, or is that sometime in the first half of next year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I think certainly year-over-year from a gas standpoint, I think we'll continue to see
participation from a gas standpoint. I mean, gas prices have gone up slightly through this timeframe, but when you look
at next year, the strip is still pretty low, and you will still see coal consumption. I think you'll still see a considerable
amount of gas consumption as well. And it also depends on whether the economy comes back the way it should to fill
in the valleys.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you.

And we have a question from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Your line is open.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi Kit.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Good morning.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So a quick follow-on, Nick, your comments on, that the rising gas price now, it may have positive
– if I heard you correctly, may have positive implications for the unregulated business. Are you talking specifically
about looking at a dark spread kind of calculation there, where earnings and cash flow improve more or less directly
with gas price?

Page 9 of 14
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think certainly the dark spread will be critical in that analysis. But I also think that
because we do have advantageous coal pricing, and certainly the switchover price is lower, and we also have coal units
that participate very well in the market, that we'll have a degree of flexibility there and certainly the flexibility in our
contracting to take advantage of price swings, whether they go one way or another.
So, I think certainly from our perspective, we look at it, and our coal units are still in the money. Our gas units are
clearly in the money, because we have newer gas fired units that are high in terms of efficiency. So – and our coal
efficiency is still pretty good as well, so I think we're in a good spot there.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: All right. Good. And can you tell us a little bit more about how things are looking at BlueStar and
the retail business? I believe you said you're making money there, or they're covering their costs or something to that
effect. Can you talk to us a little bit about what kind of margins you're seeing in the retail business?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I probably can't comment on the margins, but I can tell you that we are after margins
rather than volume. But as far as the integration of BlueStar, the systems integration continues and is in a good place at
this point. And certainly from the effort placed in that business, there is a consistent philosophy of BlueStar and our
philosophy, which are one and the same today that we're participating in many markets. It's not – I mean certainly the
Ohio market is critical for us, but we're also participating in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland and others, and that's one
way in which we can hedge this generation in the future with quality contracts with customers across the board, so –
particularly in areas that we understand like PJM, MISO and so forth.
So – and like I said, they have 150,000 customers. I think that's like a 28%, 29% increase from last quarter, and they
continue to make progress. But I'm really hesitant to talk about volume increases, because once again, I think we're
focused on the margin piece.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: All right, good. Thank you very much.

Our next question from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Neil.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Good morning. This is Neil in for Michael here. So, on industrial demand, how would it have
looked in the third quarter if we were to exclude Ormet from the calculation?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. So, Brian, you have those numbers.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I do. It would obviously be slightly better. The industrial overall would drop to something
like 2% negative for the third quarter rather than the 3.1% that it was.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Okay.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, because we had primary metals, which is where Ormet is in, you still had
approximately a 9% to 10% reduction in activity on the industrial side, so – in the primary metal piece of it. Obviously
it was compensated in oil and gas activity and other things. But when you look at the industrial piece of it, we have to
be concerned that either inventories are catching up or the economy is slowing down to where they're having to drop
their consumption. So, we're certainly keeping an eye on that, particularly after the election.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: And on Ormet, I think regulators said that they can defer some of their electricity payments to
you. How should we think about the earnings impact of this deferral?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, certainly, we work together with the Ohio Commission on this and when you have a
customer in Southeast Ohio that's 500 megawatts, I guess with the two potlines off, it's 300 megawatts. But they

employ 1,000 customers, I mean 1,000 employees. So it's pretty important to the economy to keep them going, and
certainly, the Ohio Commission has stepped up with us to try to arrange a solution, a stopgap measure to keep them
going. And the deferral mechanism the Commission set up for approximately $20 million on the deferral, and that's
certainly for us, it's no earnings impact, because we're still deferring that.
<Q - Neil S. Mehta>: Got it, and last question, could you provide some color on the timing and sizing of the
securitizations in Ohio and West Virginia?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yeah. Neil, in West Virginia, we're talking about $400 million, and in Ohio we're talking
about $300 million. We anticipate getting those orders later this year, very early next year and anticipate the
securitizations for the gross amount of about $700 million in the first quarter of next year.

And our next question from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Could you talk about the impact of the accelerated depreciation on the merchant assets? I think
you said book value is $284 million, and you're depreciating, that they'll be down to zero by 2015. What's going to
happen there? I mean, is this – are these lives going to be extended when you get an order?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: No. I don't anticipate the lives will be extended. What we're going to do is, Paul, we're going
to go from a methodology where we used to look at those assets on a collective basis in the east generating pool and
now we'll need to look at them likely on an individual basis. So certainly the lives won't be extended beyond 2015,
because that's where we have to be in order to be compliant with MATS. There could be some type of impairment that
might be associated with those assets, but in any event we are depreciating them at a pretty aggressive schedule right
now and have been since late 2011 when the final MATS rule will came out.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, and this is only applies to the units that we anticipate retiring in 2015. The others are
fine.

concern on the economy et cetera. So is that 4% to 6% an aspirational goal, or should we see, given everything that's
going on, that off the 2012 base next couple of years you can actually generate 4% to 6% a year growth?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, I think as we said in February, the, that growth rate just by the invested capital in the
regulated business will support that 4% to 6% growth rate. So – and that's things that we – I think if you looked at the
capital allocation chart that we had – we used to have a chart in there that had the spend on each area. Much of that's
block and tackling and things that we have to do. So when you look at the level of that capital spend and the earnings
profile associated with that, that gets you in that 4% to 6% range. So – and then, of course, we're still working on the
transmission piece, and I'm certainly very pleased with the progression of transmission and its business case. So I think
the issue for us is to define what that base start is when we give 2013 guidance, but we fully intend on the 4% to 6%
rate to still be there, and, of course, the dividend policy to be commensurate with the earnings growth as well.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Right. Also on the transmission piece of it, you guys have laid out for us a couple of times, I think, in
your slide deck, a ramp from 12% to 15% in terms of the earnings contribution. Are those numbers still solid, are all
those projects now in hand, and you're still confident that ramp is pretty much locked in? How should we think on that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, as we said before, we're only showing projects that we know are real, and so those
numbers are still secure. And we continue to grow the transmission business, we continue to work for ways to allocate
more capital to transmission, because there is a lot of projects out there. And when we refocused this effort on the
indigenous projects within AEP and the service territory and things that need to get done to benefit reliability for our
customers, there is a lot of work to get done. So we're happy with those numbers, and you can look at those as numbers
we're going to deliver on.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And last question, I believe you guys said at the end of September customer switching in Ohio was
42%. Are the trends so far that you're seeing in switching pretty much consistent with your expectations and also
consistent with what was baked into the final ESP order?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. They're a little bit lower than we anticipated, but as this process moves forward, it's
difficult to tell how quickly it will move along, particularly when we go to auctions and other things. So it's one of
those things where there is 42% there, and there is a queue associated with people switching as well, about 8%. So it
continues to grow.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: It's a pretty aggressive switching schedule. I think some of the things that happened with the
timing of capacity orders and the like slowed that rate over the summer, but we've seen it pick up since there's been
some clarity with the recent orders that the Commission has brought.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. Thank you.

included the queue, you would have seen 45% switching. So, does that mean you guys are doing better with kind of the
net adds to end up at 42% at the end of September?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, at 42% and an additional 8% or 9% in the queue, you're at 50%, 51%. So...
<Q - Philson Yim>: Okay. So the guys in the queue in July are, haven't all been processed yet, I guess?

And our next question from the line of Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi. If I remember correctly, you all mentioned that you'd seen a reduction in usage
per residential customer this year on the order of 2%. I was wondering if you expected that to continue to decline and
possibly accelerate over the next year as the incandescent bulbs begin to be phased out.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, I think the verdict's still out on that, because there's two issues there. One is
efficiency, obviously, which Brian talked about, and the other is what happens to the economy. And it's yet to be seen
really what the true effect is. I think you can still have growth when you have energy efficiency, if you have an
economy that supports the growth. But right now the denominator continues to decrease, because you have both issues
occurring. And I fully agree with you, energy efficiency is here to stay, and I think the energy efficient appliances and
certainly bulb replacements, all those types of things will have an effect. But we don't know the effect of the economy
in the future and really the further electrification of the economy that still needs to be resolved.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: That's helpful. Can I trouble you all to comment on how the regulators at
Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power have responded to-date to your proposal to move over the Mitchell and Amos
3 plants and how you see those regulatory proceedings playing over time?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. I think those conservations are going very well. Certainly, there has been plenty of
time, based on what we've gone through the last year, for there to be a complete understanding of what we're trying to
do. The fact of a matter is, though, we're transferring over at net book something that they're already paying for, and
certainly they're assets located within the service territory. So when the states look at it, and typically in the past,
they've been focused on FRR, in other words, supplying their own needs for customers and securing a consistent supply
for – [ph] power (49:37) supply for their customers. I think these are fully controlled assets that clearly are in the
money and produce value for customers in the long-term. So those discussions have been positive.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Art.
<Q - Art Massimiani>: Just a quick question, if you could just give maybe a little bit more color on the dividend, I
know you've talked about the dividend policy focuses to be commensurate with earnings growth, and you've talked
about 4% to 6% earnings growth. Any color on the payout ratio? I know you're running towards the higher end of 60%.
With the increase in your earnings coming from the regulated, could we maybe potentially see that payout ratio go up,
or if you could just give a little bit of color on the growth?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah. Well, if you look at the, just the regulated portion, and you look at pure regulated
utilities, that ratio is higher than that, up in the 70% range. So, but that being said, our board certainly understands the
importance to our shareholders of a dividend policy that makes sense. And when we come out with the February
guidance, certainly our board will be, as they usually do, look at considerations relative to the dividend as well. So, I
would not be too concerned about us tapping out at the 60%. That's a guidance that we put in place ourselves, but we
will certainly evaluate our dividend appropriately.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Art, we'd really like to have a complete story around that in February when we talk to the
investors, and I think Nick's comments about the board being committed to rewarding our shareholders with a strong
dividend is something they've demonstrated over time, and we'd like to discuss that in more detail in February.

And our next question from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: Hi. I wanted to ask a bit more about the repositioning study and what that's going to
encompass, whether it's reviewing your cost structure or your asset mix overall.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yeah, Rajeev. So, the study is focused on several areas. Our generation side, and we're very
heartened by the evaluation there, lean management practices, those types things, over 80% of the plant people are
involved in the evaluation of the how the plant moves forward. And there are some pretty interesting things that they've
come up with. So, there are some structural changes in the way the plants operate and really the use of contractors and
things like that. So, which – that's something that they're looking at. From an IT perspective, it certainly is focused on
that piece as well. The finance piece, they're looking at their reporting obligations and all these types of things that,
where the efficiencies lie.
Certainly an organizational review is going on as well, but I wouldn't say it's an asset change. Certainly it could be
some capital deployed to make things more efficient in some manner, but most of it is process, pure process oriented,
and then looking at spans of control, looking at organizational structure alignment with the new reality of where we're
taking the business.
And – but the big issue is to make sure that whatever changes we make are sustainable for the future and with our
long-term strategy in mind. And that's – so, and that really gets us to a point where we can start to think about, as I've
said earlier, once we go through the steps of, that we've lined out in our long-term plan, to get to a point where we can
effectively optimize our asset mix to improve ROE.
<Q - Rajeev Lalwani>: Okay. And then just on the asset mix side, in terms of the unregulated side of the business, it
seems like you're still comfortable keeping that longer term, or is that subject to change if commodity prices are
weaker, capacity prices are weaker?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I think our – as I've said previously, we're going to continue to grow this competitive
business. But we are a regulated utility, and if we can make it work with long-term contracts, FERC based contracts,
long-term retail contracts, all of those types of things that make it appear to be quasi-regulated in some fashion, either
FERC regulated or otherwise, then – and if it makes sense to our shareholders to keep, we'll keep it. But I would say
