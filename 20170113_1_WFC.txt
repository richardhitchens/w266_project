I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tim Sloan.
Timothy J. Sloan
Thank you, Jim. Good morning and Happy New Year. Thank you all for joining us today. I know it's been a very busy
morning for most of you.
Our results in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with loan and deposit balances at an
all-time high, while we maintained a strong risk discipline. While the last few months of the year certainly were
challenging, I couldn't be more pleased with the hard work and progress of our team – that our team made to rebuild
trust, which I'll highlight shortly.
But first, I want to summarize our financial performance for the past year. We generated earnings of $21.9 billion and
EPS of $3.99 a share. We grew revenue by 3%, including 5% growth in net interest income. Average loans grew $64.5
billion, up 7%, and average deposits increased $56.5 billion, up 5%.
Wealth and Investment Management total client assets reached a record high of $1.7 trillion, up 7%. Our credit results
continued to be strong with a net charge-off rate of 37 basis points. We returned $12.5 billion to our shareholders
through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 76
million shares.
On page 3 we describe the progress we've made on our Retail Banking sales practices remediation plan, including
contacting our retail and small business customers and encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact us.
We established the Sales Practice Consent Order Program Office, reporting directly to our Chief Risk Officer, which is
undertaking actions to meet the requirements of the Consent Orders that were issued as part of the settlements in
September. As part of this effort, we submitted a Reimbursement and Redress Plan to the OCC and the CFPB in
December. We refunded a total of $3.2 million to customers, including the $2.6 million that was part of our original
analysis.
As part of the Consent Orders, work is now underway to expand the time periods of our review to cover the beginning
of 2011 and the period through September 2016, and we've hired an independent consultant to evaluate sales practices.
We've also gone beyond the requirements of the Sales Practice Consent Orders as part of our effort to make things right
for our customers, including a nationwide mediation program at no cost to our customers.
In addition, we've begun the data analysis to review 2009 and 2010 for potentially unauthorized accounts and we've
engaged a separate third-party consultant to evaluate sales practices more broadly across Wells Fargo. We are leaving
no stone unturned so that we can emerge from this a better, stronger company.
We've also made progress on evaluating potentially unauthorized credit card accounts, including any impact to
customers' credit scores and analysis of credit signatures to verify authorization. We want to identify anyone who is
negatively impacted so we can make things right.
We've accomplished a lot over the past few months, but we still have a lot of work to do, and we understand that it will
take continued effort and time to rebuild trust with our customers, team members and other key stakeholders.
Another important action we've taken is the recent launch of our new Retail Banking compensation program. This has
been a top priority over the past few months and is a significant step in reinforcing to our Retail Banking team
members what is expected of them, how their actions connect to our business priority of serving our customers and how
they will be rewarded for performance against these expectations.
There are five key principles to the new plan, which we highlight on page 4. First, there are no product sales goals,
which we previously ended in October. Second, we will gauge success based on customer service, increases in primary

customers, household relationship growth and risk management and not on opening new accounts. Third, this new plan
includes a strong focus on team performance with metrics heavily weighted toward team and branch goals, not just
individual goals. Fourth, we have stronger controls in place to monitor behavior and ensure we're doing things the right
way, including more proactive monitoring at the regional and corporate levels. And finally, we will be closely
monitoring results for any unintended outcomes or behaviors prompted by the new plan and we will make changes as
needed.
It will take time to communicate the plan and train thousands of team members so they understand the changes they
need to make to successfully achieve new objectives. We are also leveraging a number of new business success metrics
including primary customer growth, which measures the growth of customers that use Wells Fargo as their primary
financial institution, and household relationship balance growth to measure how Wells Fargo satisfied the broad
financial needs of our customers. We will share more details on these and other metrics during our Investor Day in
May.
The incentive plan rollout is an important step in restoring trust. This new program, coupled with our work and
redefining our service experience and training our leaders and frontline team members, will be important elements as
we continue this work. Also effective this week, as part of our annual compensation review process, we increased our
minimum hourly pay rate to a range of $13.50 to $17 an hour, a 12% increase from the previous minimum rate and
86% higher than the national minimum wage. We believe this increase is the right thing to do for our team members.
On slide 5 we provide the December customer activity in Retail Banking, which we've been updating on a monthly
basis since our last earnings call. In general, while account openings are still down from a year ago, customers continue
to actively use their accounts and many of the trends have shown improvements from the lows earlier in the fourth
quarter. Let me highlight a few of those trends in more detail.
Customers are increasingly coming into our branches, including a modest increase in banker interactions, which started
the last two weeks of November and continued through year-end. Customers continue to open more checking accounts
than they closed, and primary consumer checking customers increased 3%.
Our credit card business benefited from strong holiday spending and December had record monthly purchase volume
growing 8% from December of 2015 and active accounts were up 7%. While new applications stabilized in October,
we have not seen an increase in application volume. The decline in December compared with November reflected
normal seasonality. We have recently started to reintroduce some outbound calling and direct mail, and we will be
monitoring these results very closely.
Customer experience scores continued to improve from the lows experienced early in October, with branch customer
experience scores nearing pre-settlement levels by the end of December. While customer loyalty scores have steadily
improved since the lows in October, we still have work to do in order to return to previous highs. The improvement in
these scores reflects the outstanding job that our Retail Banking team has done by focusing on providing exceptional
customer experience.
Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts, and we've seen higher deposit and credit card balances
and increased credit and debit card transaction volume, which drives near-term revenue. The decline in rate of new
account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so we'll continue to be transparent regarding those
trends.
In addition, we're also tracking the impact to our other businesses. While businesses that are not reliant on retail banker
referrals have not been significantly impacted, lower banker referrals continue to affect businesses such as mortgage.
Referrals accounted for approximately 9% of mortgage originations in 2016, and we expect that lower referrals in the
fourth quarter will reduce funding volumes in the first quarter by approximately 2.5%.
In summary, we are pleased that the trends have stabilized and many metrics have started to show improvements.
Before turning the call over to John Shrewsberry to discuss the details of our financial results, I want to update you on
our resolution plan. We're working closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to better understand their

concerns so that we can bring our resolution planning process in line with their expectations.
Additionally, to demonstrate our commitment to the remediation of the deficiencies and the overall resolution planning
process, we have implemented actions to limit the size of our total non-bank subsidiaries' assets to the levels in place as
of September 30, 2016. We've already reduced assets to below this level as of year end and expect to operate at this
level for the foreseeable future. We are committed to remediating the two deficiencies identified by the agencies in our
revised submission that is due in March and have added significant resources to this effort.
John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results. John?
John R. Shrewsberry
Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone.
We earned $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, the 17th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion.
Our consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model that has continued to perform
well through the challenges we've faced in recent months. We had solid underlying performance in the quarter,
including a record level of loans and deposits and strong growth in net interest income.
It's important to note that our results in the quarter included a loss of $592 million or $0.07 a share from the impact of
net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. Slide 8 provides more detail on our long-term debt hedging program.
As we've previously discussed, as part of our overall asset/liability management program, we typically swap our fixed
rate long-term debt to floating rate in order to balance our deposit-oriented liability structure and better align with the
interest rate sensitivity characteristics of our assets. We also issue non-U.S. dollar long-term debt to diversify our
funding sources, and a portion of that debt is swapped to U.S. dollars.
While we believe this hedging strategy is prudent from an asset/liability management perspective, it's generally not
possible to achieve a perfect accounting hedge due to the differences in the required valuation measurement of the
hedging instrument and the hedged item. As a result, this can produce hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses from
quarter to quarter as interest and exchange rates change. However, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized over the life of
the hedging relationships is expected to be zero as long as the hedge accounting is maintained and the hedges are held
to maturity.
In 2016, we experienced significant quarterly volatility in hedge ineffectiveness due to key interest rate and foreign
currency fluctuations, including a hedge ineffectiveness gain net of related economic hedges of $379 million in the first
quarter and a net loss of $592 million in the fourth quarter. However, the 2016 full-year net hedge ineffectiveness
accounting impact on our results was a loss of only $15 million.
FASB has issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines, and new guidance is expected to be issued in 2017.
If issued in its current form, the interest rate-related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges would be
significantly reduced.
Turning to page 9, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. We had strong loan growth, up $6.3 billion from third
quarter on commercial loan growth. Consumer loans were reduced by the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of certain
previously sold reverse mortgage loans following the sale of the related servicing in the fourth quarter. Investment
securities increased $17.1 billion, with $44 billion of purchases predominantly agency MBS. The growth in these
portfolios as well as a smaller balance sheet drove the $32.3 billion decline in short-term investments and Fed funds
sold.
Deposit growth was also strong, up $30.2 billion from the third quarter, with increases in commercial, consumer, and
small business banking balances. And our short-term borrowings declined $27.9 billion, reflecting lower repurchase
balances. Credit quality remained solid, and we had a reserve release for the first time in 2016, which was $100 million
in the fourth quarter.

Turning to the income statement overview on page 10, while revenue declined from the third quarter, we had strong
growth in net interest income, up $450 million, and our NIM increased 5 basis points. Non-interest income declined
$1.2 billion, driven by net hedge ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking
results, which I will discuss later. Other sources of non-interest income were diversified and relatively stable. There are
a lot of linked-quarter changes in specific expense categories this quarter, which I will highlight later in the call. But in
total, expenses were down $53 million from the third quarter.
As shown on page 11, loans increased $6.3 billion from third quarter, with broad-based growth across many of our
commercial and consumer portfolios. Our auto portfolio was an exception, as balances declined $587 million from the
third quarter. To respond to conditions in the competitive landscape and to maintain our risk tolerances, we've tightened
our underwriting standards. Auto originations in the fourth quarter were $6.4 billion, down 21% from the third quarter
and down 15% from a year ago. We currently expect balances in our auto portfolio to continue to decline in the near
term.
On page 12, we show year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio, but our commercial growth
was strong across many businesses and asset classes, and the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of reverse mortgage loans
reduced the growth rate of our 1-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio.
As highlighted on page 13, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67.4 billion or
6% from a year ago, with growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. Consumer and small business banking
deposits increased 8% from a year ago.
Our average deposit cost increased 4 basis points from a year ago, driven by commercial deposit pricing. There was
little to no market response to the rate hike in December 2015, and we currently believe that deposit betas from the rate
hike in December 2016 will also be low, at least initially. Indications so far support this view, but we continue to
monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers while maintaining our disciplined
relationship-based pricing strategy.
Net interest income was up $450 million or 4% from the third quarter, reflecting growth in loans and investment
securities, higher interest income on trading assets, and higher income from variable sources, including periodic
dividends and fees. There was also a modest benefit from higher interest rates in the quarter. The net interest margin
increased 5 basis points from the third quarter, driven by growth in earning assets, including deployment of cash into
investments and the net benefit from higher interest rates. Income from variable sources benefited the NIM by
approximately 2 basis points.
Our growth in earning assets and the higher rate environment continued to benefit net interest income as we remain
asset sensitive. However, first quarter will reflect the impact from two fewer days and the typical linked-quarter
reduction in income from variable sources.
Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion from the third quarter, including the $592 million of net hedge
ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking fees. I've already explained the impact
from net hedge ineffectiveness, so let me highlight the drivers of our mortgage banking and trading results.
Mortgage banking results decreased $250 million from third quarter and included a $163 million decline in mortgage
servicing income, primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs. These costs increased $109 million in the
fourth quarter as a result of actions we took to work through an aged population of FHA foreclosed properties where
we've had challenges in repairing and conveying them back to HUD. As a result, we increased our estimated cost to
resolve these properties in the fourth quarter. However, we expect these actions will reduce unreimbursed servicing
costs significantly in 2017.
Residential mortgage origination volume was $72 billion, up $25 billion or 53% from a year ago and up $2 billion from
the third quarter. Applications were down 25% from the third quarter, and we ended the fourth quarter with a $30
billion unclosed pipeline, similar to our pipeline a year ago. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale
mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 13 basis points from the third quarter, primarily
due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the fourth quarter. We currently expect origination volume in the

first quarter to be roughly in line with the volume we had in the first quarter of 2016, but down from fourth quarter due
to seasonality in the purchase market and lower refi volume driven by higher interest rates.
On page 16, we provide some details on trading-related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest
income. Total trading-related revenue was down $378 million from the third quarter. Trading-related net interest
income was up $146 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher average trading asset balances, as well as $98
million from periodic dividends and carry income on certain hedged trading positions in our equity and RMBS books.
The corresponding decline in the value of these hedges was reflected as a loss in net trading activities for the revenue
neutral.
Net trading activities declined due to a $223 million decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes
compared with the strong third quarter, as well as seasonality, fewer trading days in the fourth quarter, and lower client
demand as clients adapted to the rising rate environment. While our client-focused business model typically
underperforms the market in periods of high volatility, we believe we successfully managed through the post-election
market volatility in the fourth quarter. $106 million of the decline in net trading activities was from deferred
compensation trading results, which was largely offset in employee benefits expense.
Finally, there was a $61 million decline from a change in credit valuation adjustments in the fourth quarter due to
market-driven changes in credit spreads and higher swap rates. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, total
trading-related revenue was down $27 million. On page 17, we highlight the five-quarter trend across major fee
categories. Compared with a year ago, many of our fee businesses grew, including deposit accounts, brokerage,
investment banking, card and mortgage originations. This page illustrates that while many businesses had
above-average results in the fourth quarter, total non-interest income reflected below average mortgage servicing
income and lower market sensitive revenue, which was down $526 million from a year ago.
As shown on page 18, expenses declined $53 million from the third quarter, but our efficiency ratio increased to 61.2%,
primarily driven by the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness losses on our revenue. Our efficiency ratio for the full year
was 59.3%. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level. While total expenses were relatively flat from
the third quarter, there were some meaningful changes in some specific expense items in the fourth quarter. Personnel
expenses were down $195 million from the third quarter, primarily due to lower revenue related incentive
compensation, lower deferred compensation expense and one fewer payroll day.
As a reminder, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation
and employee benefits expense. We have typically higher outside professional services equipment and advertising
expenses in the fourth quarter, and combined, these categories increased $394 million from the third quarter. This
increase was also driven by higher project spending and legal expense. Operating losses declined $334 million from
third quarter on lower litigation accruals, and all other expenses declined $116 million from third quarter, which
included a $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation.
As we highlight on page 19, we remain focused on expense management and efficiency. We've been working on a
number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018, with
the full-year benefit starting in 2019. This is not a new focus. We're just providing you with more detail on our
initiatives this quarter to reduce expenses.
We've summarized these opportunities into three categories and included the stage of completion on the right of this
page. The largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization. We've started to make changes in how we're
organized to reduce complexity and redundancy by continuing to realign staff areas including marketing, finance, and
technology. These changes should not only reduce cost, but should also enable us to more seamlessly serve customers
and team members.
We remain focused on reducing discretionary spending in areas like facilities, non-customer related travel, and
third-party spending. And as we've discussed in the past, we're also focused on selective divestitures of non-core
subscale businesses, which includes the sale of our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses last year. We
also formed the Payments, Virtual Solutions, and Innovation Group, which will accelerate our focus on delivering the

next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer
experiences and products.
While these efforts should have a meaningful impact to certain expense categories, there will not be a bottom-line
impact as these savings will be reinvested in the business. Our expense focus enables us to operate more efficiently,
generate meaningful expense savings and continue to invest to drive future growth, all while continuing to have a
strong efficiency ratio.
Let me take some time to discuss our brand strategy in more detail, which along with each and every business within
the company, is part of our focus on discretionary spending. We continuously evaluate our branch network. And while
our physical distribution strategy is driven by customer behavior, while branches continue to be a critical component in
serving our customers' needs, our investment in digital capabilities has enabled us to seamlessly serve our customers
across channels providing them with more choice and convenience in how they bank with us. And as a result, more
transactions are occurring outside the branch.
Our strategy is also influenced by geographical differences in our individual markets, economic trends and competitor
actions to close or open branches. Once external trends indicate that there's an opportunity for branch closures, we
focus on the customer impact. Additionally, we evaluate the CRA impact and branch profitability and other key criteria
to maximize expense savings and minimize revenue loss.
Based on observed trends and customer behavior, we began to accelerate branch closures in 2016 and closed 84
branches, mostly in the second half of the year. We expect the pace of branch closures to increase to 200 branches in
2017, and we expect closures at that level or slightly higher in 2018. There also continues to be opportunities for de
novos in some attractive markets.
Many of the closures this year will be in close proximity to another branch, and therefore, we don't expect a significant
revenue or team member impact. The full-year expense benefit usually occurs one to two years after the branch has
closed. We will be providing more details on our branch distribution strategy at our May Investor Day.
Turning to our business segments starting on page 21, Community Banking earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter,
down 14% from a year ago and down 15% from third quarter. The declines were primarily due to net hedging
effectiveness losses and lower mortgage banking results. We've already discussed many of the business trends within
Community Banking, so I won't go into any more details here.
Wholesale Banking earned $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 7% from the third quarter.
Revenue was $7.2 billion, up 9% from a year ago, driven by 16% growth in net interest income. Balance sheet growth
was strong with both deposits and loans at record levels. Loan growth was broad-based with average loans up $44.5
billion or 11% from a year ago, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. And we
completed the final phase of the GE Capital portfolio acquisitions in October.
Wealth and Investment Management earned $653 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 4%
from the third quarter, which was a record quarter. Fourth quarter results reflected strong balance sheet growth with net
interest income up 14% from a year ago. Average deposits were up 10% and average loans increased 11% from a year
ago, the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. WIM total client assets reached a record
high in the fourth quarter of $1.7 trillion, up 7% from a year ago, driven by higher market valuations and continued
positive net flows.
Turning to page 24, net charge-offs increased $100 million from the third quarter with 37 basis points of annualized net
charge-offs. Commercial losses were up $36 million driven by $32 million in lower recoveries. Consumer losses
increased $64 million driven by higher losses in credit card, auto and other revolving credit and installment loans due to
seasonality, higher severity in auto losses and a movement toward more normalized losses in unsecured lending.
Residential real estate portfolios continued to improve with net charge-offs down $28 million or 41% from the third
quarter. Our first mortgage loan portfolio had net recoveries in the fourth quarter and we had only 38 basis points of
loss in our junior lien portfolio.

Nonperforming assets continued to decline, down $644 million from the third quarter, with improvements across our
consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve release of $100 million reflecting
continued improvement in our residential real estate portfolio and stabilization in our oil and gas portfolio performance.
Slide 25 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings continued to decline, down 8% from the third
quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We had $177 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter with all losses
from the E&P and services sectors. Given the current environment, we continue to believe that losses peaked in the
second quarter of 2016. Nonaccrual loans were $2.4 billion, down $84 million from the third quarter, and criticized
loans declined $776 million or 11%.
Turning to page 26, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in was stable at 10.7%, well above our
internal target of 10%, which includes the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We repurchased
24.9 million common shares in the fourth quarter and entered into a $750 million forward repurchase transaction,
which settled this week for 14.7 million shares. We returned $3 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through
common stock dividends and net share repurchases.
The final TLAC rule was issued in December and becomes effective on January 1, 2019. We estimate that as of
December 31, 2016, we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $18 billion in order to
be compliant. This shortfall is lower than our previous estimates, which were based on the proposed rule, due primarily
to the grandfathering of existing debt governed under foreign law in the final rule. It also was impacted by lower RWA
levels at year-end. However, the removal of the phase-in period in the final rule will result in a modest acceleration of
our issuance plan. We issued a total of $32 billion of qualifying TLAC in 2016, and we currently expect issuance in
2017 will be at a similar level to fund both maturities and our targeted build of qualifying debt.
In summary, our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated solid underlying performance as we continued to meet our
customers' financial needs. We had record levels of loans, deposits and client assets. Our credit quality, liquidity and
capital all remain strong. We once again earned more than $5 billion in the quarter, demonstrating the benefit of our
diversified business model, which continued to perform well during a period where we faced unique challenges.
It's been only four months since we signed the sales practices consent orders, but we've already made progress in
restoring customers' and team members' trust, and we remain committed to being transparent with investors. While
there is still more work to do, we're confident that we will build a better Wells Fargo that will continue to meet our
customers' financial needs, benefit the communities we serve, and provide opportunities for our team members and
investors.
And we can now take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: John, how are you? I wanted to ask about the rate sensitivity profile, John. I was
wondering if there's been any change in the core rate sensitivity. And could you remind us what kind of benefit you get
from the Fed hike that we got in December?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure. So we're still in – I think we're in the 5% to 15% range, which is what we talked
about the last time our Treasurer, Neal Blinde, presented more broadly. That hasn't really changed very much. I think
we've estimated that the quarterly impact – a full quarterly impact of 25 basis point parallel shift, which is different
than what we got in December, although arguably, we got more than that on the long end, is worth on the order of $150

million per quarter. And that estimation still holds as well.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: I know you put some swaps on in maybe 2015 it was, what's muted, what would've
been your maybe natural asset sensitivity. Just wondering, as maybe you're thinking about the rate environment
evolves, are you able to get out of that and adapt that? Or is that locked in for a few years? How's that...
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Those hedges will be in place for a few years. They're captured in this calculation of our
rate sensitivity. And so, if you think about LIBOR-based commercial loan as the hedged item there, those won't float
up. And that incremental benefit won't be passed along in the near term as a result of the choice to fix those out and to
earn higher interest income in previous periods and to change their profile. So that's not where the benefit would come
from. It's under floating rate loans. It's incremental floating rate loans in those categories that haven't been hedged. But
that program was a result of a specific decision to reduce interest rate sensitivity in a period that felt lower for longer,
and it will be other assets that float up that create a benefit on the short end.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. I guess your sensitivity also will come from your liquidity deployment. It looks
like you put some to work this quarter with the Fed funds sold down $30 billion. I know you get asked this all the time,
but is there a way for us to think about how much of that $270 billion or so of liquidity is kind of deployable, flexible
dry powder versus kind of needed to meet the various liquidity and other requirements?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah, I think we're sticking with the tens of billions at any point in time as incrementally
deployable. This relationship between the liquidity value of whatever we might be incrementally investing in, and there
are limitations, as you know, on certain – the definitions of certain assets as either high quality liquid assets or not. And
then there's the capital impact of moving too far off the curve and increasing our exposure to diminish in OCI in a
rising rate environment. So there are lot of trade-offs to be made. We're making them all the time with that same
outcome in mind that you're curious about. We will be deploying more in a higher rate entry point, but subject to those
constraints of what it means for capital and what it means for liquidity versus holding cash.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thanks.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: I think people – hi, Tim and John. I think people are really appreciative of the incremental –
just putting a number around the work you're already doing on the cost side. You did, however, mention that you
expect to reinvest it. And so I was wondering if you could help us understand your comments just about the efficiency
ratio remaining high. Does that mean high relative to your historical 55% – 59% range, or does it mean high end? And
just how would you help us understand just how you get from point A to point B and how we start to see efficiency
improvement over time?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. So, John, I'll start and then jump in. I think, Ken, the efficiency ratio metrics that we set
out at our Investor Day last year are really guidelines for us to operate in, in the environment that we expected if we
turn the clock back to last May. And we think the 55% to 59% range is best in class in the industry and the range that
we're expecting to operate in for the next couple of years. Things have changed, clearly, and expectations have
changed. But the efficiency ratio is a function of not only your expense rate, but also revenue growth. And we're
hopeful that we'll continue to grow revenue over time as we did over the last year in 2016.
And our guidance is that in the short term, as revenue continues to grow and we continue to have some headwinds from
an expense standpoint, and first quarter is going to be a good example of that because we'll have some impact from

annual incentive compensation impact and so on, that we're going to be at a high end. And again, we think about the
expense ratio – or efficiency ratio, excuse me, not on a quarterly basis but as much year over year. So our expectation
for 2017 is that we'll probably be at the high end of that range.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: And the only thing I'd add, and this is implied, but to the extent that we're getting
revenue increases from interest income, then that's substantially more efficient in terms of dollars of expense per dollar
of revenue than most sources of non-interest income. So there should be a lift if we're getting it in interest income.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: That's great, John, and that's actually my follow-up as well, is that you do seem to have a
decent path towards NII growth from the factors that you've talked about and to John's questions before. Can you talk
about just some of the moving parts inside fees and in terms of how those businesses feel? The brokerage business has
flattened out, but maybe hopefully it's turned the corner. And then obviously, there's the mortgage side of things, which
obviously with rates on unclosed pipelines down a little bit. So what drives fee growth as you look ahead? Where do
you see the most opportunities, and what are the things that we have to just be mindful of?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Sure, the big source is, setting mortgage aside because we talked about it a little bit in
the prepared comments, and I think you just nailed it, we're in a lower point in the refi cycle. So it's really about getting
after the purchase needs of our customers and then those refis that do come up. But applications are down across the
industry, and I think people expect that in general. So what that yields will depend on the path of where rates go, how
jobs are formed, and what the demand is for homebuying.
And our other big source is deposit, deposit service charges. Our customers are using our products more than ever, so
we've had good growth in debit card, and we'll continue to work there. Now we continue to attract new customers to the
bank in order for that to grow like it has in the past. But that is an area of focus for Mary [Mack] as she launches her
new program in Community Banking. And of course, a lot of that also comes from the commercial side of things,
where we're a leader in providing treasury management services to our corporate customers as well. And that's been a
growing business for us over the last several years.
On the card side, new credit card applications are down, but for the cards that we have out there and the cards that we
are originating now, people are using them more. They're transacting more, they're spending more, their balances are
higher, et cetera. So those have driven good sources.
And then with respect to brokerage, obviously we're at high market levels right now, so we expect good fees from that
as well as institutional asset management. But with David Carroll's team's focus on meeting the saving for retirement
and investing needs of all of our banking customers, my sense is that there continues to be an opportunity there also.
We have to execute along all of those dimensions, but there's a real path forward.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I would just reinforce the opportunity we have in Wealth and Investment Management. As
John said, David and the team did a terrific job last year. And when you think about growing that business 10% year
over year and we just couldn't be more pleased with their performance.

<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: I just wanted to get some clarification on the response to Ken's question. I guess as we think
about the reduction of expenses and investing it back by year-end 2018, does that mean that the expense base on an
absolute basis could potentially be flattish in 2018, or is that too simplistic to think about because we really have to
think about the revenue side as well? I was just trying to think about whether or not we should think about the $2
billion as something that can self-fund investments in 2018, or we really should be going back to the 55% to 59%
efficiency ratio guidance.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I would stick with the latter.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I would too.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Because you never know where a dollar of revenue is going to come from. And
especially on the non-interest income side, the mix matters in terms of what its related expenses are. And so I wouldn't
be predicting a couple years forward what that mix is going to look like or what the associated expense impact is going
to look like at the margin from a dollar of one sort of non-interest income versus another. I would think about it as these
are undertakings that we have going on to accomplish all of our incremental spending and still stay in 55% to 59% on
an annual basis.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: And just to clarify, it sounds like if we do get a structurally higher curve, like you've said in
previous calls, that could really drive the path to the middle or lower end of that 55% to 59% efficiency ratio target.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Over time. But again, Erika, it's a function of so many other different variables, not just
interest rates but just fundamental economic growth. If the economy grows at 3%, it's better than 2%. That means loan
growth is going to be higher and maybe other activity will be higher. I would just reinforce John's comment to just
think about that 55% to 59% that we're going to save a lot of money here at Wells Fargo, and we're going to reinvest
that business for the long term that will pay benefits well beyond the next couple years.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I do think it's reasonable though to say to get to the lower end of the range, it's going to
be because of the impact of higher rates on interest income.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. And just if I could squeeze one last question in here, in the back of the retail sales
issue, there has been a lot of focus on new account openings. And I guess I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of
whether or not the profitability of your primary customer has really been impacted by the scandal. Because I guess as
I've been talking to investors about this, does new account opening really matter if that credit card was not being used
anyway or was sitting in a drawer? I guess I'm wondering if we could – I know you've given a lot of detail already, but
I'm wondering if the new account opening statistics overstate what the revenue impact to your primary customer is
from the retail sales scandal.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It's a good question, and I think the short answer is it's too new to tell. The value of a
relationship tends to increase over time. And generally, relationships are a little bit less profitable at the beginning than
they might be two years from now and four years from now and five years from now. So I don't mean not to ask your
extra question, by the way, Erika, so we'll have to reduce your questions next quarter, but the fact of the matter is, is
that I think it's just too early to tell. We're just excited that we saw what seems to be an inflection point in the midst of
the fourth quarter. And so we're starting to see some real positive attributes in some of those metrics not only in terms
of accounts activity, but also in terms of customer service and experience.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Hi.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: I wanted to follow up on a comment earlier. I think you said – I just want to make
sure I didn't hear it incorrectly, but have you promised to keep the absolute size of your balance sheet at the 9/30 level?
Is that the entire balance sheet, or is that just a segment? Did I miss something there?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: No, what we've said is that we'll keep our non-bank subsidiary balance sheet at the 9/30
level, and that accounts for probably 10% of our overall balance sheet.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. All right. So from my point of view, not that big of a deal. All right. It's been
a busy day.
Just separately, you guys have talked about that there's a third-party review of all layers of management into the sales
practices and kind of what was known, what wasn't known. There was an article I think this past weekend just talking
about emails being reviewed. I can appreciate that takes a very long time for a firm of your size, but any thoughts on
when that would be concluded? And when and how it would be communicated to investors and analysts?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Think of the review in terms of sales practices in two parts. One, there's a requirement under
the consent orders with the OCC and the CFPB to have a third-party consultant come in and take a look at sales
practices primarily in our retail-related businesses. And so, that's just begun. My guess is that will take the good part of
this year to accomplish.
And then separately, because – as I said in my earlier remarks, we want to leave no stone unturned here, we've said that
we're – and we have brought in a separate consultant to look at sales practices across other businesses within the
company. And my guess, it will take much of this year to complete that work. And if we find something that's
important, we'll communicate that, but if nothing happens, we may not communicate it. But we'll take it as it comes.
But I think given our desire to be very transparent, we'll probably err on the side of over-communicating as opposed
under-communicating, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay, that's appreciated. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: The – back to the sales practice issue, given that you're seeing some turn, some inflection here
that you cited in some of these metrics and everything, are you in any better position to help quantify what you would
say would be the all-in recurring financial impact of the issue, both with the foregone revenue as well as the related
expense impact from this?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: No, I would say not, but John, jump in if you feel differently, just because we're, you know,
this has been going on for just the last quarter or so. And while we're pleased with what we think is hopefully an
inflection point, we may have months over the next few months where things turn the other way. Again, for a month,
but what we're really focused on is the long-term trend. In the short term, the revenue impact has not been significant,
but we want to be careful about that is that to the extent that we're growing primary checking accounts at 3% instead of
5%, over time that would have a bigger impact. So I would still put it in the category of too new to rate.

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: One specific I can add is that I'd estimate for the next several quarters, we're probably at
$40 million, $50 million this quarter of outside professional service fees, which includes the third parties...
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Incremental.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Incremental.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yeah.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Which includes the reviewing third parties and law firms as well. And that probably
grows a little bit and then tails off. So that's incremental.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. All right. Thank you. Then separately, I know you were alluding to this a little bit earlier
with the asset sensitivity questions, but I just wanted to see if I can get some thoughts on your NIM trajectory here in
coming quarters. Just given the TLAC pace now is going to be a little bit quicker, I mean that's a negative drag, but also
you've got the impact of the rate hike. So how would you be thinking about the trajectory of the margin here through
2017?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So I'd rather talk about it in dollars, if those are useful to you because NIM is really an
outcome and we can't predict what exactly is going to happen with deposit flows, et cetera. But just to put a dollar sign
on it, if we don't get any more moves by the Fed in 2017 – and I anticipate that we might – but if we didn't, given that
the pace of TLAC issuance that you mentioned, given the balance sheet positioning today, given what we might expect
from loan growth, what we could imagine from redeployment, et cetera, we're – it's pretty easy to sketch out a 4%, 5%,
6% net interest income growth trajectory full year 2017 over full year 2016. What that means for NIM because of what
the balances are that are applied to that is a little harder to pin down. Is that helpful?

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah. Thank you very much. You talked about in the beginning of the call that you've gone all
the way back to 2011, but I know there's been some discussion from – in the media and some politicians of going back
farther than that. Are the regulators good with you going as far back in 2011? Or do you need to go back farther later
on?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So, Paul, good question, and let me clarify. Under the consent orders, we're required to go
back a little bit earlier in 2011 than we had previously done and then bring forward the analysis to September of 2016
to the date more or less that we had signed the consent orders. That's the regulatory requirement. We've decided, right –
this is the management of the company, not any third parties located anywhere else around the country – have decided
that we think it's appropriate to go back and look at 2009 and 2010. That's something that we announced in late
September, October, and so we're in the midst of doing that. But think about that as a separate effort outside of the
consent order requirements to make things right for our customers.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay, so 2011 is a consent order. You're willing go back as far as 2009. And if you've had
discussions with people on Congress who were asking you guys to go back even further on that, is that – does that
satisfy their needs?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, I'll leave satisfaction rates in Congress to them. We think that it's important to go back
and look at 2009 and 2010. We picked that timeframe because that's when we put Wells Fargo and Wachovia together.
And we think that's right from our perspective. It's well beyond the requirements that our regulators set for us, and so
we're in the midst of doing that.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then my follow-up question, and I did ask this to Jamie Dimon, but I was wondering what
your thoughts of it. On the mortgage world, the credit box is really, really continued to be tight and you heard a lot of
the new administration guys talking about opening up the credit box. Can they open up the credit box effectively? And
what do you guys want to hear for you guys to start going down and opening up the credit box in the mortgage world?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It's a good question. We think it's very important to continuing to provide a broad suite of
mortgage options to our customers. And we think we do that better than anybody in the industry. We've got the number
one share and we're satisfying customers every day. There's no question that there have been certain rules and
regulations that have been promulgated over the last eight years which have impacted and provided some concern in
the industry, not just with big banks, in terms of how we provide credit. Some of it's related to the fact that we all were
part of servicing settlements that went back decades almost, which were a surprise to everybody. So I think the more
that there can be clarification – and FHA is a great example – the more that there can be clarification on any uncertainty
in the future the better.
Having said that, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made and the performance of our yourFirst Mortgage
product, which is focused on first-time homebuyers. The volumes have exceeded our expectations and so we're just
really pleased with the fact that we've had a very strong origination year and the credit quality within the mortgage
businesses has just continued to exceed our expectations. As John noted in his remarks, we had that recoveries in our
fourth quarter from our first mortgage business. So we're really pleased with the position that we have in the mortgage
business. We're hopeful that the new administration can continue to provide clarifications in terms of that business and
we look forward to working with them.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Two things I'd add, we're not looking for a way to put lower credit quality first
mortgages on our balance sheet. So if there are others who are looking for loosening the box for that outcome, I don't
think that that would apply here. And as it relates broadly to tightening the credit box as a result of the financial crisis,
it's really about underwriting the ability to repay. And that's what's constraining how much money people can borrow
and whether they can borrow, and it's a reasonable requirement. And that's how we're operating. So customers have to
be able to provide evidence of their ability to repay. So more jobs, et cetera, advances that cause versus making it –
lowering the requirement for the ability to repay.

remaining high, towards the high end of the range near term, what assumptions do you have baked in for rate hikes?
And when you're defining rate, I'm presuming near term – I'm presuming you're thinking 2017?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yeah. So in our own internal analysis, there's one in the middle of the year and one at the
end of the year. So not much in terms of the short-end of the curve providing incremental interest income in that
calculation.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Great. And so then this whole notion of the $2 billion savings that you're talking about,
that's going to come over the course of the 2017-2018, and then the investments also coming during the same
timeframe. Is there any kind of timing differences on those, or that's all supposed to be at the same time?

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: At the same time. It's sort of self-funded at the same time.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Timothy, a completely different question. Living will, what went wrong with that? And
the changes that you have to make, what kinds of implications will that have for you in terms of your numbers?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, so fair question. The focus of the regulators on our resubmission that we made last fall
related to legal entities and shared services. And so what we're in the midst of doing is having, as I mentioned, some
very good quality meetings with the regulators to make sure that we appreciate what their expectations are, and focused
on providing more detail to them in terms of how we manage risk related to all of our legal entities, and then how we,
our shared services would operate in the midst of a catastrophe at Wells Fargo. Actually, we don't think that's going to
occur. And so we've redoubled our efforts there. We've added some additional folks and additional resources, and we're
going to work very hard and improve the quality of our submission, which is due at the end of March. I don't
fundamentally believe that it's going to affect our ability to serve our customers and rebuild trust in any way, shape or
form. But we were disappointed, and we've got to make some improvements and we'll do it.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: And will that legal entity change, would that make any changes to your funding, your liquidity,
any of that, any comment, any color on that at this point?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, at the margin, it might impact some things, but not materially, Vivek.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: There might be some pre-positioning of capital liquidity into various entities. But from
your perspective, it wouldn't have a meaningful difference.
<Q - Vivek Juneja>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: You're welcome.

Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hey, Marty.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Thanks. Hey. Had a couple of little more micro small issues, and then had a big question for
you, Tim, at the end. We're looking at the servicing. Usually the servicing fees would kick in when rates started to go
up. However, you had that un-reimbursable cost. Your servicing fees dropped down to 18 basis points was about the
lowest I've seen. That is a temporary and should rebound back to a more normal 20-ish type of basis points going
forward. I think I heard you say that.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So servicing fees that are coming off of the unpaid principal balance of our servicing
portfolio will track how big the servicing portfolio is. And it has shrunk over time as prepayments have been frankly
faster than our share of the origination market as we've exited different types of businesses to de-risk both our mortgage
origination as well as our mortgage servicing business, like the reverse mortgage portfolio we sold this quarter for $4
billion of unpaid principal balance, like several of these origination programs that we deemed higher risk over time. So
the notional that is driving the contractual servicing fee stream has been coming down. And as you'd expect, we think
it'll stabilize now because prepayments could slow to a halt or creep in a higher rate environment.
But as you say, in a higher rate environment, we'd also expect that the float's worth more as we have escrows in taxes
and insurance and other things. Those are worth more to us in a higher rate environment than a lower rate environment.
And that should start to work its way in over time. And then specifically on unreimbursed foreclosure costs, on the one
hand, we're working down the long-term cyclical mound of foreclosed properties, et cetera, that need to be worked out
of the system, we're originating those types of loans, FHA loans, in particular, at a much slower pace than we were
previously. And now we've taken this step where we've taken charges in Q4 that we think are really going to reduce the
rate of that expense in 2017. So I would expect servicing revenue in general to be meaningfully positively impacted by

that last piece, in particular.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: And then when you look at the hedge ineffectiveness related to your long-term debt, I would
assume that the credit spread compares, in other words, the real basis risk change was your credit spread gapped out
with the reputational issues that you're working through right now in the marketplace, and that drove a large part of this
negative. So that would be an unusual in this particular quarter. Would that be correct?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I don't think that's as big a driver as you think. It's really a portion of it because you're
discounting that leg of the hedged relationship with a credit spread in it and the swap leg you're not. But it has more to
do with the direction of rates and the amount of the uptick in the swap rate over a short period of time than our spreads.
You can see the impact of our spreads in Q3 versus Q4 in our net CVA outcomes on the trading side of things because
we generated positive P&L in the third quarter from our own spreads gapping out, and then we didn't have that in the
fourth quarter. But those are relatively small numbers for Wells Fargo.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: Okay. And then, Tim, the big question is, Mary Mack is going around now, and you said talked
to 3,000 team members. Is the environment such that if she had done that a year ago or two years ago, nobody would
really want to step up and say anything bad about the company because everybody was thinking of it as such a
high-performing institution. Is the flow of information freeing up so you're getting some really good information and
ways to improve along a lot of different lines with these town hall meetings?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Absolutely, Marty. And that's part of the – when we think about rebuilding trust at the
company, rebuilding trust is not only with external stakeholders, but candidly is a primary focus with 268,000 team
members. If we don't rebuild trust with all of them, then we've got bigger issues. And I think Mary's outreach in terms
of her town halls, and she's been tireless in terms of these town halls, is very important. And many of the other senior
leaders within the company have had similar town halls and who have been out there more than we've ever been talking
to our team members.
And the way that we're getting feedback from our team is not just through those town halls, but also through requests
that we make to them through surveys. And we're getting all kinds of great ideas in terms of how to improve Wells
Fargo, and many of them that we're implementing. So I'm really pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of
our internal communication, and we're seeing that in terms of some of the feedback that we're getting from our team
members. And then that translates into better service for our customers. Personally, I think that's one of the drivers. I
mentioned that in my earlier remarks in terms of the improvement in the customer experience scores in retail. I just
couldn't be more pleased with that performance given the circumstances.
<Q - Marty Mosby>: I appreciate that, Tom (sic) [Tim].

Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Good morning, guys. Tim, I think you touched on that you raised the wages of your lower
wage workers well above the federal minimum wage. Can you share with us what that will do for compensation
expenses in 2017? I know seasonally, first quarter everybody has the uptick in employment expenses, but what will that
do for expenses this year?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: So a fair question, and I'll give you an answer that's probably a little bit frustrating, so I
apologize in advance. And that is that we don't really look at it that way because one of the reasons why we wanted to
increase the minimum levels of compensation is that we want some other positive outcomes, so outcomes like lower

turnover. And that could have a net impact and would have a net impact, and we think it will have a net impact on
whatever the expense number might be. Lower turnover means lower training costs. It means higher productivity
because you've got more experienced bankers, tellers, service folks that are working with our customers. So net-net
over time, making this decision we think is a net positive for the company. So we really don't look at it as gosh, it's
going to have this kind of impact in a certain period of time because the other outcomes that I mentioned aren't really
known until we look back a year from now.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Fair enough. And then I guess the follow-up question is, can you guys give us some color on
how the GECC acquisition is performing, how the integration has gone? Have you been very pleased with it? And just
some color there.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure. Any acquisition and integration is complicated. And so my answer will not do justice to
the incredible amount of hard work and effort to all of the hundreds of people, if not thousands of people within the
company that have been working hard on that integration. But overall, I would tell you it has exceeded our
expectations. The quality of team members that we were able to bring on from GE has just been very impressive. Their
engagement in the business and how happy they are to be part of Wells Fargo is very encouraging.
The quality of the customer base that we were able to bring on has exceeded our expectation, and those customers are
doing more business with us. And one of the opportunities that we have over time is to broaden those relationships
because GECC, which was a terrific lender, was just that, a lender, and we have other products and services that we can
provide to that customer base. So if this is a nine-inning game, the first inning we put some points on the board and
scored some runs, and hopefully we'll continue to do that. But again, long answer to your question, so far, so good.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: I appreciate the color. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Hi, thank you. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Good morning. I wanted to discuss the branch rationalization strategy a little bit and what the
thought process is there, especially the thought process around the 200 branches. You have a slide where you have
some bullets around some of the factors that you consider when you close a branch. But when I look at that number, it's
about 3% of your branch network, the 200 figure. You've closed fewer branches than perhaps some of your peers have
in recent years. I guess the bigger question is whether you can do a little bit more there and whether you can pull the
cost lever harder through a bit more aggressive branch rationalization. So I just wanted to go through the branch
strategy and how you think about that and what some of the factors are in determining that 200 figure per year.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I'll start and, John, jump in. It's a great question. What you saw last year is us increasing the
pace of branch rationalization. So that 80-plus that we closed last year, most of that was in the second half. And what
that's reflecting is us listening to our customers in terms of how they want to do business with us. They still want to
come into branches, but they also are accessing us via online and mobile and through ATMs and on the phone. And so
our strategy is really based upon listening to customers and looking at their habits and how they want to interact with
us. And based upon that, we think it makes sense. Mary has had an opportunity to oversee the business for the last six
months. And what we've concluded is that we should increase the pace of rationalization to about 200 this year.
I wouldn't describe that as our long-term branch strategy because again, it's really a function of reactions and habits
from our customers. We may increase, we may decrease, who knows? It's going to be based upon how they want to do
business with us. But what we're seeing right now is it leads us to the conclusion to be focused on that 200 branch
number for the year.

<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: I think that's right. And we'll continue to – there will be a feedback loop from this
process to see how customers react to it, whether we're right or wrong about customer attrition, deposit attrition, or
other things that we're trying to minimize by taking the strategy that we're taking. And if six months into this we think
there's an opportunity to do more, then we'll come back and we'll do that.
And we'll talk in some more detail at our May Investor Day about the process that we use to analyze this, why we think
this is the right approach to take, some of the idiosyncrasies of our branch footprint versus the others that you're
familiar with just in terms of owned, leased, cost to operate, et cetera. We've got branches, a lot of them as you might
know, in very low-cost locations. And so the expense pickup that you might be imagining may not be exactly the same
as if they were all in coastal communities or major metropolitan areas, et cetera. There's a lot of differences from one to
the other. But this is the beginning of a process where we're picking up. And the whole time, customers will be
reflecting in their use of physical versus virtual how much they value coming into our branches, and we can keep
feeding that back.
<Q - Saul Martinez>: Great, that's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier question. What proportion of your
employees are affected by the minimum wage hike? Do you have that figure?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: It's about 26,000 people.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi. How are you? Just two questions, please. One is, you mentioned the tightening of some
of your underwriting standards in portions of the auto portfolio. Could you just maybe give us a little insight into what
you were doing and where, whether it's in the credit spectrum, or new versus used, or how that's playing out?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Yes, so what we've been holding fast on term, I think we've talked about this with this
group before, but there's between leasing as a competitive product or just other lender's willingness to go to seven years
and beyond more frequently than we are, that has caused us to lose some volumes, sticking by that. And the other two
areas, I think, are proof of income on the one hand, which is part of how we try to underwrite credit, and then back to
ability to repay. You mentioned new versus used, because we're not attached to a manufacturer and we don't have a
leasing program, we do are disproportionately a used car lender. And so these are criteria that are meaningful to us.
And at this part of the cycle, it's causing us to lose volume.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. Okay, thank you for that. And just, I know there's been many, many questions on
OpEx, but I'm afraid I'm still a little confused. I understand certainly where you're coming out in terms of the efficiency
ratio. But just in absolute dollar terms relative to the roughly $52.4 billion that you had in 2016, how should we think
about that figure in absolute terms for this year?
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So the way that I would think about it is thinking about it from the expense ratio. And I
know it's a little bit frustrating because again, one of the reasons why we think about expenses here is part of that
efficiency ratio, is it's very much a function of revenue opportunities. And depending upon which business is
generating those revenue opportunities or which products, some of them have higher or lower expenses associated with
them. But the way that I would think about that $2 billion, is we're going to save that $2 billion over the next couple of
years, and then we're going to reinvest it in the business.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. Thank you very much for the clarity.

Our final question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Good morning, Nancy.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. I guess my – this sort of tags on to Gerard's question, I guess. But in
looking at your new compensation scheme and the fact that it's fairly new, I mean, how confident are you in sort of
projecting, accruing, et cetera for comp expenses this year? Were you able to beta test this at all or is there sort of wide
variability in where the numbers can come out?
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Well, we were able to test it somewhat, Nancy. But as you can appreciate, the timeframe that
we had was a little bit shorter than we'd normally have liked.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: I don't want to give you the impression that we're always changing incentive compensation
plans for tens of thousands of people in 90 days. So there's some risk in – that we didn't get it completely right, and
that's one of the reasons why I wanted to reinforce the point that we're going to be watching this very closely. And to
the extent that we need to make some changes, we're not going to wait for a year from now; we'll make some changes.
But when I think about the fundamentals of the plan, they were reviewed by Mary and team. We had a lot of
discussions with the retail folks. We had it reviewed by our risk folks and HR folks and the likes. And just the
fundamentals of basing it on customer service, increasing in primary accounts and household growth, I mean, those are
all measurable items. So we're not really concerned about having the accruals correct or incorrect. And they're all very
important drivers for growth in relationships and in return, satisfied customers, and then that'll translate into revenue
growth over time.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And secondly, there was another piece of news in the last couple days where you've
gotten a letter, I think, from some members of Congress about the growth in overdraft charges and whether this is
somehow linked to the rest of the issue. So if you could just address that whole overdraft issue, I'd appreciate it.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Sure, so I'll start. John, jump in. I'm actually waiting to get the letter, so you've read about it
before I've actually received it. But my understanding is that it was based upon some earlier reporting regarding
year-to-year increases. Recall that in 2014, we made a number of changes in terms of how we provide information to
our customers, how we process payments and deposits, and debits and credits and the like, which meant that our
overdraft income actually declined in 2015 to 2014. And so the year-over-year, again, three quarters to three quarters
comparison you're seeing, 2016 to 2015 is a reflection of the changes we made in 2014, revenue decline in 2015, and
then growing off that number. And the reason it's growing is not because there's anything nefarious that we're doing or
it's part of any sort of retail sales practices issue, it's just a reflection of the fact that we're seeing growth in our
customer base, and we're seeing more customer activity. We think maybe our competitors are making some of the
changes that we made a year later, and so maybe that's impacting some of their overdraft revenue. But I'll be responsive
to the letter when I get it, and we'll continue to provide the right services to our customer base.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So just a little bit more color on that.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: Yes, please. Yeah.
<A - John R. Shrewsberry>: So we don't have the largest overdraft revenue base among larger banks. As Tim said,
we made this change, and specifically, the change that we made was to post to customers online and mobile account

picture, items that were being received throughout the course of the day that we're going to post overnight in a batch so
that they have that information before making a determination about whether to overdraft or not. We implemented that
at the end of 2014 and from 2014 to 2015, and that's good for customers. It was on purpose. It was intended to give
people more information to make better decisions about what to do with their money, and we dropped in overdraft
revenue from 2014 to 2015.
And then as Tim said, because the business has grown, because people have gotten used to that information, and made
different decisions about how they want to run their lives, we picked back up from 2015 to 2016. We're flat from 2014
to 2016. As we understand it, our peers adopted that similar customer-friendly technology a year later. And so the point
of comparison that is available now is their year of adoption versus the period right afterward when customers can react
to that information. So it's a little bit of apples-and-oranges. But our fee levels, our frequency of charging, et cetera, are
right in the middle of the fairway compared to the competitive set. There's nothing different about Wells Fargo's
approach to that activity.
<A - Timothy J. Sloan>: And, Nancy, the more that we can provide information to our customers so that they can
make good decisions about how to manage their money, the better. And we're going to continue to look at ways in
which we can use technology, particularly through mobile, to provide that information, so it's much more
customer-friendly to them.
