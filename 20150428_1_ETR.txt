MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Entergy First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release and Teleconference.
[Operator Instructions] I would like introduce your host for today's conference, Mrs. Paula Waters, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Paula Waters
Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We'll begin today with comments from our Entergy's Chairman and CEO,
Leo Denault, and then Drew Marsh, our CFO, will review results. In an effort to accommodate everyone with questions
this morning, we request that each person ask no more than two questions.
In today's call, management will make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these risks and uncertainties is included in the company's SEC filings.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Leo.
Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. 2015 is an important year for Entergy because it will be one in which
we continue to execute the strategy that we have been pursuing for some time.

As we report results for the first quarter, I'd like to start by putting the progress we've made in some perspective. Two
years ago, we laid out an ambitious agenda for the future we wanted to create, one in which Entergy was growing
because our communities and customers were prospering. One goal in that agenda was to deliver stability and
efficiency by maintaining solid financial footing and by making Entergy a more nimble organization, one more aligned
with the changing energy landscape. To that end, we joined MISO and also began the process transforming the way we
work by removing costs from our business and aligning talent and resources with strategic company imperatives.
Another goal was to provide clarity, a well-defined path forward identifying what business initiatives the company
would focus on and a timeline for execution. We accomplished this by first articulating our vision and mission for the
future simply but precisely. We filed and concluded several major regulatory proceedings, including four rate cases,
representing 80% of utility retail sales, which provide clarity on future earnings opportunities. We also ended our
efforts to spin off and merge our transmission assets to ITC.
Finally, we said that our well-defined path would focus on seven major strategic imperatives, which we refined down
to: growing the utility business and managing risk and preserving optionality at Entergy Wholesale Commodities. As
many of you may recall from our Analyst Day presentation last June, we outlined our plans to achieve these
imperatives. Over the past year, we have continued to provide greater detail as to how we intend to capture the
opportunities available to us and today the picture is much more complete. We have filled in details of what we aim to
achieve, how we will achieve it, and a timeline for execution.
In terms of performance, results, and growth, we continue to be in line with our expectations. In the near term, financial
results for the first quarter of 2015 include operational earnings of $1.68 per share. That's a strong start to the year, and
while it's still early, it is clearly in line with our expectations for full year results. Drew will elaborate on this in a few
minutes.
On our strategic efforts, a brief look back confirms the soundness of a number of the business decisions we made over
the past two years, many in partnership with our regulators. For example, joining MISO has proved enormously
beneficial to our customers. In the first year alone, customers across the utility realized nearly $240 million in
energy-related savings, exceeding expectations. Consistent with our expectations, the utility also realized substantial
capacity-related savings due to the lower reserve margin required within MISO's larger footprint.
With an industrial renaissance underway in the Gulf South region fueled by low natural gas and electricity prices, it
became clear that Entergy's utility business was well positioned to capture an enormous growth opportunity. In order to
meet this opportunity, we expanded the number of people dedicated to growing our industrial customer base. This team
laid out a detailed map of where the opportunities would likely materialize and develop customized strategies to serve
these new and existing customers.
Through an effective partnership with state and local officials, we have worked tirelessly to help attract industrial
customers to the region, and as of March 2015, the Entergy utility business has experienced seven straight quarters of
industrial sales growth. As we said we would, we are leveraging this opportunity this industrial renaissance provides to
keep our customer rates low while modernizing our operations, strengthening reliability and growing rate base.
Some important examples of this include our announcement last year to purchase the Union Power facility in Arkansas,
the completed construction of Ninemile 6, ahead of schedule and under budget; and planned transmission builds in
Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. Importantly, we are also taking deliberate steps to create the financial flexibility we
will need to drive even more growth. Our current efforts to combine Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana is one good example. Obtaining authorization for our purchase capacity rider in Texas in addition to the
existing transmission and distribution routers is another.
Focusing specifically on 2015, as you can see on slide two it promises to be another busy year. We have set our sights
on accomplishing a number of important tasks this year, and we are on track. For example, Ninemile 6 began
commercial operation in late December, and we were pleased to welcome Louisiana state officials and members of the
LPSC to its official grand opening in January. We announced the construction of a new high voltage transmission
project necessary to maintain reliability in the Lake Charles area load center, among the largest in Entergy's history.

The MISO board approved the project last week, and we will be filing for LPSC certification very soon.
In Arkansas Governor Hutchinson signed legislation that establishes a formula rate plan with a forward test year and
also addresses evidentiary considerations in setting return on equity and the proper method to determine the AFUDC
rate. Because it eliminates the need for a major base rate case every two to three years, this law will allow Entergy
Arkansas to align rates with investments in a timely manner with focused time and resources on activities that create
sustainable value for the state, including job growth.
In Mississippi, between the recently approved rate case and a new law passed this quarter. We now have a well-defined
rate structure, including forward-looking feature, saleable credit, faster recovery that will allow us to attract new
customers and businesses for the state. We're also making progress on tasks that we have targeted for the second
quarter.
For example, last Friday Entergy Arkansas filed its base rate case requesting to recover cost that resulted in a $167
million increase including a 10.2% ROE, a formula rate plan with a future test year. The latter would be per the
recently approved legislation. We expect new rates to go into effect in early 2016. New rates associated with the
formula rate plan would go into effect in early 2017.
It is worth noting that after this case is resolved we expect to have two utilities operating under formula rate plans with
forward-looking feature. In fact, nearly 85% of expected rate base in 2017 will be under FRPs or other formulaic
ratemaking mechanisms. Over the next few years, at the utility our priority is to continue to implement our resource
plan, which we are calling Power to Grow, and which is designed to allow us to support the economic growth in our
service territory and maintain reliable service to existing customers, all while keeping rates low.
And by 2020 we see a need to construct approximately $3.7 billion in new generation resources consisting of six new
power plants. We also expect 635 miles of new upgraded transmission to come online by 2022. Whereas most of these
projects are subject to approval by our regulators, we will be making the necessary filings seeking those approvals.
Let me give you a bit more detail about both the generation and transmission needs that comprise the utilities Power to
Grow. On the generation front, utilities supply plans include, for example, three newbuilds CCGT. More specifically,
we are planning for, whether through self-build or other agreements, one 800 megawatt plant in the Amite South region
pending the results of the RFP that is underway, to solicit proposals for new generation in this region of our system.
Another plant would be in WOTAB, specifically within the Lake Charles area, which is experiencing rapid industrial
expansion. Completion of this facility is targeted for 2021. Third would be in Texas, specifically the western region,
also by 2021. These generation resources are in addition to the planned acquisition of the Union Power facility as well
as the construction of Ninemile 6.
It is important to note that as with the 2020 Amite South facility, self-build projects for the other new plants I
mentioned would be market tested via an RFP or other mechanism as directed by our regulators. But the need to
modernize as well as to meet growing demand is clear.
In addition, to support nearer-term needs we anticipate adding one CT plant in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, area by the
end of 2020, as well as a CT in New Orleans in 2019. Both of these plants will further diversify our generation
portfolio by providing quick start peaking capability to serve growth and meet locational reliability needs. On the
transmission front, our resource plan includes significant investments in transmission to meet new and evolving NRC
requirements as well as facilitate committed and expected growth and attract future growth.
Major projects include the $62 million project we announced this month in Arkansas to build 24 miles of line, in part to
attract new industrial customers. In Texas over the next two years, we have approval to build three 230 kV transmission
projects totaling more than 65 miles of line and more than $150 million in investment. In Louisiana we plan to make
significant investment, about $56 million, in new high-capacity transmission facilities in Amite South, which will make
economic energy available to our customers and ensure reliable service in the heart of this industrial load pocket.
In addition, we intend to build an approximately $187 million project, including contingency, in the Lake Charles area,
an action recently approved by the MISO board. I'll make a note here that everything I've just listed has been part of our

capital plan for some time. We began by identifying the context and need, moved to the level of investment we thought
it would take, and have now named the specific projects, which merely provide more detail and clarity.
As I have noted the Power to Grow projects will bring significant economic and reliability benefits to the customers
and communities we serve, and if our plans are approved, will translate to $8 billion of capital expenditures over the
next three years, resulting in $3 billion to $4 billion in incremental rate-based growth, $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion in
utility net income, and utility, parent and other midpoint earnings per share of between $4.50 to $4.90 by 2017.
In addition to this activity, we are in the early stages of reviewing new investments that could provide significant value
to our customers. As we have before, we are identifying need and context, and as these specifics begin to emerge we
will provide more detail.
For example, in Louisiana the staff of the Public Service Commission issued a proposed order establishing a pilot
program that would deploy instruments to stabilize natural gas costs, including acquisition of supply through a direct
interest or joint venture. Recent Mississippi legislation also supports such investment by providing for rate recovery of
capital investment in natural gas reserves in order to foster long term stability in the cost of fuel.
We will also continue to evaluate opportunities for operational, reliability and customer service improvements as the
industry continues to evolve, and these could involve investments in the grid. We will work again in partnership with
regulators and policymakers to achieve legislative and regulatory frameworks that support constructive outcome both
for our business and those it serves.
This is a long list, but we know that everything on it is important. If we continue to make progress on this list, as we
expect to do, we continue to deliver good customer service with a more modern and reliable system at competitive
return levels and if we do it all while maintaining our rate advantage, we will have created value for all of our
stakeholders. The stability and financial flexibility created by these actions will help to put us in a position to discuss a
dividend increase with our Board of Directors, a discussion that could come as early as this fall.
Turning to EWC, hereto over the past two years we've made progress on resolving numerous uncertainties and
improving productivity. Most importantly, our EWC plants have operated safely and reliably. The nuclear fleet's
average capacity factor over the past five years has exceeded 90%. We also made it a priority to better align our
commercial and operational teams, as this alignment would be the foundation of everything we sought to achieve. The
substantial value subsequently created by our risk management and hedging activities, particularly during periods of
extreme market volatility, is evidence of our success in this regard.
While a confluence of factors resulted in much lower prices and less volatility this past winter in the Northeast markets,
our portfolio remains well positioned to capture upside from volatility as we see reserve margins decline and
inadequate fuel supply infrastructure for the foreseeable future.
We also made progress towards resolving some of the uncertainty surrounding the license renewal at Indian Point. We
did this in part by successfully arguing that the plant is grandfathered from review under New York's coastal
management program. While this decision is being appealed by the New York State Department of State, we continue
to believe that based on the facts we will be successful in extending the license life of Indian Point into the next decade
and beyond. We remain committed to working constructively with the State of New York and regulators in this
process.
While the recent shutdown of Vermont Yankee, as well as the ongoing investment growth at utility has diminished its
absolute and relative size, EWC remains an important asset in the Entergy portfolio. As we look to the future, we will
continue to focus on operational excellence and adaptive commercial approaches.
We will also continue to advocate for changes in price formation and reform of the Northeast market structure.
Continued out of market policies and intervention at state and regional level have made clear the critical need for
federal guidance and direction in independent system operators responsible for competitive regional market.
In particular, we believe guidance is needed in implementing new policies for both capacity and energy pricing, which
are market based, promote transparency and provide fair value for attributes provided by each type of generating

resource. Entergy has been an active participant in many proceedings supporting and competitive market. While some
initial signs of problem recognition are emerging, generators in restructured markets must see constructive changes
implemented in the near future. Without such change, sustainability of otherwise viable existing generating units will
continue to be at risk, especially given the investments required to properly maintain and reliably operate these
facilities.
We remain committed to working constructively with FERC and the ISOs to achieve fair and balanced competitive
markets in the Northeast. In 2017 based on market prices at the end of March we estimate EBITDA of $540 million at
EWC.
Two years ago we redefined our mission to be a world-class energy company in business to create sustainable values
for all of our stakeholders. We set plans and strategies to meet that aim and I am pleased to report on our achievements
for each stakeholder. For our owners, we said our objective is to deliver to quartile returns in 2014, and we did so. For
our customers, we said we wanted to achieve best-in-class service, the most important way to do this is by keeping
power flowing and when the lights do go out, getting them back on as quickly as possible.
This June the Southeastern Electric Exchange will recognize Entergy with its Chairman's Award for our transmission
teams work restoring power quickly and safely after last year's tornadoes. Also this year for similar reasons and for the
17th year in a row EEI awarded us with its Emergency Recovery Award.
We said we would maintain our rate advantage. Today our average retail customer rates across all classes are 20%
below the national average. We said we'd maintain our commitment to support the communities we serve. Last year
alone we contributed more than $16 million to numerous agencies, foundations and other organizations all working to
make our communities better. The recognition of our performance on this front, we were recently named to Corporate
Responsibility Officer magazine's ranking of 100 best corporate citizens. We are proud to be number 36 overall, as well
as the top ranked utility.
And finally, to our employees, we said we would cultivate a culture that rewards and fosters achievement. And in doing
so we would create a company that everyone is proud to call their own. This effort will never have an end point but
everything I've talked about today is evidence of our success on this front and the credit goes entirely to the 13,000-plus
people across Entergy.
So again today it is clear that Entergy is on a path to create sustainable long term value for its core stakeholder. We
believe our track record of achievement over the past two years serves as evidence of what we can achieve in the years
to come. Again, in terms of performance, results and growth at Entergy we are where we expect to be. We are on track
to accomplish what we set out to achieve.
And with that I'll turn it over to Drew. Drew?
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Before I get to the quarter's results, I'd like to spend just a few seconds
on our new quarterly earnings package. The release and appendices focus largely on results, while our forward-looking
disclosures are primarily in the webcast presentation.
We've also made a few additions, some of which I'll point out as I go through the result. In case you were having
trouble finding a particular item we've provided a cross reference on page 22 of the release. Our earnings package is
organized a little differently, but the disclosures that you depend on are still provided. I hope you will find the new
items are responsive to your feedback. If you find that is not the case, please let us know.
Now let's turn to the quarterly results. Slide three summarizes first quarter consolidated earnings per share. Operational
results exclude special items from the decision that closed Vermont Yankee and the HCM implementation in 2014.
Operational earnings per share were $1.68 in the first quarter of 2015, lower than the $3.29 per share earned in 2014.
The quarter-over-quarter decline was largely attributable to lower wholesale energy prices at EWC.

Slide four summarizes first quarter EPS for the utility, and parent and other. Combined operational EPS was $0.97 per
share in the current period, compared to $0.90 in the first quarter of 2014. Utility net revenue was the biggest driver and
billed retailed sales increased 1.5% on a weather-adjusted basis. Once again the strongest growth was in the industrial
class.
Quarter-over-quarter non-fuel O&M increased mostly in line with our expectation. Fossil expenses were higher by
$0.07 due primarily to planned maintenance outages. Nuclear spending increased $0.04, due largely to higher
regulatory compliance expenses. Other expense increases contributed $0.10 to the quarterly variance, most of which
have direct cost recovery and net revenue, including energy efficiency cost and MISO administrative fee. Utility first
quarter 2015 result included an income tax benefit as well.
You probably noticed that we added a new adjusted earnings view that endeavors to highlight the underlying
performance of the utility business, the parent and other, which combined form the basis of our dividend policy.
Turning back to Industrial Sales for a moment on slide five, they came in 2.9% higher than last year. The growth was
again across almost all customer segments. Chemicals saw the highest increase, primarily due to chloralkali and
petrochemicals customers. Transportation segment was also strong. Other industrial sales increased – excuse me,
although industrial sales increased they were lower than we expected due to customer outages and some delays with
new customers and expansion projects.
Moving on to EWC, slide six shows both EBITDA and EPS for the quarter. EWC operational adjusted EBITDA was
$254 million in the current quarter, about $200 million lower than last year. Closure of Vermont Yankee and its mostly
un-hedged position last year counted for more than half of the quarter-over-quarter decrease. Closure of VY also affects
every line item, and that makes understanding detailed drivers difficult. Therefore slide 27 and 28 in the appendix
provide additional information to help you navigate.
Excluding VY, net revenue was still the main driver for the EBITDA decline, as wholesale energy prices in the first
quarter of last year were significantly higher. Non-VY nuclear generation increased on fewer refueling outage days. On
an EPS basis, EWC's operational earnings were $0.71 per share, lower than the $1.39 earned a year ago. In addition to
the drivers already noted, EWC had a higher effective tax rate and higher realized earnings on the decommissioning
trust, about half of which was for VY.
Briefly moving to slide seven, OCF was $611 million in the current quarter, about $150 million lower than 2014. The
most significant driver was lower net revenue from lower wholesale energy prices at EWC, partially offset by higher
net revenue at the utility.
Now let's turn to forward-looking information. Slide eight summarizes our 2015 operational earnings guidance which
we affirm today with a midpoint of $5.50 and a range of plus or minus $0.40. We are ahead of expectations through the
first quarter but it's still early in the year, and our expectations for the full year remain on track with our original
guidance.
As we look at the longer-term expectations, slide nine summarizes our EWC EBITDA outlook based on market prices
as of quarter end. You will note that they have not changed much since the end of the year, despite the volatility
between then and now.
We are still bullish on power and natural gas versus the current market, but not as bullish as we were. And that means
that we now expect EWC's EBITDA will be below our previous point of view expectations.
That said, we've received consistent feedback that the POV-based EBITDA has been a source of confusion since we
introduced it last summer. Markets have been within our point of view range and below our point of view at multiple
times over the last year, proving again and again that EWC markets and, by extension, earnings, are volatile.
To simplify, we are returning to our previous practice of externally communicating only the market-based EBITDA
expectation, since it is grounded in the reality of today. We will continue to provide our point of view on the market,
but not the specific point of view EBITDA estimates.

While on EWC, continue to receive questions regarding impairment. As of the current quarter, we have not incurred an
impairment loss, but we continue to monitor this issue, which includes consideration of the expectation of future
economic conditions, particularly price levels, as well as the state of operations and the carrying value of the asset.
Keep in mind accounting impairments would not affect our decisions with respect to continued operations of the plant.
Slide 10 reflects our 2017 outlook for utility and parent and other. The utility outlook remains on track for 2017
operational earnings of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. As we have said before, this includes a statutory tax rate and a
pension discount rate of 5%.
The foundation for utility's growth outlook is its capital investment plan. Continue to expect 5% to 7% rate-based
growth through 2017, led by the nearly $1 billion Union acquisition and other potential generations to refresh our aging
fleet, as well as to meet new customer load requirements, and by transmission investments to meet NERC requirements
and customer reliability needs with the industrial expansion.
In addition to the capital investment plan, we will need to execute on rate cases in Arkansas and Texas this year to
achieve our objectives. A few final comments on financing activity before I conclude.
Entergy Corporation had $550 million five-year notes, which will come due in September of this year. We plan to
refinance those notes in advance of the maturity date, possibly as early as this quarter. We are also amending Entergy
Corp.'s $3.5 billion credit facility, along with $650 million of companion operating company lines of credit to extend
for one year and to account for the ELL/EGSL business combination.
Lastly, on March 31, S&P revised its rating outlook for Entergy Corp. and its subsidiaries to positive from stable. S&P
specifically noted increased focus on our regulated businesses, the expectation for above-average utility sales growth,
the recently passed Arkansas legislation, and other factors that are expected to continue to strengthen our business risk
profile over time.
As Leo said, we've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years, and remain on track to achieve our objectives over
the next few years, and create real and sustainable value for our key stakeholders – our owners, our customers, our
employees, and our community.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is now open.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning and congrats on the quarter.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Julien.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Of course. Now, could we address first off the sales growth? You addressed it at
length in the commentary, but perhaps can you jive the, just the first quarter 1.5% relative to the full-year target? And
also in contrast, I see that the, I suppose, in your guidance, you talk about utility revenue up $0.55 for the year. And I
think you hit it net about $0.25? So, a constructive commentary there. Where do you stand vis-à-vis the EPS as well?
So, the percent change and the EPS on the utility, if you can.

<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Julien, I'll maybe address your first question in terms of the growth. As Drew said, the
1.5% is primarily impacted by what we saw in the industrial sector in terms of where it came in at 2.9%. Most of that,
that was driven primarily in two areas: the timing of new and expansion projects that we expected in the first quarter, as
well as some one-time unexpected issues, or outages to some of our existing customers. And those two issues roughly
represented about 50% of the difference in terms of what we expected versus where we ended up. So clearly that means
we've had some softening in the first quarter. Clearly, some of that we will see pick up as we go out into the year and
into 2016 and 2017.
So it doesn't change our overall expectation as it relates to 2017 at this point in time. What I will also say though, even
with the 1.5% growth, as you mentioned, our revenues were still strong. And revenues got clearly much closer to our
expectations. And so, it's still early and we're still assessing where we believe we'll be as we go through the year. But I
mean the first quarter delays clearly could dampen our 2015 results. But again as Drew mentioned earlier, we still see
ourselves in our earnings guidance for 2015.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. And I'll just add that in addition to what Theo said, we do have some costs in
that top line which are offset in O&M. So I think in my comments, I talked about around $0.10 is other stuff, is what,
some things like MISO costs and energy efficiency costs that were a little ahead of where we expected them to be. And
they were offset in that net revenue line. So that's part of why the net revenue line is higher than maybe what you were
anticipating as well.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. But just to be clear on the sales growth, it's fundamentally delays, not
necessarily a shift in the fundamental outlook for a decline of the commodities, et cetera?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes, I mean what we saw primarily was just shifts in timing. As we've said, from an oil
price perspective, we still don't see any significant impact. I mean we fundamentally believe a large majority of our
industrial growth through 2017 is coming from projects that are already in advanced stages of development. And first
quarter didn't change that.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Julien, this is Leo. Julien, I'll just add, we've mentioned this before but I guess it garners some
reinforcement. A lot of these expansions and/or new customers, they're big projects, and they target a date that it's not
uncommon for capital projects in the hundreds of millions of dollars, or in some cases the multi-billion dollar range to
just slip a month or two here and there. So that may or may not occur in line with what we would have expected from
time to time also.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And then secondly, if you don't mind, a kind of bigger picture question on dividend.
You alluded to it earlier. What's your targeted payout ratio? Or how do you think about the dividend in the context of
the EWC business and the utilities at this point or prospectively?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, from a EWC business, we don't think about it at all. The dividend is purely from utility,
parent and other. And we had outlined at the Analyst Day our expectation that a 65% to 75% payout ratio of utility,
parent and other earnings was our target.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Got it. So perhaps in looking at that initially here, remaining towards the top end of
the range, would that be a fair statement as you think about growing that in the 2016 timeframe?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Well, when we look at it, just to put some context about it, our objective being to return capital
to shareholders and to do it on a protracted sustained basis, we're looking to create an era of sustained dividend growth.
So, as we look at the growth in that segment of the business, we're not going to chase the payout ratio and have the
dividend jumping around a lot. We're going to look for what's sustained growth in the business, and we'll make
recommendations for the board to put together a path with the dividend that achieves that, consistent with what those
long-term earnings growth would be.
So, we're going to review that, as we always do every year. But when we get into this fall, it's going to be reviewed in
the context of the growth that we continue to believe is going to occur within that segment, as well as other factors that

Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I was looking – I was a little bit confused by the decommissioning benefit that you guys have in
the release. As I recall, you guys were expecting the decommissioning expenses to increase. So I was wondering, is that
decommissioning – how should we think about decommissioning and guidance, the decommissioning trust fund and
what have you, and the benefit that you saw in the quarter versus the rest of the year?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: That's a good question, Paul. So, when we were at EEI, we talked about $20 million to $25
million of net income drag from Vermont Yankee in 2015 and 2016, and then it kind of trails off to about $10 million
after that. So, we do expect it to come down as critical aspects of the decommissioning process wind up – wind off, I
should say. But, and since EEI, and as we got closer to the actual shutdown date, and we started to need to make
decisions around how we were going to manage that decommissioning trust, it became clear that we needed to be
de-risking that trust, as we move through the first phase of decommissioning, which caused us to have to turn over our
portfolio a little bit more than we had previously anticipated. And so we are trying to do that at a nice ratable basis as
we go through the year.
It started a little bit last year, and it will probably continue on into a little bit into the first quarter, maybe even next
year. But it should be about $0.04 or so each quarter, is kind of what our expectation is. And that, over the course of the
year, is going to take up a lot of the offset drag that we were anticipating for 2015. So I think Vermont overall for the
year would be anticipated now to be about flat or maybe even slightly positive. And I would say about flat is the
expectation.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: For the full year?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: The full year.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So there's going to be – okay. And then in terms of the zone changes in New England, I
was wondering if there was any impact on you guys – and this is in terms of the point of view change – well, not the
point of view change, but has there been any quantitative change in the point of view? I know directionally, you guys
are bullish, but has there been anything in terms of your outlook for the markets that has changed quantifiably?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Paul, we have, in fact, lowered our point of view from a natural gas perspective. And obviously
that flows through power prices. However, we still do remain bullish compared to the market overall.
As it relates to the zone in New England, it's really a tough call in terms of where those markets end up. We're still
working through that. But really, there is a wide range of outcomes depending on supply/demand balance. And so, right
now, I don't have anything to share specifically as it relates to a price range. We're trying to get more information from
the ISO and further evaluate that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
<Q - Gregory Harmon Gordon>: Thanks. Can you talk about the – what your earned return on equity has been in
Arkansas? And given the recent changes in the regulatory structure there, and your intent on filing under the new
structure, whether you think you'll see – over what trajectory you think you'll see improvement in that return?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes. Sure, Greg. This is Theo. I believe if you look at the packet, the webcast packet,
with the slides, normalized was about 5.9% for the last 12 months ending March 31 of this year. And clearly, with the
reform and with the rate case filing, we expect to see that change. And if you think about the impact of the rate case
filing and the revenue impacts, as well as net income impacts, we see Arkansas, as we go forward to 2016 and beyond,
with the formula rate plans for the test years making significant movement to earnings there allowed returns.
<Q - Gregory Harmon Gordon>: Okay. So you think the balance – that you'll be litigating that case for the balance of
2015. And to the extent that there is a change, and we'll see that show up in 2016?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes. I mean there will be an effect. There's I think a long statutory period in Arkansas.
And while we don't have a procedural schedule set just yet, we would expect to see the case playing out through the
remainder of 2015. And we would see, at the latest, rate impacts 10 months from the filing date, which was last Friday
– this past Friday.
<Q - Gregory Harmon Gordon>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Eggers of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Just going back to the point of view comment or kind of the change there, I think previously
it looked like you had about $100 million or $150 million of POV uplift for 2017. How much has that point of view
changed? And does that have any bearing on kind of the 2% to 4% EPS growth target you guys provided starting back
at your Analyst Day?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. I'll take first crack at it and then I don't know if anybody else will jump in. But
the – as it relates to the EBITDA uplift that we were talking about before, I think it was $650 million to $700 million.
And as we've kind of gone along and prices have stayed low, and we've gotten closer and closer to those periods, it's
less and less likely that we would make it into the range.
And so, our point of view has slipped in the time frames that we've talked about, below that $650 million threshold. I
think, last quarter, we were right about the edge, and now we're a little bit below. So, that's what's happening with it. As
we look out, we still have a bullish point of view that it starts to rise as we get beyond the period that we are talking
about. But it's been pushed further out as we've gone along.
As it relates to the 2% to 4%, I think the primary driver at the utility continues to be right on track, the utility and the
parent and other, combined entity. In fact, we've given those ranges for 2016 and 2017. Those are still very much
intact. In fact, we have some – we are looking for additional opportunities maybe even in the 2017 timeframe.
But as EWC is the volatile part of that earnings mix, it doesn't look like at this point that that – that EWC would allow
us to make it back into that particular range. However, you never know. Stranger things have happened. And 2017, in
particular, is still pretty far away. So, we wouldn't say we can't make it, but right now, as we look at our view, we are

probably just below that level.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you. And I guess just on the gas reserves and rate base conversation, can you
maybe just share a little more detail on how those two processes are going to work? And what you guys have from an
overall annual natural gas burn rate?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: In terms of – Dan, it's Theo – in terms of how the process works, I mean, we have the
pilot program Leo mentioned in Louisiana, and we'll be filing comments relative to that this month. And that will
progress based on the Commission's directive, in terms of how they see that – how that moves along. At this point,
we're just, we're exploring our options. And the timing of that is going to depend on the form of the investment, and
again, how that plays through the regulatory process. In terms of gas burn today, I'm not certain I can tell you exactly
how much it is. We'll probably just have to follow-up and give you that information.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: I would just say, Dan, I mean, obviously given the nature of our fleet, our gas burn is pretty
significant. I don't, off the top of my head, have how many Bs a day we're talking about, but it's trivial.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, I'll say -- this is Drew -- I'll say it's going to be a small amount of our overall gas burn
to begin with. You know we are not going to be able to jump in and hedge our entire supply, as Leo said. I mean, it's
very large. I mean, we're spending in the neighborhood of $3 billion a year on gas supply – maybe a little lower, since
prices are lower today. But it's a significant amount. And so, we would be trying to carve out, at least initially, a small
layer that would allow us to kind of get our feet under us and really appreciate how this is going to work through all the
various operational processes, as well as regulatory processes.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: And I don't want to ask a detailed question, but I'm going to anyway. The EWC guidance for
this year at $0.70 versus the $0.71 you did in the first quarter, I know you don't want to update guidance too early, but
is there a plausible case where you guys would not make money at EWC for the rest of the year?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, if prices went lower, yes. But I don't think that's our expectation. I think we're a little
ahead of schedule through the first quarter. And we expected to earn a little bit more. But, as we've gone along, the
nature of that EWC business in particular has gotten highly seasonal and anchored towards really the winter timeframe.
And so, while we do expect to make a little bit more money at EWC over the course of the year, the bulk of their
earnings at this point are completed through the first quarter.
<Q - Daniel L. Eggers>: Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Yeah, hi. Hi. Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Morning.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Just a little more flavor this morning on the natural gas pilot. And I guess you
mentioned both Louisiana and Mississippi. Could you maybe give us a sense of just rather than an amount of gas, just
potential investment size? Is this tens of millions? Hundreds of millions? Billions? Just some rough idea of potential
scale of these investments.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. I'll – it's certainly not in the billions at this point. And tens of millions is
probably too small. So it's going to be, I'll say, in the neighborhood of $200 million to $300 million maybe initially in
that range. It could be a little higher or lower but something like that -- if we decide to move forward with this.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Is that just Louisiana? Or is that both states?

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No, that would probably be both states. I mean, Louisiana would be the bulk of it.
Mississippi's fuel burn is considerably smaller than Louisiana.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. And just – like you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have no
impairments on EWC, as of the current quarter I just – why did you even mention that? Is there something that you are
particularly focused on there, to bring that up?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, it's something that we get questions on from time to time. And because of that, we
think it's something that's been on investors' minds. So, we wanted to just make sure we were forthright with a
discussion about it, and make sure that everybody knew that it is on our radar screen. It's something that we are paying
close attention to. That was the primary reason for it.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. And just lastly in the kind of overall utility outlook that you've provided
through 2017, would you say the improved Arkansas environment was kind of assumed in there? Or would you say it's
a potential kind of upside to the utility plan?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Hi, Steve. This is Theo. I mean, clearly, as we laid out our plan, we had an expectation
about improving our results in Arkansas. And so I would say yes, if you look at the growth that we see, there are
primarily three main elements, especially when you move from 2015 to 2016 in the utility. So it's the sales growth; it's
regulatory improvements in Arkansas; and clearly, it's the Union investment. And so, we did have an expectation
around that.
In terms of whether there is upside or not will be more defined as we go forward, and we move through the process of
the case itself, and then to build the case. But we had an expectation to try and improve results in Arkansas as we laid
forth – a we laid our plans out for 2016 and 2017.
<Q - Steven Isaac Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, two questions. One, any plans regarding, both near-term and long-term,
regarding the holding company level debt? Meaning is your anticipation to leave that debt there? Is your anticipation to
make sure all of it is financed long-term and there's no short-term? You've done a good chunk of that already. Is the
goal to kind of pay that down, so whenever EWC has cash flow, you can kind of get back to the mode, like you used to
do a number of years ago, of being able to use EWC's free cash to buy back stock? Like, how are you thinking about
short-term, one or two years? And then a three to five year cycle about what to do with the parent debt.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: All right. I'm not sure where to start on that one, Michael. There's a lot going on in that
question. In terms of the capital structure, I talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about the parent financing that we
have coming up. I think we're going to do the fixed rate notes. We're going to refinance those this fall or maybe even
much earlier than that.
We have a lot of financing activity going on, on the second half of the year, with the parent note coming due, the
anticipation of the Union acquisition, and the financings that will have to go on with that at the utility level. And then,
because of the ELL-EGSL combination, we have to redo revolvers for those businesses. And while we are at it, we're
going to go ahead and redo the entire thing. So we're going to probably do that a little earlier in anticipation of the
ability to close that combination.
So, those are the main activity things. In terms of going forward, we are continuing to anticipate that we are going to
carry that short-term debt for a while, and that it's going to continue to float. So the short-term rates haven't moved too
much, and certainly we have a lot of exposure to interest rates on the pension side of our books. So, any movement on

that side is balanced pretty well on the interest rate side for the roughly $1.5 billion of short-term debt that we have. So
we wouldn't anticipate that we would change that any time soon.
And as we think about the overall parent debt capital structure, including both the short-term variable and the fixed rate
piece, we're still targeting that 18% to 20% parent debt to total debt ratio. And so we're going to probably be a little bit
above that this year as we close through the, I guess the Union deal. We'll probably draw a little bit more on that.
But over the next few years, we do see it trending down and provided we don't come up with a whole bunch more
investment opportunities. So, I think those are the kind of the main things. And we're going to continue to kind of
maintain our capital structure at the parent level for the time being as it is today. But obviously, we'll be looking for
other ideas and opportunities as we go along.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And I don't know if I answered everything that you had in your question, Michael, but?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: No. That's perfect. An unrelated question. A while ago, a year or a year and a half ago,
there was a lot of discussion about Palisades in terms of operating performance, NRC oversight, a handful of other
things. Can you just kind of touch base on that a little bit? It's been a while since I think you've talked about it, so I just
want a sanity check to what's out there.
<A - William M. Mohl>: Sure. Michael, this is Bill. Look, Palisades has been running extremely well, above a 90%
capacity factor. The one issue we have out there is the embrittlement issue, which is still under review by the NRC. We
expect clarity on that by this summer. And again I think based on our own analysis, we really do not believe there's any
issues there, and hope that that will get verified in July. But no, Palisades is back on track and operating very, very
well.

<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Just a quick one back on sales growth, I'm afraid. I was just curious on slide 5, where
you talk about existing large customers down largely on outages. But you know it would have been up absent outages.
How significant was the outage piece? And can you just size that relative to the delays you saw on the new customer
stuff?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes, Jonathan, this is Theo. I think I mentioned, as part of the first question, roughly, in
terms of where we landed versus our expectation, it was approximately half and half. About half of it was really due to
timing of new and expansion projects, and half was really due to one-time unexpected issues or outages with some of
our existing customers.

Thank you. And in interest of time our last question will come from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Your
line is now open.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Thank you. My Arkansas question got answered, so let me move to Mississippi with just
one question. Is the new law, I mean pre- the new law, you can make an investment in infrastructure. Let's say the
development didn't happened and the commission could come back with a used-and-useful argument and disallow that
investment. Is that what this eliminates?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Charles, when you speak to the new law, I assume you're talking about what was passed
recently as it relates to the ability to make investment in anticipation of economic growth.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Yes. The thing you referred to on the first page of your release.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yes. I think it, really more than anything, gave clarity as it relates to how you can make
that investment in anticipation of that growth. But I think it really goes to what's happening in Mississippi in terms of
improving relationships, and their recognition of the importance of economic development and growth, economic
growth in the state. Again, the clarity I think was more around, you can make that investment and there's an
expectation, we should have an expectation that that investment would be viewed as necessary, and from a rate
recovery perspective, make it less controversial.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Okay. That was it. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: And Charles, I'll just add what we've been doing over the last couple of years is working really
in partnership with all of our stakeholders in each jurisdiction. And that partnership is around what it is that we are all
jointly trying to accomplish. We are all jointly trying to accomplish economic prosperity in the communities that we
serve, and that they regulate or that they have administrative control over, if you are the governor or what have you.
So we spend a lot of time on that overall objective. And that objective being to promote economic development and
prosperity in those economies. That has resulted in a better understanding between us all about what our objectives are
that we share and what processes that we can utilize that we can agree on. So, at the end of the day, legislation and laws
aren't all going to show up the way we would design them. They are going to come up the way that, jointly, between us,
Governors, legislative bodies, economic development agencies and regulators, believe is in the best interest of those –
of their jurisdictions and our customers.
And so what I think you've seen in Arkansas, what you've seen in Mississippi, what we've seen with the proceedings
around capacity and transmission distribution riders in Texas, what we hope to see as we continue to go forward in
Louisiana is, things that work to promote job creation and economic prosperity and better communities where we serve.
That's really all we've done. But it should turn out well for us if it turns out well for the communities. And I think that's
what you're seeing in those types of legislative efforts and regulatory outcomes that we've seen over the last couple of
years.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Okay. Thanks, Leo. But it certainly gives you more confidence in your 2017 outlook for
the utilities in – what's happened in Arkansas and Mississippi recently?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: It absolutely does. And the reason that confidence is important is, if you think about what is
happening in all these jurisdictions, in Arkansas, we have a major customer coming online. We have a steel mill that
we provide a lot of electricity to in Louisiana. We've got significant growth along the Gulf Coast as it relates to the
petrochemical business.
And in Texas, we see not only the industrial expansion, but in Texas, we see significant commercial and residential
loan growth as well. And we have to be ready, willing and able to serve that load, and do that while we continue with
the process we started on 10 years ago of refreshing the generating portfolio, and continuing to meet an ever-evolving
set of reliability requirements as it relates to transmission.
