MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please
disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir,
you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Thank you, Erin, and welcome to the Kinder Morgan Analyst Call for the First Quarter of 2013. As usual, we'll be
making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
I'll give an overview of the first quarter. Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer, will then take you through the details
of the financials; and then our President, Steve Kean, Kim and I will answer any and all questions that you might have.
As usual, we'll be talking about Kinder Morgan, Inc., the GP of the Kinder Morgan companies, which I'll refer to as
KMI and also about Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and El Paso Pipeline Partners, which I'll refer to as KMP and EPB
and those are our affiliated master limited partnerships.
Together, these companies have an enterprise value of a little over $110 billion. That makes us the largest midstream
and third largest energy company in North America. Once again, I'm happy to report that all three entities raised their
dividends or distributions for the first quarter of 2013.
So let me take you through each of the three companies.
Starting with KMI, we raised our dividend to $0.38, which is $1.52 annualized. That's up 19% from the first quarter of
2012. We had cash available for dividends of $513 million or $0.49 per share, which is an increase of 14% over the

$0.43 per share that we had in Q1 of 2012. We're on target with our drop downs of El Paso assets into KMP and EPB,
and we completed the drop down to KMP in the first quarter of 50% of El Paso Natural Gas and certain midstream
assets and we expect to sell our 50% interest in the Gulf LNG facilities to EPB later this year.
We're also on target regarding the expected savings resulting from the El Paso acquisition. We originally projected
$350 million in the first full year. We're now in excess of $400 million for that first full year versus that $350 million
target.
The strong performance at KMI was driven by good results at both KMP and EPB and by good results in the pipeline
assets we still retain at KMI. We expect to meet our budget target of $1.57 in declared dividends for 2013; that's a 12%
increase from the 2012 declared dividends of $1.40. And if you look out further into the future, we've currently
identified well over $12 billion of expansion and JV projects across North America.
Now let me turn to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners or KMP. And there we increased our distribution to $1.30, which is
$5.20 annualized. That's up 8% from Q1 of 2012. Our segments produced earnings before DD&A of $1.276 billion.
That's up 24% from Q1 of 2012. And of course, as you know, we like to refer to distributable cash flow per unit and
there DCFU pre certain items was $1.46 versus $1.37 for Q1 of 2012 and that's an increase of 7% year-over-year.
If you look at the performance of each segment of KMP, starting with natural gas – and let me just relate to our overall
feelings with natural gas across all of the Kinder Morgan companies – we believe natural gas is clearly the fossil fuel of
the future. It's domestic, clean, abundant and reasonably priced and that makes it the clear winner for this country for
decades to come.
One of the biggest challenges to this rosy scenario is to overcome the obstacles in midstream infrastructure to ensure
that there's adequate capacity to connect the new sources of supply to the markets where the demand is.
Now, if you look at Kinder Morgan specifically, we have 62,000 miles of gas pipelines. We'll have about 70,000 post
the Copano merger, so I think our companies are ideally situated to help meet this challenge of providing the needed
infrastructure in North America.
Within KMP, this segment was up 78% from its earnings before DD&A in the first quarter of 2012. Of course, this
improvement was driven primarily by the drop downs of Tennessee Gas Pipeline and El Paso Natural Gas, both of
which occurred subsequent to the first quarter of 2012, and both of which are performing as expected, and actually a bit
above our plan for Q1 of 2013.
Across the KMP Natural Gas segment, transportation volumes were up about 7% versus a year ago. That's as a result of
higher Eagle Ford value – volumes, increased deliveries to Mexico on our Texas intrastate systems and a new supply
project in the Northeast on Tennessee.
We expect to close on the Copano acquisition in early May. As we've told you previously, we expect that to be
modestly accretive to KMP in 2013 and that's not in our present forecast numbers. And we expect it to be about $0.10
accretive in 2014 and beyond. We expect that we'll be adding, as I've said, about 7,000 miles of gas pipelines, which
have 2.7 Bcf a day of natural gas throughput capacity, together with nine processing plants, which have over a Bcf a
day of processing capacity and about 315 million a day of treating capacity.
Aside from Copano, we have lots of other projects underway in our Natural Gas segment at KMP, mostly at TGP in the
Northeast, where we have $900 million worth of projects there alone. But we're also finding opportunities to do more
gas to Mexico, to expand our Texas operations, and we're now in an open season to determine the industry interest in
our proposed Freedom Pipeline, which would connect a portion – which would convert a portion of El Paso Natural
Gas from natural gas to crude oil service and would crude from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California
refineries.
Now let me emphasize, as we said before, we won't build this unless we have customer support through binding
long-term contracts. Our open season began on April 2 and extends through May 2.

Turning to our CO2 segment. The positives there were very good oil production at SACROC. We averaged 30,700
barrels per day in the first quarter. That's up 14% or almost 4,000 barrels from Q1 of 2012. And we also had record
NGL production, actually over 20,000 barrels per day gross production at our SACROC processing unit, the Snyder gas
plant. And that was up 15% from the first quarter of 2012.
We also substantially improved our volumes at the Katz Field, as that production continues to ramp up
quarter-to-quarter. The negatives were a wide Midland-to-Cushing spread on oil prices in January and February. That's
now corrected and the forward curve indicates it will stay corrected for the rest of the year. But that spread in January
and February did negatively impact our average oil price per barrel. We also faced lower NGL prices for the quarter,
compared to a year ago, but pretty much on our plan.
Even with those two negatives, we expect the CO2 segment to be slightly above plan for the full year 2013. Although
I'll caution that at anytime you talk about projecting what's going to happen over the next nine months, that's always a
little dicey this early in the year. But so far, we feel good about our CO2 segment.
The big thing here is that the CO2 demand in the Permian basin remains very strong. We talk about that almost every
quarter. Consequently, we're expanding our source fields in Southwest Colorado by adding a significant amount of
compression that we believe will boost the total output from Southwest Colorado from about 1.2 Bcf a day that we
have today, to about 1.4 Bcf a day by 2014. All of that additional CO2 will be sold under long-term contracts. As I said,
the demand for CO2 in the Permian is very strong.
We are also starting work on a new source field on the Arizona-New Mexico border that will add significant additional
supply in future years and we estimate that we will be able to add at least 200 million cubic feet a day as a result of that
deal.
So if you look at it, we're supplying about 1.2 Bcf a day today. With these projects, we expect to get up into the 1.6 Bcf
a day, maybe a little better than that in the next few years. That's a significant additional source of service to our
customers and additional source of opportunity for our own bottom line. Today, of course, we're still curtailing
customers, including our own oil production activities in the Permian Basin. That's how strong the demand is for CO2
in the Permian.
Turning to our and Products Pipelines segment, they had a very good first quarter, led by higher volumes and revenues
on our Cochin Pipeline system, by increased volumes and margins at our transmix operations and by the contribution
from Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate Line, which was completed in the second quarter of 2012.
In this segment, our NGL volumes increased by 32%. Over a year ago, our NGL revenues were up 56%. Looking at
refined products volumes, we were up 1.4% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2012 and that's contrasted with an
EIA national decline of about 1.2%. Our increase was driven largely by volumes on our Plantation system, which in
turn was helped – were helped by a competitor pipelines' allocations during the first quarter.
We also had good biodiesel volumes in this segment, which were up by 20% over a year ago. We expect this segment
to be slightly above plan for full-year 2013. And also in this area we have a number of significant projects underway.
These include a splitter project on the Houston Ship Channel, which will split condensate for us.
We've now expanded that planning to 100,000 barrels per day of processing capacity, and we've expanded the storage
capacity from 1.2 million barrels to 1.9 million barrels. That's all pursuant to long-term contracts with BP. The total
cost is now projected at about $360 million. The first phase will come online in 2014; the second phase in 2015. And
we expect that to be a very good project for us and our customers. And in fact, we think there may be opportunity to
add even additional volumes on a going-forward basis.
In addition, we have significant expansions of our KMCC line, construction of our Parkway Pipeline in Louisiana and
Mississippi, and the reversal of our Cochin Pipeline to move condensate up to Alberta. These are significant projects
and that we have a lot more detail on them in our release from this afternoon.
Turning to our Terminal segment. Here, we benefited from increased demand for export coal, where our volumes were
about 12% above last year. But we continue to see lower domestic coal volumes. We also enjoyed increased revenues

in our liquids terminals, particularly in the Northeast and Gulf Coast, due to new and restructured contracts at higher
rates.
On the negative side, we had lower petcoke volumes, due largely to refinery shutdowns during the quarter along the
Gulf Coast. And we had a decline in steel volumes. We think the average utilization of our steel customers went from
around 79% down to about 75% during the quarter. And we also saw a decline in this segment in ethanol volumes,
primarily due to a conversion of certain of our ethanol assets to other uses, primarily crude service and some vegetable
oil.
And we also experienced the impact of higher ethanol barrels being imported on our coastal terminals, but actually had
higher demand in our terminals that are located on the inland waterways and elsewhere, away from the coast.
In our Terminals group, we're working on a wide range of improved major projects. We'd detailed these in our release
and they include significant new liquid storage facilities at Edmonton, Alberta; our fifth crude-by-rail project; progress
on our $430 million BOSTCO Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, which we now expect to expand beyond the
original 6.5 million barrels of capacity; and together with the expansion of our chemical storage capacity.
Turning to Kinder Morgan Canada, Trans Mountain continues to experience very strong demand to move oil sands
production to the lower mainland of British Columbia and to Washington State, as well across our dock in Vancouver.
Specifically, the movement of volumes to Washington State were up 7%. Our volumes across the dock in Vancouver
for the quarter were up 18% from a year ago.
We also signed a new three-year toll agreement with our current customers, which was recently approved by the
National Energy Board in Canada.
During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our one-third interest in Express Pipeline and we received approximately
$400 million gross proceeds from that sale. That will mean that the segment, Kinder Morgan Canada, will likely be
slightly below plan for the year. But overall taking into account the use of that cash we received, the transaction will be
modestly accretive to cash flow at KMP as a whole.
Most importantly, we continued to make progress on our proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain system from
300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels a day. That's a $5.4 billion potential project, underpinned by long-term
contracts on over 700,000 barrels per day. We expect to file our facilities application with the NEB later this year.
So that's it on the segments in KMP.
Let me spend just a couple of minutes on EPB. There we raised our distribution to $0.62 a quarter. That's up 22% from
the first quarter of 2012. On a DCF per unit basis, we had $0.78 per unit versus $0.69 cents a year ago. That's up 13%
year-over-year. We had a strong first quarter resulting from the drop downs, which occurred in Q2 of 2012, and by
good results on the SNG system, where we completed an expansion project.
Our gas-fired power generation on SNG was up 4% versus a very strong Q1 of 2012. And that's in contrast to the
national trend, which was down quarter-over-quarter. And frankly, in contrast to the results at our other Kinder Morgan
pipelines, where we were down in first quarter of 2013 versus first quarter of 2012, in terms of demand for power
generation; still had good quarters, but not as big as the first quarter a year ago.
At EPB, we're particularly encouraged by significant LNG export opportunities that we're pursuing. At our Elba Island
facility in – near Savannah, Georgia, we entered into a long-term contract with a Shell subsidiary to develop a
liquefaction facility that will have capacity of 2.5 million tonnes per year or 350 million cubic feet a day of throughput,
under two phases of development.
The first phase is approximately 210 million cubic feet a day and that is not contingent on any non-FTA approval. And
on [ph] an 8H (18:03) basis will involve a capital cost of about $1 billion. If we build the second phase that will be an
additional CapEx of about $500 million [ph] 8H (18:04). We own 51% of the project. Shell owns 49%. And in
addition, we're also doing some expansion on related facilities to get the gas to liquefaction facilities and we also own
earn a return on those.

At Gulf LNG, that's our facility along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which EPB expects to purchase from KMI later this
year, we're working on a larger facility. But, again, we're emphasizing customers with demand for export to FTA
countries. And we're coming along pretty well with that. We'll just have to see whether we could put it all together, but
we're hopeful that we can.
EPB is also bidding through SNG on a new pipeline project to Florida to serve the needs of Florida Power & Light
under an RFP procedure that's presently underway in Florida.
So in summary, 2013's off to a very good start at the Kinder Morgan companies and we continue to see enormous
opportunities for expanding our great midstream footprint across North America.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with KMP and then I'll do EPB financials and finally KMI. Looking at the first
page of the KMP financials, you'll see it's the GAAP income statement. As we say every quarter, we don't find the
GAAP income statement overly meaningful. And so I'll move to the second page which is what we think more
accurately portrays the results of the company and our calculation of distributable cash flow, so the cash flow that we
produce for – that's available for distribution.
At the bottom of that page, you will see DCF per unit, as Rich said, of $1.46, up 7% versus a year ago. Versus our
distribution of $1.30, that translates into coverage of a little over $60 million. As we said at that time of the budget, and
it still continues to be true, we will have excess coverage in the first quarter. We will have excess coverage in the fourth
quarter. And we will have excess coverage for the year. But we will have negative coverage in the second and the third
quarter.
The DCF in total $550 million in the second quarter. That's $88 million above the first quarter of 2012.
Looking at where that growth comes from. The segments in total $1.276 billion of segment earnings before DD&A and
certain items. That's up $247 million or 24%. Of the $247 million, $218 million of that is coming out in natural gas
and, as we discussed, that's largely driven by the drop downs that KMP or the assets that KMP has acquired from KMI,
both in August of last year and in March of this year. And that's somewhat offset by reduced income because of the
sales, the FTC sales that we made in the third quarter of – the fourth quarter of last year.
Products Pipelines is up $24 million and that's a result of the good performance on Cochin and transmix.
Looking at each of the segments versus our budget. Natural Gas Pipelines in the quarter was slightly above its budget,
but that's largely due to timing on O&M on some of the interstate gas pipelines. For the year, we expect that Natural
Gas will be on its budget.
CO2 for the quarter was slightly below its budget. That's a function of the wide Midland-Cushing differential that
impacted the price we get on our oil. As Rich discussed, that is now corrected, primarily as a result of the Longhorn
Pipeline coming online. For the year, we expect CO2 to be slightly above its budget, largely as a function of higher oil
prices.
Products Pipeline for the quarter was slightly above its budget, as a result of strong performance on Cochin and
transmix versus what we expected. And the same will be true for the full year; we expect them to be slightly above
their budgets for the same reasons.
Terminals for the quarter was a little bit below its budget, given the lower domestic coal volumes, the lower steel
volumes and a terminated contract on our Material Service Handling business. For the year, we also expect them to be
slightly below their budget, primarily as a result of the terminated contract and also higher book taxes. Now, realize
book taxes have an impact on terminals, but overall in our calculation of DCF, we add back book taxes, subtract cash

taxes, so this book tax impact does not have an impact on the overall DCF of KMP.
Kinder Morgan Canada was on budget for the quarter. As Rich mentioned, we will be below plan for the year, as a
result of the Express sale. But overall, the transaction's going to be accretive for KMP as we use the proceeds to reduce
the debt we need – the debt and the equity that we need to issue.
Dropping down to the middle of your page, general and administrative expense, $123 million in the quarter. That's up
about $15 million from last year, largely as a result of acquisitions. For the quarter, we're on our budget for G&A. For
the full year, we expect G&A to come in slightly below our budget, as a result of higher capitalized overhead that's
resulting from increased expansion CapEx projects.
Interest for the quarter was up $48 million over the first quarter of 2012, as a result of higher balance, given the
acquisitions and expansion projects. For the quarter, we were slightly favorable to our budget. And for the full year we
expect to be favorable to our budget, given the reduced debt needs – our financing needs as a result of the Express
transaction.
The sustaining CapEx for the quarter were up about $4 million over last – first quarter of 2012. In the first quarter
versus our budget, we are actually – spent less than what we budgeted. So there's a favorable variance. But for the full –
that's just timing, for the full year, we expect the sustaining CapEx will be on budget.
The certain items in the quarter total $137 million benefit, $141 million of that is the gain on the sale of Express.
And so, that really takes you through KMP. As Rich said, we expect at this point to be on our budget for the year.
Looking at KMP's balance sheet. The only thing I'll point out to you here is that we had to – under the accounting rules,
we have to recast KMP for the drop downs. What that means is we have to go back and restate KMP's 12/31 balance
sheet to include the assets that were dropped down as of March 1.
The primary impact that you're going to see on the balance sheet as a result of that is you're going to see a big negative
of about $490 million in Partners' capital and that's because we're separating the transaction; you're separating when
you put the assets on your balance sheet from when you pay for the assets. And so, when we put the assets on the
balance sheet – now they're on our balance sheet as of 12/31, there's a big positive. When you pay for them, then you
have a negative in Partners' capital. And so that's what you're seeing in the change in Partners' capital between
December 31 and March 31.
Looking at debt to EBITDA, we ended the quarter at 3.9 times; that's up. Now, what you see on the face of the balance
sheet is four times at the end of December. But, again, that's a result of the recast. Where we actually ended December
last year was at 3.7 times. The debt to EBITDA is up as a result of the acquisitions and we only have one month of
EPNG and midstream in our EBITDA, but we've got a – all of the debt in the total debt outstanding. So we still expect
KMP to end the year at 3.7 times, consistent with its budget.
Total debt, we ended at $7.22 billion. That's up from $15.35 billion at the end of last year. Again, the $15.35 billion is
where we really ended. You can see the recast number is $16.5 billion. So the increase in debt from where we actually
ended, $1.87 billion increase in debt in the quarter.
And just going through the primary uses of that. The acquisitions were $1.1 billion. That was $1.655 billion was the
acquisition price on the drop downs. That included $558 million of KMP's allocable share of the EPNG debt. That's
your $1.1 billion of acquisitions.
Then as a result of acquiring the other 50% of EPNG, all of EPNG's debt came on to KMP's balance sheet. It was
previously an equity investment and that debt was not on KMP's balance sheet. So you have $1.115 billion that came
on as a result of that.
We had expansion CapEx of about $480 million and we had contributions to equity investments of a little under $90
million. The primary contributions to equity investments was a $45 million contribution to Midstream to pay off a
revolver that was down there. So that's a $2.78 billion use of cash between those items.

We generated about $400 million in proceeds from the sale of Express, and then we raised about $650 million in equity
between the units that were issued to KMI, a KMP offering and the KMR dividend.
And then we had about $139 million use of cash in the quarter for working capital and other items. That's primarily
associated with accrued interest, most of KMP's interest payments on its bonds occur in the first quarter and in the third
quarter.
So that's KMP.
I will now turn to EPB. Again, first page in package is EPB's GAAP income statement. I will skip over that and focus
on the calculation of distributable cash flow. EPB generated DCF per unit in the quarter of $0.78. That's up $0.09 or
13% over a year ago. Based on the distribution that we declare today of $0.62, that's coverage in the quarter of about
$30 million.
Similar to KMP, EPB generates excess coverage in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter. And we expect it will
have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter, but will have coverage consistent with its budget for
the full year.
DCF in total $169 million. That's up $26 million from the first quarter a year ago. Looking at the components of the
$26 million increase in DCF. The first line on the DCF calculation: earnings before DD&A and certain items, $317
million in the quarter. That's up $34 million versus the first quarter of 2012.
In addition, that doesn't tell the whole story, as we've talked about in prior quarters. EPB was acquiring partial interest
in assets from El Paso and they – what happens is from accounting perspective, they record 100% of the income and
then on the piece of that asset they don't own, they record an expense down below called non-controlling interest.
As a result of acquiring 100% of certain assets, primarily the remaining 14% interest in CIG, there is lower
non-controlling interest in the first quarter of 2013 than there was in the first quarter of 2012. So that's an additional of
$8 million that the assets generated, so in total, the $34 million plus the $8 million, $42 million increase in the
performance of the assets. About $28 million of that is a result of acquisitions. And the balance largely as a result of the
performance on SNG, due to the expansion projects and also to improved or lower O&M.
G&A in the quarter, $20 million expense. That's down from $30 million a year ago, so a $10 million improvement.
And that's just the cost savings that Rich mentioned that we're achieving of – that's EPB's portion of the $400 million.
Interest is $75 million expense in the quarter. That's a $6 million increase from a year ago, largely as a result of higher
balance, given the expansions and the acquisitions.
Sustaining CapEx is lower by about $3 million and then the GP incentive is higher by about $24 million. That gets you
to $25 million of the $26 million, so there's about $1 million in other items.
For the year, EPB overall is on track to meet its budget, and there aren't any significant variances in the major line
items that we use to calculate DCF.
On EPB's balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter at 3.7 times debt to EBITDA. That's down a little bit from the 3.9 times
at year-end. That's largely – that improvement is largely timing. We still expect to end the year at 3.9 times, consistent
with our budget.
EPB's debt in the quarter, we ended at $4.14 billion of debt. That's down about $93 million. Just to reconcile that debt
for you, we spent a little over $20 million in expansion CapEx. EPB started an ATM program and issued about $22
million under its ATM program during the quarter. We had about $35 million of coverage. And then working capital
was a source of cash of about $58 million, largely as a result of the timing on interest payments.
So with that, I'll move to KMI and its cash available to pay dividends. The first page of the KMI numbers, the cash
available per share, as Rich mentioned, $0.49. That's up $0.07 or 16%. That compares to our dividend of $0.38, so we
have over $100 million – we've got about over $115 million of coverage in the quarter.

Similar to both KMP and EPB, at KMI, we expect excess coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and excess
coverage for the year. Actually, we're going to be right on top for the year of coverage. And the second and the third
quarter are negative coverage, given the timing of certain cash tax payments and interest payments.
The cash available to pay dividends $513 million. That's up $210 million or 69% from the first quarter in 2012.
Looking at what drove that growth of $210 million, the cash generated from the two MLPs, up a $199 million. The
cash generated by – from KMP, up $94 million, of that $81 million was associated with the GP interest. And the
balance, $13 million was associated with our interest in the limited partner units.
EPB up $105 million, as a result of the acquisition that occurred subsequent to the first quarter in 2012. The expenses at
G&A interest and cash taxes, actually, a $23-million benefit when you compare the first quarter of 2012 to the first
quarter of 2013. And that's largely a result of some debt that was paid down, some KMI debt that was paid down when
it matured with the drop down proceeds last August.
If you look cash – G&A expenses, up $8 million quarter-to-quarter. That's a function of the acquisition. Interest
expense I mentioned is a positive. Cash taxes are also a positive, but that's just timing. As we outlined in our budget,
we expect cash taxes in 2013 to be higher than they were in 2012. And then the cash available from other assets, $100
million increase and that's a result of the acquisition.
And then you can see that is offset by the debt that we assumed in the El Paso acquisition and the acquisition debt. So
that that – those assets less the debt that was either assumed or issued was about a $12 million increase in expense
between the two quarters. And that gets you the $210 million increase for the quarter.
Turning to KMI's balance sheet. KMI ended the quarter $9.375 billion of debt. KMI's balance sheet, like KMP's
balance sheet, has been recast, so you can see the 12/31 debt at $10.23 billion. Actually, where we ended 2012 was at
$11.4 billion of debt. So you basically – we have a little over $2 billion repayment of debt at KMI in the first quarter.
Just the major items that drove that. The proceeds from the drop down were about $988 million. The debt that moves to
KMP associated to those drop downs, as we talked about on KMP, $1.115 billion. We sold the Bolivia to Brazil
Pipeline and got a little under $90 million. We made a contribution to our pension, which is about $50 million use of
cash. We repurchased about $80 million worth of warrants. And then we had contributions to equity investments of
about $48 million. The largest piece of that was the $45 million contribution to Midstream to repay its revolver. Then
there's about $24 million in other items to get you to the $2.04 billion reduction in debt.
So that's all I have.

Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your
line is open.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good afternoon, Rich. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: How are you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good thanks. I've got a question – actually two questions about the CO2 business and this
goes back to some of the comments that you made with regard to expanding the source fields in Southwest Colorado.
But as you're talking with these Permian producers, you guys obviously have a pretty good sense of the timing of CO2

production, as that ramps concurrent with the expectations for crude production growth and it seems like that could
drive a lot of incremental volume commitments on the Freedom Line.
So from a source field perspective, is the right way to think about those compression additions that you referenced at
Doe Canyon and McElmo Dome still tracking about $500 million in total cost for both? And a target in terms of
volume ramp may be around the second and the fourth quarter of 2014 respectively?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Go ahead, Jim Wuerth.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah. The costs are right on budget with – and I think with both those together it's about
$500 million. We should have – expand at Doe. We should be getting most of that expansion done in the volumes by
the end of this year, in fact, in the fourth quarter. And then towards the end of 2014 for the Yellow Jacket facility.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay and then taking that one step further, that new source field on the Arizona-New
Mexico border, I assume you're talking about expanding Saint John's, so – and I recognize you're still in the assessment
phase there. But is the right way to continue to think about that roughly a $2 billion project cost that could possibly get
to 650 MMcf a day throughput? And that would basically feed the Cortez line? And am I thinking about that the right
way?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah, we've reduced the cost quite a bit and looking at a $200 million case and then we'll
start with that. And I think those numbers are around $600 million. And we – yes, we would hit into the Cortez
Pipeline, just south of Albuquerque.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay, that's all I had. Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay.
Operator
Next we have Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ted, how are you doing?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: I'm doing well, thanks, Rich. Just on the Freedom side here, you've got this number, the 277,000
barrels a day. I guess I'm wondering, it seems like a pretty precise number, how did you get to that number? Is that
what you need to get to sort of a certain hurdle rate? Or kind of return that you'd need? And then maybe you can talk
about the kind of tariff you'd need to get to the economics you want on that pipeline?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well the 277,000 is just what the engineering studies showed with the result – would be the
result in capacity from the way we intend to build it. That's not the number of barrels we would need. We would need
fewer barrels than that. I think we said publicly, we need around 200,000 barrels a day to make the thing hunt
economically. As far as the tariff, Tom Martin's here. Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, it's in the neighborhood of about $5. Is kind of what we've been pitching to the
market.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: About $5 and so we, again, as I said, we have an open season underway now and if we get
the kind of commitments that we hope to get, this will be a go project. If we don't, we'll obviously reassess. We're not
building it for our health; we're building it only if we can make money on it. So that's where we stand on it and we're
just in the middle of the open season now. I've had good conversations, but we'll see how that translates into volumes.
As I've said before, it would seem to be a marriage made in heaven. You've got certainly trend line toward increasingly
excess production in the Permian. And you've got West Coast refiners that are spending hellacious amounts of money
on crude supply. And you would think that paying a reasonable amount of money to bridge those two, the source and

the demand would make sense but, again, that's up to our customers.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. That's helpful thanks. The next one for me is just on the terminals here. It looks like kind
of flat year-over-year results. You're now saying probably below budget. I guess I'm trying to understand is that just
kind of continuation of the trends we saw in the first quarter with the weak coal volumes, petcoke volumes? How do
you see that shaping up for the rest of the year?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, first of all we had a 12% growth in the Terminals for the year and we'll get very close
to that. So when we say slightly below budget, we're still, for the year, going to have very nice growth. We have some
things coming online later in the year. So certainly it's not going to be flat to 2012. We're going to have growth. We're
just not going to have quite chin the bar at that 12% growth that we have in the budget. John Schlosser, you want to
add?
<A - John W. Schlosser>: The other thing I'd add is the petcoke vol – our earnings were off $2.3 million and that was
associated with four outages at major refineries here in the Gulf Coast, so we don't expect that to recur in the out
quarters.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Great. And then this is small one. I think it's a small one for you but I want to make sure this –
all this REN noise – the renewable credits, I guess, is that anything that we should think about as being an impact to
you? An opportunity or a cost? Just how do we think about the RENs for you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, it's a positive for us because we generate excess RENs at our transmix facilities. And
then how much of an upside for us is – depends on the price of the RENs. We're pretty definite on how many RENs
we're going to – excess RENs we're going to generate and it's about 700,000 gallons a month...
<A - James P. Wuerth>: That's right, Rich, 700,000.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And so today, those prices are running $0.65, $0.70, so you could multiply that out and
that's how much per month we could make from it. But they were as low as $0.10 a few months ago. They've been as
high as I think $1.08 or $1.10 at one point. So we're just – we're selling them on a monthly basis to a customer who
wants to take all that we have and so we'll just see what it results in.
So it'll be upside. The question is how much and that we don't know. We'll just play it month by month and that's not in
any of the projection that Kim's talking about when she says Products is going to slightly exceed its plan for the year.
We haven't counted anything on additional REN sales, although we recognize about $1.9 million I think, Ron, of sales
in the first quarter?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: First quarter.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah.
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: $1.9 million.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.

Next, we have Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Hi, thanks for the call. A couple questions, first, on LNG. Is the focus on off-takers that are
really interested more in FTA country exports just natural conservatism? Or do you think that it's just going to be very
tough to get incremental DOE non-FTA approvals? And do you see the recent rise in gas prices in the States affecting
both the appetite and potential pricing for those long-term contracts?

Page 11 of 13
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, first of all, I think the answer as to why we're concentrating on FTA is a combination
of two things you mentioned: that we are conservative about it; and secondly, we're not sure what the non-FTA process
is.
I mean, just as recently as yesterday at a conference I guess the undersecretary who's charged with making this decision
said that he didn't know when they would make the decision; that they had to consider a lot of factors. They've had a
couple studies already, both of which said we should export, but we don't have a decision yet.
So I think in the end and I've said this before, our view is that there will be substantial amounts of non-FTA approved,
particularly for those plants that have good contracts with viable creditworthy companies. But we can't guarantee that
that's going to happen. So we've concentrated on the FTA.
And as I said in my remarks, the beauty of the deal with Shell at Elba Island is that that whole first phase is not
contingent on getting the non-FTA approval. Now at the Gulf, where we have more space, more opportunity there in
terms of sizing, we're working with some customers there to do a non-FTA train, excuse me, an FTA train. And then
we're working with other customers to work on non-FTA volumes too.
But again, our first preference is to get FTAs signed up because there we have projects we can depend on and know
that they're going forward, so that's our feeling.
As far as the gas price increase, I don't know how much a weekly or monthly movement really means. I don't believe
anybody thought that the Henry Hub price of supply, looking out over the life of an LNG contract, was going to stay at
$2 or $2.50, where it was this time last year.
But certainly, if the perception becomes that gas prices are meaningfully higher, then that will have some impact I
suppose on how willing players are to enter into contracts. You have to remember, of course, that the disconnect
between the landed prices for LNG, particularly in Japan and rest of Asia to a lesser extent versus the price of the
Henry Hub, even when adding in the liquefaction and transportation expenses, is still enormous.
There's still a big spread there between the landed cost and the cost of landed price and the cost of delivering. So I think
there's still money to be made there. But that arc may well change, may well close and, obviously, we're not betting on
that. We're just looking for customers who want to take a swing at those things and make a lot of money. And we're
happy to just get a minimum return on our little assets that we're going to build for them.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And just want to follow up on Darren's questions on CO2. Is the CO2 supply more than
EOR really driving expectations for outperformance for the year? And on EOR, do you see production continuing to
surprise to the upside?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think, first of all, starting with the second question, on the EOR side, we were off to
a very good start, particularly SACROC, which was hugely above this quarter last year and a good bit above our plan
for the first quarter. And these NGL volumes also running above our plan and at record levels, and we expect those to
continue.
Now we're going to have – well, we have a train down now and that curtails for a couple of weeks some of our NGLs.
So you may not have exactly the same numbers we had in the first quarter, but we expect both of those will be very
strong for the year.
Katz had a very nice increase quarter-over-quarter and we're continuing to see growth over there. We're now running –
in April, for example, we're up to 2,400 barrels, a little over 2,400 barrels a day there. So that's a nice increase, even
over the first quarter. So I think all of our EOR activities, our oil production looks good for the year and we expect that
to continue.
The supply side of it, the CO2 amount, I think, is more a long-term driver. As Jim Wuerth said, we will have some of
that, particularly at Doe online we think in the October-November timeframe, which will help us some. We're
curtailing now and at Doe alone, we think we can take the production up from about [ph] 105 a day to 170 (50:25) a
day. So to the extent we can sell [ph] 65 (50:30) million cubic feet a day of CO2 for a couple of months, that'll be a

nice little driver in the last couple of months, but it's not the major driver.
The major driver, I think, in the long run is getting that production from Southwest Colorado up to the full 1.4 Bcf a
day and then that should happen by next year. And then getting to St. John's field on, in which case we'll be at 1.6 Bcf
or maybe a little better. And that's where I think the upstream or the supply side becomes a real driver.

[Operator Instructions] Our next one comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Brad, how're you doing?
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Good. On the Cochin project that you guys have discussed going from Illinois to Alberta, you
obviously have an eastern segment of that pipeline, which there's been no reversal plans announced yet. But given the
prospect of a lot of condensate basically without a market in Ohio, as the Utica gets ramped up, is that a project that
you're continuing to look at? And have you discussed that with potential customers?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, we continue to look at that. There are a couple of interesting alternatives for that
eastern segment. Ron McClain, anything you want to add to that?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: We've looked at several opportunities and actively pursuing it. We don't have a project yet,
but we do think it's part of the ultimate solution for some of those products that's going to come out of that area. So
we're working with several people on it.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. Thanks on the Tennessee Gas asset, you – the asset runs through a potentially productive
area in Northwest Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio. One of your competitors recently announced a project to provide
gathering and processing services in that area. Is that an area where – especially given your past relationships with
Petrohawk, given that Halcón is talking about that being a big area for them, is that an area that you expect to
potentially use your Tennessee Gas footprint to build out a gathering and processing asset base there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Tom Martin?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, I mean, we are – in our Midstream segment, we're actively pursuing gathering and
processing opportunities in the Utica, as well as the Marcellus. We're really focusing on the Utica right now, been
pursuing that over the last several months and really starting to see a little traction there at this point. So it'll be both dry
gas and rich gas gathering, as well as processing and we're pursuing that, those opportunities right now.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. Thank you. And just one more housekeeping question, can you provide utilization rates on
the oil and condensate line out of the Eagle Ford? And if you have the numbers available, a breakout of oil versus
condensate volumes?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, what we have on the Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate Line is it has capacity of
300,000 barrels a day. As we've publicly said, our original contract with Petrohawk, now BHP, was 25,000 barrels a
day in the first year and then ramping up to 50,000 barrels a day beginning in the middle of this year, of 2013. And that
throughput alone was sufficient to make it a very viable project economically.
Since then, we've added Phillips 66 as a customer. We've publicly announced this. They have taken additional capacity
of about 20,000 barrels a day on it. We're very close to adding another customer. In fact our board approved today the
expenditures for it; that will add another 25,000 barrels a day. And we have still another customer that we think is
probably another 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day.

So that's – kind of gives you an idea of the ramp up in volumes there. We see that as it's going to be an extraordinarily
good investment for us because there's just a lot of people, a lot of producers that want to get to the Houston Ship
Channel and that's what we provide them. And then sort of as a step out from that, of course, I think that helped us
secure the contracts to build the condensate splitter on our Houston Ship Channel property, which is the $360 million
project that I referred to earlier.
So we've got long way to go, a lot of upside on KMCC that we'll just see how it plays out in the future.
