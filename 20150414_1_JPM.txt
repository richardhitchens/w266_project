MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2015 earnings call. This call is being
recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please standby.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available
on our website. Please refer to display mat regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation.
So starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $5.9 billion for the quarter and EPS of $1.45 a share, and a
return on tangible common equity of 14%, on revenue of nearly $25 billion, up 4% year on year, reflecting strong
performance. The quarter was characterized by a constructive environment supporting broad strength in underlying
performance. We saw higher levels of volatility in client activity on the back of a number of macro events driving
higher market revenues. We also saw strength across IB fees and core loan growth was strong up 10% year on year.
Included in the results was firm-wide legal expense of approximately $500 million after-tax. Outside of legal, other
small and notable items on a net basis did not contribute significantly to the results which means that a more core
earnings number would have been well the other side of $6 billion. Adjusted expense, which excludes legal, was $14.2
billion, down $100 million from the fourth quarter with an adjusted overhead ratio of 57%. And outside of a modest

reserve build for oil and gas, which I'll come back to, credit trends remained benign and firm-wide net charge-offs
remained low at $1.1 billion. We continue to make progress against our capital targets, reaching a fully phased-in
CET1 ratio of 10.6% while returning over $3 billion to shareholders in the quarter.
Finally, we're pleased that we did not receive an objection to our capital plan and the board announced its intention to
increase the quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.44 a share and authorized gross share repurchases of $6.4 billion. Before I
move on, you'll notice we streamlined our earnings press release for the quarter to simplify the format and focus in on
key messages.
Skipping over page two, turning to page three and our balance sheet. As I said, the firm's fully phased-in CET1 ratio
advanced with 10.6%, up about 45 basis points quarter on quarter, with earnings, model benefits and the combined
impacts of portfolio runoff and other RWA reductions being offset by capital distributions. The fully phased-in
standardized CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up from 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014. While we made very good progress
during the first quarter, the pace of capital accretion during the year won't be linear, particularly given the timing of
model benefit. We continue to expect our ratio to be 11%, plus or minus, at the end of this year. The firm and the bank
SLR improved slightly from last quarter at 5.7% and 6% respectively.
On the next page, on page four, we've added a new page on our balance sheet, given the objectives we outlined at
Investor Day on non-operating deposits, so turn to page four.
As you look at the balance sheet, it's important to look both on an average and on a spot basis. If you look on the left,
our average balance sheet is higher by $46 billion, which reflects a significant ramp up in deposits in the fourth quarter.
But if you look next to that, you can see on a spot basis that March is actually relatively flat to December. And if you
move to the right, end-of-period deposits are also flat quarter on quarter, but with a relatively significant mix shift
towards retail deposits, with other deposits down $24 billion, predominantly driven by client actions related to
non-operating deposits, reflecting good progress towards our goal in what has effectively been a matter of weeks since
Investor Day.
We're actively engaged with our clients and working with them to implement plans to further reduce these deposits, and
we expect the second quarter to be meaningful in this context. We're still committed to our goal of reducing them by up
to $100 billion by the end of the year.
Moving on to NIM and NII, it's the higher average cash balances on deposit growth as well as some asset reductions
that drove the seven basis point compression in NIM. And in terms of NII, day count was a large driver of the decline.
Turning to page five and Consumer & Community Banking, the combined Consumer businesses generated $2.2 billion
of net income for the quarter and an ROE of 17%. Revenue of $10.7 billion was up 2% year on year, driven by healthy
growth in balances and in non-interest revenue, partially offset by spread compression. Revenue declined 2%
sequentially reported, or 4% if you were to exclude the loss in the fourth quarter associated with portfolio exits in card,
and this decline is driven by seasonality in NIR as well as fewer days in the quarter.
We remain focused on the customer experience and on our strong customer satisfaction rankings, and we continue to
grow households and see very low levels of attrition, and we're deepening relationships. Our average deposits are now
over $0.5 trillion, up 9% year on year. We have record client investment assets, up 12%. Our active mobile customer
base is up 22%, card sales volume up 8%. And our overall loan book grew for the third consecutive quarter, with core
loan growth of 15% year on year.
And across CCB, we remain disciplined on expense management. Year-on-year expenses were lower by nearly $250
million, and our head count is down about 1,900 so far this year. And you'll recall that at Investor Day, we committed
to reduce expenses by about $2 billion in 2017 relative to 2014. And while it will not be exactly linear, you should
assume a meaningful down payment towards that $2 billion in 2015.
Moving to page six, Consumer & Business Banking, CBB generated net income of $828 million for the quarter, up
10% year on year, and with an ROE of 28%. We continued to see robust performance across our drivers. Average
deposit balance growth was up 9%, up $39 billion from last year. And in Business Banking, the momentum we saw in

2014 carried over into 2015 and supported loan originations of $1.5 billion, up 2% year on year, but with average loan
balances up 6%, also driven by higher utilization rates.
These underlying drivers helped offset the impact of the low rate environment. NII was down 5% quarter on quarter, in
line with our guidance, on lower deposit margin, which was down 12 basis points, driven by lower reinvestment rates
as well as day count. NIR, while down seasonally quarter on quarter, was up 5% year on year due to strong client
investment and debit revenues. Expenses were down 3% year on year, reflecting continued improvement in branch
efficiency.
Mortgage Banking on page seven, you'll notice we simplified the reporting for Mortgage Banking here. It's now
consistent with the other CCB lines of business, but the additional detail by sub-line of business is still available in our
earnings supplement.
So overall net income was $326 million for the quarter. Originations were strong at $25 billion, up 7% quarter on
quarter, as we maintained share in a larger market and realized higher revenue margins. And we added $15 billion of
high-quality loans in the quarter to our balance sheet, driving slightly higher NII quarter on quarter despite fewer days.
Although production was higher, our total revenue declined quarter on quarter on lower repurchase benefit and lower
servicing revenue.
Expense of $1.2 billion was down 6% quarter on quarter and down 13% year on year, but excluding legal would have
been down 19% year on year, over $0.25 billion despite higher volumes as we continue to tightly control our costs.
On credit, we continue to see improvements in home prices and delinquencies and released $100 million of NCI
reserves this quarter. And you can see the net charge-off rate at 30 basis points was down 25 basis points year on year.
Moving on to Cards, Commerce Solutions & Auto, net income of $1.1 billion, down 3% year on year, with an ROE of
22%. But excluding reserve releases, net income was up 11%. In the quarter we moved our commercial card loans to
the CIB to align with the client relationships. This was a $1.3 billion reduction in card loan balances, and relatively
modest impact of less than $50 million on each of revenue and expense.
Revenue of $4.6 billion was relatively flat year on year, with a Card revenue rate of 12.2% in line with guidance on
solid sales growth and reflecting continued investment in acquisitions. And in Auto, we saw solid loan and lease
growth partially offset by spread compression. Expense was up 2% year on year, predominately driven by higher Auto
lease depreciation.
In Card we saw end of period loan growth of $3 billion, excluding the commercial card transfer I just mentioned, and
we saw sales growth of 8%. This sales growth is lower than recent growth rates, which have typically been in the
double digits, reflecting the impact of lower gas prices, estimated to be about 200 basis points as well as a generally
competitive environment.
In Commerce Solutions, we're gaining share. Volume was up 13% year on year driven by continued strong spend as
well as the addition of new merchants.
And in Auto, results continued to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales and stable used car values. It was the 14th
consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth with average balances up 6% year on year.
Year-to-date, the pipeline remains healthy, reflecting continued strength in the market as well as the strength of our
manufacturing partners. Finally on credit, card delinquency rates and net charge-offs remained low.
On page nine, the Corporate & Investment Bank. CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $9.6 billion,
and an ROE of 16%. Revenue was up 8% year on year as market conditions in the quarter benefited both Investment
Banking and Markets, and our businesses performed well. In Banking, our IB fees of $1.8 billion were up 22% year on
year.
We continue to rank number one in global IB fees with 8.6% share, up 100 basis points since last year. Advisory fees
were up 42%, which was a strong start for both JPMorgan as well as the market with some large transactions. In fact,

this was our highest first quarter on record and we saw share gains of 150 basis points. Debt underwriting fees were up
16%, driven by acquisition financing. Aside from that, debt issuance was generally lower. And equity underwriting fees
were up 13% in a market that was up only 4%. Our wallet rank improved to number one both globally and in the U.S.
Looking forward for IB fees, we had some notable large transactions in the first quarter and so we do expect the second
quarter to be lower, although our pipeline remains strong. Treasury Services revenue of $1 billion was down 2% year
on year, mainly driven by lower deposit NII and lower trade finance revenue. And Lending revenue was $353 million,
up 9% given dividends on restructured securities.
Moving on to Markets revenue of $5.7 billion, was up 9% year on year. But if you exclude business simplification,
both Total Markets as well as Fixed Income Markets would have been up 20%. A number of macro events occurred in
the quarter including Central Bank actions, the Swiss Bank decoupling, a stronger dollar and oil price volatility, which
supported Markets performance broadly and Currencies/Emerging Markets, Rates, Commodities and Equities. In fact,
Equities had one of its strongest quarters, up 22%, with strength in derivatives and cash in particular across the U.S.
and Asia.
The first half of the quarter for FICC was particularly strong. The market has absorbed a number of the macro events at
this point, and recent sentiment is that the Fed will act later rather than sooner this year. As a result, while we are still
seeing good client flow and volatility does remain elevated, it is somewhat lower coming into second quarter.
With respect to business simplification, in the second quarter it will have an overall neutral impact to our P&L but will
have or drive a $300 million decline year on year in revenue, with a $300 million offset in lower expenses.
Securities Services revenue, $934 million, was down 9% year on year, driven by two factors. First, the impact of
change in presentation for client revenue-sharing agreements in our ADR issuance business. Effective this quarter,
these pass through repayments to clients will be treated as a reduction of revenue, having formally been treated as an
expense but with no P&L impact. Second, at the end of the fourth quarter of last year, there was a significant client exit
and the revenue impact of this is reflected in this quarter's results. So for the remainder of 2015, given those two facts,
we expect Securities Services revenue to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion a quarter depending on
seasonality.
Lastly on expense, total expense was $5.7 billion, up 1% year on year with a comp to revenue ratio of 32% for the
quarter, flat year on year, and an overhead ratio of 59%. Non-compensation expense declined due to business
simplification, partially offset by higher legal expense year on year.
Moving on to page 10 and the Commercial Bank. It was a strong quarter with respect to the underlying fundamentals in
this business. Another record quarter for investment banking revenue with gross revenues of over $750 million. In
absolute dollars, it was our strongest quarter ever for loan growth, adding over $5 billion in loans across C&I and CRE,
and revolver utilization was at its highest level since 2009. Credit quality remained exceptional with continued loan net
charge-offs of only 3 basis points.
So overall financial performance for the quarter was solid. Net income was $600 million on $1.7 billion of revenue, and
an ROE of 17%. Revenue increased 4% year on year, driven by record investment banking revenue which was up
nearly 70%, on increased equity underwriting and M&A activity, was partially offset by continued yield compression.
Expenses increased 3% year on year as we continued to invest in controls, but our overhead ratio was consistent with
the prior year. We're reaching a peak in control cost in this business and you should expect expenses to stabilize from
here. Loan balances increased 11% year on year and 3% quarter on quarter. C&I loans grew 4% sequentially in line
with the industry, driven by higher utilization in our Corporate Client Banking book. And in CRE, loan growth was
3%, continuing to exceed the industry on strong activity in both multifamily lending as well as real estate banking.
Finally, on credit and reserves, for the full firm, we added a little over $100 million to reserves relating to oil and gas
exposure this quarter, the majority of which is here in the commercial bank. We review our energy exposure on a
name-by-name basis and under a range of commodity price assumptions. This quarter's reserve build reflects
downgrades in the E&P portfolio and if the current price environment continues, it's reasonable to expect some further

reserve builds during 2015 but relatively modest.
However, in the context of a funded portfolio of $15 billion, this is a very modest build and it's fully within the range of
our expectations at this part of the cycle for energy. And although we're taking reserves, it is not clear that it will
translate into credit losses as the industry and our clients are not standing still but actively working to manage liquidity
and leverage in the face of lower prices.
Moving to page 11 and Asset Management. A good quarter in Asset Management, net income of $500 million, an ROE
of 22%, and 27% pre-tax margin on $3 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 7% year on year, driven by flows and
higher banking balances. And expense of $2.2 billion was up 5% year on year, primarily driven by investments in
infrastructure and controls and including modest legal expenses. This marks the 24th consecutive quarter of long-term
net inflows at $16 billion, driving record AUM of $1.8 trillion, up 7% year on year and client assets of $2.4 trillion,
with strength in multi-asset and equity flows.
In banking, we reported strong balances in both lending and deposits. Average loan balances were up 8% year on year
and average deposits up 6%. And we reported strong investment performance, with 79% of mutual fund AUM ranked
in the first or second quartiles over five years.
Turning to Corporate and turning to page 12, Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $221 million, but the results
included a loss in the quarter of $173 million pre-tax, primarily due to a timing impact of costs associated with certain
non-operating deposits we plan to exit. On Other Corporate, as we've completed the spinoff of OEP and other portfolio
sales during the first quarter, the remaining private equity business is not expected to be a significant contributor to the
firm's earnings. Therefore, beginning this quarter and going forward, we will be disclosing our corporate private equity
results as part of Other Corporate. This quarter, private equity contributed a modest positive to the results. Also
included in the results of Other Corporate, the $300 million pre-tax of legal expense, which is largely offset by $177
million of net income from tax items.
Moving to page 13 and the outlook, I addressed most of this guidance through the presentation. I just want to highlight
a couple of items. First in CCB and the Consumer businesses, a couple of geography points relative to analyst models.
We guided in the fourth quarter to expect the first quarter's Consumer Bank revenues to be down on deposit margin
compression. We saw that this quarter as expected, and we expect deposit margins to remain pressured as rates remain
low.
In the Mortgage Bank, at Investor Day we guided for revenues to be down approximately $1 billion for the year, on
lower servicing revenues as well as lower repurchase benefits. We saw some of that this quarter and that guidance
remains. Against that, as I said earlier, across CCB, we do expect to deliver a meaningful portion of the $2 billion
expense reduction guidance in 2015.
Finally on this page, on Asset Management for the full year, expect the pre-tax margin and ROE to be at the low end of
the through-the-cycle target range.
So wrapping up, a strong result for the quarter in a constructive environment, we saw strong market and transaction
activity despite continued margin compression. The performance continued to reflect the strength of each of our
franchises, strong Markets revenue and IB fees, 9% growth in retail deposits, 10% core loan growth, and good progress
against our capital, our balance sheet, and our expense commitments.
With that, operator, please open up the line to questions.

<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Hello there. Just one quick clarification question on the – the performance in equities was
great, and you mentioned it's pretty much across the board. Do you think there's any seasonality, any one-time events,
block trades, anything like that that would lift such good performance in the quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: There wasn't anything particularly noteworthy in terms of one-time events. It was really quite
broad, particularly in derivatives. In cash, the performance was I would say solid year over year because we saw
strength in the Americas this year, where we had strength in Europe last year. And I think the first quarter 2014 wasn't
particularly strong, so I think we were flattered a little bit with the relative comparison, but it was a really strong
absolute and we think probably strong relative performance.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: And maybe this is a related question, but I'm not sure which line it would flow through.
From what I understand, you guys and others have been pushing or talking with your prime brokerage clients to help
improve ROAs in the business. Is part of that flowing through in just better equity performance, more business with
clients?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, this is where it would be. I wouldn't say it's a driver, but we are, as you said, and the
whole industry is looking to work with clients to optimize the use of balance sheet and improve returns. So we've seen
some of that, but I wouldn't say it was a key driver.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: Okay. Switching gears, in Jamie's letter he talked about mentioning the need to push the
new G-SIB rules to the product and the client level.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Glenn Paul Schorr>: And it piqued my curiosity. I'm just curious. How different is that from what you've already
done? In other words, each step of the way you've been early in adopting and pushing out to the desk level higher
capital charges. Does this just mean more of the same, meaning higher capital charge, higher capital charge, or is there
something different there that you need to do?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, it is more of the same. Obviously, G-SIB took on a slightly heightened focus when we had
some doubling happen in the proposal in December, so we've always been measuring and monitoring and tracking
G-SIB at a very granular level. But we are obviously on a path now to aggressively manage it, which means that we're
going to be just a little bit more focused on that constraint, not uniquely also with advanced capital, standardized limits,
balance sheet caps and alike. So it's more of the same, honestly, Glenn, just a heightened focus on this, given the U.S.
proposal and given the impact of, at least at this point, FX translation.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And different than RWA, it affects certain products more than others and we pointed out
non-operating deposits, stuff like that. Certain businesses more than others, we pointed out clearing, and certain clients
more than others, we pointed out financial institutions. So just that kind of multi-variant theme is not mystical, and
we're actually already starting to reprice some of these businesses to get an adequate return in G-SIB capital. And we're
seeing other people do that too.
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's right. We may be in a different position with G-SIB, but others are leverage constrained.
And just generally speaking, we are starting to see a lot more discipline around balance sheet, and pricing is following
somewhat generally.

Yes. Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, good morning, Marianne. I was wondering on net interest income, do you have an
outlook for how the net interest income dollars could trend from here, assuming that you don't get much help from
higher rates, what are the key drivers? And what's kind of your outlook for NIM and NII dollars for the year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So again, assuming for a second that rates don't rise until the back end if not the end of the
year, and we can come back to that if you like, we would expect our NII dollars to be stable to slightly up, because
we're still seeing growth in our interest-earning assets. Obviously this quarter we were down some on day count. It was
a big chunk of the quarter-on-quarter reduction. So we're really going to see the biggest lift in NII when we do see
front-end rates rise, and we'll see when that is.
And similarly on our NIM, we would expect NIM to be stable, particularly given, as we talked about, what we've seen
dilute our NIM more particularly over the course of the last year or two has been this significant increase in cash, and
we're going to see some of that at least stabilize in turn as we start to reduce our non-operating deposits. So we should
see our NIM relatively stable and again start to rise when rates rise.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Erika.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes, good morning. On the CCAR, do you expect any potential surcharges on the CCAR to
come out when the U.S. final rules on SIFI buffers come out? And in addition to that, have you learned anything from
the CCAR in terms of the transparency of the process? Is there progression in terms of the back and forth with the
regulators as you go through the CCAR process and their expectations?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Taking your first point, Erika, obviously, I don't know. The next time we're going to, in all
likelihood, get CCAR instructions including the rules and the minimums is likely to be sometime towards the end of
this year for the next CCAR cycle as we get prepared to deliver that. So all I can say is what you know, which is clearly
the door was left open for the minimum to be increased or potentially to include some element of a surcharge. We're
hopeful that that won't be the case because we would say the surcharge should be carried in baseline times to be used in
stressed and to have all firms end up well capitalized afterwards, but have no more insights than that for you.
With respect to the dialogue with the Fed, look, it's definitely much, much further progressed than it was two years and
three years ago, and every year it gets better in terms of the bilateral conversation, and it's constructive. I don't think,
however, you could today or will likely ever be able to characterize it as transparent and clear, maybe potentially by
design in terms of understanding or being able to reconcile exactly what their models do and what their results are
driven by. So I won't be able to clarify for you what changed in their results or what differed between ours and theirs,
but the dialogue itself is definitely more constructive and more bilateral and more continuous.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: The drop in the adjusted expense is I think about 3% year-over-year came in a little
bit better than we were thinking, while revenues were also a little bit better. Obviously, you've got a lot of cost saving
programs underway that you mentioned earlier in the call and at Investor Day. But should we think that maybe you're
running ahead of schedule or that the cost saves could be more, or is it just lumpiness as we kind of go
quarter-to-quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think the best way to answer that is that we are still firmly with our guidance as adjusted
expense of being $57 billion, plus or minus, by the end of the year – or for the year, sorry. Obviously, we will always
try and outperform that but I wouldn't characterize one quarter as a change in our guidance at this point.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, obviously, a big company out there announced it's
exiting most of its banking assets and just wondering if there's any interest or appetite within your commercial bank to
bulk up the acquisition there in terms of asset purchases versus a complete company.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, the most important thing obviously in all of that is that we were delighted to be able
to partner with the large company on their strategic transformation and that's most important thing about that
transaction for us. I'm not going to comment specifically on whether or what JPMorgan would be interested in, in terms
of asset purchases. We are much more focused on partnering strategically with the company.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Chris J. Spahr>: Hi. This is Chris Spahr on behalf of Mike Mayo. I just have a question relating to your CET1
ratio guidance. Do you give any kind of guidance on the Tier 1 leverage ratio by the end of this year, given your CET1
of 11%?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, we haven't given any specific guidance, Chris.
<Q - Chris J. Spahr>: Do you think there's any way you'll be able to kind of manage that ratio higher in the context of
this year's CCAR?
<A - Marianne Lake>: In the context of the CCAR we just had?
<Q - Chris J. Spahr>: Yes.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Look, we're going to – we expect our – it's a little complicated this year and we sort of
articulated at Investor Day, because we're going to move at some point, whether it's the third quarter or the fourth
quarter, to have standardized RWA be our binding constraints. So 11%, plus or minus, is our target on CET1 and that's
what we said.

Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you and good morning. Marianne, you mentioned that Treasury Service revenues
were down due to the trade finance revenue area. And I noticed on the balance sheet the trade finance outstandings
have dropped meaningfully on a year-over-year basis. Can you share with us what's going on in that line of business?

<A - Marianne Lake>: There are a couple of different things. One was a little specific. We had a portfolio of loans
that we held for sale and have subsequently exited from the balance sheet, which drives some it, but in addition, just
generally, a competitive environment and lower demand, particularly in Asia.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then second, you mentioned that you obviously have a very strong advisory business in
the quarter, and you gained market share of 150 basis points. Do you have any sense of who you took the market share
from? Was it European investment banks or U.S.?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not specifically, no. I will tell you that while we're obviously delighted with the performance,
it was a relatively strong market and there were some larger transactions. So we're happy with the gains, but I can't
specifically comment on where it came from.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on your energy comments. Could you
help us understand what events it was that led to the reserve building? Was it company-specific events in the form of
bankruptcies or just something else in your internal ratings migration?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's definitely more the latter. So basically, if you think about the E&P portfolio in particular,
when we think about the redetermination somewhat semi-annually of the borrowing base, and looked at those
companies on a client-specific name-by-name basis, there was some contraction in the borrowing base, and therefore
some downgrades that drive our reserving methodology.
It doesn't mean that we feel that those companies are necessarily in significant difficulty, but that's the way the
reserving methodology works. And as I said, we do this on a client-by-client basis. We're comfortable with our
exposures, and clients are looking to manage their own defensive positions.
So it's not clear that they will necessarily be realized in losses. In fact, it's the implied curve rather than flat to normal
oil prices is in fact happening to play out, it's possible that there will be very little in the way of credit losses
experienced.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay, and just on that last point, your view on that is because of a recovery in prices rather
than restructuring actions or things that your clients are undertaking. Is that fair or is it a bit of both?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Both, both.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to see if I could just follow up on the energy point.
Obviously, you have the reserving and then you mentioned the 200 basis point impact on spend. I'm wondering if you
could just expand the discussion of energy. Are there positive offsets that you're starting to see in the businesses
elsewhere, either in terms of whether it's credit or borrowing or investment banking opportunities that maybe popping
up? Can you summarize the benefit if at this point you can see any positive offsets?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So first of all, just on the contraction in spend driven by oil prices, it's pretty typical in this part
of the cycle that you would see lower energy prices in the first instance drive savings rates up, and you see consumer
spend for the energy dividend, so to speak, lag that. So the fact that we saw that happening in the first quarter is not
atypical and it doesn't mean that we don't expect the spend to grow and for that energy dividend to ultimately translate
into higher spend going forward. So it's more of a normal timing phenomenon is our expectation.

But with respect to other activity, yes, we saw active equity capital markets with some defensive issuance, and
generally I think it's a positive overall for businesses and for the economy.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: And my follow-up question is just with respect to the Securities Services business.
You mentioned the change in presentation, and then there was the client loss. Is there a way you can help us understand
just what the organic growth rate of the business is adjusted for the reclassifications, whether it's on a sequential quarter
or year-over-year basis?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not readily, but we can get back to you.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Good morning. Maybe just go back to the capital ratio issue for a second. You noted that
standardized you're at 10.8% and then you still feel that will be your constraining factor by the end of this year. So if
you're already at 10.8% and your target is 11%, I know it's plus or minus, but it does seem like you've got three quarters
to hit 20 basis points. So is there anything unusual you're expecting in the coming quarters, or is it just hey, you can
never know quarter to quarter, but all else being equal, it looks like you can probably hit 11% if not better, is that a fair
way to think about it?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Nothing specific to call out in the second half of the year and we should hit 11% if not a little
better, yes.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: And as you looked at the surcharge – the G-SIB surcharge more, the proposal, do you feel
better or worse? Are there any areas where you think you can pull the lever more significantly to improve that ratio, or
lower the charge?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Look, I would say seven weeks or six weeks, whatever, after Investor Day, the messaging
hasn't really changed, which is we have every intention of aggressively managing the score, doing as we talked about
earlier in a very granular way, and we're already working on that. And you see that in the most obvious place, which is
in the reduction already to date in non-operating deposits, but we continue to work on all of the things, so derivative
notional compression, Level 3 assets, financing. Obviously, we're still thinking about what the response should be in
terms of risk intermediation and clearing. And so I think six weeks on from Investor Day, the story is the same. We feel
– we are fully committed to ensuring that we are safely within the 4.5% bucket and we may not stop there, but we're
only a few months into this.

You have a question from line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Marianne, going back to the reserve build, which obviously was done for the oil
and gas as you mentioned, can you share with us? In the Corporate & Investment Bank, I know on a total dollar amount
relative to the corporation it's not significant, but there was a big increase in the nonaccrual loans from $110 million to
$251 million in the quarter. Can you give us some color on what drove that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Obviously, you noted it's from a small base, so that's notable. There are two specific
transactions – or two specific exposures that were moved to non-accrual. One of them was moved on a somewhat of a
technicality, a sovereign downgrade, which we fully expect to recover on, but that's just the way we have to present it.
And the other smaller piece was one other isolated exposure. So I wouldn't overthink it right now. It's two exposures
and it's $200 million in total.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And again, that was not oil and gas related obviously. It's in the CIB area. It was in the
Commercial Bank.

<A - Marianne Lake>: The first, the sovereign downgrade did have oil and gas underlying exposure. But again, it was
on a technicality rather than on the fundamentals of the company, and we fully expect to recover on that.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. You highlighted the Swiss franc as a tailwind for FICC. Could you
maybe size that for us?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, I would just say that overall, our sense is that the market is neutral relative to the event.
We happened to be able to benefit a little from it. Some others will be more neutral and some may have lost. These
things happen in a regular way in trading businesses. And it just happens to be the case that that event and the volatility
it drove is good for our client franchise. I just wanted to say – and I think it really just goes to show you that we're in a
business where expertise matters and risk discipline matters, and we were able to capitalize on both of those, not just
for the Swiss franc but also for the other macro events in the quarter.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Sure. I know that the higher volatility of course would drive higher volumes. I was
just talking about the events specifically and if there were some one-time gains involved in that so that we can adjust
for a core figure here.
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, I wouldn't even characterize them as one-time gains. I would characterize them as one of a
number of items that drove our performance in the business.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, fair enough. And then on the energy front, a lot of the focus was on the CB
and the energy exposure there, but you all mentioned that there are exposures in CIB too. Can you give us maybe an
update if there were any changes in any of those exposures or loans this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so overall as a total firm, the reserve build that we took was a little over $100 billion,
four-fifths of which was in the Commercial Bank, so we did experience – we do all of this on a name-by-name basis, so
we did it across our portfolios, but the majority was in the CB E&P portfolio.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Thank you very much. On your deposit discussion about pushing out, I think you said during
your Investor Day that you would like to get about $3 billion of non-core deposits off the balance sheet, and I know
you said that you hope to make progress in the second quarter. How should we model that out? And what type of
benefit have you modeled out to the NIM with that $3 billion of deposits?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It was $100 billion.
<A - Marianne Lake>: $100 billion.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: $100 billion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, no worries. $100 billion. Look, at the end of the day, you can see that over the course of
the last – since whenever, the third quarter of 2012, our cash balances grew by a couple of hundred billion dollars and
that has been a very large contributor to the compression in our NIM, not the only one.

So as we push out the non-operating deposits, we would expect to see that help but remember, we're still growing retail
deposits. So if you look at this quarter in particular, even though we reduced our non-op deposits related to client
actions by about $20 billion, the majority of that $24 billion, we have flat deposits. So we're continuing to grow the
good retail deposits. So I would say it would be a tailwind, but it would be a tailwind to a sort of stabilizing and slightly
improving NIM outside of rate rises.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then real quick on your professional services, professional services was down like from $2
billion to $1.6 billion. Is that mainly due to some of that legal cost maybe starting to go away from the crisis?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No. I'm sorry that I, off the top of my head, can't remember the number you're saying, but no,
our legal expenses – forget the legal expense that relates to reserves that we've taken and settlements that we've
reached. Our regular way expense for third parties in legal isn't down substantially quarter on quarter or year on year at
this point, although at some point it will be.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hey, good morning. So, Marianne, I was hoping that we could dig into the RWA progress
that we saw in the quarter, and specifically was hoping that you could disaggregate how much of the sequential decline
that we saw was a function of the planned mitigation actions and model benefits that you've cited versus actual
FX-driven declines? Because assuming that the U.S. dollar's strength persists, all else equal, one could surmise that we
should expect RWAs in a long-term context actually coming out below that $1.5 trillion target that you've cited in the
past.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So specifically with respect to the quarter, I would say that the wholesale credit parameter
updates model benefit is about half of the RWA reduction, with the other half coming from regular way portfolio runoff
as well as some reductions in market risk associated with market risk positions, reductions in private equity, reductions
in commitments, so some position reductions rather than driven specifically by FX.
Look, we're running above $1.5 trillion now, and we said we're going to manage both the advance and standardized to
that number over the course of the next couple of years. So if FX is – or if the currency translation is a tailwind, then
we would hope to do better. But at this point, let's get there.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, fair enough. And another question on capital but relating to CCAR. Marianne, you've
noted on this call and in the past that you don't expect CCAR to be JPMorgan's binding constraint longer term. But just
given the reduction that we saw in the ask or the need to use the mulligan in the last exam, I was just hoping you could
cite some of the planned mitigations actions that you expect to take so that we could see you guys get on the path
towards delivering on that 55% to 75% net payout target.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, so look, at the moment, our CET1 ratio launching into CCAR was 10% or below 10%,
not the 12% that we expect to run at once we've built our capital to our target level. And so you are right that right now
under CCAR, Tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint both last year and this year. And so a combination of our
capital strategy around how we think about the issuance of preferreds together with balance sheet actions will be how
we think about mitigating that limitation in the short to medium term.
But ultimately it – but it doesn't change the fact that once we get to our target, assuming that is the 12% that we
articulated at Investor Day, that again, we don't think we should be leverage constrained. So yeah, we're going to work
on that, obviously, and we're continuing to build capital, but when we launched into CCAR, we weren't at that level.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning. Jamie, you warned in your annual letter about the possibility of another
flash crash. Yesterday, I think Simon Potter at the Fed warned about it and cited HFT as one of the issues. Larry
Summers warned about it about a week ago. Are these warnings going anywhere, I mean are they being translated into
action anywhere in the system?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: To give you a little perspective, I also spoke in that that the banking system is much stronger to
start with and every bank in the system's much stronger. So just trying to think through what are the effects of some of
these things, and we look at it as kind of a warning shot across the bow. What I worry about more is what happens in a
stressed environment, and I think people are paying attention to what's going on in the markets and if there has to be
changes down the road, there might be some changes that are relevant to that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Secondly, Marianne, a question about Commercial Banking. The returns in
Commercial Banking have remained in sort of the high teens over the last number of quarters and it's certainly
respectable, sort of 17% to 19%. Is there any way those returns improve materially as rates go up, or does that get
offset by competitive factors? And are we at sort of a normalized level for that business?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The best way to think about it is the through-the-cycle target that Doug Petno put out at
Investor Day, which is 18%. So that doesn't mean to say that we will benefit when rates rise in this business, and it is
very competitive and spreads are compressing, and there's a lot of factors going on. But through the cycle, 18%, so with
some years below and some above.
The question on core growth in Securities Services outside of presentation changes and client exits is currently in the
low single digits. So obviously a little bit muted because we're working on balance sheet optimization, but certainly
growing and in the low single digits. But in terms of looking at advisory and who we are gaining share from,
principally, European banks. Okay. No more questions?
