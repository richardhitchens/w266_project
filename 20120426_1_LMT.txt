With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert J. Stevens
Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. By now, you've had an opportunity to
review two releases from us today, one describing our first quarter performance and one describing the discussion I've
had with our board regarding my retirement and our leadership transition plan. I'll start with the latter.
I'm very pleased to announce that our board has elected Chris Kubasik to be our next Chief Executive Officer and
Marillyn Hewson to be our next President and Chief Operating Officer, with both appointments effective January 1,
2013. To assure a smooth and seamless transition, I'll continue to serve as CEO through the remainder of 2012, and
with shareholder and board approval will serve as Chairman of the Board through January 2014. Chris and Marillyn,
along with Bruce and many others, had been full partners for many years in evolving our strategies and our operating
concepts to deliver superior value to customers and sustain value to shareholders. Together, we have built a great
leadership team with bench strength, an excellent workforce, a sound strategy, a solid portfolio and an operational
momentum upon which to build value. I'm very proud of them and all that they've accomplished, and I'm confident
there'll be much more to come.
Let me anticipate at least one of your questions today. Why make this decision now? Well I must tell you, I love what I
do here. I believe in our mission, our values, our purpose, our people, our customers. Just having the opportunity to
contribute at this level is such a privilege. I'm grateful to our board, and I'm grateful to our employees for the chance
and for the support. It would be great if it could go on forever, but there are realities. I'll be 61 years old in September
and 621/2 when the transition plan I've described is complete. We have a mandatory retirement age here at 65. By the
end of this year, I will have served as our CEO for more than eight years, as President and Chief Operating Officer for
about four years before that, and as Chief Financial Officer before that. By any measure, that's a full period of service.
When I assess the complexities in the global security and economic environments, that new reality we've talked so
much about, with the increasing velocity and volatility of global events that will shape our decision-making over many
years – certainly beyond my mandatory retirement age – I wanted to assure that we have a tested and trusted senior
leadership team in place who can provide continuity and evolve our strategies over the longer term. We have that team
in place now, ready to go, and you know them well.
I've also studied leadership transition environments and have made my own assessments about what approaches are
most successful and what works best. Let me give you three thoughts here. First I believe longer-cycle transitions that
assure a more complete transfer of responsibility are more effective than shorter ones, particularly for complex,
long-cycle businesses like ours. Announcing our transition in April 2012, with an effective date in January 2013, gives
us eight months to focus on transition. And as I mentioned, with the support of our shareholders and the board, I'll
remain as Chairman for another year, through January 2014.
Second, I think it's very healthy to draw highly qualified successors from inside the company, essentially a
grow-your-own philosophy. We have an exceptionally productive talent management, leadership development, and
succession planning process that has had full board involvement over many years, and both Chris and Marillyn have
had a series of very successful rotational assignments that have demonstrated their talent and their ability.
And third, I believe transitions are more successful when the company is strong, and we are strong in every sense.
Leadership, people, culture, financial flexibility, strategy, portfolio, all in place, which led to the performance that we
saw in 2011 and that which we're reporting on the first quarter of 2012. That is not say that there is not more work to
do, because there is. But there is always more work to do. That's why we've committed ourselves to a philosophy of
continuous improvement. Every generation of leaders has their challenges. Probably the one constant of executive life
is that there will be challenges. Our leaders are up to the task. Chris is on the call with us today. Congratulations, Chris.

Well, thanks, Bob. And I'm grateful to you and the other members of our board for your confidence in my ability to
lead this great company, which has a 100-year history of protecting Americans and allies around the world. We work
with the best team in the industry every day, and I will build upon the foundation we've created to carry out our mission
to support our customers. I want to assure everyone we'll remain focused on meeting our strategic, operational, and
financial commitments; on growing our business profitably; on innovating relevant new technologies; on further
engaging our employees; and on returning value to investors.
I worked closely with Marillyn for almost 15 years, and I look forward to partnering with her in our new roles. Her 29
years with Lockheed Martin and experience in three business areas and corporate headquarters have given her unique
insight in executing our strategy and sustaining our emphasis on operational excellence and affordability. I'm confident
the transition will be seamless and successful, and I look forward to reporting our progress along the way.
Again, Bob, thanks to you and the board for this opportunity. I'll turn it back to you.
Robert J. Stevens
Thanks, Chris. Again, congratulations to you, and congratulations to Marillyn.
Let me turn to a very brief summary of the first quarter, because we do want to get on to Bruce and we want to move
on to your questions. I see the quarter as a strong start to 2012 and a continuation of the execution momentum we
demonstrated last year. We grew sales by 6%, earnings from continuing operations by 20%, and earnings per share by
29%. Solid program execution and effective risk reduction, coupled with ongoing cost reduction initiatives, lifted
segment operating margins to 11.9% in the quarter, up from 11% in the prior year. Cash generation was $458 million
after making planned pension contributions of $505 million.
Our cash deployment to shareholders in the quarter totaled $569 million, reflecting payments of $327 million in
dividends and share repurchases of $242 million, for the retirement of 2.7 million shares. These results reflect the
strength of our corporation and the quality and dedication of our workforce that I referred to earlier. Thanks to
everyone in the company for the hard work.
Some uncertainty was relieved in the quarter with the delivery of the president's FY 2013 budget request to Congress
on February 6. The proposed defense budget outlines a base budget of $525 billion, with an overseas contingency
operation budget of $88 billion. This budget reflects the new national security strategy outlined by the President and the
Secretary of Defense, and the priorities within the budget generally align with our portfolio and our experience. The
Department of Defense remains on a course to reduce spending by $487 billion over the next 10 years, in accordance
with the requirements of the Budget Control Act, but there's been no meaningful movement on sequestration. I believe
our views in opposition to the sequestration process are clear, and we'll continue to work to stop this action.
At the same time, we continue to work on affordability projects. From 2010 to 2011, we've lowered our overhead costs,
as reflected in our forward pricing rate proposals submitted to customers, by almost $1.2 billion. Over the same period,
we removed 1.5 million square feet from facilities, and we're projecting the removal of an additional 2.9 million square
feet through 2014. Beyond facilities reductions, we have also had to implement painful employee reductions. Since
2008, the net reduction of our total workforce stands at about 18%, with 26% of those reductions in leadership
positions. Business conditions and competitive pressures require us to continue to evaluate staffing levels and were the
catalysts for the recently announced layoff of an additional 500 employees within our MS2 business.
Finally, let me turn to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Year-to-date performance in the flight test program is ahead of
plan. On the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, we are slightly ahead of plan for both the number of flights
conducted and the number of test points earned. On the short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft, we are ahead of plan
by about 60% on flights and about 22% on test points earned. And on the carrier variant, we're also ahead of plan by
about 31% on flights and 32% on test points earned.
Contract negotiations continue on the Lot 5 program, with ongoing discussions between the customer and our F-35
team. We received our first counter-offer from the government yesterday, and that's currently under evaluation. And we

look forward to finalizing negotiations in the second quarter. We were pleased with the recent decision by the U.S.
government to add two additional aircraft to Lot 5, bringing the revised procurement quantity to 32 aircraft.
Also, at midnight last Sunday, about 3,600 members of the International Association of Machinists union in Fort
Worth, Texas, rejected our best and final offer and are on strike. The offer that we advanced was fair and competitive
and balanced the interests of employees, the company, and our customers as we seek to position our business to meet
today's affordability challenges and win new business in the future. For current Fort Worth machinists union
employees, our offer included increases in wages, pension contributions, annual cost of living supplements and
adjustments, and a ratification bonus, but also sought to convert the defined benefit pension plan to a defined
contribution plan for new hires that would join our workforce in the future. This position of moving from a defined
benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan for new employees has been applied consistently across our
company for some time now, since 2006, and I'm confident it's the right approach to meet the demands of our business.
Our operations will remain open, and we'll implement our contingency plan while focusing on meeting our
commitments to our customers.
Now I'll have Bruce go through some of the details of the quarter, and then we'll open up the line for questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with web charts that we included with our earnings release today.
Let's begin with Chart 3, and an overview of the first quarter. We grew sales for the company by 6% over our first
quarter – excuse me, our 2011 first quarter level. This growth was slightly better than expected, and I'll describe the
drivers behind that growth on the next chart. Our segment operating profit margins improved by 90 basis points to
11.9%, and I'll also provide more color on that improvement in a couple of charts. Earnings per share from continuing
operations increased by 29%, driven by the higher sales volume, the margin improvement, as well as a lower share
count compared with this time last year. We generated approximately $460 million in cash from operations while
making some expected payments that we discussed during the last call, including over $500 million of pension
contributions made this quarter. As a result of our performance to begin the year, we increased our segment operating
profit outlook by $50 million.
On Chart 4, we'll look at our sales by the four business areas. Sales for the company were slightly ahead of our
expectations, with three of our four business areas growing in the quarter. Aeronautics led this growth, with an 18%
increase, driven primarily by accelerated and higher quantities of both C-130 and F-16 aircraft deliveries and higher
F-35 production volume. Electronic Systems had 4% growth in the quarter, led by our mission systems and sensors and
missiles and fire control business units. Space System started the year with a 2% increase in sales for the quarter,
consistent with our expectations. And IS&GS declined by 3%, driven mostly by a reduction in sales for the AMF JTRS
program. But this overall reduction was less significant than we had expected, with growth in our intelligence line of
business helping to mitigate the JTRS decline.
Chart 5 shows the segment margin levels for each of the four business areas. As you can see, most of the margin
improvements that led to the company's 11.9% level was driven by Electronic Systems. This improvement was driven
primarily by outstanding performance at our missiles and fire control business unit across a large group of programs
and also reflected the acceleration of a number of performance milestones and contractual actions that were expected to
occur later in the year. The net of this performance and acceleration led us to increase the guidance for Electronic
Systems' operating profit by $50 million for the year.
Turning to Chart 6 and our earnings per share in the quarter, EPS from continuing operations grew 29% over the $1.57
per share we reported a year ago, again driven by the higher sales volume, margin improvement, and lower share count.
And our pension-adjusted EPS of $2.41 improved by a strong 22% over last year.

Moving to Chart 7, you can see our updated outlook for the year. We're maintaining our sales outlook, as most of the
first quarter growth reflect the timing of deliveries and not an increase in the total deliveries for the year. Our segment
profit outlook is $50 million higher than we provided in January, as we just discussed. However, our earnings per share
from continuing operations remained at $7.70 to $7.90 as a result of changes in several non-operational items. I'll
discuss this further on the next chart. Finally, with the additional segment operating profit for the year, we believe that
our cash from operations will be at least $3.8 billion.
On Chart 8, we'll discuss our earnings per share outlook of $7.70 to $7.90. This outlook recognizes the $50 million
increase in segment operating profit, or $0.10 per share, and this offset non-operational items of an equal amount. The
first of these items is a net increase in unallocated expenses, reflecting the change in our post-retirement benefit asset
and liability levels, along with an increase in several corporate expense items, including our environmental remediation
liabilities. In addition to these non-operational cost increases, our expected average share count for calculating EPS
increased due to both the higher-than-planned level of options exercised in the quarter and an increase in share price,
resulting in less share count reduction for the planned $1 billion of share repurchases.
Chart 9 shows our sales guidance for the year, again reflecting no change from our initial guidance.
Chart 10 shows the $50 million increase in our segment operating profit outlook for the year, with all the change
resulting from our increase in expectations for Electronic Systems.
And finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 11. While we're mindful of the open labor negotiations in our
Aeronautics business area and the potential impact of sequestration, we're up to a good start for the year.
And with that, we're ready for your questions. Sean?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please
go ahead with your question.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Oh, hi, good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: If it's okay, I actually have one question for Bruce and then what I think may be a quick
question here for Bob. Bruce, I'm just looking at your Electronic Systems margins here, which seem to be well above
expectations. I wanted to know if you could provide some color on the risk retirement events that allowed margins at
ES to expand so much? And any specifics you could provide would be helpful there.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Thanks, Rich. Yeah 15%'s obviously a little higher than we run in years past. In fact, I
think it's probably the highest rate for any business area, possibly in the history of the corporation. As I look at the
performance adjustments in the quarter, they were unusually high in the first quarter, and as you said, particularly in
Electronic Systems, most specifically within missiles and fire control. Think of that being about $150 million more first
quarter this year than the first quarter last year. And as I look at that, I think we had accelerated performance milestone,
as I said on the previous discussion, contractual action, a number of risk retirement, and I'll give you a couple of
examples. One, for instance, was we reached initial operating capability on our Sniper pods for the Australian F-18
aircraft. This quarter we'll be expected to do that in a subsequent quarter this year.
We also had a number of completions of block delivery items, and by that I mean where we're shipping a large quantity
of, in this case, HELLFIRE missiles, MLRSs and the like, where upon the completion of a group of deliveries, that
results in the reduction of risk retirements for that block, and in some cases it actually results in the reduction of
warranty obligations. And so we had sort of a double-whammy effect for those two events in the quarter, earlier than
planned. As I look throughout the rest of the year, Rich, I do think we're going to expect to return to lower levels of

profit adjustments going forward in the remaining quarters and expect the total year will be very much in line with what
we experienced in 2011.
I think you had a question for Bob, did you?
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Yeah. Thanks, Bruce. Bob, at the risk of this being a somewhat sensitive topic, I wanted to
know if I could get a comment from you on negotiations with the machinists union of Fort Worth. I wanted to know if
you could talk about the impact of a protracted disagreement. Is this a situation that's serious enough where, for
example, you think you have the potential to lay off personnel? And I'm only asking this because the news reports I'm
looking at seem to indicate that the union is making statements like they're ready for a long strike, that kind of thing.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. I appreciate the question, and it is a matter that we're focused on. I mentioned in
discussions with the media earlier today that I was surprised that the IAM went on strike. And the reason was that we
have not asked the IAM union workers in Fort Worth to do anything our other employees have not already done. For
some time now, we've been converting the company from a defined benefit pension plan to a defined contribution plan.
This is a practice that is not unique to our company. It is not unique in our industry. And it's a practice that's entirely
consistent with today's economic realities.
Nothing is being taken away from current union employees in the offer that we've presented. I believe it's very
competitive in today's economy, reflecting our value of the work that's being done by our union employees. And it's not
clear to me how in this environment, how many new employees we'll be hiring in the future. But any new employees
hired in the future will be offered a pension plan. And I personally think it would be an unfortunate outcome to have a
strike over the principal issue of defined benefit pension plans for future hires to cause any unnecessary disruption in
the F-35 program or any other program that would put the employment of our current workers at risk.
Every action that this company has taken for many years now has been to stabilize our program base, particularly in the
face of mounting uncertainty with regard to overall economic resources available. So I believed – this action was
certainly unwelcome. Having said that, we have a contingency plan in place. We're compelled now to execute that
contingency plan, and we are. We continue to fly the airplanes, and we continue to build the airplanes. But I do believe
in every sense, the offer that we put foot forward to the union was a fair and reasonable position.

Our next question comes Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good afternoon, and congrats both to you, Bob, and you, Chris.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: My question, Bob, is on, the F-35. We've seen with the release of the budget the last few
months, a lower ramp over the next five years for the U.S. And there's been a number of countries that have – now, the
waffling, I guess, publicly, of some of your customers internationally has continued. And I'm wondering if you could
give us update on your view on, I guess, where you stand on that, the potential cost spiral, and all the issues that I know
you're very focused on.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. Thanks, Joe. I will tell you I think the actions that were taken recently, even with the
phasing out of additional airplanes, added a little bit to a sense of stability in the program. We might be looking at
quantities less than we would have preferred to see. But I think we've stabilized. And I think the performance of the
airplane is being quite recognized pretty broadly by customers. It is not to say we don't have challenges, but we're
making progress against the set of challenges. We have known corrective actions for observations that have been made
in the flight test program.
I get reinforcing language from our partners pretty consistently. And you know we had a favorable decision in Japan.
We're looking at Korea. We're working effectively with Israel on the international front. I think – it's quite
understandable to me, Joe, that the leadership in our partner governments are looking at their security challenges and

their economic challenges, and they may be talking about phasing an airplane here or there. But it also strikes me as
very clear that they are uniformly committed to a fifth-generation airplane, because they believe that airplane over the
next 50 years will provide the maximum amount of security and the best investment of very scarce security dollars. So
I think we've gotten some very strong reinforcing views of their commitment and interest in the program. It is our job
to go execute that. And not to conflate issues, Joe, but that's why the strike was a bit of a surprise to me and why we'd
like to have this matter resolved.

Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thank you so much, and good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on your cash deployment strategy and whether
you're comfortable with the allocation that you currently have between buybacks, dividends, and potentially
acquisitions going forward?
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, I think we're generally pleased with what we have done historically and where we are
today. Robert, I know you know we look at this on a continuous basis. We're giving it great attention now, but I think it
has served the company well, and I think it has served the interest of investors as well.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Rob, I'll jump in from my perspective as well. I look at our cash deployment practice, and I
think the key word there has been flexibility and specifically flexibility to address sort of four constituents that I always
think of relative to cash deployment. Obviously starting with folks like yourself and shareholders, where we consider
dividends, a stock repurchase. I also think the ability to have some fairly quick action on acquisitions by having some
cash in the bank to enable us to do some quick decisions and not have to wait on financing, for instance, is a help as
well.
I look at customers, and there the ability to make the critical investments from both a capital expenditure and IRAD
perspective, our independent research and development. I think having some consideration for addressing potential
continuing resolution impacts in advance of sequestration impacts, including the effect of small suppliers and being
able to decide what makes sense from a disruption perspective as far as helping some of those smaller suppliers through
these periods of funding uncertainty, I think, is also helpful.
I look at employees as another constituent, and that's primarily as it relates to funding the pension plan, which I think
we've demonstrated our willingness to do that quite long – or for quite some time. And lastly, I look at debt holders.
And there I think maintaining the appropriate ratings levels relative to our desires going forward. Keeping a balance
between the demands of equity holders and debt holders is a critical element there as well. And I think the question is
sort of maintaining that balance and maintaining that flexibility going forward.
I think Chris has one other add here.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah. Rob, and as you would expect, I've obviously been part of the decision and
strategy and perfectly aligned with Bob and Bruce, and I don't anticipate any changes in our cash deployment strategy
as I look to the future.

<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Following up on the last question, particularly, Bruce, it sounds a little bit like your strategy
is evolving as the environment changes. You talked before about – you obviously lead with the dividend, highest yield
in the sector. And you've talked about continuing that momentum, maintaining a strong buyback, and reminded us in
the past that you've got the cash balance to allow for that. But now with the stock where it is, you're guiding to a $1
billion buyback. So have we seen the peak in the buyback at this point, and is there any difference in your M&A
strategy? It seems like you're preserving cash for more options than you did even just a quarter ago.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: You know, Rob, I think we still have a longstanding 50% free cash flow commitment to
shareholders. That's obviously been changing over time such that now the dividend practically gets us to the 50% of
free cash flow.
I want to be able to remain opportunistic as far as share repurchases are concerned, and as you might expect, if we took
a look at what we spent in the first quarter this year, we actually spent almost the exact same amount as we spent in the
first quarter of last year. So we're tracking very closely to both a quarter of the $1 billion that we committed to, as well
as tracking to where we were last year. I think we'll be opportunistic. I mean, obviously, the stock has run up some on
price. I think our commitment relative to the dividends has been very consistent. We've had eight consecutive years –
nine consecutive years, excuse me, of double-digit increases in our dividend policy. And as I always say, I think that's –
our past track record is the best indicator of where we're going in the future with regard to that.
I do think on the acquisition side, we are still in that marketplace, as I said on the first quarter call. I do like having the
flexibility to make quick decisions relative to engaging. There is more competition, I think, with some of the
acquisitions that we're looking at. And so I think there's not a huge change. You said kind of a change in the style going
forward relative to cash deployment. I wouldn't say it's a huge change. But we are mindful of – this is a little bit of
different environment than we've been in the past.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. I believe you had 12 weeks versus 13, and yet your sales were particularly strong. And I
know you have a the pull-forwards in Aeronautical. Can you give us a little more color in just why they were quite so
strong ex the Aeronautical, which I think you've already explained.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Cai, I'll take that one on. It was 12 weeks, to your point, and I'll maybe anticipate the
next question. The 14th week happens in the third quarter of this year. So you may see the offset of that in the third
quarter coming up. Most of the sales increase was frankly on deliveries as opposed to cost volume. And particularly
true, obviously, in the Aeronautics business area, but that was also true in large part in Electronic Systems.
I think as I looked, at least, at IS&GS I was always particularly pleased to see where they ended the first quarter. Even
though they were down 3%, the fact that it was down 3% and they've got a fairly large portion of sales that are sort of
cost-based, POC, percentage of completion based sales, and were still only down 3%, I think's a real help as far as me
feeling good about their performance for the rest of the year.
I mentioned some growth in intelligence that helped offset some of the AMF JTRS reduction. That obviously would've
been greater had we had another week in the quarter. So I think that's benefited us. Again, I think as I said with the
prepared remarks, I think we were a little bit higher in sales in the first quarter than we had anticipated, especially given
the 12 weeks. I think it's a little too early – obviously we held the sales outlook constant for the year. I think it's a little
too early to say there's an increase in the rest of the year out there, so we've kept committed to the $45 billion to $46
billion. And I'll just – I'll leave it at that.

Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Yes. Good afternoon.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Hi. I'm interested in IS&GS, and just trying to understand, when you look forward, we've seen
a little bit of contraction in backlog. And if you're looking forward and you split this into defense, intel, and civil, how
are you seeing the outlook right now over the next few years in those different markets? And then what are you seeing
also in terms of the competitive environment? Are you seeing more competition on individual contracts as they come
up?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes, Doug, I'll try that one as well. As we look at IS&GS – and I'm just kind of looking at
some of my notes here – I think the surprise – it wasn't a surprise, but the biggest driver of the down in the first quarter,
as I said, was in defense line of business, again, offset in large part by the intelligence side. Civil kind of stayed flat
relative to the prior year's first quarter. And I think going forward, that's probably going to be somewhat the story for
the rest of this year. The civil business is going to be flat to slightly lower than it was last year. Defense is going to be
down, primarily because of AFM JTRS. Intelligence is going to be down to slightly flat, but possibly with some growth
because of what we saw happen in the first quarter.
I'm optimistic, really, in all three lines of business relative to our ability to grow some of the cyber activities, cutting
across, as I said, all three lines of business. I think we're finally starting to see – I know you guys are probably getting
tired of us talking about cyber for so long without much results across the industry. But I think we're starting to see
some traction there that has been helping us to have some growth there going forward. There's also opportunities, as
you well know – this is the business area where we have most of our adjacent market opportunities, and that includes
the energy, healthcare. We made the acquisition last year with QTC from a healthcare perspective, and I think that's got
some prospects to help maybe mitigate some of the – particularly lightness in the defense in the near term.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good afternoon, and congratulations, Chris and Bob. And Bob, I'm glad you let Chris finally
out to talk to investors.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: [indiscernible] (36:25) I am, too.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you just talk – and I guess it's mostly Bruce – but can you talk a little bit about the order
environment? In the past, you talked about the first half would be relatively weak. And I know the Aeronautics
shipments were up, but the backlog there did decline $2 billion sequentially. So can you just talk about how that
backlog and the order activity is going to look as we look through the year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Sure, Sam. I like to think we've teed it up, as we expected it to happen in the first
quarter. I think in the January call we said we expected to go down sequentially. I'll say as I sit here today, I think
second quarter is going to down from the first quarter, although I'll say a lot of that is dependent upon the ongoing F-35
negotiations. So depending on when the LRIP V negotiation finishes, depending on when we get additional funding for
the undefinitized contractual action or the UCA for LRIP VI, and depending on when we get the long-lead funding for
LRIP VII, that will bounce between second and third quarter, likely. If those all were to happen in the second quarter,
we might actually see some growth. If not, I think we'll have a big third quarter.
We are expecting in the third quarter to have some good government satellite orders. We're also expecting the F-16
mod program for the Taiwanese government to happen in the third quarter. And in fourth quarter, we always expect
that to be our largest order of all four quarters. That's where we get the orders for the new fiscal year coming up. And
think of that as Fleet Ballistic Missile, PAC-3, and then in this case the C-5 FY 2013 order, which is getting bigger and
bigger every year as those quantities go up. So I think I teed up at the last call that we comp – by the end of this year,

Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good afternoon, and my congratulations as well to both of you.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thanks.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Bruce, just a quick question on cash. I want to focus in on the cadence for cash generation
for the rest of this year, have you remind us, perhaps, of what your pension contribution plans are for this year, perhaps
pension contributions for next year as well. And then just talk about the impact of FAS/CAS harmonizations and how
you are viewing that at this point from cash generation as we move into some of the out-years. But if you could give us
a flavor of cadence for the rest of this year, what cash might do next year, particularly as it relates to pension
contributions, and then longer term what FAS/CAS is going to do for you?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Okay, Jason. Let me try to address all those for you.
You talked about the cadence of cash for the year in pension contributions. I tried to tee up actually on, I think, the –
probably the December call or the October call, excuse me; if not in October, definitely January – that we're going to
have a little different profile in cash in 2012 as maybe compared to prior years, where we're going to have a lower first
half of the year in cash and probably a higher second half of the year than we've experienced in previous years. Still
think that's going to happen. First quarter obviously showed – followed suit to that pattern, if you will.
Second quarter, I'm expecting it to look a lot like the first quarter, basically. We've already made a $600 million
contribution to the pension plan. That satisfies all of the required contributions to the pension plan in 2011. That's the
full $1.1 billion roughly. We also had two tax payments, as we normally do, in the second quarter, and that's why it's
keeping it about $0.5 billion dollar level. We do think the second half of the year will be much higher within the first
two quarters and get to the $3.8 billion. And again, we told you in – at least I told you in the prepared remarks that
we're increasing or at least feel more confident in our ability to generate the $3.8 billion, at least that much, with the
additional operating profit that we're generating.
I think you asked – I'm trying to recall this – I think you asked what the contribution for pensions was next year? It
grows fairly considerably. Think of it as $1.1 billion this year. It's probably another $1 billion-ish next year to $2.1
billion or so. The CAS contribution grows slightly, maybe $300 million or $400 million, as we sit here today.
I think the real heart of your question, Jason, is so what happens over time with that contribution? And you should
think of us from sort of a CAS harmonization perspective as having roughly $4 billion of advanced contributions to the
ERISA versus what we recovered from a CAS perspective. And so what CAS harmonization is doing is spreading that
advanced funding, if you will, that $4 billion, over the period of the CAS harmonization recovery. So think of that as
2013 through 2017, so that'll be spread – not quite peanut butter, but 25% increments each year – 25%, 50%, 75%, and
100% – over that period of time. So we expect the operating cash will get a pretty significant benefit from the recovery
of that previously funded ERISA payments over the next few years.

<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thank you.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: A couple questions on Aeronautics first. Can you give us your latest view on what 2012 versus
2011 units by program should look like? And then if you could provide any commentary on 2013 versus 2012 as well,
even if just directionally, that would be helpful. And then on Aeronautics margins, they've kind of been reset lower as
you're layering in more lower-margin revenue. The guidance, I guess, implies they kind of moved back towards 2011
through the rest of the year. I'm just wondering if you could provide any comments on your thoughts on the direction of
the Aeronautics margin beyond 2012 for the next couple of years? Thank you.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Hey, Noah, I'll take that as well. So in terms of the deliveries by program, I think was
the first part of your question, maybe 2012 versus 2011. I think we're up pretty significantly in our F-16 deliveries,
especially in the year 2012 versus 2011. We're going to be somewhere around the 40 aircraft in 2012 for F-16s versus –
I think we did 22 in 2011. Quite a few of those get delivered off of the Turkish assembly line. I think more than half, if
I recall, come off the Turkish line. The rest of those come off of the Fort Worth F-16 line.
C-130s are fairly constant to last year. We'll do – I think we did 33 last year. We'll do that number, maybe 34, this year.
The other firm that's got some quantity increases was the C-5 program. We delivered two last year. We'll likely do
about six this year. I think the F-35 is probably well known and will stay fairly flat in that period of time, somewhere in
the 30 aircraft mode. I'll remind you again, we're still booking those early low-rate initial production contracts on a
percentage of completion basis. So sales will not tie to the deliveries of those aircraft, if you will.
And then I think you talked about the Aeronautics margin this year and going forward. We have been talking about the
Aero margin coming down when the associated volume of the F-35 program starts to pick up, and that program brings
with it greater weight at a lower margin. We still think that's the case. I think as I look forward, we're going to come
down some from where we are in 2012.
Frankly, we benefited in 2011, and we're still benefiting in 2012, from a number of the cost-reduction activities that we
put in place over the past 18 months or so. Think of those, as Bob talked about, some facility issues – facility reduction,
some head count reductions. Some of that benefits the U.S. government; some of that benefits the contractor – in this
case, us. And we're seeing that materialize in margin improvements, not just in Aeronautics but especially in the
Electronic Systems as well. That helped 2012 from where I kind of thought we'd be a year ago. I still think we're going
to come off that number, the 11% number, going forward because of the F-35 volume. We'll be somewhere in the
10%-ish – 10%, 10.5% range would be my guesstimate over the next couple of years from a margin perspective for
Aero.

<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good afternoon. And welcome back to the call, Chris.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Well, thank you.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Hey, Bob, you talked about the flight test program for the F-35 tracking ahead of
schedule. I'm curious if you can talk about it not from the hardware side, but from the software side, and kind of some
of the schedule milestones that you're looking at there; where you are relative to the respective block schedules; and
whether you're on par with the plan or still tracking a few months behind.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah, Myles, it just so happens that we have our Chief Operating Officer here with us today.
He knows everything there is to know about F-35 software schedules.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Yeah, Myles, let me talk about Block IIA. That's the next milestone that we're
focused on. We're a couple months behind schedule. There's some pressure on that. The good news is that both
ourselves and our customer see this status in the same fashion, and we're working on a recovery plan. So sometime in
the middle of 2012, whether it's July or September, in that timeframe, we will be in position to deliver Block IIA. And

again, the ultimate delivery under the development plan for the remaining of the software is due in the 2016-2017
timeframe.
So we have three years to get to IIB in the IOC. So I'm pleased with the progress that were making. About 90% of the
airborne software code has already been written, and a little more than 85% is in the lab and in flight test. So we're
tracking this on a regular basis, made some good progress here of late, and I'm confident the team will deliver.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah, Bruce, I wanted to pursue the F-35 margin based on the – a lot of disclosure that you
gave in the report. It looks like the F-35 margin on the production went up this year from last year. If you could just
talk a little bit about what caused that and where we might expect it to go?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, George, as usual, you're pretty perceptive, and I think you gave us a backhanded
compliment on the disclosure, so we appreciate that as well. I'll pass that along to the team. The F-35 margins on the
production side, on the low-rate initial production contracts, I think I tried to tee up on the last couple of calls that we're
nearing completion of the deliveries of each one of the early, early LRIP contracts.
And so in the case, I believe, of LRIP 1 and LRIP 2, we're far enough along on deliveries of those two in particular that
we did have some performance adjustments on the positive side, simply reflecting the fact that we've come – in the case
of LRIP 1, we've delivered those aircraft. In the case of LRIP 2, we're making very good progress on the completion of
the aircraft out of the factory for that lot as well. And as you would expect, the risk retirements associated with that
progress enabled us to make an improvement in the performance adjustments that we just talked about.
Going forward, I think there might be some potential for some additional on the latter – additional LRIP 2 or LRIP 3. I
don't think anything sizeable. And I think the overall margins, as far as where we see it, is kind of – think of between
mid and double-digit sorts of levels for the year, is where we think the LRIP contracts will come out in total.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Michael S. Lewis>: Yeah. And I just wanted to circle back on F-35 for a second and get your opinion on exactly
how you expect the Congress to come back with these markups and what else you would expect, whether there's
additional aircraft that could be brought back into the program in 2013 and 2014. Thank you.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. I believe that the fiscal 2013 bill, which is on the Hill now, is being
marked. And let me say so far, because we're not completely through these discussions, I think the early indication is
the House marked it 29 airplanes. The Senate has not yet marked. Our conclusion after discussions, again recognizing
we're not through with the process, is that there's a good level of support for the quantity of the program that's been
described in the rephasing of the production plan.
So I have this sense that there is a view that we've got the program better managed and better focused, and we're
earning value in both the flight test program and on the production line, and that we need to stabilize the production
build, focus on cost reduction and affordability, and there's a general level of support for the quantities that Bruce and I
have referred you to over time. We see those quantities as being, let me say, within a range of 30 to 32-ish kind of
airplanes, flat for a couple of years, and that's the U.S. content.
So I think a corollary to your question is can that be changed? I don't think it's likely to be changed from the U.S.
domestic buy, but we might see an increase in airplanes, probably not in the very near term, but we could see an
increase in airplanes during this flattish period were international customers to come forward and combine their buy
with the U.S. buy.

Chris, welcome back to the call.
<A - Christopher E. Kubasik>: Great. Thank you, Carter.
<A - Robert J. Stevens>: Thank you, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: I wanted to go back – this is probably for Bruce – and talk about the kind of elephant in the
room and sequestration and contingency planning and how you prepare for that kind of looming wall. And I recall last
year as we led up to the debt ceiling negotiation and the potential for a government shutdown, you dialed back a bit on
the cash deployment in the case that you may need it to self-fund some things. And so, I wonder if there are scenarios
that you evaluate as we move closer to the end of the year and you think about some of the things that may happen in
terms of sequestration and ways you may deal with it, if there's a scenario where we could see that sort of action being
taken again.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Carter, great question, and as you would probably expect, we are looking at multiple
scenarios. I'll be honest with you and say they're difficult because they're kind of scenarios of our own making, since
we don't have a whole lot of direction that we can rely on as far as what the effects a sequestration will actually have on
an individual program basis. So, as I said, you would expect us to be doing some scenario playing out. We're doing that
right now, as we speak. I think we'll get a little better visibility possibly as we head into the summer timeframe from
our customer in this regard.
At least as I've looked at it, Carter, the thing that I'm watching the closest, and I think it may be the most interesting
part relative to 2012 going forward, is there's a very likely chance that we're going to have a continuing resolution in
the first quarter of the next fiscal year, so in the fourth quarter of 2012. And I think it's going to be an interesting study
to see if our government customers – by definition, continuing resolution normally says you kind of spend at the same
level of the new fiscal year as you did at the prior fiscal year.
It's going to be interesting to see what happens in this continuing resolution with the prospect of a sequestration three
months after the continuing resolution will start, if it starts. And specifically whether or not customers feel comfortable
or not sort of holding the line at the same level as the prior fiscal year or whether or not we see a reduction in the
continuing resolution in anticipation of sequestration. So those obviously are prospects that we're concerned about.
You read what I was trying to describe relative to cash deployment [ph] rights. (55:48) We're trying to keep all of our
options open there and do what makes the most efficient sense for us to continue performing throughout the rest of this
calendar year.

like the quality of the portfolio we have now. We think the portfolio in the core business actually has the potential for
future growth with international expansion. And as Bruce mentioned in his remarks earlier, we're looking to add
content to the company to adjacent markets. We're constantly evaluating this portfolio.
I rather think what you should expect to see from us are cost reductions of the nature we've been describing in facilities
consolidations and unfortunately very difficult and painful reductions in force, where the programs relevant to the
businesses have been reshaped. We're focusing maximum attention on efficiency that drives affordability for our
customers. I would like to get some more visibility as to the more specific consequences of sequestration, because it's
such a significant number, and as Bruce mentioned, it's not very specifically detailed, that we would like to see more
about that. And then we would add that as an overlay to our ongoing evaluation of how our portfolio is performing
today and likely to perform in the future.
We have a sufficient amount of firepower to add to our portfolio. We have sufficient talent and leadership in the
company to add resources to any segment of that portfolio, to either improve its performance or to take segments of our
portfolio into new markets with new customers to facilitate future growth. But insofar as sequestration is sitting out
there, I think we're going to have to go along a little bit so that we have a broader knowledge base. And we'd like to
make our decisions with little higher confidence that we understand the circumstances and the implications of those
decisions before we make them. So with the uncertainty I think we're going to continue our evaluation here.
