Sean M. Connolly
Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Before we jump into the details of
our quarterly results, as I usually do, I want to outline the big picture for everyone. Hillshire Brands is a focused food
company that is equally committed to delivering growth and profitability. We believe in a very disciplined approach to
brand building and innovation across our core brands. We also believe in reducing cost to fuel our growth agenda.
Three quarters of the way into our year, I feel very good about the progress we're making against our plan and year one
is on track.
Q3 was a mixed story for Hillshire, with earnings coming in better than our expectations, helped by favorable input
costs. Revenue declined slightly, driven by declines in food service. That said, we were very pleased to see our brand
building and innovation investments continue to strengthen our core brands. With EPS coming in better than we
anticipated, we can now say that we expect full year EPS to be at the high end of our guidance range.
A quick word on costs, and I'll ask Maria to elaborate further on this in a few minutes. We continue to make progress
on our cost efficiency efforts and this year is firmly on track. Encouragingly, we have also identified the remaining $35
million of our F 2015 cost program as well as additional savings opportunities, some of which comes beyond fiscal
2015. These new initiatives further strengthen our confidence in our F 2015 targets, as well as our conviction that we're
creating a company built for sustained long-term value creation, again, more on this in a few minutes from Maria.
As you know, the economic engine of our company is the retail segment. After four consecutive quarters of volume
growth, the retail segment turned in flat volume versus Q3 a year ago. As you can see on this chart and as I pointed out
previously, the Q3 comps were far more challenging than what we saw in the first half. In fact, this chart also implies,
this was the most solid volume quarter yet, year-to-date, versus fiscal 2011, which is a way of looking past last year's
lumpiness.
But there was a lot going on underneath the flat volume performance in the retail segment, beyond the tougher comps
that I want to share. So let me break that down for you. First, we had strong growth where we increased MAP
investment. Second, we planned a decline in Hillshire Farm lunchmeat to enable our supply chain transition to our new
package structure. Third, we continued to pull low margin, low velocity items out of the market in advance of new
innovations. And finally, our frozen bakery business declined more than we forecast as competition did not follow our
post-holiday season price increase. I'll cover most of these points in a bit more detail.
In fiscal 2013, we've made good progress on our disciplined plan to increase MAP spend to 5% of revenue by the end
of fiscal 2015. Recall our history has been a MAP rate of 3% to 3.5% annually. Year-to-date we've been at 4.3% with
the increase focused in two areas. First, Jimmy Dean, where we have very strong confidence in the ROIs; and second,
supporting new item innovation because you can't generate new item trial without first generating awareness.
Frankly, the improvement in trends that we've seen overall is very encouraging. This chart compares our fiscal 2012
trends in consumer takeaway versus our year-to-date fiscal 2013 performance and what you see is real improvement.
Our strong brands have grown stronger and the ones that were weak are in a better place year-to-date and that is
encouraging. Our focused approach to deploying MAP increase was fully evident in quarter three, where more than
100% of our total MAP increase came in support of two businesses, Jimmy Dean and Ball Park burgers. In total, MAP
was up $8 million in quarter three or 24% and as you can see that added real firepower to both businesses.
Similar to what we're seeing with MAP, innovation is starting to contribute. I'm proud of our team for getting after this
with such vigor. Over the past four years, 9% of our annual revenue has come from items launched in the prior three
years. Our goal is to get that number to 13% to 15% by the end of fiscal 2015. So far this year, we're at 11%, which is
solid progress, and frankly we're just getting warmed up here with a lot more to come.

Without a doubt, Jimmy Dean has been our standout performer in fiscal 2013 and in Q3. Year-to-date, we've seen our
decision to ramp up brand building and innovation pay dividends. Volume and sales have been up meaningfully in our
first nine months. Contributing to that are the new innovations we introduced this year and we've also improved upon
an ad campaign that was already strong. Plus, we've been very pleased with consumers' positive response to our new,
more contemporary packaging.
If you look within Q3, the story is the same, sustained strong sales growth as velocities continue to increase on key
products. Driving that in Q3 was a MAP increase of over 38%. Finally, we introduced our new flatbreads line, which is
gaining distribution now and is truly an exceptional product.
We call Aidells and Gallo our artisanal brands because they're beloved by foodies. These businesses enjoy strong
marketing support and continue to grow nicely in response. Year-to-date volume, sales and share are up meaningfully
on both brands. Further, innovation is also moving full-steam ahead. Aidells is particularly interesting because it
demonstrates where we invest the highest MAP rate in our portfolio, we get the highest growth. In quarter three,
momentum continued and this was encouraging as Aidells in particular had very tough comps in the quarter. New items
like Aidells Salame and Gallo Peppered Salame helped overall.
You've heard me talk previously about our commitment to getting the hot dog category moving in the right direction,
and overall Ball Park is moving in the right direction. Year-to-date our Ball Park hot dog business has increased its
leading market share position and this is particularly encouraging to us as our Ball Park hot dog business is one of the
categories where we elected to discontinue some previous sub-optimal line extensions.
In quarter three, we focused on driving trial on our burger business, specifically our new frozen frame-grilled burgers,
which are pre-cooked and ready in 60 seconds from the microwave. We invested MAP to generate awareness and trial
on burgers, and the response was terrific. Sales in Q3 were more than twice that of the prior quarter and repeat purchase
has also been robust. Over 100% of our total MAP increase in Q3 went to this business and Jimmy Dean and clearly
we're glad we made that decision.
Q3 was also an important quarter for our Hillshire Farm franchise as it represented the start of a multi-phase restage in
one of our $1 billion brands. In the quarter, we began phasing in new smoked sausage varieties and improved sausage
packaging. Our snackable sausage business we call cocktail links, has had a strong season, and our pre-sliced
lunchmeat business transitioned to new improved product quality and a new package structure. And we call this phase
one because we expect innovation to play a critical role on this business well into the future.
Now let's talk a little bit about the Hillshire Farm lunchmeat transition. First, recall our Kansas City lunchmeat facility
is a state-of-the-art, high speed and highly automated operation. We anticipated a start-up curve as we transitioned to
the new improved product and different package structure and to avoid out of stocks, we pulled back on MAP and
promotion in quarter three versus where we'd been in quarter two. In fact, we planned for an associated volume and
sales decline as we navigated the transition, and you likely saw this in the scanner data. But as the quarter unfolded, we
also determined that the transition would be more challenging than had originally been assessed, and that the packaging
aesthetics we were seeing were not consistently up to our standards. While cosmetic, this was unacceptable to us and
we immediately mobilized to make several changes. Accordingly, we are refining our execution for more consistent
packaging appearance. But at the end of the day, this is an excellent brand and now an even better product, so it's
important we get the packaging right.
From the beginning, we've talked about the need to strengthen our soft spots and that the recovery timetable could be a
bit choppy. In the first half, we made progress and trends improved meaningfully on average. Q3 was a reminder that
our work here is not done. On one hand, our Sara Lee Deli restage recently commenced and we're hearing very positive
customer feedback. On the other hand, Foodservice and retail frozen bakery still need work.
In Q3, our Foodservice/Other segment declined. This was a function of our commodity sync pricing decline and soft
bakery performance as consumers continued their retreat from desserts amidst challenged household budgets. On the
retail side, as I mentioned earlier, frozen bakery had a challenging quarter three. Part of this was expected. In particular,
we proactively discontinued several low margin, low velocity items from the line up despite knowing we had unusually

tough comps where year-ago volume was up over 6%. The impact of this was then exacerbated by our competition not
following our post-holiday price increase.
We remain very clear-eyed about the need to bolster the softer pieces of our portfolio. With a lot of core brand
programs now in a good place, we're increasing our attention and making the necessary moves in other areas. In
Foodservice, while we have the leading market share in pies, velocity growth on core SKUs has been elusive. However,
we see a meaningful innovation opportunity in upscale desserts, which is nearly a $1 billion category growing and we
only have a 3% share.
C-stores are another opportunity with meat-centric hand holdable foods. And finally, we see additional opportunities to
increase trade efficiency. As we pursue these initiatives, we'll also be focused on improving margins over time. On
retail frozen bakery, it starts with sharpening our price points. We simply can't let others take our consumers because
price gaps remain too high. We're also improving our shelf presence and have several new items in development to add
some interest to our lineup.
Before I turn it over to Maria, I want to close with our overall outlook. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in a
disciplined way behind our core brands. At the same time, we are in a good position to increase our attention on the
remaining soft spots. And we're very pleased to be mobilized against a new, even more robust cost savings program
and strengthening our capabilities for sustained performance. We also see opportunity to create additional value
through disciplined capital deployment. Put it all together, and we remain very confident in both our original three-year
plan and our conviction that we are creating a company built for sustained, long-term value creation. That's it from me.
Maria, over to you.
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you've seen in our numbers and just heard from
Sean's comments, we posted solid earnings for the quarter, strong results for the first nine months of the fiscal year.
And we're on track to deliver the updated guidance we provided on the last call. We continue to execute our plan and
we're making progress.
Before I dive into the numbers, let me make some overview comments. For the quarter, we had favorable input costs,
which offset lower sales and enabled us to deliver higher gross profit year-over-year. We continue to invest in MAP
and innovation and our SG&A expense was higher as planned and previously communicated. Through a lot of work
over the last few months, we've identified the specific opportunity to deliver committed savings and additional
efficiencies. We ended the quarter with a very strong cash balance and overall we're on track to deliver a solid year one
of our plan.
Now let's take a look at the quarter's financial results. Our adjusted net sales declined 1% behind a 0.4% increase in
volume. If you exclude commodity meat sales, our volume declined approximately 0.5%. Lower sales were primarily
driven by Foodservice/Other segment. Gross profit was up 3% versus last year and benefited from favorable input cost
in the quarter. While our input costs were favorable for the quarter, the level of favorability was substantially lower
than what we experienced in the first two quarters. Consistent with our strategy and our intent to invest some of the first
half favorability into our business in the second half, we continued to invest in MAP in the quarter, and our MAP spend
was 4.2% of sales. As Sean discussed, we're diligent in our analysis of expected returns on MAP, and we only deploy it
when and where we believe we'll get an appropriate return.
Our SG&A excluding MAP was up 7% from last year as expected behind three things, our work force ramping to more
normalized levels, stranded costs coming into our P&L as our transition services agreements continue to ramp down
and certain investments that we made in the business. Adjusted operating income of $72 million is down 13% versus
last year, and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.35 was down 15%. As you can see, year-to-date, our adjusted EPS of $1.46 is
up 28% versus last year.

Now let's look at the segments. Retail segment sales and volume were flat, reflecting strength in many of our brands
being offset by planned decreases associated with our Hillshire Farm lunchmeat transition, product discontinuations, as
well as consumption weakness in frozen bakery. The 3% decrease in retail adjusted operating profit reflected planned
increases in SG&A, which were primarily the result of stranded cost coming into the segment from previously divested
businesses.
Moving on to Foodservice/Other, overall this segment had a challenging quarter, and you see that in the numbers.
Volume grew 1.3%, but 3 points of that growth was from commodity meat sales. Excluding sales of commodity meat,
Foodservice volume declined 2%. A number of factors contributed to the sales decline. First, macroeconomic
conditions were very challenging for restaurant traffic early in the calendar year. And as we've discussed, the dessert
area of Foodservice where we have a large business, is heavily impacted by consumers tightening their spend when
they do decide to eat out.
Next, when we have deflationary input costs, our Foodservice sales are lower as much of our business there is on
pass-through pricing contracts. And finally, our Foodservice/Other segment also had negative mix for the quarter,
depressing both sales and income. The unfavorable mix resulted from higher commodity meat sales, lower Bakery and
less favorable mix within the Foodservice Meat area. All of this, plus the segment's portion of the higher SG&A from
stranded cost lead to an adjusted operating segment income decline of 41.5% and an adjusted operating segment margin
of 4.1% for the quarter.
Beyond the financial results for the quarter, we've completed another major milestone in our plans, which is identifying
the specific opportunities and action plans to deliver the remaining $35 million of the $100 million cost-saving target
we communicated in June. As you recall, at that time we said we had full line of sight into $65 million of that. And we
had to find the remaining $35 million. We said we'd look to find it in our largest areas of spend, trade and supply chain
as well as general process efficiencies that would result from implementing a new culture and a new way of working.
The good news is that we now have full line of sight to the $35 million and we found some more.
As we work through our strategic planning process, which just wrapped up and which goes through fiscal 2016, we are
pleased that we've identified an additional $45 million of annual savings opportunity that we look to deliver by fiscal
2016. The additional opportunities further de-risk achieving our mid-term target.
We expect to spend $80 million to $100 million of new cash charges to achieve the $80 million in on-going benefits.
To be clear, the $80 million of benefits includes the $35 million plus the incremental $45 million. There may also be
some non-cash charges and we'll have more to say about that as we move forward.
The projects we've identified had outstanding financial returns with less than a three-year payback in total. In addition
to further strengthening our confidence in the mid-term targets, the investments we are making in capabilities will
position the company for sustainable growth and profitability well into the future.
Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. We received approximately $80 million of cash proceeds from the
sale of our Australian bakery business in the third quarter, helping to bring our cash balance at the end of the quarter to
$416 million. Excluding significant items, the business generated $242 million of cash and $407 million in adjusted
EBITDA during the first nine months of the fiscal year. With $533 million of net debt, we remain conservatively
leveraged. As we said, our priority is investing in our business. We're doing that through our investments in brand
building and innovation and we'll now be deploying some of our capital against our capability development and
efficiency programs as I discussed a moment ago. Beyond that, our strong cash position and the underlying earnings
generation of the business provides flexibility for us to increase our dividend over time and actively consider M&A as a
path to leverage our assets and capabilities to create shareholder value. We expect to have more to say on capital
allocation as we give guidance for fiscal 2014 on our next call in August.
With the first nine months of the year behind us, we are refining our full-year fiscal 2013 guidance. We now expect to
be at the high end of our EPS guidance range. Our previous sales guidance holds, and we still expect to be up slightly
for the year on the top line. Our outlook incorporates our expectation of continued investment in MAP and innovation
and takes into account the expected sales and earnings impact of the Hillshire Farm lunchmeat package transition.

Clearly, that situation puts more variability into how we will end the year than we would normally have with two
months to go, and it also influences the EPS guidance we are providing.
Let me make a few other comments related to guidance. We expect input cost to be unfavorable in the fourth quarter,
which will be the first time we've seen that this year. We also still expect segment SG&A excluding MAP to be up for
the year. Corporate expenses have continued to run favorably, and we now believe that we'll finish the year close to
about $50 million in corporate expense.
So let me wrap it up. Overall for fiscal 2013, I'm pleased with how our first year is unfolding. We're getting a lot of the
heavy lifting done that needs to be done in our first year. The significant favorability we gained this year from lower
input cost and expenses is enabling us to deliver higher earnings than originally anticipated. We've identified specific
actions to improve the capabilities of our business and deliver committed savings and finally, we're on track to deliver
the high end of our updated guidance that we provided on the last call.
With that, I'll now open it up for questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Akshay Jagdale, you may go
ahead with your question and please state your company name.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Thank you. KeyBanc. Good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, Akshay.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Hi. So can you quantify what the impact of The Hillshire lunchmeat issue is on the fourth
quarter earnings? I mean it looks like you didn't change your sales guidance. So the sales impact, if I understand it
correctly, is not very different than what you thought previously. But if you could just help us understand what the
earnings impact is in the fourth quarter that would be great.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We're not going to get into specifics on the impact of working through the lunchmeat piece
in the fourth quarter, Akshay, because quite frankly, we are getting the estimates to be more precise. I mean the way I
think about it overall, after the last quarter, as you know, we raised our EPS guidance range to the current $1.60 to
$1.70. And Q3's EPS came in a bit better than expected, which enables us to be able to say that we'll be at the high end
of the range. We won't go further though, as we have to take the actions necessary on lunchmeat as we discussed in the
call. And if that ends up costing us less than we estimated, it's possible we could do a bit better, but we don't want to
convey false precision on those estimates at this point.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay, helpful. And then just returns on MAP spending, so very encouraged to see
continued spending on MAP and your expectation to continue that trend in the fourth quarter, but obviously there's a lot
of moving parts on the volume side, so help me sort of grade yourself on how you did on your MAP spending so far?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I would give us an excellent grade on the MAP spend, and the simple way to think about it
is, we are extremely focused in terms of how we deploy the MAP increase. Our historical MAP rates have been very
light, as we've talked many times. And we needed to get them up. In fact, by fiscal 2015, we need to get it probably to a
full 5%. This year, we've increased it from about 3.5% a year ago on average to about 4.2%, 4.3%. And that increase
has been extremely focused. And where we've increased it, there is an outstanding return on investment. Jimmy Dean
really the key and then from an innovation side, on our Ball Park burger business where we are – feel very good about
the ROI because not only are we getting the trial response we want, but the product is delivering excellent repeat
purchase. So it's one of the – it's the gift that keeps on giving. The key, though, is that we focus our increased MAP in
areas that we believe, as Maria said, are ready for the MAP and we have confidence we can get a good ROI on it.

I'll also point out too, that on lunchmeat and we can talk a little bit about lunchmeat, that's a business where we
returned MAP to the portfolio in support of lunchmeat back in the second quarter. And we got the business going from
a mid single-digit decline to growth again, until we plan for the transition this quarter. So overall, I feel very good
about the response we've seen on MAP.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: And one last one just more on the category dynamics. Generally speaking meat-centric
snacks if I may, but we cover a few companies that are lower on the sort of branded scale, if I may, and closer to the
farm. And they have been talking more and more about becoming more branded and acquiring brands et cetera. So you
have some players who don't have a strong branded presence that are moving up the chain perhaps in private label first
and then with some smaller niche brands. So the first question is, have you seen that impact your categories, broadly
speaking? Do you think that's a long-term risk? And then secondly, related to that, the reason these companies that I'm
mentioning think this is a good strategy is because they feel like being closer or vertically integrated in some of these
protein chains gives them a competitive cost advantage. So not being vertically integrated, is that another – is that a big
risk in any way to your business model?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: A couple of thoughts in response, Akshay. First of all, I won't comment on specific
competitors, but I will say a couple of things. Number one, we do not believe vertical integration is an advantage to us
at all, and the reason for that is because we like being a focused food company and specifically a focused, branded food
company. We like management's attention on building great brands because great brands tend to translate to the ability
to hold price and higher margins, and we like the ability to focus on things like the consumer and innovation as
opposed to the vertical integration side of it. So that is definitely not our philosophy.
With respect to other companies or other companies wanting to be in the branded business, of course people want to be
in brands. But there is a difference between brands and iconic brands, and what we love about our portfolio is we
believe we've got a portfolio of iconic brands. As we've talked before, some of them have been neglected. We clearly
have been quite busy trying to get them up and running again to unleash their potential, and we feel like we're making
tremendous progress in that regard.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Just one follow-up on that. I mean, have you seen...
<A - Maria Henry>: Akshay, I'm sorry. We've got a lot of people in queue. So we can follow up with you afterwards.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay. No problem. I'll get back to you. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Jason English. You may go ahead with your question and please state your
company name.
<Q - Jason English>: Hey, guys. Jason English here, Goldman Sachs. Thanks for the question.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, Jason.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: Maria, can you comment on or try to help us quantify the magnitude of deflation? And then on
the flip side, what the potential inflation may be for the next quarter?
<A - Maria Henry>: Let me give you a little bit of color there. On the deflation that we saw in the third quarter, that
was the most significant driver of what you saw happen on our gross margin line. So I won't give you a specific
quantification on it, but you kind of know what the normalized gross margin rate of the business is. And the help from
the input cost was the key driver on our gross margin rate in the third quarter. Going forward, in the fourth quarter, we
expect commodity cost to be a hurt, and we expect commodity cost to be inflationary in fiscal 2014. Now if I compare
the expectations on that to what I thought three months ago, it has become less inflationary, but we still expect it to be
inflationary in the fourth quarter and as we move through 2014.

<Q - Jason English>: Great. Thank you for that. One quick follow up. Sean, yesterday we saw Clorox report earnings
and they got buffeted on the charcoal side of their business with a really weak start to grilling season. Have you seen
any headwinds related to that in your business?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Last year was my first winter in Chicago. When I got here we had five days in a row of
80-degree weather. So it was an unusual wrap, but quite frankly I don't like talking about the impact of weather on the
business because to me that's a timing thing. Weather always comes. Grilling season I expect will be robust, and we
expect to be full participants in it.
<Q - Jason English>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Goldman. You may go ahead with your question and please state your
company name.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hi. JPMorgan.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ken.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Good morning. Maria, you guys now have, if my calculations are right, more cash on your
balance sheet as a percent of enterprise value of pretty much every packaged food company out there. So I guess my
question is what are you waiting for, right? You have a dividend yield that you've talked about increasing. Maybe
you're keeping your powder dry for some acquisitions that you see out there, but I'm just curious, why not raise your
payout ratio now, please some investors who are obviously looking for yield in this kind of environment and perhaps
get your stock up that way, rather than sit on cash that's not earning much interest?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Ken. I agree that we've got a very nice cash balance at the end of the third quarter, and
we've talked a lot about how we think about capital allocation with the first priority being internal investment in our
business. We continue to invest in our business in brand building through innovation and MAP and as I talked about
today, we'll be investing some capital against capabilities development and some new projects to unlock some further
efficiencies. Beyond that we do intend to take up the dividend, and I'll have more to say about that on the call in
August. We do see M&A as a way to create significant shareholder value. As I've talked about, we think we've got
assets and capabilities that can be leveraged. We'll have a disciplined approach to M&A, clearly, and we're looking for
acquisitions that align with our strategic vision and have smart financials. So we do see M&A as a good way to create
value, and we want to allow ourselves flexibility to be able to act on that. You know as well as I do, one of the factors
with M&A is that we don't control availability or timing of when deals can happen. So we'll keep you updated moving
forward, but we are actively looking at that.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Would you say, though, just as a follow up that one of the reasons you are keeping cash in
your balance sheet is to keep your powder dry for a potential acquisition? And if so, why would you do that given how
low interest rates are, right? You could always raise your dividend now, and if a deal comes, lever up and I'm sure the
market would be more than happy to see you do that.
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah. I clearly understand where you're coming from and your point of view on that, but I'll have
more to say about the dividend come August.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - Maria Henry>: Yep.

Thank you. The next question comes from Rob Moskow. You may go ahead with your question and please state your
company name.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Thanks. It's Rob Moskow, Credit Suisse. I guess I wanted to know more about the packaging
switch in Hillshire, The Hillshire Brand. And maybe more broadly, Sean, the Sara Lee business before you got there
had kind of a reputation for uneven performance and some supply chain hiccups. So I wanted to know if you think that
this latest issue is just kind of a one-time event or as you look at how the business is performing right now, do you feel
like the supply chain is – it needs more investment in order to avoid future issues?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good question. I feel great about our supply chain. The team on the supply chain side has
made great strides this year in a number of areas. This is an issue specific to lunchmeat and quite frankly the majority
of the lunchmeat decline in terms of net sales on the quarter was planned, because keep in mind per my comments
earlier, Kansas City is a very automated amazing plant, but when you transition to a new physical structure, you
basically ramp down your throughput to start the thing up and get used to the new structure. And that means that our
typical merchandising, which was fairly robust in the year-ago period, we expected not to be able to fulfill. So we
chose to manage the demand side of it down by pulling back on our MAP expense and our merchandising versus where
we were in Q2. So that's the bulk – the bulk of what we saw there was planned.
What was not planned was that as we went through the quarter and we started getting products out on the shelf, simply
put, it didn't look right consistently. The product was great, but the appearance wasn't consistently up to our
expectations. And we noticed it, and so did our consumers toward the end of the quarter, because if you'd looked in fine
detail at the scanner data, what you would have seen is the promoted volume was down throughout the quarter as we
planned. The baseline volume was down a bit because we pulled MAP down, but then it dipped a bit further when
some of these inconsistent products made its way on to the shelf. What we were expecting, quite frankly, was nicely
layered, beautiful meat and an overall appearance that lived up to the product's strong taste credentials, and in some
instances the presentation didn't meet our standards. So we'll address it in Q4 head on, and we'll move forward with our
other restaged products – projects. But the bottom line is we're committed to doing things right on Hillshire Farm, and
we expect big things from this. It's one of our billion dollar brands.
And recall before the transition we had gotten the brand growing again when we activated MAP in quarter two. So it's
an executional challenge that we'll work our way through. I don't view it as a big deal, but in no way do I view it as a
statement around our supply chain capabilities, which I think are excellent.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. Maria, just a quick question about the cost savings that you found and you're going
after, of the cash that you're spending, where is it going to be spent on, is it mostly on capital to improve efficiency? Or
is it also to pay off pensions and maybe retirement acceleration?
<A - Maria Henry>: The $80 million to $100 million of cash charges that I talked about is not CapEx. Those are
charges that will show up against the P&L. And the areas that we are going after for the savings are areas where we
have the biggest spend on our P&L. So it's in the areas of trade and revenue management. It's in the area of supply
chain efficiency. And beyond that, it's within our support processes in the company. So things like IT, finance,
procurement, those types of activity. And so that's what that spend is focused on, and that's where we expect to realize
the benefits.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Maria Henry>: Yep.

<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Bank of Montreal and good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ken.
<A - Maria Henry>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Just following up on that question about the cost savings. How do you expect to use those
cost savings? Are you going to put it back into the business? Are you prepping to basically offset greater commodity
inflation? How do you think about that incremental cost savings? And how does that better prepare you for the future?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. Let me break down the cost savings that we talked about. We talked about a number of $85
million, and $35 million of that was just finding the specific opportunities to the $100 million that we had committed
to. When we just completed our strategic planning process, which goes through fiscal 2016, we were able to identify
the incremental $45 million in savings. A lot of that comes closer to the – or into full 2016 as our strategic planning
process goes out an additional year. The way that we think about the savings is that it de-risks the achievement of the
mid-term guidance that we've given. It gives us some more flexibility around investing in innovation and for growth,
and beyond 2015 it gives us some further flexibility.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And my just follow up is, the degree of outperformance that you had in the first half of the
year, the re-investment, does that give you – change the confidence level to be able to offset the commodity exposure
for 2014? Or because obviously you put a lot back into the EPS number, how do you balance that and kind of thinking
about – more about 2014 with that.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, we're not going to speculate on how we think the commodity curve is going to unfold
for fiscal 2014 at this point. Certainly we're not prepared to guide on fiscal 2014 at this point. But I will say the
philosophy we've got is that if we find ourselves in any given fiscal year where we get material favorability to the
bottom line because input costs break our way, our principle has always been to take some of that to the bottom line but
to take some of it and put it back into the business so that we could strengthen our brands going into potentially
headwind periods.
And the whole reason for that is the way you manage for margin consistency on these businesses is by keeping your
brand strong, and that's precisely the model that we followed this year as things broke our way. And it's given us the
ability to put a little bit more into MAP in the back half. For example, you'll see MAP spend in quarter four, where
typically in the old days, our MAP spend in quarter four would drop precipitously as we were kind of sliding into home
on the year. So we'll sustain that. We've also got more slotting in our back half this year for new items that are coming
into the marketplace following some of the weeding that I've talked about before in terms of pulling out previously
launched lower margin or low-velocity SKUs.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Thank you very much.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Sure.

Thank you. The next question comes from Alexia Howard. You may go ahead with your question, and please state your
company name.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Yes. It's Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein. Good morning, everyone. Can I ask
about – coming back to the lunchmeat question, how soon do you expect to be back up to sort of full capacity, starting
the marketing and merchandising again? Just want to get a sense for whether that's – it's possible that it might persist
into the next fiscal year? And secondly, just as a follow-up, do you have any ballpark estimate of what the unexpected
lunchmeat transition issues might have cost you, either to the top line for the year or the EPS line? Thank you.

<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, per the comments earlier on the precise cost of navigating through this lunchmeat
bump, the way I think about it in the simplest terms is, EPS came in a bit better than what we expected in quarter three.
But we're not going to take that to the year because we've got to use that to cover anticipated cost to navigate through
this in quarter four, which we really don't have a whole lot more precision on that to give you in terms of top line or
bottom line. We're working through that as we speak.
In terms of the conversion cost piece and the plant running, the plant has actually made tremendous progress in the
typical startup that we were planning for, that we were working the plant through. And just in the last couple weeks, the
plant has really started to get its throughputs back up. Exactly where in quarter four we'll land that thing back to our
typical run rate, I can't tell you. But my team's goal here is obviously to push this to get it right back to where it was as
fast as possible.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. The next question comes from John Baumgartner. You may ask your question and please state your
company name.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Good morning. Wells Fargo.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, John.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Sean, just in terms of pricing here at retail, it seems as though the industry has been
passing through lower input costs in sausage. Lunchmeat prices have been declining a bit. So just wondering what your
sense is as to the consumer's ability to absorb higher prices going forward, if the industry needs to pass through some of
those re-inflationary input costs over the next few months?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think the consumer's willingness to pay higher prices depends upon the brand. And it
depends upon the elasticity of the brand. And we have different elasticities, as do all companies, on different brands. It
tends to be directly correlated with the strength of that brand. So, our goal is to continue to strengthen our brand so that
we can pass through pricing. And in deflationary times, we tend to hang on to that deflation, it gives us the ability to
drop it to the bottom line or invest it back in the business. In inflationary times, we look to hang on to, as we look for
our brand strength to be able to help us navigate inflation to the best of our ability. But, as you can imagine, it varies by
business. So businesses like Aidells, which ironically is our most expensive brand, and Jimmy Dean have lower
elasticities, but businesses historically that had either not innovated or competed based on price have higher elasticities.
Those businesses we are trying to move more toward advertising and marketing-based competition and less based on
price competition.
So, in terms of specific competitors and what they may do on price, sometimes if you don't have a brand equity, you
resort to price-based competition as an alternative. That's one of the things that we see going on in the dessert category,
which was challenging for us this particular quarter, where there really hasn't been a lot of innovation and
contemporization in that category, and as a result you see people competing on price, which really isn't good for the
category overall. So, we're going to stay to the high road here on this and continue to push on brand building and
innovation because we're convinced that's ultimately the way to create the most value for our shareowners.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Great. Thanks, Sean.

<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Sure. Consumers – excuse me – Consumer Edge Research. Sorry about that. I just had a
question on Foodservice. I know no one really brought it up, doesn't sound like so far, at least. When you look at the
operating profit decline, year-over-year, is about $10 million it looks like on the segment side, $7 million that came
from Foodservice. So I'm just wondering, I guess, one, could you just kind of walk through or discuss where you might
foresee trends for modeling purposes, kind of anything into Q4 then really for overall for 2014? And then secondly,
which is just kind of bigger picture is, how do you view the Foodservice business? I mean like how much operating
leverage are you able to get out of that business to actually make it worth your while to continue to work through with
the pressure that we've seen in the business, really for the past three to four years across the board for most companies
that operate in the area? Thanks.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: A couple of thoughts, so first of all, just about every company that I can think of in our
space has a Foodservice division and that's because it's practical to have a Foodservice division. You can create value
with a Foodservice division, you can leverage your assets, so on and so forth. So it definitely plays a role, not only in
Hillshire, but in just about every company I can think of in the space. The industry in general had a tough quarter in
Foodservice overall in the first quarter of the calendar year, as I'm sure everybody's seen, particularly in January for a
variety of reasons I won't get into, macroeconomic. And we were no exception of that. And interestingly recall, that's
following a very solid quarter two, where I think if memory serves me correctly, our OI was up 8% or so in the quarter.
So it was an unusually challenging quarter in Foodservice. But Foodservice absolutely plays a role in our portfolio.
We expect that the channel will remain challenging in the immediate future, but clearly not to the same degree as this
past quarter. And in part that's because what we're doing – part of that is the industry and bouncing back from the tax
refund deal in January, so on and so forth. But a big part of it is because we're taking action to improve trends and mix
over time in our portfolio, as we talked earlier in the call. I don't know, Maria, did you have anything to add to that?
<A - Maria Henry>: No.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up is, this all goes back to Ken's questions around cash and
the dividend increase. I know you're going to talk about this in August. But that said, from the beginning of the year,
EPS guidance has gone up. You now have a $400 million cash balance at the end of Q3. So obviously the cash
expectations, the cash generation expectations of the business in year one have been a lot higher than you expected, or I
would think so, from where you started the year. So with that outside of looking for M&A or looking to increase the
dividend, how do you think that out-sized cash generation has actually expanded your optionality to allocate capital or
expanded your potential – or increased your potential to potentially increase the dividend more so than you had
originally planned? I'm just trying to get a sense of, you're in a better position now than you were on earnings, but also
in cash, as you were in the beginning of the year, and I know we keep kind of pushing that off, but the larger question
is, with more cash, how could you potentially use the stepped-up cash level going into 2014?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. We are very pleased with where we are on cash, both in terms of cash that we have on the
balance sheet. As you know, it is higher than I expected it to be at this point when we first came out in June of last year.
So very happy with the cash balance and also the underlying business has had very good cash generation this year
because of a number of factors.
How all that plays into how we think about capital allocation is that we still think about it in line with the priorities that
I've talked about. When we look at our dividend, we've clearly started out at a conservative dividend payout level, and
we've talked about taking that up over time. We take into account the higher cash balance that we have and also what
we see in terms of the earnings generation of the business coming out of having just worked through our new three year
or updated three-year strategic plan. So we'll take all of that into consideration as we reset the dividend, which I'll talk
about in a few months here on the August call. We also still consider share buybacks as a valid way to deploy capital.
We evaluate the economics around share buybacks against what we think is in the best interest of the shareholders from
an increased dividend or M&A activity and weigh all of those factors to come up with how we allocate capital. At the
end of the day, we look to allocate it in a way that we think best creates shareholder value over the long run. So I agree
with you that very happy with the cash balance and the cash flow generation of the business in the fiscal year, and that
gives us a lot more flexibility on what we might do and the level we might do it to.

company name.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Davenport & Company. Good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning, Ann.
<A - Maria Henry>: Good morning.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: Thank you for the question. I wanted just to touch a little bit on volume expectations for 2014
as we've seen good response from the increased brand support behind Jimmy Dean and Ball Park. Can you comment on
volume expectations as we go into 2014?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Ann, we're not going to comment on 2014 now. We'll be in a position to talk more about
what we expect in 2014 on our next call.
<Q - Ann H. Gurkin>: But given the response you've seen right now from the increased MAP spending, is it fair to
assume we could see upside to volumes going into 2014? [ph] Is that a fair digression (51:22)?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think what we can say is that we are committed to growth, and we're committed to
profitable growth. We believe that is the way to create value, and we'll do it through brand building and innovation.
And we've given mid-term guidance at this point as you know for F 2015, but nothing yet on F 2014.

company name.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Thanks. With Morningstar. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning.
<A - Maria Henry>: Good morning.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: I'm just wondering, you pulled back on the MAP spend on the lunchmeats initially due to the
packaging issue. So I'm just wondering, since you had some new innovations and flavors that you're planning to roll out
in the fourth quarter, if any of those adjustments could impact the timing of the MAP spend to support the rollout?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: A lot of the – some of the launches here for the back half are really just ramping up. For
example, Ball Park Lean hot dogs just from now kind of flowing into the marketplace and achieving scale. Same thing
with some of the new lunchmeat flavors. So typically what we do is we'll work new products into the marketplace in
the back quarter of the year, the back half of the year sometimes, and then really begin to support them once they
achieve scale distribution, which really probably is more of a fiscal 2014 concept.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Okay, great. And then just wanted to touch quickly on the gross margins were pretty strong,
and clearly commodity costs were the driver. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense for how much innovation
also seems to be playing a role, given that the volumes are strong, and how we should think about favorable mix from
innovation versus pricing and the higher input cost going forward?

<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, innovation will clearly be ramping up, as it has been this year. I showed you the 11%
versus the 9%. We expect by the time we get to fiscal 2015 that will be up farther, as we talked. The gross margins on
those innovations will depend upon the specific item. Some of the items leverage assets that we are up and running on,
and we've got them in house, and we've got an excellent gross margin on. Some of the things that are newer to us we
work through co-packers, we sell at a lower gross margin in the early days until we prove it and then we repatriate it,
we'd bring it back in-house, reinvest some capital, so on and so forth. So it's really a mix. Innovation will absolutely be
more of a contributor overall though to the top line as we proceed forward than it has been historically.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Great. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from [ph] Philippe Gusen (53:47). You may go ahead with your question, and
please state your company name.
<Q>: Yes, sir. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions here. Mitsubishi Securities. Maria, I wanted to kind
of go back to the M&A topic that came up a couple of times, and I have kind of a two-part question to that. First, from
a portfolio perspective, can you point us to any potential holes that you would have for M&A activity, kind of what
makes sense? And then kind of related to that as well from a geographic perspective, obviously focus is on the U.S., but
do you see opportunities to add value also by looking outside of the U.S.?
And then my second question is more from a credit perspective. Right now you're a solid, mid-BBB type company.
When you look at M&A activity potentially down the road, can you share with us what your sensitivities are with
regard to ratings? Is it critical for you to maintain that mid -BBB? Or you might be willing to go a little bit lower but
still stay in that investment grade space? Thank you.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, [ph] Philippe (54:51). Your first question is around M&A and I'll take geography first. Our
first priority is within the U.S. We think we've got ample opportunities right in front of us and the execution risk of
staying within the U.S. geography is obviously lower. And so right now that's where our efforts are focused, given the
sizeable opportunities that I think we see.
In terms of the holes in the portfolio, here is how we think about M&A and the potential targets. We look for things
that are in line with our strategic vision, clearly that have smart financials to them. In terms of – specifically what we
look for is we look for properties that have meaningfully attractive top-line growth trends. We look for things that are
accretive to our margin structure and to our EPS. And ultimately we look for places where we could structure deals that
have economics that create shareholder value over time.
In terms of the credit rating, we are solid investment grade at this point. Our preference is to remain solid investment
grade. That, we think, gives us just financial flexibility on a number of fronts, which we like. Does it mean that we
absolutely wouldn't do something that might put a little bit of pressure on that? No, it doesn't mean that. But our
preference is that we would like to maintain our investment grade rating for the flexibility it gives us.
<Q>: Okay. Thank you very much, Maria.
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah.

Operator
Thank you. The last question comes from John Baumgartner. You may go ahead with your question, and please state
your company name.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Wells Fargo. Thanks for the follow-up. Maria, any update in terms of the legacy
payments still due, as an impact to cash on the balance sheet here?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. There is a couple of things that I've talked about on legacy payments. I've previously told
you that we would have $65 million to $75 million in charges in our fiscal 2013 P&L related to what we're calling
legacy actions. You can see in the tables that year-to-date we have $52 million of significant items related to that. I
think that it's likely going to be close to the bottom end of that range, and some of it will materialize beyond fiscal
2013.
The other piece that I've talked about in terms of legacy items is that we expect $190 million to $210 million of legacy
cash obligations. And I've said that the majority of that would be paid in fiscal 2013. I expect some favorability on
those costs as well, so the lower end of the range. And I'm going to provide more guidance on that specifically in
August. And the reason I'm holding off until August is that I expect a significant amount of legacy cash to get paid out
in the fourth quarter, and there's some timing issues around that. So I'd rather just get through the fourth quarter, see
where we are. And then I'll give you a clearer picture of how I see the cash related to those legacy obligations post
fiscal 2013 when we're back on the phone in August.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: All right. Thanks, Maria.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure.

Thank you. At this time there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.
