MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is John, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the DuPont quarterly investor call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After
the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Carl Lukach, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carl, you
may begin.
Carl J. Lukach
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome, thank you for joining us today for DuPont's first quarter
2013 performance call with investors. With me this morning are Ellen Kullman, Chair and CEO; Nick Fanandakis,
Executive Vice President and CFO; and Jim Borel, Executive Vice President of our Ag and Nutrition & Health
segments.
The slides for today's presentation can be found on our website along with the news release we issued this morning.
During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, and I direct you to slide two for
our disclaimers. All statements that adjust expectations or projections about the future are forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance, but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors

that could cause actual results to differ materially.
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you review the reconciliations to GAAP statements
provided with our earnings news release and on our website.
I'd like to highlight several changes we've made this quarter in our reporting materials. We will now refer to operating
earnings, which exclude non-operating pension costs and significant items. We announced these reporting changes in
December last year and believe this better reflects the ongoing performance of our businesses. In addition, we have also
made a number of simplifications and additional disclosures we hope will make it easier for you to understand our
performance and reconcile to GAAP results.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Good morning and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to have this opportunity to review how our company
performed in the first quarter and against our growth and value creation plans. Our results were in line with what we
expected and communicated to you three months ago.
DuPont reported $1.5 billion of operating earnings, or $1.56 per share, on revenues of $10.4 billion. Our employees
executed well against our business plans and faced a wide range of market opportunities and challenges in global
markets. And despite the challenging environment in Europe and a few other markets, our strategies for long-term
growth are working. In Agriculture, we had record-setting sales and earnings that reflect strong farmer demand for our
products, especially our latest corn seed hybrids and our blockbuster crop protection product, Rynaxypyr. We had a
strong finish to the growing season in Brazil and took advantage of an early and robust start to the North American
growing season to deliver exceptional results. And Jim is going to provide more insights about our strong performance
in these businesses.
While our Agriculture segment hit record levels, our Performance Chemicals segment sales and operating earnings
were down in line with what we expected, reflecting the widely communicated market adjustments underway in the
global titanium dioxide [TiO2] market. While our results here were down significantly from peak levels last year, our
titanium dioxide business earns a superior cash return on invested capital and did so in the quarter. We continue to
expect market conditions to stabilize around the middle of the year, and we saw early signs of that in the first quarter as
our sales volumes were up 8% sequentially from the fourth quarter of last year.
In general, uncertainty in industrial markets dampened customer demand in other businesses. Specifically, global
automotive builds were down, particularly in Europe, Japan, and Korea. Additionally, demand for materials sold into
the photovoltaics markets declined in China, and public sector demand in the U.S. remained soft. We continue to
increase value by driving cost productivity, capitalizing on the integration of our recent acquisitions, launching new
high-value products, and actively deploying our science in fast-growing emerging markets by collaborating closely
with leading local companies.
Our cost productivity gains in the first quarter were firmly on track to meet our target of at least $300 million for this
year. Our Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences teams have fully integrated our Danisco and Solae
acquisitions, and we're exceeding our acquisition synergy targets. We have growth programs underway and are excited
about the value creation these acquisitions will deliver going forward.
Our new product launches in the first quarter continued to reflect the diversity and the richness of DuPont's science and
technology capability as we apply innovation to address world needs by increasing food production and quality, by
improving energy efficiency, and providing greater protection for people and the environment. We introduced more
than 500 new products this quarter, balanced between growth and replacement products and balanced across our
portfolio of businesses. In Agriculture, we introduced new products in seven crops across five continents that will
increase agricultural productivity.

DuPont is also actively collaborating with value chain partners globally through our 11 newly opened Innovation
Centers. The most recently opened center was in Istanbul, Turkey this month. And it's through these centers that
DuPont science connects directly with current and potential customers to collaborate and develop new solutions to meet
their needs. We have hundreds of new products underway and are excited about how we are activating our science to
create value for customers and shareholders.
In addition, I'd like to highlight that during the quarter we executed the $1 billion share repurchase program that we
announced to you last quarter. And today, we also announced our Board of Directors has improved a 5% increase in
our dividend. Lastly, we are reaffirming our full-year 2013 outlook, which I'll address at the end of our call today.
And so with that, I will turn things over to Nick, who will take you through the quarter results in detail. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Let's start out with the details of the quarter, shown on slide three.
As expected, operating earnings of $1.56 per share were down $0.08 versus $1.64 in the prior year. This decline
reflects lower Performance Chemicals operating earnings of $0.26 per share, largely due to the decline in global TiO2
prices. And this was partially offset by record results from our Agricultural segment.
Consolidated net sales of $10.4 billion increased 2% versus the prior year. Volume increased 2%, led by our
Agricultural segment, where volumes grew 8%. Additionally, 1% higher local selling prices were the result of
value-driven pricing in the Ag and Nutrition & Health segments, which were partially offset by declining TiO2 prices.
Currency had a negative 1% impact on the top line, primarily due to the weaker Brazilian real and Japanese yen.
From a regional perspective, the largest local selling price increases and volume growth were seen in the U.S. and
Canada and Latin America, where our Ag businesses flourished. In Asia-Pacific, higher volume in our TiO2 and our
Packaging & Industrial Polymers businesses were offset by lower volume in our Electronics & Communications and
Chemicals & Flouroproducts businesses. The 6% decline in local selling prices in the region was primarily due to lower
TiO2 prices.
In Europe, lower volume was primarily due to poor weather conditions that delayed our Ag sales. However, Ag pricing
gains drove higher local selling prices up, but they were partly offset by lower TiO2 prices. This quarter, developing
EMEA was our highest growth region, up 15% versus last year, reflecting strong Ag sales growth in Eastern Europe.
For more information regarding the company sales by geographic region, please look at slide four.
Now let's take a deeper look into the operating earnings for the first quarter. New this quarter, slide five provides a
segment operating earnings variance analysis. From this, you can see clearly the large impact the Performance
Chemicals and Ag segments had on our overall earnings compared to the prior-year first quarter. Our remaining
businesses were impacted by continued uncertainty in industrial markets. Jim and Carl will provide more details about
each of our businesses when they cover the segments.
Moving to slide six, you can see that the decline in segment operating earnings resulted in a $0.14 per share negative
impact on the consolidated results. This $0.14 also includes a negative $0.04 currency impact for the first quarter. At
current exchange rates, we expect the second quarter currency impact to also be negative by about $0.02 per share. For
the full year, we expect a negative $0.05 currency impact, with a $0.01 tailwind in the second half of the year.
The $0.03 benefit from lower corporate expenses that you see on slide six reflects this quarter's savings from our 2012
restructuring program. We are on plan to deliver the $300 million in savings that we targeted for 2013. You'll see the
savings impact more of our results as we progress throughout the year.
In addition to the restructuring program, we continue to execute on our cost productivity initiatives throughout all of
our businesses. We are well on our way to delivering on our commitment of greater than $300 million for the full year
from these initiatives. As a reminder, this is in addition to the $300 million of savings we expect this year from the
restructuring program. In total, both will contribute significantly to offset inflation and help fund our growth

investments.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on slide seven, first quarter free cash flow was an outflow of $3 billion
versus an outflow of $2.2 billion last year. As you recall, our working capital spikes in the first quarter due to normal
seasonality of our Ag business. This increase in seasonal outflow versus last year's first quarter was due to lower cash
earnings and higher Ag working capital, partially offset by lower pension contributions. The higher Ag working capital
was primarily due to the timing of customer and production growing compensation payments, which were also larger
this year due to higher commodity prices.
In the first quarter, we executed a $1 billion share repurchase program, which will be completed by the end of this
month. We accomplished the share buyback by using a portion of the Performance Coatings divestiture proceeds,
which we received in February. We used the remainder of the Performance Coatings proceeds to strengthen our balance
sheet, and this is the primary reason you see our net debt decreasing by $4.5 billion versus this time last year.
Additionally, as Ellen just noted, we announced today that our board approved a $0.02 per share or 5% increase to our
quarterly dividend. This is our 435th consecutive quarterly dividend.
In summary, first quarter results were in line with expectations, with strong growth in Ag more than offset by lower
TiO2 prices.
With that overview of the first quarter, I'll turn the call over to Jim to review our Ag and Nutrition & Health segments.
Jim?
James C. Borel
Thanks, Nick.
The Agriculture segment had a great start to what we expect will be another year of strong growth in both our Seed and
Crop Protection businesses, posting another new record for first quarter sales and operating earnings. Agriculture
fundamentals remain solid globally, and we continue to execute and deliver results consistent with our long-term
growth plans. Our results in both businesses were led by a strong start to Northern Hemisphere planting season
preparations and a strong finish to the season in Latin America.
On slide eight, sales in Agriculture grew 14% to $4.7 billion, with volume of 8% and price of 6% net of a small
currency headwind, primarily in Latin America. Operating earnings increased 13% to $1.5 billion. Volume and pricing
gains were partially offset by higher input costs in seeds, pressuring operating margins down slightly. Ag results
included about a $0.02 per share timing benefit to the first quarter operating earnings, primarily due to the accelerated
pace of North American corn seed deliveries as compared to last year.
Starting with Seeds, first quarter sales grew 14% to a record $3.6 billion. Corn sales in North America led the way, as
growers have signaled intentions to the USDA to plant about 97 million acres in the U.S., similar to last year. And
we're seeing very strong demand for our corn hybrids following last year's strong competitive performance, and our
order book remained solidly ahead of last year. Adoption of our industry-leading AcreMax integrated and reduced
refuge products is strong, and we're on track to deliver against our penetration commitments.
We've also launched AcreMax XTreme in 2013. And while introductory volumes are small, we're looking forward to
growers experiencing these dual-mode above and below-ground products on their farms this summer.
Growers across the Corn Belt have high interest in our AQUAmax hybrids, which demonstrated a 9% yield
improvement against competitors in water-limited environments last year. Orders are exceeding our expectations, and
we now anticipate that AQUAmax will be planted on about 7 million acres in North America.
We're also beginning to extend the AQUAmax to Europe, and initial interest there is high. Mix improvement from
these technologies integrated into our newest genetics put us on track to achieve our plan of 5% to 10% pricing gains in
North America.

Last month, USDA Planting Intentions survey indicates growers expect to plant about 77 million acres of soybeans.
And while soybean sales impact operating earnings more in the second quarter as they're typically planted later than
corn, we're on track for another successful season, with orders tracking similar to last year.
Turning to Brazil, we continue to see the results of our multiyear investment in growth strategy paying off. First quarter
for us is primarily where sales for the safrinha season impact our financial results. Growers in Brazil planted a record
number of corn hectares in the safrinha planning season, and it likely exceeded the summer season corn plantings for
the first time. When the planting data is finalized, we expect we will gain share following a multipoint share gain in the
2012 summer season.
Farmers in Brazil continue to adopt our newest technologies at a rapid pace. New genetics, native traits, and innovative
solutions like Intrasect, which features two modes of action in above-ground insect control, are creating value. We
expect Intrasect products to represent about a third of our corn sales in 2013. And for the entire safrinha season, we
grew sales over 40% from higher volume and strong pricing gains.
Our Crop Protection business had a strong first quarter also, exceeding $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time.
Crop Protection sales grew 17% in the quarter, approaching $1.1 billion. Volume gains were the primary driver, but
price also increased in each region on the strength of new product launches. Regionally, North America led the growth,
with sales up 60%. In North America, we saw strong preseason demand across all product portfolios, bolstered by high
grower planting intentions and good crop prices.
Demand for soybean preemergence herbicides was strong, and we continued to experience strengthening mutual
success with our go-to-market approach working together with Pioneer in the U.S. corn and soybean market. We're
very excited about the new launch of our picoxystrobin disease control products, Aproach in the U.S. and Acapela in
Canada, as leading contributors to our rapid growth in North America.
We also saw strong Crop Protection sales growth across Latin America, with sales up 30%. Insect pressure was intense
in corn and soybeans, creating strong demand for our Rynaxypyr and Indoxacarb insect control solutions. Rynaxypyr
continues to grow in all regions and countries, and we're on plan to exceed $800 million in sales this year. In addition,
the new launch of Cyazypyr insect control products from that same innovative classic chemistry as Rynaxypyr
continues to deliver exceptional field performance results, expanding our portfolio and breadth of insect control
innovations.
We continue to make investments in our leading crop protection R&D pipeline, and the first quarter results demonstrate
our focused strategy for growth is working.
As we look to the second quarter, we expect sales growth similar to the first quarter, anticipating a strong finish to the
Northern Hemisphere grain planting season. We expect earnings to be up moderately despite the $0.02 per share impact
from early North American corn deliveries in the first quarter. Additionally, we expect operating margins in the second
quarter to decline one to two points versus the prior year, primarily from higher input prices in soybeans, which
represent a larger portion of second quarter sales. Lastly, we'll continue to make strategic growth investments in both
businesses.
Grower planting intentions are high. Our order book is strong and we have good supplies of seeds and crop protection
products positioned in the market. Air and soil temperatures have been cooler in the early spring this year, and weather
in the next few weeks will be an important factor in determining whether acres are planted as intended. We'll remain
close to our customers through planting, and we are in the best position in the industry to meet changing grower needs.
Now let's turn to slide nine and review our Nutrition & Health segment, which includes Enablers, Health and
Protection, and Protein Solutions businesses. Sales of $868 million were up 7% on pricing gains and volume growth.
Sales were particularly strong in emerging markets, growing double digits in all three businesses. Operating earnings of
$76 million were down $3 million, as sales growth was offset by higher raw material costs, primarily guar in Enablers.
Global market fundamentals remain solid, and we saw pricing and volume gains across all three businesses. Health and
Protection and Protein Solutions both delivered strong results and growing price and volume, led by very strong

probiotics and specialty protein sales. Productivity remains a clear focus, and cost and operations synergies are on track
with our plans.
Turning to the outlook, we anticipate similar sales growth in the second quarter as demand indicators and market
fundamentals remain solid and in line with the first quarter. Operating earnings in the second quarter are expected to be
flat, as high-cost guar inventory in Enablers will continue to pressure margins, partially offset by productivity efforts.
As we look to the second half of the year, we expect margins to improve as raw material costs normalize.
Now I'll turn it to Carl.
Carl J. Lukach
Okay. Thanks, Jim. I'll cover the remaining segments, beginning on slide 10 with Electronics & Communications.
Sales of $616 million declined 9%, primarily due to lower sales into photovoltaics [PV], as market share gains were
more than offset by reduced materials usage by module manufacturers. Operating earnings of $49 million were down
$10 million on the lower sales.
For the second quarter, we anticipate sales will be down significantly and operating earnings down substantially versus
a very strong 2Q last year. Although PV module production is expected to be flat for the year, in the second quarter
module production is forecast to be down 15% versus last year's strong second quarter, when inventories were building.
We also believe the trend of reduced materials usage at module makers will continue. We anticipate second half results
will benefit from sequential increases in module production and stronger demand in consumer electronics, driven by
smartphones and tablets.
Moving to slide 11, sales in our Industrial Biosciences segment were essentially flat at $289 million, on 1% higher
prices offset by a 1% decline in volume. Strong demand and higher prices for Sorona in carpeting and growth in food
enzymes were largely offset by lower enzyme volumes for ethanol. Operating margins of $41 million were up 5%, and
margins improved on lower input costs and disciplined cost management.
For the second quarter, sales are expected to be up modestly on new technology launches. Strong demand for Sorona is
expected to continue in growth in detergents and food enzymes, partially offset by continued softness in ethanol. We
expect demand for enzymes for ethanol to remain soft into the second half of the year until producer margins improve.
Our operating earnings are expected to be significantly higher from sales growth and continued synergies.
Now let's discuss Performance Chemicals on slide 12. Sales of approximately $1.6 billion were down 17% due to an
11% decline in priced and a 6% volume drop. The decline in price primarily reflects lower TiO2 prices. All of the
volume decline was attributable to chemicals and fluoroproducts, reflecting lower industrial demand and scheduled
plant shutdowns. TiO2 volumes were essentially unchanged year over year but up 8% on a sequential basis. Operating
earnings declined 56% or $320 million, largely in line with our expectations versus last year's peak level.
Turning to the second quarter, operating earnings are expected to be down substantially, similar to the decline in the
first quarter results due to lower year-over-year TiO2 prices. While demand patterns remain dynamic and evolving, we
believe TiO2 demand is stabilizing as the year progresses, with improving industry fundamentals and the absence of
customer destocking. While there is uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery, we continue to believe that
the market will bottom around the middle of this year. Published reports indicate a gradual but steady decline in
producer inventory levels. Coupled with stable to improving demand outlook, it provides us renewed confidence that
the sequential margin contraction experienced in the past three quarters is abating.
Turning to Performance Materials on slide 13, sales of $1.6 billion were down 3%, with 1% higher volumes offset by
3% lower prices. Sales of ethylene copolymers grew 10%, with strength in non-food packaging and consumer
applications providing top line growth for the Packaging & Industrial Polymers business unit. Volumes in Performance
Polymers declined 4% due to weakness in automotive sales in Europe and Japan, partially offset by strong sales in
China and ASEAN due to continued penetration at key OEMs.

Operating earnings of $292 million increased 5%, primarily due to lower feedstock costs. Higher sales volumes in
packaging markets were partially offset by weak demand in Europe and Japan automotive markets. For the second
quarter, sales and operating earnings are forecasted to be essentially flat, with auto builds down in Europe and Japan
offset by gains in North America and China.
On slide 14, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segments. Sales were down 4% on lower volume and price, primarily
reflecting lower spending in the U.S. public sector as well as continued uncertainty in industrial markets. Operating
earnings decreased $21 million, primarily due to weaker sales mix and lower plant utilization, partially offset by
productivity gains.
For the second quarter, we expect sales and operating earnings to decline modestly year over year, reflecting market
conditions similar to the first quarter. However, operating earnings and margins are expected to improve sequentially
from the first quarter through the rest of the year due to our productivity actions, the U.S. housing market rebound, and
improving demand in industrial and public sector markets.
This concludes the segment update, so I'll turn the call back to Ellen now.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great, thank you, Carl. Let me close by providing you with some insights about what underpins our outlook.
Starting with the second quarter, as Jim mentioned, we did see about $0.02 per share timing benefit in the first quarter
from an accelerated pace of corn seed deliveries in North America. This will impact our second quarter. On the top
line, we expect second quarter market conditions to be similar to what we saw the first quarter, solid fundamentals in
Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences, as well as continued demand uncertainty from industrial
markets. On our bottom line, we expect strong growth again in our Agriculture segment and tough comparisons to
prior-year peak levels in Performance Chemicals. Consistent with what we discussed in January, we expect first half
operating earnings per share will be about 7% to 9% lower than last year.
Turning to the full year, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $3.85 a share to $4.05 a share, which is 2% to 7%
growth from last year. Growth fundamentals in Agriculture markets remain solid, and we expect our product lines to
perform very well. As a result, we anticipate low teens growth in sales for the full year from our Agriculture segment.
We expect the food and beverage industry to continue to generate stable global demand for our Nutrition & Health and
Industrial Biosciences products and anticipate increasing our market penetration in these markets, led by superior value
propositions of our product offerings.
For TiO2, as I mentioned, we anticipate supply and demand in the global market to stabilize around midyear, from that
point resume a growth trajectory, which has been tracked historically to GDP growth. We also anticipate improvements
in demand in the second half from industrial markets. This is based on our evaluations of country and regional forecasts
for general industrial production, auto production, homebuilding and construction, solar module production, and other
markets. Data for these markets show negative or no growth in the first quarter, but are forecasted to grow several
percentage points for the year. Examples include global auto builds, industrial production, and photovoltaic module
production. This means we will see sequential improvement in demand as the year progresses, which we're ready for
and will positively impact many of our businesses like Protection Technologies, Performance Polymers, and Chemicals
& Fluoroproducts.
You'll continue to see cost savings from restructuring program and ongoing productivity initiatives, which help offset
inflation and fund growth initiatives. And we're committed to these programs and believe they are returning real value
to our shareholders. And we'll remain steadfast on our current track of deploying our science to bring a consistent,
steady flow of new products to global markets that solve real market needs. They also strengthen our market position
and improve customer satisfaction, all at higher value for customers and shareholders.

So in closing, our first quarter results were as expected and communicated to you three months ago. In addition, we
reaffirmed our full-year outlook, repurchased $1 billion of stock, reduced DuPont's net debt $4.5 billion, and raised our
dividend, actions that reflect our priorities and confidence in our ability to execute our business plan.
It always comes down to staying close to the customers, understanding their underlying demand signals and disciplined
execution. Our indicators are signaling gradual improvements in demand as we progress through the year, so we must
remain agile and quick to respond as customer demand improves, which is exactly what we will do.
So, Carl, back to you.
Carl J. Lukach
Okay, John, we're ready to go to the calls and take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Good morning. In terms of outlook, Ellen, I just wanted to clarify that the first half I think
was previously down 3% to 7% and is expected to be down 7% to 9%. Is that consistent with the message that you're
trying to get across versus previous, or is it an artifact of the change in pension accounting?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so I never gave a number range in our January call. We said it would be down. I
don't remember the word we used...
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: I think it was modestly.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Right, so we're getting more specific based on the impact of the volatility of
Performance Chemicals and some other factors like the higher commodity prices. And we thought it would be helpful
to you to get more specific at this point in time about the first half of the year.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying that...
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: It is consistent with what we were seeing or thinking starting in January.
<Q - Mike Ritzenthaler>: Got it, okay, then maybe a more detailed question for Jim. Monsanto has been on a
partnering licensing frenzy lately including, of course, with DuPont. It appears that they will have the optionality
through one or more of these agreements for all the major next-gen herbicides, Liberty, Enlist, dicamba, and so forth in
corn, soybeans, and other major row crops. Can you walk us through DuPont's rationale on this subject and how
important Enlist and dicamba is for corn over the next couple of years? And do soybeans need a dicamba trait as well?
<A - James C. Borel>: Sure. First of all, as you know, what matters to a farmer is a product that really performs and
has the flexibility and yield performance that they're looking for. And so the agreement with Monsanto is a nice
addition. It gives us additional product options and additional modes of weed control to be able to offer. And we expect
that that plus the stacking flexibility will help enable us to make even better performing products that will give more
value to customers over time. So I think overall, we feel really good about the opportunities that it allows us to pursue.

<Q - Brian Maguire>: Hi, good morning. It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today; a question about the balance
sheet. It looks following the divestiture of the Coatings business it significantly strengthened. And with about $6.5
billion dollars of cash, it seems like you have a lot to deploy. I was just hoping for an update on how the acquisition
pipeline is looking and what kind of acquisitions you'd be looking to pursue in this environment.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, thank you, Brian. We've been really consistent about how we talk about
acquisitions. There are things that have to advance either our science or market penetration in key markets where we
see our science is going to make a difference. I think you've seen that, whether it's in large ones like Danisco or
whether it's in small ones like PINAR, which gives us the opportunity to extend well into sub-Saharan Africa with our
Agriculture segment; or things like Innovalight, which gives us the silicon ink that really enhances the efficiency from
a PV standpoint. So we continue to have strong activity in the company looking at various areas, Nutrition & Health,
Agriculture, Industrial Biosciences, Advanced Materials, where we think that either science and/or market penetration
can help.
And let me just be clear about what I'm looking for. I'm looking to create trajectory or momentum. I'm looking to create
the greater opportunity for our company by doing this, not just creating bulk but really creating momentum. And so we
do see acquisition as being an important part of our growth plan going forward and continue to focus on those areas.
<Q - Brian Maguire>: Great, one follow-up, if I might, just on the TiO2 business. It looks like your volume was up
sequentially 1% there, a little bit better than you were guiding for last quarter to be flat. Do you think that you're taking
some market share in there, or is that just more reflective of the overall market improving that much?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Hi, Brian. This is Nick. I think when you look at what's going on in the TiO2, it's
really playing out very much like we had anticipated. The destocking from our customer inventory levels, that's at a
normal basis now, so that is done. I think there is still some inventory levels from the producer side based on published
data that's out there that suggests that that still has some work to be done, but it's moving in the right direction. And it's
in line with the statement when we say that we believe things will hit that stable normal level by the end of the first half
of this year.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thank you and good morning. Ellen, if I could just ask you, you made a couple comments
about the outlook, and I thought I'd try to tie two of them together. One was about the second half improving
fundamentally in general, and the second piece was you said it was all about talking to your customers. And so I just
wanted to see. Is it the conversations you're having with your customers that are giving you the confidence in a better
looking second half outlook – and leave aside Agriculture – relative to some of the not so great macroeconomic
indicators we're seeing or some of the commentary we're seeing out of other industrial materials companies?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so let me talk about the macro and then we'll go down to the customer level. So if
you think about industrial production only being up 1% in the first quarter versus what economists are continuing to
focus on, which says it's 2% to 2.5% for the year, if you think about automotive globally being down 1% in the first
quarter, being up maybe 1% in the second quarter, it's going to be actually up 4% in the second half of the year to meet
the builds, and so there are the macro indicators there.
Now if you go down and you talk to automotive, if you talk to people down our value chain, they feel that there is just
– I wouldn't call it a great change but a building of a little more confidence. And so I think that's what we're seeing.
China infrastructure for example, they've come out and their government has come out and said they're going to install
10 gigawatts of solar modules as part of their infrastructure this year. Now we didn't see any of that in the first quarter.
But we see activity, and hopefully that will lead to that and that will be good for our Electronics business. And so we
do see it coming from different ways.

Now again, it's a wait-and-see basis, and I'm a very practical person; I'd like to see it more tangibly. But all our
forward-looking indicators in that area are showing signs of sequential slow improvement, which at the end of the day,
that's why the [ph] work (39:00) values are cautiously optimistic.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And, Jim, if I could just ask you quickly; a question I get a
lot now is if the USDA is right and corn goes to $4.80 per bushel next year, could you speak a little just holistically
about how you think that would impact the germplasm pricing opportunity for next year?
<A - James C. Borel>: Sure. First of all, even at that price, farmers are still incented to maximize yield. In fact, you
could say that yield becomes even more important at a lower price. Technology adoption is still going to continue, and
that's a big piece of what drives price. And we should see in that scenario a benefit on COGS. As long as we stay in a
range that's profitable for farmers, even the lower price is not necessarily bad. There is still incentive to maximize
productivity, and that's what we help farmers do.

Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you. Nick, you used to provide a consolidated delta between EPS impact of price versus
variable cost, so I was just wondering what that was for the overall company. And more specifically, I'm just
wondering. You haven't really commented on the cost situation in TiO2. So what headwinds do you face this year on
margins due to higher ore costs and lower capacity utilization?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yes, thanks. We've looked at changing our reporting system, simplifying the reporting
system, so we're no longer tracking inventory streams all the way through the chain to the consolidated level.
Obviously, though, we continue to analyze this in depth at the plants, where it's most impactful with the data.
You talk about TiO2 and raw material costs there. Our ore costs are higher due to some of the legacy contracts
expiring. But we're still very much in an advantaged position when you look at us versus our overall competitive base,
largely driven by our technology and our ability, as we've said many times, to consume the lower-grade ores as well as
high-grade ores to make high-grade TiO2.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: As a follow-up, how much are you anticipating your TiO2 costs to be up this year?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Ore isn't going to be the major driver in the COGS. If you look at the total company,
you're probably looking about the 3% to 4% range on raws.

Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: David, how are you today?
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Good, thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Good. I heard you published a report yesterday. But anyway, I get asked this question
a lot. And as you know, we continually evaluate all our business since we expect them to drive innovation and science
into the marketplace to differentiate themselves from the competition. And as you saw in the last couple years, if we
find a business that's not measuring up, we take those decisions very seriously.
So I'll talk about TiO2. We have advantaged process technology. It gives us a sustainable competitive advantage no
matter where we are in the cycle. Therefore, we earn superior cash returns on our invested capital through the entire
cycle, and we're well above our cost of capital even at the trough. So it generates strong cash flow, so we can use that

little planting has actually been done. But as I mentioned, our order book is already ahead of last year. We feel good
with our position, but we need to get through the season to be able to firm up what actually will happen with share.

Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi, good morning. The other income in the quarter was $92 million versus $14 million in
the year-ago, or I think about a $0.06 benefit. What was that and how does that affect the segment income? That is,
how does other income get reflected through the segments?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So I know that farmer was down $23 million quarter over quarter.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: And we had some one-time things last quarter that weren't there this year in the way
of sales that showed up in other income, Jeff.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So let me get back to you because I don't have the specifics right to you, so we'll come
back on that.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay, great. Secondly, Safety & Protection has been not as strong as it might be. If what
you do is you adjust high velocity offshore operations in Safety & Protection and just look at the North American
performance, how did North American sales grow in the first quarter, and how did North American operating income
fare?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so we can talk about sales but not operating income because the fact of the matter
is our plants, most of them are located in the United States and we do a tremendous amount of exporting out of the
United States into other areas of the world.
In Safety & Protection in North America, we're seeing progression based not only on a continuation of our focus on
commercial construction but the startup of some higher opportunities in housing starts and builds, both in the Corian
and in the Tyvek product lines. We're seeing softness in the first responder and the military area in the United States.
We've "won" tenders, but they haven't released the orders yet. And how sequestration affects that, we don't think so,
and we do expect that to pick up as the years go on.
So in addition to that, we have the productivity efforts that are starting to come through, and you'll see margin
expansion in that area. So we have some positives from the standpoint of construction. We have some negatives like
first responder, that area. Net-net, sales in the quarter were probably flat up very modestly.

Our next question is from John McNulty from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John McNulty>: Yes, good morning, just a quick question. On the Ag business, you indicated there was a little

there maybe a little bit of a tailwind excluding that going into that because of the European weather?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yes, that's a net. North America is by far the larger impact. In Europe, what we're
seeing is it's cold and wet. So as it relates to seed, some of the plantings are delayed a little bit. In terms to crop
protection, some of the winter crops, some of the early sprays that would have been going on late in the first quarter
haven't gone on. We'll see how the second quarter and how the season develops as we go into the second quarter. But
North America was by far the larger impact.
<Q - John McNulty>: Okay, great, and just a quick follow-up on the Nutrition & Health business. You had indicated
that guar was a headwind for you in your Enablers business. I think if we're right on this, guar spiked up a lot last year,
and we should be largely through that, so I guess I'm wondering. How much inventory do you have left of that, and
how much longer do we see a headwind before that becomes what should be a pretty significant tailwind?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yes, we're expecting to be through that during the second quarter, as I mentioned.
And so as the second half progresses, that should largely be behind us.

Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning, a couple of quick questions on Ag. First for Jim, you indicated
AQUAmax targeted acreage up to 7 million now I think from 5 million previously. Could you comment on this source
of that upside, whether that puts you in a sold-out position for the year, and how high you think that acreage can go at
maturity for the product?
<A - James C. Borel>: First of all, as I mentioned, we're seeing great demand based on the performance last year. And
so we have good supplies. Demand is strong. We have good supplies to be able to fill that, and we'll see where it ends
up as the season progresses.
In terms of ultimate peak, we haven't sized that, but this generation is really aimed at areas that are particularly water
stressed in the western Corn Belt, and so it's aimed at fairly targeted area. There is some upside as well in Europe that
we're starting to introduce it. And there's some early interest, particularly in France.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: And a clarification, if I may, on your implied guidance for the second quarter of I guess
$1.30 to $1.36. You talked about timing issues 1Q versus 2Q. I'm wondering if the target for the June quarter reflects
any expected timing issues in Ag out of the second quarter and into the third given the cool wet start to the planting
season.
<A - James C. Borel>: No. At this point, we would expect the season to have normalized itself during the second
quarter.

Our next question is from Chris Nocella from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Chris J. Nocella>: Hi, good morning. Regionally, you had strong 4% volume growth in the U.S. How much was
it up excluding Ag? And in Asia, you had flat volumes over a pretty easy comp last year. So can you just walk us
through what you're see there?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So we'll start with Asia first. So in Asia, volumes were flat. It was a tale of two cities.
Developed Asia was down 5% on volume, based on things like automotive builds in Japan and Korea being off
substantially. And we had obviously 5% growth then in developing Asia, with things like strength in India, strength in
China in things like automotive. So Asia was very much a mixed bag. So on average it was zero, but it was a tale of
two cities and developing areas still making great progress; and then developed areas, specifically Japan and Korea,

If you look at North America, I'd say ex-Agriculture, we were pretty flat except for DC&F, where we had a shutdown
that impacted some of our volumes there in one of our businesses. But it was flat to up 1% outside of Ag, and I think
that answers your question.
<Q - Chris J. Nocella>: Thanks. It also seems like you're having some challenges in some other parts of the
Performance Chemicals segment as well. So I'm just wondering what your outlook for those businesses are in addition
to TiO2.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, so from a refrigerant standpoint, we're coming into season, so second quarter is
the season for refrigerants. For polymers, our volumes were off there, and that's an area where there is I think – the
industrial slowdown or uncertainty in industrial markets are impacting the Performance Polymers standpoint. You
know about DTT. We've talked about titanium dioxide. In Industrial Chemicals, we have things like cyanides, which is
making great progress, and things like anilines, which we had some slowness due to our outage. So everything we see
says the second half should pick up as industrial production picks up in this segment.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi, good morning; a question on photovoltaics. You expect sales to be down substantially in
second quarter but expect a second half recovery. Can you just tell us what's going on with the market makers in
China? And how confident are you of this recovery?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So what I would tell you is that in PV, confidence would not be a word I would use
because it's bumpy and it has been bumpy. But we use the best external published data we have. We stay close with the
module manufacturers and people down the value chain and try to use the best information we can get in order to
forecast.
Now the second quarter of last year was a very strong year. There was a lot of overproduction in hindsight in that
second quarter, and that's why the comps this year, we're stating that in the second quarter that that's going to be off
some 15%. The module production will be off 15%. At worst, we're forecasting that PV installs will be flat for the year.
And so with that, it means there has to be some progression coming through the year and that it will improve in the
third quarter and improve again in the fourth quarter. So Dave Miller, who leads that business, has some of the best
data in this area that I've ever seen. And we stay very close to it because it is, as we say, bumpy. But all indicators are
now an improvement through the second half of the year.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Great, thank you. On TiO2 quickly, I think, Nick, you mentioned that inventories are declining.
Can you just quantify that? And when do you see pricing improvement in the industry? Thank you.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: I'm not going to comment on pricing per se. I'll comment on the market dynamics as a
whole. And as I said, when you look at the published data that's out there around inventory levels, it would suggest that
there's probably still maybe around 10 to 15 days of excess inventory at the producer level versus a normalized state.
And I believe that excess can be brought back in line by the end of the first half of the year or the second quarter. There
has already been tremendous progress made in this area of moving producer levels down towards this normalized level
that I spoke of.

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes, it was a little hard. That one came out of left field, but we try.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Terrific. I do have a question, and it actually relates a little bit to the balance sheet being so
strong and the fact you guys went to market and got some cheap debt as well. Obviously, you're looking at M&A. But
what are the thoughts about a more balanced approach with share buyback as part of the mix as well?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yes, Frank, this is Nick. How are you doing?
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Great.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Good. Hey, when you look at the balance sheet, you're right. We did reduce our debt
level. Our net debt went from a year ago March $11 billion, reduced it by $4.5 billion this March, largely driven by the
proceeds from the DPC sale as well as productivity gains that we continue to drive in the company.
Our target here, Frank, is pretty clear. We want to maintain a strong balance sheet, and I define that strong balance
sheet as the AA2 rating. When you take into account, as the credit rating agencies do, the pension, the unfunded
pension portion, and you include that in part of your adjusted net debt calculation, with the changes that we've seen
now in our balance sheet and the strengthening of it with the proceeds, we come to that position where I feel more
comfortable around that AA2 rating. That obviously gives us a strong balance sheet with the flexibility to do things that
we find could be creating additional value, whether that be acquisitions or capital projects, et cetera.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: But...
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: But keep in mind, we just – I'm sorry, Frank. Keep in mind we just did complete the
$1 billion share buyback or will complete it end of this month.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: All right, but not likely to see another program announced anytime in the near future?

I still have $1.7 billion from board authorization that's available to me on that program.

Our next question is from Duffy Fischer from Barclays.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Yes, good morning. I just wondered if you could talk about year-over-year changes. So if you
look at first half versus second half, with your implied guidance, first half this year is down $0.25 of EPS. Second half
is up a little over $0.40, just triangulating those numbers. With Ag being seasonally weak and being your best
year-over-year performer, what are the big buckets of improvement in the second half where you could grow earnings
so much more substantially versus the down earnings in the first half?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: If you remember, Duffy, the second half of last year was quite slow in the industrial
markets. And so those are markets that we'll start there that we believe we will see slow sequential improvement on. So
if you take a look at automotive being flat in the first half of the year, being up 4% and the second half of the year, it's
going to have a positive impact on not only our Safety & Protection business, our Performance Polymers business, and
also our Chemicals and Floor Products business, if you think about U.S. housing.
U.S. housing continues to build if you think about TiO2, reaching that bottom from a cyclical standpoint and starting to
get back to GDP type of growth in the second half of the year. And a lot of these are predicated on what we're seeing.
One of the drivers is industrial production, only 1% growth in industrial production in the first quarter. And our
economists and others that I read are sticking with 2% – 2.5% for the year. So we need to see that modest sequential
improvement in the areas that I discussed plus continued delivery against our plan in Agriculture, in Nutrition &

Health, and in Industrial Biosciences. We have plans there very specifically laid out quarter by quarter on what they
need to accomplish, and we think that that's how those numbers work out to be what you said.
<Q - Duffy Fischer>: Okay. And then we spend a lot of time talking about Ag and TiO2 because they move in big
increments and drive a lot. But if you separate all the rest of the company and look at those five segments the strip out
the commodities, so take TiO2 out of Performance Chemicals, take the ethylene cracker out of Performance Materials,
in the first half, five of the six segments would be down in op earnings looking at it that way without the commodities
excluding Ag. And so when you look across that broad base, there was growth in the world. And that's one of the things
when you talk to investors; to get a multiple, you need to see that growth across a lot of these performance segments
that doesn't seem to be there now. So when you handicap that, what needs to be done to get the rest of the non-Ag,
non-TiO2 DuPont going?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I do think of things like automotive production. It's down 1% globally. So although
we saw great op volume growth in China, we saw negative growth in Japan and Korea. And so going from flat
year-over-year builds to plus 4% in the second half of the year is one of the keys. I think that if you think about the
general industry, you think about all of the areas that are going on out there, whether it's in aircraft production or on the
industrial side motors and transformers, if China does continue with their stated objective around 10 gigawatts of
module installation in their infrastructure and in things like their transportation sector, which impacts us both in Safety
& Protection and Performance Materials, we'll see an uplift in the second half of the year. And I think that's why I'm
cautiously optimistic. We have a lot of external science. We're starting to hear things through our value chains. We
need to see that reflected. It's still early in the year but I'm cautiously optimistic.

Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the call, and I'll turn back over to you, Carl, for an update on the
Investor Day.
