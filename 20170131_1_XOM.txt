MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to this ExxonMobil Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. Today's call is
being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary,
Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year 2016
earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are through the Investors section of our website.
So before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two. Turning now to
slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full-year
earnings of $7.8 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $1.7 billion. Corporation continues to generate cash flow through
the business cycle to meet our commitment to shareholders and support investments across the value chain. In the
fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded dividends and net investments by a healthy margin.
We're realizing the benefit of strengthening prices in the fourth quarter in our Upstream financial results; however,
these results included a $2 billion impairment charge in the U.S. segment, largely related to dry gas operations with

undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountain region. The impairment charge was the result of an asset recoverability
study completed during the quarter and is consistent with the approach we took in 2015.
Continued solid performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments underscores the resilience of our integrated
business throughout the commodity price cycle. Corporation continued to progress strategic investments across the
Upstream, Downstream and Chemical segments during the year, including execution of major projects, value accretive
acquisitions, and pursuit of high potential exploration opportunities.
Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic
growth remained modest during the fourth quarter. In the United States, the pace of economic expansion slowed,
relative to a stronger third quarter while stabilized in China, and remained tepid in Europe and Japan despite some
improvement in the quarter. Crude oil and natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter on anticipation of an
improved supply balance as well as colder weather. Refining margins improved in Europe and Asia while seasonal
margins in the United States weakened. And finally, Chemical margins decreased due to higher feed and energy costs
driven largely by commodity products.
Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or
$0.41 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed dividends of $3.1 billion to our shareholders. CapEx was
$4.8 billion, down 35% from the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting ongoing capital discipline and strong project
execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.5 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7
billion and debt was $42.8 billion.
The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $5.1 billion
to $3.7 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing
asset management program, yielded $9.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. A negative adjustment
for working capital and other items reflects changes in deferred tax balances. Uses of cash included shareholder
distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $3.8 billion. Debt and other financing items
decreased cash by $4 billion, primarily due to a reduction in short-term debt. Cash flow from operations and asset sales
covered dividends and net investments in the quarter by more than $2 billion.
Moving now to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $1.1
billion from a year ago quarter as a result of the impairment charge taken in the U.S. Upstream segment. This was
partly offset by stronger Upstream results and an earnings benefit in the Corporate and Financing segment as a result of
favorable non-U.S. one-time tax items.
On average, we expect that near-term Corporate and Financing expenses will be in the range of $400 million to $600
million per quarter, which does represent a reduction relative to our previous guidance.
Similarly, in the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $970 million.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings
decreased $1.5 billion from a year ago quarter resulting in a loss of $642 million. Higher realizations improved
earnings by $510 million driven by higher liquids prices. Crude realizations increased more than $8 per barrel, whereas
natural gas realizations decreased $0.32 per thousand cubic feet.
Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million, and other items added $70 million driven by lower
operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, fourth quarter
2016 Upstream earnings totaled $1.4 billion, up $528 million from the prior year quarter.
Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production decreased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year to 4.1 million
barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 97,000 barrels per day as new project growth and work program volumes
were more than offset by field decline, entitlement impacts and downtime in Nigeria.
Natural gas production decreased 179 million cubic feet per day as higher demand and project growth were more than
offset by decline, regulatory impacts in the Netherlands, entitlement effects and divestments.

Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased $1.3 billion from the third
quarter of 2016. Improved realizations increased earnings by $450 million. Crude prices were $4 per barrel higher, and
natural gas prices were up $0.41 per thousand cubic feet.
Favorable volume and mix effects contributed $230 million driven by higher seasonal demand, lower downtime and
project growth. Other items increased earnings by $90 million, driven by favorable foreign exchange effects.
Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased more than 8% or 310,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids
production was up 173,000 barrels per day, mainly the result of lower downtime and growth from new projects and
work programs. Natural gas production was 823 million cubic feet per day higher than the previous quarter. Stronger
seasonal demand in Europe and entitlement effects were partly offset by regulatory impacts in the Netherlands and field
decline.
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the
quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $110 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Weaker margins reduced
earnings by $570 million. Favorable volume mix effects, mainly from increased operational efficiency and production
optimization, improved earnings by $200 million.
All other items added $260 million, mostly from asset management activities, partly offset by increased maintenance
costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects.
In the quarter, Imperial Oil completed the sale of its retail network. The sites have been converted to the branded
wholesale distributor model, resulting in earnings benefit of $522 million.
Turning to slide 14. Downstream earnings were flat sequentially. Stronger refining margins outside the United States
and improved volume mix increased earnings by $160 million and $100 million respectively. All other items reduced
earnings by $250 million driven by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange
effects, partially offset by asset management gains.
Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings
were $872 million, down $91 million compared to the prior year quarter. Weaker margins, primarily for specialty
products, decreased earnings by $10 million, while unfavorable volumes and mix effects further reduced earnings by
$30 million. All other items decreased earnings by $50 million largely due to unfavorable inventory and foreign
exchange effects.
Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down almost $300 million sequentially. Weaker margins, driven by higher
feed and energy costs, reduced earnings by $200 million. Higher volumes added $50 million and all other items
decreased earnings $150 million including seasonally higher operating expenses and unfavorable inventory and foreign
exchange effects.
Turning now to the full-year financial results starting on slide 17. As I mentioned, 2016 earnings totaled $7.8 billion
and represents $1.88 per share. Corporation distributed $12.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx totaled
$19.3 billion for the year, a reduction of $11.7 billion versus 2015. Throughout the year, we maintained a relentless
focus on cost, capturing both structural efficiencies and market savings, while maintaining operational integrity. These
efforts resulted in further reduction in total CapEx and OpEx of $16 billion in the year, versus 2015 when excluding the
effect of the Upstream impairment charge. As a result, cash flow from operations and asset sales was $26.4 billion.
Turning to slide 18. Cash balances were flat to year-end 2015 at $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation
expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program resulted in the $26.4
billion of cash flow from operations in asset sales. The negative working capital and other impacts for the year were
driven by lower Upstream payables, deferred tax impacts and cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan. Uses
included shareholder distributions of $12.5 billion and net investments of $16.7 billion. Debt and other financing items
provided $2.8 billion in the year.
Moving to slide 19. This graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year, and highlights
our ability to meet our financial objectives. In a difficult business environment, the corporation continued to generate

strong cash flow from operations and asset sales to support the dividend and most of our net investments in the
business, supplemented by a moderate increase in debt financing. We maintained financial flexibility to continue to
invest through the cycle in attractive opportunities.
As indicated, shareholder distributions totaled $12.5 billion. Annual per-share dividends were up 3.5% compared to
2015, and this marks the 34th consecutive year of per-share dividend growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017,
ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plans and programs.
During the year, ExxonMobil generated $9.7 billion of free cash flow, up $3.2 billion from 2015, reflecting the
resilience of our integrated businesses and our focus on the fundamentals.
Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. We know there
will be a lot of interest in our investment plans, and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our Analyst
Meeting.
Moving now to slide 20 and a review of our full-year segmented results. 2016 earnings fell $8.3 billion, as the impact
of lower realizations in margins on our Upstream and Downstream segments was partially offset by stronger Chemical
results and lower corporate costs associated with several onetime tax items. As a result, the full-year effective tax rate
was 13%. Now assuming current commodity prices and existing portfolio mix, we do anticipate that the effective tax
rate will be between 25% and 35% excluding the impact of any large onetime items. On this basis, our full-year 2016
effective tax rate was within the new guidance range.
Turning now to the full-year comparison of Upstream results starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $196 million
were $6.9 billion lower than 2015. Realizations reduced earnings by $5.3 billion, as crude oil prices decreased over $7
per barrel and natural gas prices declined by $1.40 per 1,000 cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased
earnings by $130 million, driven by new project growth. All other items added $310 million due to lower operating
expenses, partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, 2016 Upstream
earnings totaled $2.2 billion.
Moving slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, down about 1%
compared to last year but within our full-year guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day.
Liquids production increased 20,000 barrels per day, as project and work program growth was partly offset by field
decline and higher unplanned downtime, most notably from third-party impacts in Nigeria and well fires in Canada.
Natural gas production, however, decreased 388 million cubic feet per day. Growth from projects and work programs
was more than offset by field decline, regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and divestments.
The full-year comparison for Downstream results is shown on slide 23. Earnings were $4.2 billion, a decrease of $2.4
billion from 2015. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $3.8 billion. Favorable volumes mix effects increased
earnings by $560 million, and all other items, primarily asset management gains, increased earnings by $920 million.
On slide 24 we show the full-year comparison for Chemical results. 2016 earnings were $4.6 billion, up $197 million
from 2015. Stronger commodity margins, driven by advantage liquids cracking, increased earnings $440 million, while
higher volumes added $100 million. Other items reduced earnings by $340 million, reflecting the absence of asset
management gains.
Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. So we continue to deliver on our investment plans with an
unwavering focus on long-term value. Five major projects started up in 2016, adding 250,000 oil equivalent barrels per
day of working interest production capacity. In the fourth quarter, Kashagan and Gorgon Train 2 started up, and like
other 2016 projects, continued to ramp up to plateau production levels.
Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on another five major projects that will come online over
the next two years. These projects will together contribute another 340,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working
interest production capacity.

Moving now to slide 26. Our focused exploration program continues to enhance our resource portfolio as demonstrated
in the fourth quarter. In Guyana, ExxonMobil submitted a development plan for the initial phase of the Liza field. We
continue to progress broader development planning activities based on a phased development approach. As part of
these activities, contracts were awarded to perform front end engineering and design. We expect to reach the final
investment decision for the project later this year.
Additionally, as I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call, the Liza-3 appraisal well successfully encountered an
additional deeper reservoir which was being evaluated at the time. This reservoir is now estimated to contain 100
million to 150 million oil equivalent barrels beneath the Liza field.
Also, offshore Guyana, the Payara exploration well discovered hydrocarbons, marking the second discovery on the
Stabroek Block. The well encountered more than 95 feet of high quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Two side
tracks have been drilled to rapidly evaluate the discovery and a well test is about to get underway. The data will be
analyzed in the coming months to better understand the full resource potential and development options.
Now, after the Payara well test, the Stena Carron drill ship will next move to the Snook prospect just south of the Liza
discovery. ExxonMobil also made two additional discoveries in the fourth quarter including the Nigeria Owowo-3 oil
discovery announced in the third quarter earnings call and the Muruk discovery in Papua New Guinea. Both Owowo-3
and Muruk are near currently producing fields which will enable capital efficient development.
We also continue to capture new prospective exploration acreage. In Mexico's offshore bid round one ExxonMobil and
Total jointly submitted the current high bid for block two located in the Perdido area near the U.S. border. In Cyprus,
ExxonMobil and our partner Qatar Petroleum have been selected as the winners of offshore block 10 in a recent tender
round and we look forward to negotiating the production sharing contract for this high potential block. ExxonMobil has
also been awarded an offshore prospecting license for exploration activity in the Gulf of Papua in Papua New Guinea.
The initial scope of work on this block is expected to include seismic acquisition.
Turning now to slide 27 and an update on ExxonMobil's U.S. unconventional portfolio. As a leading oil and gas
producer in the United States, we have a strong acreage position and proven operational expertise in unconventional
plays. XTO's daily production is currently more than 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, of which 38% is liquids.
Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits
through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin where we operate two thirds of our production, our average
drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of
ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill Process.
We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since
2010, XTO has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11% and which currently
represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production.
Moving now to slide 28, our most recent acquisition in the Permian further strengthens our unconventional portfolio,
adding high-quality acreage in the Delaware basin and more than doubling our resources in the Permian to greater than
6 billion oil equivalent barrels.
ExxonMobil agreed to acquire privately owned companies whose holdings include 250,000 net acres of leasehold in
the Permian. The acquisition includes an upfront payment of $5.6 billion in ExxonMobil shares plus additional
contingent cash payments totaling up to $1 billion based on development of the resource over a specified timeframe.
The map on the left shows our heritage acreage in yellow, acreage acquired in transactions in 2014 and 2015 in blue,
and the acreage associated with the most recent transactions in red. As you can see, the new leasehold represents a
significant position in the heart of the Delaware basin. Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to
date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth.
As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well-positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition
will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil equivalent barrels in multiple stacked plays, 75% of which is liquids.

The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost
execution capabilities with proprietary technology from our Upstream Research Company. We plan to drill the longest
laterals within the play which will maximize per-well recoveries and help generate market-leading development costs.
More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths two miles or longer because the acreage is not
constrained by traditional land lease issues.
This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drill wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40
per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day in the
Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017 as we begin activity on the newly-acquired
acreage.
Moving now to slide 29, we continue to strengthen our Downstream and Chemical business through selected integrated
investments in our facilities and operations. We recently completed investments in lubricants and chemical facilities in
Louisiana that support our aviation lubricants business, commissioning a new state-of-the-art jet oil manufacturing
facility in October of last year. The new plant will use Group V synthetic base stocks sourced from facilities that started
up last year at our adjacent Baton Rouge chemical plant.
Across the fuels, lubricants and chemical value chains, we continue to high-grade our portfolio and reduce complexity
to efficiently capture market value while reducing operational risk and capital expenditures.
In the quarter, we reached agreements to divest several Downstream affiliates in Africa and South America.
Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, Imperial Oil completed the conversion of its retail business to a branded
wholesaler model. This model benefits from significantly lower capital requirements while continuing to grow retail
sales.
We also continue to enhance our logistics capabilities by focusing on strategic midstream assets. We recently
announced the formation of a joint venture with Sunoco Logistics that will expand access to domestic crude oils by
improving transportation options from the Permian and Ardmore basins to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
In Baytown and Mont Belvieu, Texas, the construction of our new 1.5 million ton per annum ethane steam cracker and
associated metallocene polyethylene facilities is progressing well with phased start-up commencing in the second half
of this year.
Finally, ExxonMobil recently announced a new project at our Beaumont, Texas facility to expand polyethylene
capacity by 650,000 tons per year. This expansion amounts to a 65% increase in polyethylene capacity at the site.
Together, the projects at Beaumont and Mount Bellevue represent multi-billion dollar investments that will increase
ExxonMobil's U.S. polyethylene production by nearly 2 million tons per year or 40% making Texas our largest
polyethylene supply point. The new facilities will process advantaged ethane feed stock to meet growing global
chemical demand.
Moving to the final chart on slide 30, I'd like to conclude today's comments with a brief summary of our 2016
performance, which is really under pinned by our sustained focus on value. ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year
while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million
oil equivalent barrels per day and maintained focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio
of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx
was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015 as we exercised capital discipline in investment selectivity and continued to
pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost
discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion and positive free cash flow of $9.7
billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered the dividend
and net investments in the business.
Our commitment to shareholders remains strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. We are
confident in ExxonMobil's integrated business model and our ability to continue to grow long-term value in any
business environment.

Now we'll discuss our forward plans in more detail at the upcoming Analyst Meeting which will take place at the New
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday March 1. That concludes my prepared remarks on a very busy year. And now I
would be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]
We'll take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: Morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning, Neil.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: Hey Jeff, I appreciate the incremental disclosure here on the Delaware transaction. That's where I
want to start. As you think about that deal, is it indicative of the view that Exxon has that you see more value in, let's
say, the private market than the public market? And can you just talk a bit more about the opportunity you see in U.S.
unconventional to do deals?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Neil, and it's a good question. I would tell you that I would not view it as being
exclusive to one type of transaction. As we have talked in the past, we keep a full view on what may be out there that
could be competitive with our existing resource base and accretive to overall long-term financial performance. These
things don't happen overnight. Several of these take many, many months to go ahead and put in place. And not all of
them transpire into an executed deal. But what's important is that it is a key aspect of our overall asset management
program in order to high-grade our portfolio with the view of our underlying mission of growing shareholder value.
<Q - Neil Mehta>: Appreciate that. And then my follow-up, Jeff, is on CapEx. I imagine we're going get a little bit
more color on this at the Analyst Day in a couple of weeks, but the $22 billion that you outlined is in line with what
you talked about earlier this year but up from 2016. Can you at least speak high level to what's driving the growth in
2017 versus 2016 in terms of CapEx? Is that cost inflation or is that higher growth? And then bigger picture, can you
talk about what you're seeing in terms of cost inflation across your portfolio?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Well, Neil, as you indicated, we do plan on giving a lot more detail around our
investment plans in the analyst presentation that will be just a little bit more than a month from now. As you indicated,
the $22 billion that I mentioned is fairly consistent with our forward-looking plan that we provided a year ago. I would
tell you that it does not reflect a year-on-year increase associated with cost inflation. And in fact, the inverse is true, is
that the organization continues to look for high-impact capital efficiencies to drive the cost down. And it is by and large
a function of activity level.
Certainly as activity continues to build, we will all experience some market pressures, but that doesn't relieve us of our
fundamental objective of maximizing the value proposition. And rest assured that the organization will continue to
keep focused on what new solutions are there for us to get to a lower-cost outcome. And the organization is very
committed to make sure that we're capturing those and really leading the cost curve.

<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Hey, I wanted to start on the working capital and other headwind, $2.4 billion in the quarter, $8
billion for the year. Pretty big number. I guess I was just wondering if you can maybe elaborate or break that down a
little more between deferred taxes and some of the other items and moving forward, how you think about the ability to
lessen that headwind in 2017.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well I mean, obviously, there's really two large components that are driving it; obviously
the changes in the working capital, by and large, adjustments in receivables and payables due to activity and changes in
commodity prices. And then the second part are other balance sheet items, some of that associated with deferred taxes.
As I said, it also includes cash contributions that we made to the pension plan. So a lot of moving parts, pieces is
understandable. And I understand the interest, but that's about all the color I have for you at this point.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Okay. And then in terms of kind of priorities with cash from here, to the extent you have excess
free cash flow above the dividend in 2017, is the first priority, with your trending debt balances where they are, would
it be debt paydown, or do you feel like you have flexibility to do other things?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I think it's a function of the business climate and the opportunities that we have before
ourselves. As you've heard us say before, if you think about our capital allocation approach, it's a commitment to
provide a reliable and growing dividend to our shareholders and at the same time, continue to selectively invest in our
business with opportunities we believe are going to enhance the long-term return of the corporation.
The excess cash, by and large, we don't want to hold large cash balances if we don't have an immediate need for it. We
will think about either paying down debt or buying back shares, and that is done primarily on a quarterly basis. The
corporation will step back and look at a number of factors like our current financial position, our potential opportunities
to put capital to work, as well as what we see in the near-term in terms of the business outlook.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Okay. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Jeff, I wonder if I could kick off with your capital guidance I guess as kind of a follow-up, but
ask you if you could move it on to talk a little about the production capacity that you see that goes along with that
capital because I'm assuming the Permian is part of it. What I'm really driving at is you've got a number of projects still
ramping up, so could you give us some idea as to what the remaining capacity is for those ramp-ups? In other words,
what would the delta be if those projects were running full out in 2017? Then I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Doug, first observation would be is that you're correct that we have projects that
started up all the way back to early 2015 that are still well within their development drilling programs and are ramping
up to plateau production rate. Some of these things could take 12 to 24 months to fully reach the plateau production
rate. I don't have a specific number for you as to what is that incremental capacity that's left to ramp up, but I'll also
highlight that a number of those projects also are exceeding design expectations due to really, really strong
management by the organization around reliability and reservoir performance.
We talked about Papua New Guinea in the past. Design at about 6.9 million tons. It's now produced above 8 million
tons per annum. You've heard in the news about Banyu Urip, which the development base was about 165,000 barrels a
day. We've been producing about 185,000 and it is now under review to take it all the way up to 200,000 barrels a day.
Again, very, very strong operational reliability and very good reservoir performance. So the point I'm making is above
the additional ramp-up that's anticipated from the major project startups, there's also another layer of capacity that we're
building on based on the organization's focus on the operational capabilities of our assets.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Just to be clear, Jeff, on the Permian piece of that, I think at the time of the acquisition
you'd talked about moving to a 15-rig program. What's the starting point for that? What are you running right now?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So you're talking about the recent acquisition, I believe.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. So let me back up and first say that if you look at the overall development of the
new acreage, we see that over the long-term, it would support a multi-decade production plateau of about 350,000 oil
equivalent barrels per day, so a very substantial addition to liquids production as well. And in fact, if I can put it in
scale for you, if you remember in my prepared comments I said that our current liquids production from XTO
represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. If you were just to add on the expectation from the
Delaware acreage, that would take us up somewhere between 20% to 25% of our global liquids production. So the
point being is it's a very material part of the portfolio. As I indicated, we've got 10 rigs running right now. We are
planning on ramping up that activity over the near future, but we're going to do it commensurate with the leasehold
development requirements. We're very positive about this, obviously given the acquisition and we want to get to it right
away.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Jeff, I appreciate that answer. My follow-up is very hopefully a quick one. Payara I think in
Guyana, the limited disclosure you've given so far I guess has raised some questions about potential scale. Is there
anything you can tell us about relative scale or absolute scale of both the Liza and Payara reserve expectations
ultimately, but also a likely development plan beyond the early production system? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Doug. So as we indicated in the third quarter, given the Liza-3 appraisal well, that
really built confidence in a view that we've got at least a billion barrels of recoverable reserve. Since then, we've drilled
the deeper zone that added additional volume as I indicated in the prepared comments. Payara, we're very pleased with
the outcome. We moved very quickly to drill two additional side tracks in order to better define the reservoir. And as I
said, I think the next critical piece of information will be this well test that we're starting right now and that will allow
us to size Payara. Now, obviously as we move along in each operational activity, that data is feeding our real-time
development planning effort to assess the full development scope of the block. And remember, we've got two other
blocks that we'll have to integrate as well. But right now, we're moving forward with the initial phase development. As
we've said previously, it's 100,000 barrel a day FPSO. We do feel like that's a prudent step. Very good, strong returns,
and right now we view that as just the initial phase.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. I'll wait till the Analyst Day. Thanks, Jeff.

are you including the acquisition cost for Bass?

<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So it excludes that share purchase.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Well, it would still be part of costs incurred at the end of the day, but that's fine. Next
one on Payara, is that age correlative with the Upper Liza pay? Or the Lower Liza pay? Or can you not say anything on
that?

<Q - Doug Terreson>: Just for clarification, is it correct that the $2.1 billion in asset sale gains are after tax and
included in the $1.7 billion earnings figure? And either way, could you provide some guidance as to which operating
segments that these gains came from?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. So the proceeds of $2.1 billion are – you're asking about the proceeds that we had
in the press release?
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Correct.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, those are before tax proceeds.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: And then those proceeds are primarily within our Downstream portfolio. I'd say about
over 85% of it, it's in the Downstream.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: And the largest part of that is in the Canada retail sales.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Jeff, can you give guidance on after-tax?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: On the proceeds?
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Yes.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, I don't have any numbers...
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: To share with you on that.
<Q - Doug Terreson>: Okay. And then also, three of your competitors have taken steps to enhance their pay for
performance linkage by changing the metrics that they're using for their business units to ones which tie to intrinsic
value on the stock market, and probably the CEO pay too. And while your stock has outperformed some of these
companies in the equity market over the years, my question is, is how is the company thinking about P4P this year, and
specifically whether there's need for change given its rising profile as a corporate governance issue with investors?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, if you remember – you're talking our executive compensation program?
<Q - Doug Terreson>: I am.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. As you and I have talked in past, remember that a large part of our compensation
program is based on a long-term payment schedule. And it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are
being held to the decisions that we're making over the long-term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year
period, 50% about five years, the remaining 50% after 10 years. Really it's the later of 10 years or retirement so some

of us go even beyond 10 years. But it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our
investors feel because when it does pay out, it's paid out at the current stock price.
Now, I'll tell you that the compensation committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure
that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. For
those that are listening about it, we've got a what we call an executive compensation overview disclosure that we send
out annually that provide a lot of good detail about the structure of the program.

We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: Morning, Jeff. How are you?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: So, late in the quarter you finally got FERC approval for Golden Pass. I guess I'd add that to the
bucket in one of the later slides about kind of de-lengthening your U.S. net gas position maybe. So I was wondering,
I'm sure you've made comments on this before, but how do you think now in the new environment, or how things are
playing out currently, how U.S. LNG competes with some of your other world-scale LNG potential assets around the
world. And how do you think about that sort of moving forward as you want to develop additional U.S. gas assets in
the context of that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, you know it's a good question Sam. If you could, best place to start is really
thinking about it from our overall energy outlook and our supply-demand balances. Over the long-term, we expect that
LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost something like 250% of today's LNG capacity, a large
part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now, like most commodities, you're going have periods in which there's
oversupply and periods where there's insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on
that there are some projects that – or there is a period in which we'll see LNG oversupply.
Now if I step back from that, that's the, if you will, the value proposition. And I step back, we've got a very extensive
portfolio. And I would tell you that brownfield developments, that is incremental investments to existing operations
like Papua New Guinea or even Golden Pass provide us a economic advantage by lowering the cost, by leveraging the
installed investment.
At Golden Pass as you noted, we did get FERC approval. The one key step that we're still waiting for after many years
is final DOE, Department of Energy approval of non-FTA export authorization and we're hoping that that will come
shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you've heard us say previously as it
relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of that capacity on long-term contracts and Golden Pass, within
the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we're pursuing the long-term sales contracts. But they'll
all be evaluated on their own merits.
<Q - Sam Margolin>: Okay. I guess my follow-up then is sort of on the same topic. It might be a similar answer on
sort of an individual project analysis basis. But as you look within your 30-year outlook and a lot of energy demand
globally is driven by gas, and against the backdrop of early this year, the de-booking of some natural gas reserves,
domestically and an imperative to maybe get those rebooked over time, what do you think is more preferable between
uses of that gas for you? Investing and kind of shipping it to these Asian demand centers via LNG or keeping it onshore
and consuming it within your Chemical business?

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: That's a good question. And it really highlights and talks to the issue of optionality. We
are the largest gas producer in the U.S. Where do we see that gas going in the future? Again, stepping back from the
energy outlook we expect gas is going to grow 1.5% per year. That's primarily driven by two things. One, power
generation and the second thing, petrochemicals. As you know we've got a very integrated value chain. The
anticipation is that resource will not only meet domestic growth in power generation, but will also look at the utilization
of that into our value chain in the Chemicals business as well as we – well, we started this discussion around LNG
export. So optionality gives us tremendous amount of flexibility to make sure that we're maximizing the value
proposition.

We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning.
<Q - Evan Calio>: I have a question. Any outlook on future project returns conventional versus your acquired
Permian? And I ask the question in the context that you make a significant acquisition in one of the tighter energy asset
markets in the world, the Permian. You discuss a relatively healthy plateau, future plateau level of production while
there's distress in asset markets globally in regions in which Exxon operates. So, I don't know, just given the assets and
these laterals, these longer laterals you discussed, can you talk about how you think the future returns compete within
your portfolio or how advantaged they may be?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, from a general perspective Evan, I would tell you that clearly the recent acquisition
predominantly in the Delaware basin is very competitive. It really goes back to the fundamental objective that we're
trying to achieve through acquisitions or through exploration or our investment program. That is to make sure that
we're [indiscernible] (56:00) maintain a focus on value-accretive performance. So we're looking for investments that
are going to continue to maintain our industry-leading return on capital employed. So certainly very attractive. We've
given you a sense for the economics where I think back in the second quarter, we showed you some of the progress
we've made in unit development cost, operating cost. We gave you a sense for the portfolio then, which with the
Bakken and Permian together, we had over 2,000 wells that achieved greater than a 10% return. Money-forward
economics, full-in, fully loaded on a $40 per barrel price. You add this acquisition into this, it takes us up to about
4,500 wells. So a very robust inventory.
The long-term objective, thinking about the short cycle versus long cycle is one, in making sure that the pace
maximizes the learnings that we're integrating and captures the technology application that we want to apply in order to
achieve these outcomes like the length of the laterals. But I'd say that this acquisition and the investments that we plan
under it are going be very competitive to our existing inventory of opportunities.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Can you just mention how much of your expected CapEx, the $22 million CapEx is in shorter
cycle, however you define that whether offshore or onshore? And related, how do you consider the value of capital
flexibility or cycle times in your gating process, either as a plus or a minus for a longer cycle project?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. On the first question I tell you that we are going to provide some more color in
about a month's time at the Analyst Meeting. So if I ask you just to hold that thought, we'll give you a little bit more
perspective at that time. On the second one, the balance, the overall balance of short cycle versus long cycle, obviously
we've got a very large resource inventory with over 90 billion barrels. We're trying to move that resource inventory at
the same time maintaining a robust level of short cycle investments. Now of course that short cycle inventory continues
to grow with all these acquisitions that we've been picking up. So that's done through our annual planning process. We

look at the execution capability of the organization, the service sector and then we look at the fundamental cash
management objectives to make sure that we've got that flexibility.
And a key element of when we share a CapEx objective, we've got – we've built in flexibility to the upside as well as
flexibility to the downside. We know how to flex that program depending on what commodity prices do.

We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Jeff, I know that in the third quarter press release you had talked about the
potential for needing to take some negative revisions to proved reserves in the oil sands. And clearly, at least in the
quarter, you haven't taken any financial impairments to those assets. Can you talk about whether you would still view
those proved reserves as potentially needing to be written down, or whether the price recovery into the end of the year
was sufficient to allow those to remain on the books?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. It's a good question. Again, I want to make sure that everybody's very clear that
there is a separation between proved reserves reporting under the SEC rules and then the whole issue of asset
impairments. And really what you're asking, Jason, is clear, I think clearly the question about proved reserves. In the
third quarter, we indicated because we thought it was prudent at the time given where crude prices were, that we
indicated that we were likely going to take as much as 4.6 billion barrels out of proved and put them in our resource
base. And I'll remind you that I emphasized at that time that even though we make that transfer, there is no change to
our operations or how we manage the business, those assets going forward. We'll be announcing our final year-end
reserves here in the next couple weeks as we typically do.
In short, we do expect to reflect most of this as the pricing impact that we discussed in the third quarter. But I will also
note that we anticipate that there will be some partial offsets to those numbers. So stay tuned. We'll be finalizing that
shortly and be releasing that information here in the next two weeks.
<Q - Jason Gammel>: Appreciate that, Jeff. And then just as a follow-up, the other acquisition that you've announced
this year, I'm afraid I'm a little bit lost on the process for actually completing the InterOil transaction. Can you talk
about what is still outstanding there in order to get that deal done?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, so we're going back through the process following a decision by Canadian courts
and we put in place a new amended agreement between InterOil and ExxonMobil. And I'll just remind everybody that
in the first process through, the InterOil board fully unanimously approved this transaction and shareholders approved
it by over 80%. So we're going back through the process. And right now there is a shareholder vote anticipated in the
middle of February and then, as in the last cycle through this, we will need to go back to the Yukon courts to make a
final ruling on the offer and then hopefully close thereafter.

by the U.S. onshore? Is it additive to your existing activity or should we expect to see the capital diverted away from

areas like the Bakken and Oklahoma and be replaced by activity in the Permian?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, Ryan, we'll certainly provide more color here in a month or so. But, directionally,
it's a fairly sizable acquisition that we're making in the Permian. We feel good about our acreage position in the other
unconventional basins. I showed you a map where we've got a meaningful presence in every one of them. I would, as
an indicative guidance, I would tell you that it's likely going to add additional CapEx to our short cycle investments in
order to move forward on the acreage that we picked up in the acquisition.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on 2016 CapEx which came in quite a bit
lower than guidance early in the year. Any comments on what were the primary drivers? Is that cost deflation, deferral
of activity, change any expected scope in spend?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, thanks for asking the question, Ryan, because I think it does reflect very well on
how the corporation responded, and particularly our people and their focus on recognizing that we're in a down cycle
and we've got a great opportunity to take advantage during that down cycle. I'd say that it really is a function of a
number of things. One is, and it all is underpinned by our very strong focus around capital discipline. But it comes
down to capital efficiency, opportunities that we're able to continue to capture, regardless of where we are in the
commodity price cycle. It includes market capture. We all know that the service sector and the related costs have
dropped materially.
It also, importantly, it has to do with the very strong project execution performance on our operated projects, most of
which coming in on budget and on cost. And then there was an element of how we paced our projects for several
reasons. One, recognizing the business climate wanting to stay within our means. And two, in a low price environment
there's unique value that we're able to capture by going back and recycling through the development planning process
on some of these projects to try to do things like reduce the cost structure, add additional resource to increase resource
density. But it really is a opportunity in the down cycle to go ahead and add incremental value to those future
investment.

<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning Paul.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Jeff, with the changes in Washington, I just wondered what Exxon's stance is. Firstly, I assume
you guys are pro lifting sanctions on Russia. Secondly, I assume that you would be anti the border adjusted tax. And
then finally, can you make any comments about the impact on your operations in Iraq from the recent limitations on
travel there? I wondered if that was going to – I assume that's going to directly impact you. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. I guess a couple comments. We will continue to advocate for, in many of the areas
you talked about, advocate for free market principles. When it comes down to the important discussion that's happening
in Congress and the current administration around the tax code, we believe the tax code should be globally competitive.
It should be predictable, stable, providing investment certainty and not picking winners and losers. So I mean we will
continue to stay principle-based in our view on those matters.
With respect to Russia, we will continue to fully comply with the existing sanctions. And I'm not going speculate when
or if they are fully satisfied and removed in the future. And then on Iraq and more broadly speaking, some of the issues
associated with decisions taken in the U.S., a key aspect, wherever we are around the world including Iraq, is the
security of our people and our contractors. And we have a very dedicated effort within the organization to ensure that

situation very closely.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Understood, Jeff. If I could completely change the subject, the president of Guyana was
commenting earlier in the week that we could see production start-up in 2019 from Liza. Is that reasonable, do you
think? We've also obviously heard from Hess about final investment decision this year. And if we look back to what
you did in Angola as an example of your speed with which you can get these things up and running with the idea of
getting very early cash flow, I wondered if you could handicap the chances that we do see first production much, much
sooner than the – I think you've been talking more 2021.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. No, it's a good question. Listen, I think first and foremost is that we're going to
work with our co-venturers and the government to move this project along in the most efficient and expedient way.
And all stakeholders have a role in deciding how this project moves forward. And we certainly understand the resource
owners' interest and I'll tell you, we are very attuned to it. As I indicated in my prepared comments, we think it is
reasonable that the initial phase will move forward to an FID decision later this year. The guidance that we had been
providing as well as consistent with the regulatory filings is that the initial phase would start up in 2020.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Got it, Jeff. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You're welcome.

We'll take our next question from Asit Sen with CLSA Americas.
<Q - Asit Sen>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Morning, Asit.
<Q - Asit Sen>: So thanks for the color on the short cycle versus long cycle. I just wanted to make sure I got the
Permian numbers right. So the 140,000 barrels a day production now and your comment on the 350,000 barrels a day
of plateau production from the recent Delaware acquisition, what timeframe are we looking at?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, we have yet to share the specifics around the buildup of that. But as I indicated
Asit, we want to get at it quickly. But the 350,000 potential, and that's oil equivalent barrels per day, we believe is a
reasonable investment program that could be maintained over multi decades.
<Q - Asit Sen>: Got you. Okay. And my quick question on the new project start-ups. Barzan, is that a 2017 start-up?
And could you remind us on the working interest that you have there, 7%? That's what I have.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Our working interest is 7%. And you really need to talk to the operator RasGas on
the specifics around the project.
<Q - Asit Sen>: Great. Thanks Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Welcome.

We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Moses Sutton>: Hi. This is Moses Sutton on for Paul. Quick question on the impairment charges. Have you
completed the review of the entire portfolio or are certain assets still under review in 2017?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We've completed the review of the entire portfolio.

We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Hi, Jeff. I also had a question on the impairment. If you look back at your most recent energy
outlook, it looks like you made some quite big changes around the expectation on North American tight oil and gas. Is
it possible to relate those changes back to today's impairment decision? It feels like you expect there's going to be a lot
of growth in associated gas for instance.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, it's a good question, Alastair but I'd tell you – the first point I'd make is the reason
why we do an annual update and energy outlook is really to make sure that we are most informed about the
fundamental building blocks that really underpin that demand projection. The changes that you're asking about is really
a function of a number of factors. It's not just the energy outlook. It's our – we do this in conjunction with our annual
budget and plans process. And it also is a function as part of the energy outlook is looking at the competitiveness of
different resources that underpin that demand outlook. So it's a number of factors that will drive our decisions and
ultimately the choices that we make.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Okay. Thank you. And as a follow-up can I ask – can you explain what non-U.S. tax effects
are on the corporate items? Are these Upstream or Downstream items?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: The non-U.S. tax items really across a number of the business segments. But the largest
in the fourth quarter were primarily in the Upstream business.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Is it possible to give any color what they relate to?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, we don't have any additional information to share.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: You're welcome.

We'll go next to Brendan Warn with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Brendan Warn>: Yes. Thanks Jeff. Just first question just on those five major project start-ups. You flagged
2017 to 2018 in particularly guess with Hebron and Sakhalin that you do operate. Are they still in 2017 recognizing
Hebron most recently said it was on track for end 2017? And I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, that's correct. They're currently on plan to achieve those objectives.
<Q - Brendan Warn>: Okay so they're both in before end 2017?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes.
<Q - Brendan Warn>: And my follow-up refers – and you'll probably defer this to the Capital Markets Day. But if I
refer back to slide 33 from the Capital Markets Day, you'd sort of given guidance of cash flow from operations and
asset sales for 2016 with a range of sort of at $40 a barrel to $80 a barrel. It looks like at $45 average for this year
you've just come in at where the $40 a barrel line should be. I'm trying to reconcile, you had a weaker cash flow
number for 2016, and whether that changes your view for 2017 in terms of cash flow from operations.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Brendan, a good question. And important dialogue that we think is something that
we should be talking to. And we will update that chart you're referring to in the upcoming Analyst Day here within a
month. And be ready to talk more about it with our current views.

We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yes. Good morning. Top of the hour here. Two questions I guess. Firstly, decline
rate. I mean you guys have done very well on the development – on the production side to minimize base decline.
You've got these long duration assets in a number of geographies. Maybe just a quick update as far out as you could go
on expect decline rate on the base business.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yep, so Ed, we assess our long-term decline rate over every year. And in fact it's in our
10-K. And what we've had in terms of a decline rate here in the last recent past, last couple years, has been 3%. And let
me just qualify that 3% as being – that does not include project activity. So if we were to stop our investment
program...
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: That would be high, yeah.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Okay.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And then we haven't really had a conversation around OpEx and margins, maybe
deferred tax maybe to the prior question on cash flow as you go forward. But maybe just a word on how much more
savings you can get on OpEx. The new projects, are they accretive to margins? And then what you expect to happen to
deferred taxes as prices bump up a little here?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Really good question in terms of OpEx and how we're managing that. I would tell
you that we are never satisfied. We clearly understand there's been a lot of progress here over the last two years. But I
can tell you that the organization doesn't believe status quo is sufficient. As I alluded to previously, we'll continue to
look for structural opportunities. We'll continue to be very focused on organizational effectiveness. And importantly,
we'll continue to work with the service sector to come up with lower cost, higher quality opportunities. And sure, if the
activity continues to build, there's going talk be market pressures. But we're going to continue to work against those
market pressures to capture incremental value.
On deferred income taxes in the future, there's really nothing more I can share with you. You can appreciate some of
this has to do with the current low price environment that we've been through here the last couple years.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: And margin should also improve with the new projects coming on presumably.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, that's the objective of the investment program, yes.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Ed.

We'll go next to Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP.
<Q - Theepan Jothilingam>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two actually.
Firstly, could you just talk about – I know you're intending to issue equity for the recent Permian transaction. Is there

any thoughts about buying back to offset that dilution? And my second question just in terms of exploration for 2017. I
know it focuses on Guyana. But could you talk about any other high impact plays for 2017 and the spend associated?
Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. So, Theepan, on the fundamental question of – to me I interpret it as whether we're
going to buy back any stock. And I'll go back to our earlier discussion around it. It's really a quarterly decision that
management makes based on a number of variables that I've already described. And as I said in the prepared comments,
we don't anticipate doing any type of buybacks other than to address anti-dilutive impact associated with the benefits,
programs and plans.
On other exploration focus, we expect for the near term, flat spend out to the next several years. But I've shared a
number of key areas that we're focusing our attention. Cyprus, the high-quality block we got there on block 10 that
we've got to enter into negotiations on the production sharing contract. But we're very encouraged by it. Mexico, the
block one that we picked up, which is right along the U.S. border adjacent to some U.S. acreage that we've got. Again,
very encouraged by it. Putting plans in place.
I indicated that we continue to expand to our exploration acreage position in Papua New Guinea. You think about some
of the big high potential areas for us, Papua New Guinea is a very important to us. Guyana, that area has been very
important to us. And then as we've been talking about off and on today is the unconventional business with a very
strong focus on the liquids potential. So I think it really does make a very strong statement around the value proposition
that we're trying to deliver to our shareholders.
<Q - Theepan Jothilingam>: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. I was just wondering, when you think about potential acquisition
between equity and adding debt, could you just talk about how we should, how the market should think about that?
Should we see if there are opportunities Exxon uses paper rather than debt?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Well, it's going to be case specific. The important message for you to understand is
that we have the flexibility to do either. The final structure of a given transaction is really a function of the dialogue
between the parties with focus of what the seller wants from the transaction. But I wouldn't read any more into it
relating to our capital structure.
<Q - Theepan Jothilingam>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
And our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just two quick ones. You mentioned that almost all
of the increase towards the $22 billion CapEx budget reflects higher activity. Can you be a little more specific on what
service cost inflation you are assuming, particularly in your North American CapEx?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Pavel, as I indicated earlier we're going to provide more color around our
investment plans in about a month's time in the Analyst Meeting. I'd just ask you to hold that until we get to that point.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay. And as far as the InterOil closing process, you're currently doing the rerun of the
shareholder vote. Should the Yukon court block the second attempt as they blocked the first one, is there any other
alternative in your mind to getting shareholder approval?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah. Well, let me not speculate as to how this will progress. Very strong support from
the shareholders of InterOil. This is a process that InterOil is running and we think that we have addressed some of the
comments that were made in the first process. So let's let that go through and then we'll decide how we move forward
from there.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: All right. Appreciate it.
