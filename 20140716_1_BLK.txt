MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on
mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew J. Mallow
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind all of you that
during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. And of course, we call your
attention to the fact that the BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements.
As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of
BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. And as we usually warn you, BlackRock assumes no duty and
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
So with that, let the call begin. Gary?

Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2014.
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results.
As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.
At our Investor Day last month, I reaffirmed the growth framework, predicated on driving organic growth, using scale
to create operating leverage and a consistent capital management strategy. BlackRock executed on each of these drives
during the second quarter, resulting in continued earnings growth.
We generated second quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Operating
income was $1.1 billion, 15% higher than a year ago. Nonoperating results reflected a $37 million increase in the
market value of our seed and co-investments. Recall that nonoperating income in the second quarter of 2013 reflected a
$39 million pre-tax gain relating to PennyMac's IPO and that results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by the
monetization of a non-strategic, opportunistic private equity investment.
Our 24.8% as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter benefited from several favorable non-recurring items and an
improved geographic mix of earnings. As a result of increased growth in our international businesses, we now estimate
that 29% is a reasonable tax rate for the second half of 2014. And based on what we know today, 30% represents a
reasonable projected tax rate for 2015.
Our second quarter results were driven by $38 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic
growth rate of almost 4%. Flows were driven by our Retail and iShares client businesses. As we discussed at Investor
Day, faster growth in these businesses will drive favorable change in our revenue mix. And we once again saw organic
base fee growth meaningfully outpacing organic asset growth during the quarter.
Second quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up $296 million or 12% from a year ago, and was driven by continued growth
in base fees, performance fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base
fee growth across all long-dated asset classes.
Base fees increased $257 million or 12% from a year ago, as average AUM increased due to organic growth, market
appreciation and the acquisitions of the Credit Suisse ETF and MGPA real estate businesses. Base fees were up 6%
compared to the first quarter, aided in part by the seasonal increase in securities lending activity we typically see in the
second quarter.
Performance fees for the quarter increased $26 million or 29% from a year ago, driven by stronger performance in our
broad suite of single=strategy hedge funds as well as certain long-only equity strategies. Recall that first quarter
performance fees included a significant fee associated with the planned final liquidation of an opportunistic 2007
vintage closed-end mortgage fund.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $146 million was up 6% year-over-year but down 5% compared to the first quarter.
Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 11% year-over-year. Flat sequential
quarter results for Aladdin were once again impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenue, as we continue
to onboard a number of large clients onto the Aladdin platform. We anticipate that several of these large clients will go
live in the coming months, generating revenue uplift as we move past the implementation phase.
Our Financial Markets Advisory business continues to transition from a crisis management orientation to a more
institutionalized advisory business model, with continued momentum in bank regulatory related assignments, including
ECB, AQR and Fed CCAR Diagnostics.
As we mentioned last quarter, FMA results have recently reflected higher levels of revenue associated with asset
disposition assignments. While the second quarter of 2014 was also positively impacted by residual distribution
activity, the revenue impact was at a lower level than recent quarters.
Other income increased $17 million sequentially as a result of higher transition management service fees, earnings
from certain strategic investments and real estate-related disposition fees.

Expense for the second quarter rose $145 million year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue-related items, including
compensation and direct fund expense and an increase in general and administration expense. While compensation as a
percentage of revenue declined year-over-year as a function of aggregate levels and mix of performance fees and
timing of certain accruals, quarterly comparisons are less relevant. And our overall compensation policies have not
changed.
G&A expense increased $36 million year-over-year or 11%, driven primarily by increased occupancy and
office-related costs and other expense, including elevated legal and regulatory expense. Aggregate G&A expense in the
first half of the year benefited from a delay related to the timing of our total marketing and promotional spend, the
balance of which is expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2014.
Sequentially, G&A expense increased $64 million from the first quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of marketing
and promotional spend, increased occupancy expense, reflecting the dilapidation reversal in the prior quarter and the
previously mentioned increased level of legal and regulatory expense.
Overall, total expense increased 10% from a year ago compared to a 12% increase in revenue over the same period,
resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.4%, 110 basis points higher than last year's second quarter.
We remain committed to a consistent and systematic capital management policy. During the second quarter, we
repurchased an additional $250 million of stock, consistent with repurchase levels during the last few quarters and view
that as a good planning rate over the balance of the year.
Through both transformational acquisitions and targeted organic growth, we've built the industry's broadest asset
management platform. Our diversification, whether in terms of clients, products or geographies, is a critical component
of our strategy and enables us to deliver more consistent growth and more stable financial results over time.
Another element of our strategy is the growth opportunity in Global Retail. We saw long-term net flows of $13.1
billion during the second quarter, driving 10% annualized organic growth with positive flows across products and
regions. Results were driven by our outcome-oriented offerings, including multi-asset, alternatives and unconstrained
fixed income and efficient beta.
International Retail, once again, demonstrated stronger results, generating long-term net inflows of $8.9 billion in the
quarter. Equity flows of $2.9 billion were led by net inflows into index funds, which have witnessed accelerated
activity, as the post-RDR European distribution model evolves and demand for efficiently packaged retail investment
vehicles increases.
Multi-asset net inflows of $1.4 billion reflect a continued demand for our Global Allocation Fund, a key component of
our packaged outcomes offering. Fixed income net inflows of $4.7 billion were driven by flows into short duration,
unconstrained and high-yield bond products as well as index funds.
Within international fixed income, we saw $1.4 billion of flows into our BGF Euro Short Duration Bond Fund and
nearly $850 million into our Fixed Income Global Opportunities Fund, or FIGO, which is the cross-border version of
Strategic Income Opportunities or SIO, our flagship domestic unconstrained fixed-income fund.
U.S. Retail's quarterly long-term net inflows of $4.2 billion were led by our duration managed fixed income suite and
packaged outcomes, including our multi-asset income and Global Long/Short Credit funds. Unconstrained fixed
income continues to be led by SIO, where we're seeing strong interest from both Retail and Institutional clients. We
also saw growing momentum in our Unconstrained Strategic Municipal Opportunities Fund or SMO, which raised over
$500 million.
Global iShares generated $30.4 billion of net new business in the quarter, representing annualized organic growth of
13%, driven by strong equity flows. Organic growth for iShares over the last 12 months has returned to low double
digits, consistent with our longer-term targets. Equity flows of $20.6 billion were driven by a rebound in emerging
markets and demand for developed market exposures. In emerging markets, EEM generated over $6 billion of quarterly
net flows. And in developed markets, we saw continued demand across a variety of exposures and geographies.

Fixed income net flows of $9.5 billion represented the leading share of fixed income ETF flows during the second
quarter, paced by flows into longer-duration U.S. Treasuries, Investment-Grade Corporates, emerging markets debt and
high yield. The buy-and-hold segment remains a key part of the growth story for iShares. During the quarter, we
generated $5.5 billion of flows into the U.S. Core Series, while also extending its reach and launching a European
version of the Core.
Our Institutional business experienced $5.5 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, as net inflows into institutional
active mandates were more than offset by net outflows in index equities. Institutional active net inflows of $1 billion
included $5.3 billion of net inflows into multi-asset class products, driven by continued demand for our LifePath
target-date suite and fiduciary events. Strength in fundamental fixed income drove net inflows of $900 million, with
demand across unconstrained strategies, regional credit mandates and CLOs.
Institutional active equity outflows included fundamental and scientific outflows of $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion
respectively. We continue to experience outflows in fundamental equity products that are performance challenged,
though SAE outflows were primarily driven by partial redemptions from clients harvesting gains in appreciated
portfolios.
In core institutional alternatives, net inflows into alternatives, hedge fund and private equity solutions mandates were
offset by outflows in certain single-strategy hedge funds and capital successfully returned to investors.
Nonetheless, strong momentum continues in alternatives, with an additional $1 billion of commitments raised in the
second quarter. Since the beginning of 2013, we have raised $8.5 billion of commitments across alternatives, $6.7
billion of which has yet to be deployed. Future net new business will be generated as these commitments are invested.
Institutional index equities experienced net outflows of $7.9 billion, driven primarily by portfolio rebalancing. In the
face of strong equity markets and improved funding ratios, pension clients continue to rebalance their portfolios. And
as interest rates rise, we expect to see additional immunization activity if equity markets remain at or near current
levels.
This quarter once again demonstrated the breadth and depth of our business model. BlackRock's diversification
continues to enable us to deliver consistent results; one element of S&P's decision to upgrade Blackrock's credit rating
to AA minus, making us one of the most highly rated firms in the global financial services industry.
At Investor Day, we elaborated on the strategy to achieve our growth targets. We remain confident that we have the
right strategy tools and talent to execute.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence D. Fink
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Thanks, Gary. The second quarter marked a sixth straight
quarterly rise for the S&P 500 and rising markets, equity markets across the globe. This was driven by growing
confidence in the United States and in Europe and in pockets of outperformance in the emerging economies.
The 10-year Treasury is back to near 2.5%. The Fed continues to ease their bond-buying efforts. And even in light of
some of the recent volatility, the VIX is hovering near pre-crisis lows.
Markets have been complacent in the face of this risk, with down days quickly followed by elevated buying trends.
Credit standards are loosening, cap rates are falling and correlations remain very high, following the spring shake-up in
the global momentum trade. However, the positive environment and the market gains we've seen in the past several
years have been driven primarily by accommodative policy decisions and coordinated central bank actions.
More of the same won't be enough to move market forward from here. Corporate results and earnings growth will be
needed to become larger drivers of valuation. That's where our attention has been. And in the past couple of days, we've

seen second quarter kick-offs with some bellwether names posting very strong results.
Investors are also going to have to focus more on economic growth to justify driving asset prices higher. For that to
happen, governments across the globe must take meaningful action beyond monetary policy. The United States needs
to address issues like immigration and infrastructure. And leaders like Prime Minister Abe in Japan and Prime Minster
Renzi in Italy must advance their reform agendas to produce tangible economic results. Around the world,
infrastructure is a key area where governments and private capital providers can partner to drive long-term economic
growth and job creation.
At BlackRock, we remain highly focused on building a deep understanding of markets and evaluating risk from all
angles. I believe that the accommodative policy we've seen over the past five years will ultimately lead to increased
volatility, as policy decisions diverge and investors become more focused on the performance of individual countries,
individual industries and obviously individual companies. It is our responsibility as a fiduciary to help our clients to
prepare for this type of shift by building durable portfolios designed to perform over the long term.
We do this by providing our clients with a set of capabilities and a client experience that we don't believe anyone else
in the industry can replicate. We talked at our recent Investor Day about the key differentiators that set BlackRock
apart, and that will enable us to drive long-term results for our clients and, importantly, for our shareholders.
It starts with our people. Talent and culture are critical to our success, and I'm pleased to say that the management
changes we announced earlier this year have gone into effect as of June 1. Our team is working together in this new
structure to execute against our key strategies to meet the needs of our clients.
I strongly believe that we have at this time the deepest, most talented team in the asset management industry, and the
strength of our next generation of leaders will drive BlackRock's future success. BlackRock is the world's most global
asset manager.
We manage money for clients in more than 100 countries around the world through the combination of our
on-the-ground presence in more than 30 countries and our ability to provide clients with the industry's broadest set of
global and local investment solutions.
That global investment and distribution infrastructure positions BlackRock to capitalize on the future growth and
development of the world's capital markets that will be necessary to support global economic growth.
BlackRock's global platform generated $131 billion of long-term net flows over the last 12 months, representing an
organic growth rate of approximately 4%. These results were driven by our diverse investment platform, another key
element that sets BlackRock apart from our competitors.
We have expertise across asset classes, and we could deliver that expertise across a variety of investment vehicles. We
have active, and index and on a single platform, which helps us position the firm to meet a holistic approach and needs
of our clients.
The second quarter showcases BlackRock's product breath. With 12 funds across Retail and iShares generating more
than $1 billion in flows, tying a record number of $1 billion-plus funds that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2013. These
funds are spread across developed and emerging markets, domestic and international clients, equities, fixed income and
multi-asset class, active and index and short and long duration exposures. Together, demonstrating BlackRock's ability
to meet clients' needs across the investment platform, and spectrum.
As I mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of our platform, our deep client relationships and our global
footprint all positions BlackRock to deliver consistent financial results for our shareholders. And that consistency
enables our management team to look forward at the key trends impacting our business and invest aggressively where
we see opportunities.
One of those key growth areas is outcome-oriented investing. The investment landscape is shifting. Investors are
looking for outcomes that their investment goals rather than benchmark specific performance. This outcome-oriented
style of investing requires a combination of a diverse set of investment capabilities and a deep focus on client service.

Most asset managers specialize in one thing, and so they look at every client problem through the lens of that one
specialty, whether it may be active investments or index investments or fixed income or equities. Blackrock's diverse
platform allows us to instead to focus holistically on our clients' needs and draw upon and across the entire firm to meet
our clients' needs.
The investments we made to build the combination of active and index across asset classes and regions and our
technology and risk management capabilities differentiate Blackrock in the outcomes and solution space. And
Blackrock's offerings of package outcomes continue to drive growth in the second quarter, particularly in our Retail
businesses.
Our five-star Multi-Asset Income Fund, MAI, led by Michael Fredericks, is one of our flagship package outcomes, an
example of a fund that targets a critical challenge for our clients, generating reasonable income in a low-yield
environment by tactically balancing income across equity's fixed income and non-traditional sources of income. MAI
has raised over $1 billion in the quarter and crossed the $7 billion mark in total assets. This fund has doubled in size
organically over the last 12 months.
Similarly, in the unconstrained fixed income area, SIO has raised $3 billion inflows in the quarter, stands at over $16
billion in AUM and is the second most active mutual fund in the U.S. in terms of year-to-date net new flows.
The interest in outcome-oriented investing is especially strong among our institutional clients. They are increasingly
looking for investment partners that provide analytical inside insight, thought leadership and breadth and depth of
investment capabilities, all which play strongly to BlackRock's strengths.
At BlackRock, we take a consultant approach with our institutional clients, focused on understand their specific needs
and leveraging Aladdin's capabilities to deliver investment solutions, a capability that is differentiated from other asset
managers.
Our relentless approach to risk management and technology positions BlackRock to offer a complete advice to our
clients to help them not only achieve their return targets but to do so with a comprehensive understanding of their
individualized risk and making sure they understand the risks that they're taking.
The combination of Aladdin, our global platform and our investment expertise across broad ranges and strategies
positions BlackRock to deliver highly customized solutions to all our institutional clients worldwide. For example, in
the first half of 2014, we closed more than $1.6 billion in custom alternative commitments. And we saw strong flows in
our fiduciary business, especially in EMEA and demand for our LifePath target-date suite in the United States.
Our iShares business is also positioned to provide outcomes and solutions to a wide range of clients with differing
investment preferences and differing objectives. iShares continues to be a major growth driver for the firm, delivering
$77.5 billion of net flows in the last 12 months and $30.4 billion of net flows in the second quarter across a variety of
products and client segments.
As Mark Wiedman discussed at Investor Day, there are three ways our clients are looking at ETFs and iShares
specifically. One is core investments or building blocks to construct the basis of buy-and-hold portfolios. Two,
precision exposures, to express a specific, a targeted investment viewpoint. And three, as a financial instrument to
efficiently add data exposure to a variety of equity and/or fixed-income markets, in some case, replacing futures with
ETFs and iShares.
Each of these key product segments globally contributes to iShares' growth in the quarter, delivering the number-one
ETF flow market share position for both the quarter and now year-to-date. Regardless of our strengths for growth, we
cannot be successful unless we produce superior investment performance.
Nothing is more important than delivering performance for our clients. After the financial crisis, we restructured much
of our active fixed income business. Our focus execution has paid off, and we have strong performance across fixed
income, with 90% of our active taxable and 70% of our active tax-exempt fixed income AUM is above our benchmark
– our peer medium for a three-year period of time.

As of the end of June, we've seen a strong performance in our fixed income Total Return Fund, which is in the top
decile for the one-year, for the three-year and a five-year period. Our Low Duration Bond Fund is the top decile for one
year and three years. And our newly launched Strategic Municipal Opportunity Fund or SMO is in the sixth percentile
for a one-year period of time.
We also continue to see strong performance in our scientific active equities, with 93% of our products above
benchmark or peer medium for a three-year period. And from our index offerings, where we have 98% of our assets,
we're within or above the tolerant level, risk level for over a three-year period of time.
I've spoken at length about the steps we are taking in our fundamental equity business to improve performance. We
streamlined our investment process and recruited top-quality managers to add to our existing talent base. Most recently,
[ph] Chris Jones (26:50) has joined BlackRock as our Co-Head of Global Fundamental Equity and is our new CIO of
America Equity teams. And [ph] Tony Disperto (27:00) joined us – or will be joining us in our equity dividend team
later this year, working very closely with Bob Shearer.
In the second quarter, several of our fundamental equity managers, who had put up strong performance in recent
months, suffered a setback in a variety of global momentum-aided strategies and had produced strong alpha reversals.
We recognize that we remain in a rebuilding phase in this business. And though we never like to see performance
setbacks, we remain confident today in our capabilities of our teams and all our processes.
To give you a few examples of the strength of some of our new managers, Andrew Swan, who manages our Asian
Equities, and Bart Geer, who manages our Basic Value are in the 14th and fifth percentile respectively since they
joined BlackRock. And that performance is starting to begin to pay dividends with flows.
We believe that over time, fundamental equities will be a growth area for BlackRock. We believe the combination of
investing inner talent, inner global footprint, our access to information and idea sharing and our risk management
capabilities positions BlackRock to deliver sustained, superior investment performance to our clients. We know this is a
multiyear effort, and we are committed to seeing it through. These investments that our fundamental equity business
will further enhance the depth and breadth of our global business that we've built over time throughout BlackRock.
As I said at the beginning, we believe that BlackRock has a truly differentiated firm from any other firm in the world.
We are seeing a consistent result that this model can deliver quarter-after-quarter. If you look at our growth on a
year-over-year basis, as adjusted, you will see we grew assets under management by 19%. We grew revenues by 12%.
We grew operating income by 15%, and we grew earnings per share by 18%. That double-digit growth demonstrates
the benefits of our diverse platform and our ability to deliver strong financial results to our shareholders. And I'm
confident that we not only have the platform but we also have the right leadership team in place to continue to drive
growth in the future, even as the environment continues to evolve, as we know it will. Constantly adapting to the
changing environment and improving our performance is something we are intensely focused on. That is how we
intend to continue to unlock value for our clients and then, ultimately, our shareholders.
Finally, I would like to thank our leadership team and all our employees for delivering a very strong quarter and
helping our clients build better financial futures.
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hey, how are you?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Good.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: So I guess the first question I have is, the cost of leverage on the Street is kind of rising as
banks get their houses in order. And that pushes out the cost of leverage to various products that companies like yours
run. So I'm just curious, it certainly didn't seem to affect your flows in the current period. But in things like long/short
credit, multi-strat products that you've had success growing, does that factor in at all in terms of A), the growth and B),
the profitability of those?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: That's a good question. There's no question. You're seeing – as you're referring to the cost of
leverage, I would just say the Basel III, Volcker Rule, Dodd-Frank has forced many sell-side organizations to reduce
their overall capital committing in the marketplace. And two, you're seeing, obviously, liquidity issues in some asset
categories.
Glenn, to date, we have not seen a dramatic change in our ability to buy or sell for our hedge fund strategy. But we're
mindful of that. And indeed, you're correct. If we see a continuing amount of inability to navigate our trades, and we're
seeing larger bid/ask spreads, there's no question that can minimize the opportunities that our alternative products have.
I should say, though, one of the ways that investors are utilizing or trying to change their behaviors – and this is a
growth engine for us. We're seeing hedge funds utilizing ETFs as a – instead of futures or single-stock or single-bond
strategies, they're using ETFs as a mechanism to express a long or short type of exposure.
So in some respects, if there's more liquidity in different products, such as an ETF, you may see that. And so I think in
some respects, the changes in the world related to dealer behavior is a benefit for the ETF market, in itself. And we're
benefiting from that. I'm going to try to express one of the avenues in which people use ETFs.
But one of the big things we have seen is the utilization in the cost of using futures, margins and all that is elevated.
And people are using ETFs as another example. But you're absolutely correct that we have to be mindful of liquidity by
market in terms of the exposures we have in some of the long/short products.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. And maybe just a follow-up – I appreciate that – is related to alternatives – and I don't
know if it's a technical question. But the platform across the board seems great. Your retail penetration is clearly
growing, and yet the net flows into the alternatives bucket is pretty modest.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Less than $300 million this quarter. Now, I don't know if that's a
some-are-growing/some-are-shrinking thing. Or is it – the technical part of the question is, if you've raised a lot but
have not deployed the capital, does it show up as a flow or does it show up as a flow when you get – my question is
commitment versus funding.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: We do not put commitment in our AUM bucket. Some firms do. So as Gary said in his
speech, we did raise a little over $1.3 billion in commitments. Over the course of the year, we raised about $8.5 billion
in commitments and we funded approximately $1.8 billion of it. That is a big change. We also – and we mentioned this
in the first quarter and we're still doing it – we're actually monetizing some of our alternative products. So you're seeing
our commitments grow, but we haven't invested in that. And yet, you're seeing on the same time, we are monetizing
some of our alternatives because of the success the strategies. And we're giving back the capital.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, Glenn, it's Gary. I would say one way to think about it is the return of capital hits the flows
immediately and, this quarter, that was roughly $925 million, thereabouts. And we were basically able to raise new
commitments of $1 billion. So over the long term, the new $1 billion that we've raised will obviously replace the $900
million that we just paid out. But unfortunately, it takes some time to basically invest the money over the...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, we take the more conservative approach, the way we identify those – the asset raise.

<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So Larry's point is that of the $8-plus billion that we've raised since 2013, about $1.5 billion of
that has effectively hit flows, meaning it's been invested. And the dry powder or the $6.5 billion or $6.7 billion will hit
flows over time as it is invested...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: But we are probably in more dialogue with more clients on our alternative space than we
ever have been in the history of the firm. But we like where we're positioned, but also, we like the fact that we can
monetize good successful strategies for our clients.

Your next question will come from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Marc.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Oh, hey, Larry. Just following on the alternatives question. The performance fee is always
tough to get our arms around, the alternatives performance. But can you give us some sense maybe of what kind of
embedded gains you have in some of the portfolios that you're harvesting and maybe what that means for the outlook?
And then I guess just broadly across the alternatives platform, how is performance holding up there? Thanks.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I'll let Gary answer that.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, Marc, as you know, we obviously don't take the approach to economic net income that
some of pure-play alternative managers do. So as we effectively see gains building up, which trigger accruals of, if you
will, embedded performance fees. We fully reserve for that going forward until they become permanent and no longer
subject to...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: We don't report them.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So that's not in our P&L and, frankly, we don't really disclose those as a matter of course. I
think obviously, you saw our performance fees were up 29% year-over-year. I think the important thing to note for us is
it's very broad based. So it's not a single fund that is basically driving that. It is a very deep – the breadth of the
platform is evident in the fact that when you see the result, it's lots and lots and lots of different funds. Though it was
clear that this particular quarter, we had a number of annual locks, meaning that they lock annually as opposed to
quarterly. And we benefited from much a stronger performance in this 12-month lock period than we did in the prior
year.
But broadly speaking, I think we're feeling very happy with the performance of the alternatives platform. And the
performance fees are coming through.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: And as I said, Marc, some of the great opportunities we have, I mentioned in the speech – in
the infrastructure space where we think this is going to be a great driver in the future for us and our clients.
And so it's – we have great opportunities in front of – across the alternatives space. Rob Kapito and team have been –
and Charlie have spent a lot of time and quietly rebooting our whole alternative platform under Matt Botein and Andy
Stewart. And it's been – in the short-term, we are starting to see real tangible results.
<Q - Marc S. Irizarry>: Okay. And then, Larry, just one follow-on. Can you give us some – an update, if possible, on
any of the asset management regulation and maybe specifically any update around maybe the discourse on systemic
importance for asset managers?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I wish I had something to tell you that's factual. I don't. We don't know anything more than
what you've been reading in the newspapers. Under Dodd-Frank, banks, anybody related to Dodd-Frank, whether it's
SIFI or anything else, we're not allowed to have a dialogue. It is called lobbying, and it has to be publicly revealed that
we're lobbying. So there is not – you don't have the transparency of the process at all. This is very unusual. In any other
type of rule creation in Washington, there's always a process of dialogue. And this was explicitly prohibited in the law

of Dodd-Frank.
And so we don't know anything more than what we read. And unfortunately, what we read, sometimes we believe there
are leaks. And so it's a pretty inappropriate process from our perspective. But our job is to be a constructive participant
in this. We have been occasionally asked to provide information to various different regulators worldwide on different
things that they may be studying. It's a one-directional approach. We provide information, and we get very little back.
And that's obviously what the laws say.
So I don't know anything more. But what I'd like to do is give you some of how we think about asset managers and
regulatory oversight. We calculate at BlackRock there's $225 trillion in global financial assets. Assets that are being
managed by investment firms manage $62 trillion of the $225 trillion. So over 70% of the financial assets are owned
and managed directly by the owners.
And the other thing I would just like to say, as you know, these are not our assets across the board. We have a contract
in what we invested and how we invest with every client. As you know at BlackRock, we have hundreds of portfolio
managers making decisions. We don't have one CIO managing all the assets across all of the spectrums going left or
right or forward. So we don't think principle risks. And the last thing I would just say related to BlackRock. If you
dissect our platform, 62% of our assets or $2.8 trillion of our assets are index products. And then we manage – about
32% of our assets are in active and another 6% in cash and advisory.
So you think about the make-up of even, as large as we look upon, much of our activities are very different than a lot of
other asset managers, in itself. So we believe that narrative that I just expressed is beginning to be more understood.
And there was a proposal in Congress yesterday to allow for greater transparency in the process, deeper dialogues in
the process. And we welcome that type of activity, and we want to be a constructive participant in this dialogue.

Your next question will comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning. Thanks, guys.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: So a couple questions on retail distribution. You enter 2013, I think with a range of new
strategic initiatives. And the results over the last year or so have been pretty impressive, as indicated by net flows. But
aside from some of the key products that drove that growth – you've touched on them, multi-asset and the Core ETF
series. Could you give us a sense of how successfully you've been with the goal of really broadening that penetration
with the warehouses outside of that relationship you've had historically with Merrill Lynch?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, I'm going to let Rob answer that. Rob, why don't you...
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yeah. So we have grown significantly from being Merrill Lynch centric on retail and, in fact,
broaden the distributions to several others in a very significant way. And, in fact, our market share at some of the larger
wirehouses beyond Merrill Lynch has more than doubled over the last two years. So we continue to penetrate because
we are bringing products that a lot of them do not offer. And especially in the ETF side, we've seen a lot of growth in
that particular area.
There is other channels that've also been developed beyond just a typical wirehouse, which is the RIA channel, of
which a lot of financial advisors have moved from the large broker/dealers into smaller channels. And we have pretty
significant penetration in the RIA channel.
We also, as you know, have read about our joint venture with Fidelity. And that has been more successful than we had
originally planned. So that broadens out our effort. And one of the things that has really been successful for us is that
rather than going out with individual sales forces for our ETF channel and for our mutual fund channel. Over the last
year, we have combined our sales force to have the largest sales force, going out and talking to broaden the distribution

and treating the FAs more holistically because they own in their portfolios both mutual funds, active, index and ETF.
So we can talk to them about a more holistic solution, and I don't think that many of our competitors can claim to be
able to do that. And the last thing that has also helped to broaden out the channels is that we announced a Core Series
and are specifically developing in the ETF channel specific ETFs for the buy-and-hold Retail segment. And again,
that's something that has also broadened out our Retail network, and has been very successful.
So many things are going from years ago, when we were more Merrill Lynch centric. Now we have a much broader
and deeper retail penetration in our products.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Let me add one other thing, Luke, which I think is not fully understood by the investment
community. And that is the substantial growth in mutual funds sales in Europe. As you know, banks continue to
deleverage. More and more activities are going on to the capital markets, greater confidence in Europe and Europe's
future, with a huge amount of savings in Europe. And so we're seeing much greater penetration across the board in
European retail. So there're two other macro trends that are going on in Europe. One, domestic managers are losing out
to the global international managers. And so across the board, you're seeing the international investment managers
picking up market share in Europe.
And the last thing I would say, you're seeing a real consolidation in inflows. The top-10 managers in Europe are driving
almost 90% plus, maybe 110% – I don't have the actual number in front of me – of all the flows because the smaller
managers are actually having net outflows. But if you look at the substantial growth of $9 billion in international retail
this year-to-date, that's a high component of our growth.
And I should say international retail means Asia, means Europe, it means Latin America. So this gets back to my
comments earlier about being in 30 countries, being local in 30 different countries. We are benefiting from that. And
we believe as the world begins to look for other alternatives away from bank deposits, looking for strategies for their
retirement. If you link in longevity and longevity issues, investors worldwide are looking for global advice and we're
very well-positioned across that.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Thanks. And so my follow-up – and I apologize, Larry because I know you chafe at
the comparison of your firm to Vanguard's, but a question on the distribution strategy in retail ETFs and index markets.
I think over the years...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well I wouldn't say chafe.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: All right. Yeah. Maybe I mischaracterized that. But I've heard some wirehouse distribution
executives over the years lament that Vanguard products basically free-ride on the wirehouse distributors who have to
come see their products as a courtesy to FAs and clients. So I wonder, do you see any specific opportunity based on
your willingness to partner more directly with those firms to pay channel access fees, et cetera? Does that give you an
opportunity to supplant some of the market share they've acquired previously?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I'll let Rob answer that. Yeah.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: I don't think...
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Bob, do you chafe?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: I don't chafe at all. I view our strategies as quite different. We're going to expand by
education the use of how ETFs are going to benefit clients' portfolios, both institutional and retail. And I think in a
product life-cycle, this is very typical that you have people come in at first and want to just get involved. And then you
have all the other uses of this product.
Larry mentioned one, for example, where we have noticed that ETFs are cheaper to use than futures. There's nobody
better to go out into the marketplace and educate the community on a change like that than BlackRock is. And this is
something that many of the other issuers of ETFs really don't think about. They're out selling product. We're selling a
solution, and ETF's a part of that solution.

When it comes to people that are looking for large credit portfolios, we're able to talk to them about a holistic solution
where they can get diversification and liquidity and actually have a better structured portfolio by the use of iShares than
just buying the individual assets, themselves.
We have so many different ways that we are developing the uses of ETFs that the both/dealer community and
institutional community looks to us to use ETFs as part of an overall solution. So we're not out there just pushing one
product versus another product because it's hot. We're using this as a full part of a portfolio allocation. I think that's
very important. So it's core investment. It's to get more precision exposures into the marketplace. And we are treating
this as a significant financial instrument, not just a product that we hope to garner more assets in. It's a very different
strategy than Vanguard is. They're a good firm. So we're glad to compete with them.

Your next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William R. Katz>: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, just coming back to
regulatory front for a second, maybe a two-part question. One is, what's been the sort of reaction from the institutional
clients, given the SEC discussion about possibly voting on a prime fund with a flow rate now? And a separate part of
the question is – and it's sort of early days, but it looks like MiFID out of Europe's coming up with some pretty onerous
shifts of views on how they're treating research versus trading. Sort of wondering how you might be thinking about that
by now as it relates to your business?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: So we have continuously been a constructive organization, working side by side with our
regulators related to money market funds. So we've been continuously engaged with the SEC throughout the process.
We have made a number of recommendations. We have spoken to – when asked about what we think about it, we've
had dialogue with many of the commissioners, when asked. And importantly, we're well positioned, regardless of
where the SEC comes out on a portfolio – on the proposal, excuse me.
Money is moving around, and we're going to see how this all plays out for our clients. But when you think about where
we are as a firm in terms of money markets, we have money market funds. We have separate accounts for money
market accounts. We have short-duration bond funds. We have ETFs. You have other vehicles.
Money will be in motion. Money will change. If clients find whatever the outcome is, is very restrictive, they'll move
money elsewhere. We will also – and – but most importantly, we're well positioned. And I do believe the SEC have
been very open to conversation related to recommendations and all that. We'll see how this all plays out.
The one thing I can't comment on because we don't know what this means related to bank deposits. In theory bank
deposit could be even a better alternative. So obviously, money market funds are, in some cases an alternative to bank
deposits. And the flows of money market funds is a function of what bank rates are. But a lot of people are very
mindful of how much exposure they would have with any one single bank. And so I think this is why money market
funds are desired by clients, and this is one thing that we try to express to regulators. Clients like money market funds.
And we're well positioned. We have many government funds that have separate accounts. So we'll stand by and hear
what the outcome will be from the SEC related to their decision. We know as much as you do that, in theory, there's
going to be some decision next week. And we'll find out.
Related MiFID in RDR in terms of regulatory changes, you're going to see consolidation with managers. Our risk
management tools is a huge benefit, and I do believe our index ETF platform, efficient exposures. I think you're going
to see more movement towards ETFs as a result of the MiFID RDR type of regulatory changes. So it may reduce some
of our business in Europe, but it's going to enhance the other side of BlackRock's business.
And this is another example whereby the diversity of our products are positioning globally really differentiates us. So
we are working with regulators. We're mindful of this. We are telling regulators what clients want, what they expect.

Your next question will come from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth B. Worthington>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just one question from me. I wanted to ask about the
retirement business outside the U.S. We've seen changes to the UK pension plan this year, which appears to benefit
maybe asset managers over insurance companies. The E.U. has been underway for pension reform for I think the last
four years. BlackRock has had such success in the U.S. taking market share and driving growth in the U.S. retirement
business. Maybe, Larry, you could discuss what's happening outside the U.S. and maybe where the biggest
opportunities lie for BlackRock.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, there's no question, some of the rule changes in the UK is a big opening for firms like
us, especially related to the UK pension reform. As you suggested, it was really an insurance product. And now it's
migrating to a – much more opportunities. So the defined contribution savers will have now an option. They could take
and withdraw beyond the 25% tax-free lump sum.
So we believe this is a big opportunity for us. Yeah. So especially in light of how we think about investment outcomes
and solutions. I mean retirement is something that we are spending a great deal of time trying to help savers, potential
retirees in thinking about longevity and how their solutions are going to have to be more weighted towards equities,
less annuitized products.
Historically, as you suggested, Ken, annuitized products were the prime driver of this. And if you're going to be living
a long time earning 2% on an annuitized product or 3%, you're just going to have to be saving a lot more money to earn
the necessary pool of money you want.
This is why we're rolling out – we rolled out CoRI overseas in the UK. We're going to continue to roll out our
investment type of products to provide what I would say that solution-based strategy. So we're encouraged. We think
we're well positioned for these changes. And as you suggested, hopefully, we're in a good position to take share.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Craig.

longer-term themes of open architecture and the adoption of [ph] passes (58:15) are really progressive – progressing
really both in the target date funds in the U.S.? And I'm really thinking your perspective here from both your LifePath
and your Glide Path products.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Rob, do you want to answer that?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yeah. I mean, look, it's the same trend on retirement. People have not saved enough for
retirement, and they have lived through too much volatility in both the equity and fixed income markets. So they're
looking for an alternative for someone to manage the asset allocation and the process throughout their lifetime. So to
us, the opportunity is to develop the tools and the technology. And one that we have is called the CoRi Index, Cost of
Retirement Index, of which we can manage through target date funds and LifePath funds a better way to do the asset
allocation as a person gets closer to retirement.
We think there's going to be incredible opportunities for us in this way because the advice in asset allocation is
something that we specialize in, the models that we have specifically target retirees and manage this process throughout
their life. And it's something where we see a lot of the sponsors are moving towards and, as Larry mentioned, a lot of

Your next question will come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Daniel T. Fannon>: Hi. Just want to talk about fixed income. I mean can you talk about the momentum you're
seeing, particularly on the institutional side? Performance is flagged as improving. I just want to talk about just client
dialogue, outlook for growth and how that compares to recent periods.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well, having 90% of our fixed income products above their benchmarks for three years,
having a lot of products that are in the top decile. If there is a conversation to be had, firms are going to be talking to us
as one of the possibilities. That puts us in a very good position.
We're seeing very mixed types of conversations across the board. We continue to see large scale pension funds
de-risking, as they have taken profits in equities. We're seeing a lot of pension funds looking now towards some form
of immunization as they get closer to their liability. Or even, in some cases, above their liability, they're using bonds as
a vehicle.
But probably the most important key for us is, our fixed income platform is more than just one product. It's across the
board where we are seeing increase activities. We're in more dialogue today than we ever have been in fixed income in
terms of new flows. In the unconstrained area, we're just beginning to see public pension plans migrate out of
index-based products into unconstrained products. So we are in some very large dialogues at this moment. We do
believe one or two of the conversations are going to constitute some large wins in the third quarter.
We continue to be in deep dialogue with many clients related to credit and high yield – and whether it's an insurance
company who's looking and in need of some form of income to offset their annuity liabilities. And we're still seeing,
large-scale international investors are looking to continue to invest in dollar-based assets and expressing those
investments in the form of fixed income.
And so across the board, we are seeing heightened interest in fixed income, even in the low interest rate environment.
As I said, some of it is because they're de-risking in equities. But some of it is because they're seeing increased activity
in their own business, like an insurance company. But I would say overall – probably the overall theme I can say
related to BlackRock's future and future activities in fixed income, having the performance that we have across our
platform for five years, for three years, for one year is giving us a position where we are in dialogue with many clients
worldwide.

<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Bob?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: I don't know if we are willing to break down what is coming from one place for another. But
I can also tell you that the growth that we expected is probably twice what we had anticipated.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: For Core Series.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: For Core Series.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah.
<A - Brennan Hawken>: And we have high aspirations for this because there's a segment of the market that is really
not looking for the liquidity. They're looking for the buy-and-hold. And this is a particular segment that Fidelity
actually addresses. So we had expectations of future growth for that. But we don't rely, especially in that, just upon one
distribution segment.
There are other distribution segments that also cater to the buy-and-hold segment. That being said, there's the other
segment, which is the institutional or the trading segment. They're looking more at the liquidity of this and the access
for asset allocation in their portfolios. So what we're trying to do is have products to appeal to the right segments, and
we'll price those appropriately and make sure the performance of those is appropriate for those particular targets.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: I would just say also, we are benefiting tremendously this year from the – and Rob said it
earlier – from the integration of our two sales forces. And so you asked the question related to Fidelity, but we're
seeing, in large, activities across all the independent channels from all the major distributors. And so I would say it's
pretty broad based. But our relationship with Fidelity is strong, growing and it's a very good partnership.

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Hi, Michael.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Hi, Larry. Hey, Larry, just a question. If I look at the growth that you guys have generated
in iShares and on the Retail side. It's been fairly consistent on Retail, big improvement over the past couple years. And
then on the Institutional side, I feel like you guys have the relationships. When I look at the solution products, the
alternatives, it seems like the product offering's there. But the flows aren't as strong on the other channel.
So is it an allocation problem? I know you mentioned some on the performance side, where it's active equity or [ph]
quant demand is (1:06:21) just not there.
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Yeah.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: But just from an outlook standpoint, do you guys feel like the things are in place, so over
the next two years, we kind of see the same trend that we saw on the Retail side? Or is there something else that's
somewhat of a hindrance there?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: You're right in suggesting in terms of iShares, our rolling 12 months were going around
10%. In Retail, our rolling 12 months is about 13% growth, and our rolling 12 months in Institutional is flat. And so
those are actual facts. What we're witnessing in Institutional, though – and if you look at, our revenues were growing
faster than our AUM. We are seeing mix change. We're growing more in alts, which is lower AUM, higher fees. But
importantly, we have seen some large-scale clients de-risking in equities, going into cash. A lot of that was
international, and so the net result is a flat type of growth rate over the last 12 months.
I'll be bold enough to say we believe we're well positioned in Institutional and that we are going to see opportunity for
growth in Institutional, whether it is in fixed income, as I said earlier about all the unconstrained conversations we're
having with large pension plans in the fixed income space. We continue to be driving more opportunities in

alternatives. And I hope I could comment in the future that we're going to start seeing opportunities in our model-based
equity business because we've had exceptional return.
But we also have opportunities in the Official Institution business, and corporate – and the DC plans and in the
Financial Institution Group. So among those different areas, we are in more dialogue today than we have been. But I
am disappointed in the net results of AUM, but I'm not upset at the revenue growth that we're seeing in the Institutional
side.

Your next question will come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Chris M. Harris>: Thanks. Hey, guys. So just a quick follow-up on fixed income. You guys and others in the
industry clearly benefiting from growth in unconstrained, and you've highlighted that. I'm kind of curious if you guys
think investors understand or fully understand the risks of these funds? And then maybe how sticky do you think these
assets will be if things get a little bit more volatile in the market?
<A - Laurence D. Fink>: Well in theory, things get more volatile. In other words, if you have more volatility, which
probably means higher interest rates, you're going to be happier in an unconstrained product versus an intermediate
duration target, like a Core product. So that is what clients are looking for so they don't have a tethering to a benchmark
that has no connection to their liability.
That is one of the big issues that's confronting a lot of investors. Investors are worried about those who're in fixed
income – fixed-income for immunization purposes. They are worried about the eventuality of higher rates. We are
seeing growth in our global long/short credit products, which have zero duration. So do I think clients understand what
they're getting into? 100%. Clients were looking to immunize. They're looking for as a long a duration as they possibly
can have, so we should be clear.
We're seeing movement across fixed income. We're seeing some people who are worried about being tethered to a
benchmark that has no connection to their liability. They're either looking more towards liability matching in fixed
income or they're seeing a movement towards unconstrained. We're seeing some clients who remain steadfast in credit
and are looking to add to credit, whether it's the form of the CLO or in the form of high yield.
There's not one single behavior, but you asked me specifically related to unconstrained. I believe our investors are
investing in unconstrained for a reason, for a purpose. And the dialogues that we've had with clients year-to-date
validate my view that they understand what they're doing related to the associated risk. And the volatility that you've
discussed I think would be attached to higher rates, and that is one of the reasons why people are looking to
unconstrained. So obviously, they have to perform in that environment. And they are going to have to perform much
better than a tethered Core product that's tethered to a four-year or five-year duration.

Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence D. Fink
No. I hope everyone has a decent summer. Hopefully the volatility doesn't begin this summer, so we could take this
summer. I just want to thank all our shareholders for your interest in our company. And I would like to thank the
employees of BlackRock for a good quarter. Have a good quarter. Thanks, everyone.
