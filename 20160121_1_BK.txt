Now, I would like to turn the call over the Gerald Hassell. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Great. Thanks, Valerie, and welcome, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. Our fourth quarter results capped
off what I think was a very good year. We demonstrated that our strategic plan has positioned us well to perform in all
operating environments. Even with geopolitical instability, emerging market weakness, higher regulatory compliance
requirements, and low interest rates, we executed on our strategic priorities and focused on what was within our
control.
So for the full year, EPS was up 19%, total revenue was up 2%, while total expenses were down 2%, resulting in more
than 400 basis points of positive operating leverage. Net interest revenue was up 5% and we improved our pre-tax
operating margin to 31%. And finally, our return on tangible common equity was a very healthy 21%. So, we are on
track to achieve our three-year goals, targets which call for healthy earnings growth not reliant on improved market
conditions.
So, turning to the fourth quarter itself, adjusted earnings per share was $0.68. Now, that excludes $0.11 per share for
the impact of the previously disclosed impairment charge related to a recent court decision which Todd will discuss in
more detail in a moment and litigation and restructuring charges. That puts earnings per share up 17% year-over-year
on an adjusted basis.
For the quarter, again, on an adjusted basis, total revenue was up 2%; total expense was down 2%; and we generated
over 300 basis points of positive operating leverage, mainly driven by our business improvement process; net interest
revenue was up 7% year-over-year; and our return on tangible common equity was 19% for the quarter.
Now, looking at our progress against our strategic priorities, as I've said in the past, our first priority is driving
profitable revenue growth. We have heightened focus on disciplined revenue growth, which means paying particular
attention to our clients, profitability, and shareholder value versus growth revenues and market share. During 2015, we
made progress on a number of different fronts. We are focused on deepening our client relationships by leveraging our
expertise and determining how we can add further value to them and increase the acceptance rate of our services. At the
same time, we are also examining each business and service that we offer to ensure that we are receiving value for what
we deliver. The strategic platform investments we've been making continue to pay off. We've been able to create
efficiencies and savings for us, and in many cases, for our clients as well. We are now in the early stages of rolling out
our new platform, NEXEN, which will deliver additional functionality and capabilities to all of our clients.
Now, in investment management, we extended our liability-driven investment strategy into the U.S. market through our
Cutwater acquisition, and our U.S. retail and wealth management initiatives continue to add to our new business
pipeline. This week, we announced plans to acquire Silicon Valley wealth manager, Atherton Lane Advisers, which has
$2.7 billion of assets under management. This investment further strengthens our footprint in one of the fastest-growing
U.S. wealth markets, and we're also pleased to welcome them to the BNY Mellon team.
And in the U.S. retail space, we had success with the Standish Global Fixed Income strategy, which was the highest
growth product in Morningstar's World Bond category in 2015. And in the markets group, we continued to enhance our
collateral management systems and foreign exchange trading platforms, all to drive efficiencies, capture more volume,
and improve the opportunities for future revenue growth.
Now, our second priority is executing on our business improvement process. We have been meeting or exceeding our
business process goals and are on target to achieve the structural cost reductions that we shared at Investor Day in
October 2014. During 2015, we simplified and automated global processes, optimized and streamlined our technology
infrastructure, and shrank our real estate portfolio. During the fourth quarter, we took a number of additional actions,
improved the company's business and financial performance. Let me give you a couple of examples.

We are implementing robotics and machine learning to eliminate repetitive, non-value-added work enabling a quicker
automated process while reducing risk and costs. We completed three proofs-of-concept, all demonstrating a high
degree of accuracy in processing, reducing transactional processing time, and eliminating manual steps, all of which
enables us to redeploy resources to activities that create greater value for our clients.
Last quarter, I mentioned the new client pricing strategy group that we created to analyze and measure service delivery
costs to better align our costs to client pricing. This group is now reviewing balance sheet-related business practices
such as overdrafts, as well as manual transaction activities and new strategies around physical securities, as well as
standardizing pricing across our business units.
We're also continuing to build out our global delivery centers in lower cost locations to allow for further expansion and
position migration. And we moved over 230 full-time staff positions to global delivery centers during the quarter, and
more than 1,000 full-time positions in 2015.
Now, we've also begun to implement the bring-your-own-device strategy. We are reducing the number of data
terminals across the company and have cut back on redundant pricing fees. These efforts, large and small, are part of a
continuous, comprehensive, and sustainable process to create efficiencies and savings consistent with our continuous
improvement culture.
Our third priority centers on being a strong, safe, trusted counterparty. During 2015, we reduced and simplified our
counterparty exposures; invested in and focused on compliance, risk management, and control functions; examined and
enhanced our vendor management practices following the SunGard incident; incorporating lessons learned and sharing
those with our clients; and made significant investments in our resolution and recovery plans.
We also introduced a more robust data governance framework that will strengthen our data collection and analytical
capabilities, which is important in meeting all of our regulatory requirements globally. And lastly, we demonstrated our
strong business recovery capability in response to the historic flooding in Chennai, India, where we have thousands of
employees.
Our fourth priority involves generating excess capital and deploying it effectively and wisely. We remain focused on
maintaining a strong balance sheet, as well as capital and liquidity positions while returning value to our shareholders.
So, in accordance with our 2015 capital plan, which authorized us to repurchase up to $3.1 billion of our stock, we
repurchased $431 million in shares and we distributed $188 million in dividends during the quarter. For the full year,
we repurchased approximately $2.4 billion in shares and distributed more than $760 million in dividends. Over the last
four years, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 13%, which is among the best in the industry. And from a
regulatory ratio standpoint, all of our key capital ratios improved as we moved toward full compliance.
This quarter, our CET1 ratio under the fully phased-in advanced approach improved to 9.5% and we increased our
supplementary leverage ratio to 4.9%. We also remain in full compliance with liquidity coverage ratio, which became
effective in 2015 with a full phase-in period that extends through 2017. We remain very confident that we will be in
full compliance with all of the regulatory ratio requirements at the time of or ahead of the required dates.
Now, our fifth priority is to attract, develop, and retain top talents. We have continued to focus on investing in our
people. We have refreshed the tools and processes we use to manage, grow, and get the most out of our talents, and we
are seeing the benefits of prioritizing talent, as reflected in our financial performance.
So, as we look ahead, given a rocky start to the year in the financial markets, we expect our business improvement
process to be increasingly critical to our results going forward. We remain confident that our strategy and relentless
focus on the execution of our priorities will enable us to achieve the three-year financial targets we shared on Investor
Day and, importantly, deliver value-added services and solutions to our clients.
And with that, let me turn it over to Todd.

Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document and we'll
start with slide 7. Before I walk you through the details of the financial results, let me provide you with an overview of
the court decision that Gerald noted, which resulted in a fourth quarter after-tax impairment charge of $0.10. The
charge resulted from a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision related to a $312 million secured loan we had to
Sentinel Management Group, which filed for bankruptcy in 2007.
Following a favorable December 2014 decision favorable for us by a federal court finding that our lien against Sentinel
was valid, we received payment of the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. Subsequently, the bankruptcy
trustee appealed the decision and the appellate court invalidated our lien on the collateral that supported the loan. The
impact of this decision is that we will have an unsecured claim in the Sentinel bankruptcy. As a result, we took an
impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $170 million on a pre-tax basis, or $106 million after tax, representing our
estimate of the probable losses.
Turning now to our fourth quarter results in the financial highlights document, we'll start with slide 7. I'll focus on our
non-GAAP or operating results for the quarter and the year-over-year comparisons. On an operating basis, our fourth
quarter EPS was $0.68, that's up 17% versus year ago. On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter revenue was up 2%,
expenses down 2%, and we had 308 basis points of positive operating leverage. As we've noted in prior quarters, the
strength of the U.S. dollar continues to impact results negatively for revenue and positively for expense. Net impact of
currency translation is minimal, however, to our overall consolidated financial results.
Adjusted for the dollar, revenue would have been up approximately 3% and expenses a little less than 1%. However,
our Investment Management business is impacted more significantly from the strength of the dollar, since a significant
component of Investment Management revenue is from non-U.S. dollar sources. If you reference page 6 of our earnings
release, you will see the two currencies that impact Investment Management the most, it's the pound and the euro, and
they were down 4% and 12%, respectively, against the U.S. dollar.
Income before taxes was up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. On a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax margin
increased approximately 200 basis points to 30% in the fourth quarter. Return on tangible common equity was 19% for
the quarter.
Now, moving to slide 10 that details our operating results for the full year. You can see the 2% revenue growth and 2%
decline year-over-year in expenses that Gerald mentioned. That resulted in 420 points of positive operating leverage.
Income before taxes grew 12%; EPS, up 19%. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 5%, expenses were up 1%.
Slide 11 illustrates key metrics of our performance that demonstrate solid execution of our strategic priorities in 2015.
You can see the four quadrants here: EPS, up 19%; noninterest expense, down; pre-tax operating margin expanded
nearly 300 basis points; and return on tangible common equity is also up 300 basis points to 21%.
Slide 12 shows our consolidated fee and other revenue. Asset servicing fees were up 1% year-over-year, down 2%
sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects growth in global collateral services, broker dealer services,
and higher securities lending revenues, which is partially offset by unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar. The
sequential decrease primarily reflects lower client activity.
Clearing service fees were down 2% year-over-year and sequentially. Both decreases were primarily driven by industry
consolidation, as three large clients are transitioning to self-clearing firms. Partially mitigating this impact is the new
businesses we are on-boarding from a competitor who exited the business. And through a combination of net new
business and expense control, we expect clearing to be pre-tax income neutral in 2016.
Issuer service fees were up 3% year-over-year and down 36% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily
reflects net new business and lower money market fee waivers in Corporate Trust that was offset a bit by the stronger
dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonality in DRs. As we've noted in prior quarters, our Corporate
Trust performance has been improving. This quarter, it was a positive contributor to our growth.
Treasury service fees were down 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily
reflects higher compensating balance credits and lower volumes.

Fourth quarter investment management and performance fees were down 2% year-over-year, that would have been up
1% on a constant currency basis and that was driven by higher performance fees and a slight reduction in money
market fee waivers, partially offset by lower equity markets. Sequentially, investment management and performance
fees increased 4%, and that's primarily due to the normal performance fee seasonality. Performance fees were $55
million, that compares to $40 million a year ago, driven by stronger performance across a wide breadth of strategies,
including a sharp increase in equity long-only fees.
FX and other trading revenue on a consolidated basis was up 15% year-over-year and it was down 3% sequentially. FX
revenue of $165 million was flat year-over-year, down 8% sequentially. Year-over-year we saw lower standing
instruction volumes and lower volatility, which were offset by higher volumes in other trading programs. Also included
is the impact of hedging activities for the foreign currency placements. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower
volumes and volatility, and seasonally lower deposits from the Receipts-related activity. That was partially offset by the
hedging activity for foreign currency placements.
Other trading revenue increased to $8 million compared with a trading loss of $14 million in year ago quarter, and a
loss of $1 million in Q3. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the losses on hedging activities within one of
the investment management boutiques that we recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.
Financing-related fees increased to 19% to $51 million, and that's compared to the year ago quarter, and decreased 28%
sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher fees related to tri-party repo activity. In the second
quarter, we noted that some of our clients could moderate their usage or possibly find alternative sources for this
financing in the future. We actually began to see this take place during the fourth quarter. The sequential decrease
primarily reflects lower underwriting fees and the impact of lower fees related to the secured intraday credit I just
mentioned.
Investment and other income of $93 million compared with $78 million in the year ago quarter, and $59 million in the
third quarter, the year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher other income related to termination fees in our
clearing business. And that was associated with the client transitions that we mentioned, as well as seed capital gains,
and that's partially offset by lower asset-related gains and lease gains. The sequential increase in investment and other
income primarily reflects higher asset-related gains, income from corporate and bank-owned life insurance and other
income related clearing termination fees, partially offset by lease residual losses.
Slide 13 shows the drivers of our investment management performance that should help explain our underlying – the
underlying business. Assets under management of $1.63 trillion were down 4% year-over-year. Driven by a stronger
dollar and lower equity markets. And they were flat sequentially. We had long-term outflows of $11 billion, $16 billion
out of index funds and $5 billion into active funds. Additionally, we had $2 billion of short-term cash flows. For the
full year, we had long-term outflows of $17 billion, mainly in equity and index investments, partially offset by flows
into LTI and alternatives.
Our wealth management and U.S. intermediate expansion initiatives continues to show some progress, the wealth
management loans were up 21%, deposits were up 6%. In addition, we announced the acquisition of the Silicon Valley
wealth manager, there's AUM of $2.7 billion and 700 high net-worth clients, an investment that expands our presence
in this fast growing market. In U.S. intermediary, we had strong performance in a number of investment strategies,
experienced organic growth rates that exceeded their Morningstar categories.
Turning to our investment services metrics on slide 14, assets under custody and administration at quarter end with
$28.9 trillion, up 1% or $400 billion year-over-year, reflecting net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower market values. On a constant currency basis, year-over-year growth would
have been up approximately 3%. Linked quarter, AUC/A was also up $400 billion.
We estimate total new assets under custody and administration business wins of $49 billion in the fourth quarter, and
that gives us a total of $1.2 trillion new business wins for the year. Fourth quarter net new business was below average.
Just as a reminder, AUC/A wins are episodic and they can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Our pipelines continue to look
healthy. And as we've discussed, our strategy has been to prioritize organic growth by deepening our existing client

relationships and selectively adding new business versus simply growing market share.
Now looking at some other metrics for investment services, the market value of securities on loan at period end was
down 4%, average loans grew 4% while average deposits were down slightly. Our broker-dealer metric of average
tri-party repo balances grew 2%. The clearing metrics were mixed, DARTS volumes in large long-term mutual fund
assets were down, while active accounts were up modestly. The net decline in sponsored DR program reflects our
continued focus in exiting low activity programs.
Turning to net interest revenue on slide 15, you'll see that NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up 7% versus the
year ago quarter, and it was flat from the third quarter. The year-over-year increase in NIR reflects higher yields due to
a shift out of cash into securities and loans as well as lower interest expense on deposits. While the volume of earning
assets declined 2%, their yield increased 6 basis points year-over-year, and the yield on interest-bearing deposits
decreased 2 basis points. Sequentially, NIR was flat.
Our net interest margin for the quarter was 99 basis points, 8 basis points higher than year-ago quarter, and 1 basis
point higher than the prior quarter. Deposits were down $9 billion sequentially on average. That was the expected
response to the Fed's first rate move. Our models continue to estimate some additional loss of deposits if the Fed
continues to raise rates, as implied by the forward curve at year end, and an increasing NIM in line with our Investor
Day goals.
Turning to slide 16, you will see that noninterest expense on an adjusted basis declined 2% year-over-year and was flat
sequentially. The year-over-year increase in noninterest expense reflects lower expenses in all categories except staff
expense. Now there are a few expense items that were both positive and negative earnings that I'd like to call out, and I
think it'll help give you a bit of context.
Staff expenses grew by 4% year-over-year and that's reflecting severance costs of approximately $55 million in
ongoing support of our business improvement process, and an adjustment of roughly $30 million related to updated
information received from an administrator of our healthcare benefits. All of that was partially offset by the impact of
curtailing the U.S. pension plan earlier in the year.
Decrease in other expense primarily reflects adjustments of approximately $35 million to our estimate for bank
assessment charges. And that estimate included the European Single Resolution Fund, and it was partially offset by
higher asset-based taxes. Factoring in these items, we once again showed strong expense control.
Turning to capital on slide 17, fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 20 basis points to [ph] 9.50
(24:37). That was driven by lower risk-weighted assets as capital was about flat. Our supplemental leverage ratio
increased to 4.9% this quarter, principally due to a reduction in our balance sheet as well as a reduction in off-balance
sheet exposures.
A couple of other notes about the quarter from our press release. As you'll see in the release on page three, the effective
tax rate was 20.1%, which is approximately 5% lower than our previous guidance. The rate is lower approximately 3%
due to the impact of the impairment charge that I mentioned at the beginning of my comments and approximately 2%
lower, driven by the benefit of a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and a little higher tax-exempt income.
On page 11, you will see some investment securities portfolio highlights. At quarter end, our net unrealized pre-tax
gain on our portfolio was $357 million. That compared to $1.05 billion at the end of September. The difference in value
is principally due to the increase in interest rates.
Before I wrap up, let me summarize several items that I discussed in this quarter. As we'd indicated, the impairment in
litigation charges resulted in an $0.11 charge, and we are negatively impacted by increased compensation costs driven
by severance and healthcare cost adjustment that I just spoke of, that amounted to about 5%.
On the benefit side, we benefited by reduced bank assessment charges, a lower tax rate and termination fees related to
our clearing businesses, which added about $0.06 to earnings. These items, in aggregate, had a negative impact of
about $0.10 in the fourth quarter to our reported earnings.

Now, I'd like to provide you with a few points to factor into your thinking about 2016. As you know, we have been
planning and managing for the flat-rate scenario as outlined in our Investor Day in late 2014. Now that the Fed has
increased rates, we're using the forward rate curve assumptions. The rate increase is obviously a positive for us, but we
are still facing global economic and geopolitical challenge as evidenced by the market's sharp decline year-to-date.
As a result, we are cautious about how this set of challenges will impact the Fed thinking about future rate increases.
Additionally, we are concerned about the equity market performance impact to our organization. With that said, let me
provide you with our current thinking as we look ahead to the first quarter and the full year. We expect a modest
increase in NIR and NIM in the first quarter. With respect to the recapture of money market fee waivers, we continue to
expect to recover 70% with a 50 basis point increase in rates. 25 basis points of that increase has already occurred.
On expenses, our goal is to keep expense growth flat in 2016. However, higher rates will eliminate fee waivers and that
will drive higher distribution expenses. Largely, it was as a result of the higher distribution expense. We expect total
expense growth to be in the range of 1% to 2% next year.
In the first quarter, we would expect to see a $15 million increase in the bank assessment charges, and it should run at
that for the full year, and we would expect staff expense to be impacted in the first quarter by the acceleration of
long-term incentive compensation expense for retiree-eligible employees that typically takes place in the first quarter.
We expect our tax rate for the full year to be approximately 25% to 26%. We expect to continue to repurchase shares
under our current authorization, both in Q1 and Q2. Our repurchase for the second half of the year will be contingent
upon the Federal Reserve not objecting to our CCAR request later this year.
We think our performance, both in the quarter and throughout 2015, underscores that our strategic plan has positioned
us well to perform in some tough operating environments. We're focused on our strategic priorities, we're executing on
them and we remain on track to achieve our three-year goals.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Todd. And, Nicole, I think we can now open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, on the expense front – thanks,
Todd, for walking through some of the one-timers that impacted the results – how should we think about the
go-forward [ph] or the direct (29:28) jumping off point based on some of that noise that we saw here in the fourth
quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So as I walked you through each one of those, I would take the category run rate down by
about the amount that I mentioned.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. So the specific numbers you gave, offsets and upward pressure, were the
right numbers to rebase and then come up with the baseline starting off point, right?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think that's a fair start, Brennan.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. And then thinking about the clearing headwind, how
should we think about that rolling into next quarter? What's the right way to think about the revenue? Because I know
that – I think you had said at a conference that there might be some further headwind here in 1Q, maybe the timing

when the clients came off in 4Q might not have been fully reflected in the 4Q run rate. So how should we think about
that coming into 1Q from here?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think that's right. Maybe Brian Shea could take that. Brian?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, sure. I mean the clearing revenue fee pressure is really driven by a few large client
exits, primarily driven by the exit of Barclays and Credit Suisse from the U.S. wealth management market entirely,
which were two large Pershing clients. Barclays exited in the middle of the fourth quarter and Credit Suisse began their
exit in the fourth quarter, so they're partially out.
I think you'll see continued pressure on the fee revenue line in clearing services for the next few quarters. I think it'll be
partially offset by a couple things. We actually had a really strong new business year in clearing services in 2015. We
were benefited by the exit of a large clearing competitor from the market and picked up quite a few high quality clients.
Those clients tend to be less fee revenue-driven and they tend to be a little bit more balance sheet and lending-driven,
so that the growth they drive will partially offset the fee decline, but you'll see some of the growth in the NII instead of
the fee line.
And we also have pretty strong growth in the RIA custody and the prime business and Pershing's also going to benefit
immensely from the fee waiver restoration as rates rise, which will help the fee line as the Fed continues to move over
whatever period of time they act on. So in the meantime, we're focused on strong expense discipline in the clearing
business, and as Todd mentioned, we think we can keep the PTI flat in 2016, despite pressure on the fee line
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, Brian, thanks for that. So basically, are you saying that the revenue
headwind that we saw, X-ing out the new business wins, right, just focusing on that first, should sustain for another
couple quarters and then you've got the offsets that you highlighted picking up from there?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, partially offsetting that with NII growth and some of the fees from the JPMorgan
clients offsetting, but I think there'll be pressure on the fee line specifically for the next couple of quarters, and we'll
work hard to manage the expense to make sure the PTI impact is neutralized.
<Q - Brennan McHugh Hawken>: Okay, thank you.

We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Great. Good morning, everybody. So just picking up on the clearing question, just want
to make sure that we kind of put that question to bed. Are all the clients or all the transaction in the wealth management
space have sort of been announced over the second half of 2015, or are they kind of like reflected in the guidance?
Because I think some of them are closing later in 2016.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: So should we expect another kind of step down in fees in the second half of 2016, or
everything is kind of already reflected from the clients that exited in 4Q?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. No, so it's a good point. There has been another large U.S. wealth manager that's
announced the exit. It's another global SIFI that's announced their exit from the U.S. wealth management business. That
transition out will probably take place in the fourth quarter of 2016, so that's not positive. On the other side of that,
though, we continue to have a strong pipeline of new business in clearing services. And frankly, we have a number of
self-clearing firms that are considering outsourcing their clearing. So, I'd hope that we are able to attract some
significant new business that offsets that potential loss or that likely loss in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got it. Understood. Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. And then, Todd, shifting gears a
little bit onto the balance sheet. Looks like if you kind of look across the buckets on the yield side, doesn't seem like

many of them moved, I guess just because obviously the Fed hiked later in the quarter. Help us understand maybe just
kind of run rate of what the NIM we should look for starting 2016, assuming no further rate hikes, and kind of your
expectations for the balance sheet. Just kind of trying to right size NII outlook for 2016 versus 2015.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we would expect, Alex, modest growth. I think one of the frustrating things that
you've seen, the 25 basis point increase in short rates and long rates have actually come down. So the reinvestment
activity is not going to benefit with what we would have modeled for some percentage of the reinvestment. So we
would expect balances to come down a little bit, NIM to widen and overall net interest revenue to show a little bit of
growth.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask about the energy exposure in your C&I loan
book. I think outstanding's $500 million, but there's another $5 billion unfunded commitments. So I was wondering
maybe if you could characterize the customers you're lending to, speak to covenants or other protections against those
lenders drawing down on lines of credit if they get stressed, and then just generally, your sense of whether this
exposure is something to be concerned about.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, most of – almost all of the exposure in the energy sector is to investment grade
names. So, a lot of integrated firms. We do have some pipeline and refiners and there is a little bit of E&P, but that is to
very high quality names. So at this point, we think it's a pretty solid [ph] play (36:25). We might see some transitions in
credits, but I would not expect to see any losses.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay, helpful. Thanks. And then, at your Investor Day a little over a year ago, I think you
laid out the path to SLR compliance. I think you were targeting year end 2017. Since then, you've added 30 basis
points, I think the total you're hoping for is 250 basis points to 350 basis points of improvement. So, I wonder how
you're thinking about accelerating the path there as we get closer to the phase-in date and I think the biggest piece of
the plan was deposit reduction. So, what's the contingency plan, given that rates – I mean you said yourself that you
might not expect any more rate hikes, so there's no help there.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, so what we've seen to date, so if you look at the – you can't really look at the spot
balance sheet, you've got to look at the average balance sheet, because we do see some noise on year end on our
balance sheet. But it's average that drives the ratio. So, if you look in the quarter, we did see a $9 billion reduction in
balances in the quarter and that's a pretty quick response to the rate move that we had seen.
In addition, so far this year, it's probably down an additional $8 billion. So we would have estimated that we'd see
about a $20 billion reduction in the first move. And if we see more, we've indicated that would be in the 40 to 70 basis
point – excuse me, $40 billion to $70 billion type of range as we get to a little more normal rate.
If that doesn't happen, what we have done is we've prioritized the entire balance sheet and we might have to have some
actions against that for some of the less valued deposits. At this point in time, we don't think we need to rush into
compliance. We are building capital. We build about $800 million a year, even with 100% payout ratio. And if the
balance sheet does come down about – and we can do some other things actually to [ph] protect (38:19) the balance
sheet a little bit, we think we will grow ourselves pretty well into a reasonable rate without doing anything exceptional
to our clients.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Thanks so much.

We will take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi, good morning, folks. Just one more on the clearing, just to be clear on that. So I think,
Brian or Todd, you were saying, you expect pre-tax profit for the clearing business in total to be flat from 2015 to 2016.
Do I have that right?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That's correct, Brian.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Right.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Great.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And, Brian, if I could add there...
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yep.
<A – [0053N6-E]Todd Gibbons – The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.> Brian, if I can just add something there for
you. The clearing fees are about 12% of our total revenue, so that's what we're talking about. And it has been a decent
grower in the 5% to 6% range. So it's going to – I think the team has done a great job managing their expenses and
responding to the consolidation of the industry that we've seen here a little bit. So for a year, it might pause on its
growth.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Right. Great. No, understood. It was good color from Brian on the fee dynamics there, but
maybe if I can just dovetail into the money market fee waivers, obviously, 70% coming off of two hikes. What
percentage do you think you'll get at a full run rate on just the one hike, and do you really sort of need to need to wait to
get through 1Q and into 2Q to see that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes. I think it's – the beginning here, it's fairly linear. So, right now, the behaviors we're
seeing are consistent with what we had projected. So we're seeing it now.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay...
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: It didn't show up very much in the fourth quarter yet. We saw a little bit in the asset
management side and a little bit in the Corporate Trust side. Pershing tends to lag in the fee waiver abatement, and so
we do think that there'll be some acceleration into the first quarter.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Right. And then maybe just the – I know you give out the EPS drag from fee waivers, if you
can give that number for 4Q and what you think it might be for 1Q.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, we've indicated it's in the $0.06 to $0.08 range. And so, Brian, I'll let you do the
math, but we've indicated a 50 basis point move and I just indicated was linear, would reduce it by 7%. I don't have to
mess it up on the call here, you can figure that out now.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yeah. Fair enough. And maybe just then switching to the asset management business, maybe if
Curtis is there, if he can comment on the acquisition, I guess more broadly, on the potential for making more
acquisitions for the business, given the recent declines in valuations. And then if you can also just comment on
sovereign wealth fund exposure across the franchise.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Hey, Brian, it's Curtis. So first of all, we're very excited about the acquisition that we
announced yesterday afternoon of Atherton Lane, and it's consistent with the strategy that we've had in wealth
management, which is to go into a market. We actually have a team in San Francisco and in Palo Alto who are BNY
Mellon employees and have been there for some time in San Francisco and then about a year ago in Palo Alto. But then
to find a firm that fits culturally who has a great client base, as Todd said, 700 clients, very fast-growing economy and
have that firm fit culturally with what we're doing, meaning that they think about the entire holistic client need,
everything from financial plans to how they'd think about generational wealth transfer, using trust, insurance and then
obviously investments.

So we're going to bring to them the sixth largest asset management firm in the world and all of the banking capabilities
of BNY Mellon, and they are eager. A big part of what makes this work is that they're eager to transition a firm that
they've grown very nicely since 2005, really, to the next level and become part of a global franchise.
So we did this in Chicago with Talon in 2011, with I3 in Toronto in 2010, and acquisitions that precede that. It's pretty
much our strategy to get a toehold and then bring the full power of our institution to the clients in that region. And we
love that strategy. And to the extent that we can – in other MSAs, other markets where we think there's real opportunity
for what we can do for clients to grow our capabilities, we'd love to continue to look at those acquisitions. I will tell
you that we're extremely thoughtful about not just the terms and conditions of the acquisition, but also that the cultural
fit is there. And it takes some time to identify and ensure that we have that in place. So it's a pretty methodical process
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Do you see more opportunities, given the valuation declines? I guess I would say is your
pipeline increasing significantly?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yes. Yeah. So I think that we are certainly spending time looking for other opportunities
like Atherton Lane. So I want to balance this with yes, we would love to find other opportunities like that in other
markets, and we look at them all the time. One of the great things is we're connected. Brian talked about Pershing and
the rest of our company has a lot of insight into high quality RIA firms around the country.
So we're always monitoring it like a scouting report as to who would be a good fit, who culturally is positioned and,
yeah, we absolutely would love it. We also want to make sure that we execute, because we want to make sure every
time we do one of these, that it works for both the acquiring party and their clients.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay. Great.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: The acquiring party and their clients.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yeah. And just the sovereign wealth fund exposure in the institutional segment?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: It's been an interesting year. You've read, I'm sure, many articles about sovereign wealth
funds. At our Investor Day, we described that we were the second largest manager of sovereign wealth fund assets, so
we obviously have a lot of clients in this client channel – clients and assets. And I will tell you, and I think we
highlighted this at Investor Day, a significant portion of that is index assets.
Todd and Gerald both referenced our flows and a big portion of our outflows, both this quarter and this year, have been
in index-related assets where the fees are quite small. So we have absolutely – you can see our outflows in index for the
year, and without – [ph] may not (45:05) be appropriate to talk about any specific clients or client activity, but in line
with what you've seen from the industry.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Great. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Hey, good morning. Hey, Todd, on the core businesses, can you just talk about the – I know the –
ex the market impacts, the servicing business, ex securities lending, was a little soft. You cited in the press release,
activity. The wins this quarter of custody assets were pretty low also. Can you just talk as to what do you think, again,
ex the market impact, what's your outlook for servicing fee, core ex securities lending growth, and how much of a
weight was the lower activity on the line this quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay, well – and you also need to factor in the impact of the currency of the stronger
dollar because there are a fair amount of non-dollar revenues. So that's costing us somewhere between 200 basis points
and 300 basis points in revenues, but again...

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: On a year – not sequentially.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: [ph] A year. (46:15)
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sequentially, it's almost neutral. So it's not a big impact sequentially.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Ken, I think one way to look at it is revenue growth is a challenge. I mean, look at everyone
across the marketplace, trying to generate significant revenue growth is a challenge for everybody. We are winning in
the places that we want to. We would certainly like to deepen our client relationships and provide more services to
many of our existing clients, and we, I think, have a great solution set to offer. And so that's one of our key priorities is
doing more with an existing client base with a great set of value-added services and solutions.
But revenue growth is tough and that's why we've got to remain incredibly diligent on the expense side. And that
remains a focus and we still think we have more opportunities there. And that's what's really propelled our earnings
growth this year and it's going to be one of the reasons for our success in 2016. So, yes, it's a bit soft. We acknowledge
that. We're redoubling our efforts on our client relationships, but we've got to pay a lot of attention to the expense base
to deliver the earnings that you all are looking for and that we're looking for.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Yeah. And just on that point about operating leverage, again, the market environment's going to
make this a tough one to answer, but how much additional flexibility do you have on the expense base if the
environment doesn't quite pan out? Can you commit to getting operating leverage? I know it's tough given where the
start of the year is, but how much flexibility do you think you have on top of the actions taken to continue to ratchet
down expenses further?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Why don't I start that one and, Brian, you might add. Brian's really been leading a
significant component of our business improvement process. We still see a number of additional things that can
generate some additional cost benefits. I must admit that fruit's probably a little higher on the tree, but there's still a fair
amount of fruit. We're seeing our infrastructure cost continue to come down. We're using more automation tools. We've
got things like bring-your-own-device that Gerald alluded to. Some of these are smaller dollars versus others, and our
real estate strategy, I think, is paying off. We got ahead of where we thought we would be this year, as we moved out of
One Wall Street faster than we could, and that brought our guidance for expenses in occupancy space down, and we
reviewed our guidance because of that.
We also see other real estate strategies that could add a bit. We see opportunity in some of our market data, actually
probably find cheaper sources of market data and more appropriate sources and we've got better tools in place that
determine who's using what and how we can deliver better services that are less costly. I don't know, Brian, you have
anything to add to that?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, no, I would add, Todd, I think you and Gerald covered many of them already. But
our mentality on this is, is continuous improvement. So, we're going to keep driving this business improvement process
regardless of the market environment, whether it's worse or better. Even if rates rose 100 basis points, we'd still be
driving this because we think we can create sustainable shareholder value; so, all of the things that Todd mentioned.
We're excited about the potential from these three pilots in robotics and the ability to start to scale that impact in 2016.
The real estate portfolio, you know what we've done in New York, but that's actually a global process. So, we'll be
getting more yield from that over time. We've in-sourced a lot of application development. Our cost per unit for
development is better and our capacity has actually increased, so we see the opportunity to continue to do more on that.
We've talked about executing the private cloud. We've moved a significant amount of our legacy servers to a private
cloud environment, but we have way more to do still and that will create ongoing structural cost savings. We continue
to reduce our dependency on contract developers and temporary services and lower our people-related expenses. And
as you can see, even from the severance charge Todd took, we're executing a global location strategy. We moved 1,000
people to global delivery centers last year and I expect we'll do a similar amount in 2016. So, we continue to execute
every component of this process, and I think we have more value to leverage from this franchise.

One other part of this, which is enterprise team work which is that we're really collaborating more effectively between
investment management and investment services. A great example is the private banking partnership between
Pershing's broker dealer and RIA clients and our own wealth management group. We are now – we've established now
something like $2.3 billion in credit facilities for the clients of independent RIAs and broker dealers who are trying to
compete in the wealth management market, and that's creating some real lift for the Wealth Management business and
some real leverage for our clients, and it's another example of working differently.
<Q - Ken Usdin>: Perfect color. I appreciate it.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mike Mayo from CLSA.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: Hi. I wasn't sure about the answer to the last question. So, Gerald or Todd, do you expect to grow
revenues faster than expenses in 2016? I mean, I understand you're doing a lot of different things, but when you add it
all together, when you look out, can you commit to having that or can you not commit to it?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think, Mike, we do expect to grow expenses – excuse me, revenues faster than
expenses. But with this market disruption, we have to keep that in mind. The equity markets do have an impact on our
business. What we've indicated in the past, 100 basis point move in – 100-point move in the S&P 500 is worth about
$0.02 to $0.04 for us. And that assumes if it moves on average, from the beginning of the year. So, on average, it's
down 50 points. So, that would be – if the market continues to sell off, that could be a headwind. We will still target
trying to generate positive operating leverage, but there are market conditions where that will be impossible.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: So flat markets, flat rates, you'd expect to have positive operating leverage?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That's correct, Mike.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then just some of the ins and outs. On the expense side, I still don't understand why the
combination of custody platforms wouldn't provide you with some expense savings, and is that simply delayed, or I'm
thinking about that the wrong way? And, on the negative side you have the regulatory cost. That's the expenses, and
then the revenue side still with the asset servicing linked-quarter, it was – third to fourth quarter, it was down. And why
is that down? I guess that's some of the headwinds that you're probably thinking about here.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So, Mike, if you look at the expenses, almost every single category, with the exception of
total compensation which Todd explained, was largely affected by the severance cost in the fourth quarter; every single
category, our expenses are down. So, all of the things that we've talked about, whether it's custody platform,
transformations, or conversions, whether it's simplifying our operating structure, whether it's taking advantage of
technology and robotics, it's showing up in our numbers. It's showing up in every single line item. So I would dispute
your claim that it's not showing up in the numbers; it is. And so, I think you've got to look at it across every single line
item. Look at the positive operating leverage, the improvement in the operating margin. It's there, Mike.
<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then as far as the regulatory headwinds, which I guess you're managing and then on the
revenue side.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, the regulatory headwinds are included in our expense base. We're offsetting those
regulatory headwind costs with aggressive reductions in the operating expenses in all the other categories. So, yeah,
we're funding investments in resolution and recovery plans, better analytics, better CCAR process, better controls
across the company, improve risk management capabilities, all of that is being funded and we're still reducing the
operating expenses year-over-year and improving the operating margin of the company.
Now, on your question on investment services fees, in asset servicing in particular, yeah, it's a tough revenue
environment. And we have to up our game, engage with our clients even stronger than we have in the past, and really

<Q - Mike Mayo>: And then last follow-up, can you remind us how much asset servicing relates to fixed income
versus equities, because shouldn't you be impacted a little bit less than some of your peers?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we believe that we will be less impacted than most of our peers. We're probably the
reciprocal of what they are, somewhere between 35% and 40% equity and that would mean primarily fixed income and
money markets.

Okay. [Operator Instructions] We will now move along to Adam Beatty from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just one more on expenses. I
noticed that outside services came down pretty nicely year-over-year. If you could give some color on that in terms of
how much of that is sort of core services, like outsourcing, basically head count replacement, versus more traditional
pro services like legal and technology and the trends and the outlook there. Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. We are definitely trying to trend away from relying on outside services, typically it
costs substantially more than what we can do internally. We've even seen that on the legal side, as well as temporary
services that are provided in various functions. We follow it very closely. Any time somebody has been – outside
service has been around for a while, the supervisor of that service gets a notification, questioning why he's still around
and why we haven't internalized it. I don't know, Brian, you might want to comment, you've done a lot in the...
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, I think we're just, in general, on our major strategic projects and investments, we're
relying more on our own team and developing our own team whenever we think it's a sustainable need and a capability
we need, rather than rely as much on contractors, consultants. Part of that is also the ongoing IT application
development in-sourcing which is reducing contract consultant costs and actually, we think, improving our speed to
market and our actual development productivity at the same time. So, it's a variety of things, not one single thing, but
we're really focused on every part of these expenses.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: So it sounds like ex maybe some episodic things, there's room for further reduction there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Probably a little bit.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yes.

<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then turning to investment management and the flows,
specifically wealth management, the outflows came a lot from indexing, I assume that's somewhat institutional. In
wealth management, you mentioned $5 billion of active inflows, not sure how much of that was wealth management.
But what are you seeing amongst your clients now, and how are they reacting to the market? Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think it's exactly what you would expect it to be, which is a mix of the uncertainty. The
volatility has been very significant and, both – I think August really shocked people and then you got a little bit of a
recovery, and then the first part of this year has been challenging. People are trying to understand it, understand if this
is the beginning of something greater. We're talking to them a lot about the differences between now and the financial
crisis, banks have substantially more capital and are a lot less leveraged. There are certain – obviously, the China
impact is something everyone is really trying to understand, with everyone struggling for the data that can really be
insightful.
So, trying to help our clients understand what's happening is something that they're all interested in. I will tell you that
there also are many who have been, since the financial crisis, under invested. There's been – a lot of people who have
been more in cash, and we stress to them that having a solid investment plan, overall financial plan, is critical; being
too conservative is not a good thing and many of them have been.
So, I do think this will – we're seeing some people who are beginning to put money to work. They're scaling in. I
wouldn't say it's a – until volatility settles down, I don't think we'll see the dramatic shifts. I will tell you that flows in
the industry and we see – because we're in both investment management and investment services, see so much what is
happening. A lot of clients rebalanced when equity markets did well. And I do think that we will see people who
reduced their equity exposure earlier, they are absolutely going to rebalance in the other direction as markets decline,
they may wait from a timing perspective for things to settle down a bit and just make sure they understand what's really
happening with the economy.
The impact of lower energy prices, I still think there's a pretty significant lag effect on what it will mean for the real
economy, which would ultimately be positive. So, I think our clients are uncertain, but also interested in figuring out
whether this is an opportunity to add investment risk to their portfolio.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Excellent. That's great detail. Thank you very much.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Nicole, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. We'll take our final question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you and good morning. Can you guys share with us the – you've touched on this in past
calls, I believe, the blockchain technology, how you're pursuing that, and what the implications are for it longer term,
should it ever become a reality? What are the opportunities for you with it and what are the negatives that it could cause
your company?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. We are spending a lot of time and energy in different parts of the company on the
blockchain technology and where it can be applied. I think last quarter, we commented we have two pilot programs,
actively engaged internally. We're a participant in a couple of consortiums on blockchain technology. Interestingly,
we're hosting a Blockchain Technology Day next Monday, with our own technologist and outsiders exploring all the
different opportunities that we see and others see.
So, we're very actively engaged in the dialog and the concept of where it can be applied. I think there are some real
opportunities for us to be a disruptor to the existing infrastructure. I think it's going to take quite a bit of time to get
there, but we are not sitting back waiting. We are actively engaged in the dialog.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And when you say quite a bit of time to get there, are we thinking three years out, five years
out, or is it just too hard to say when it becomes – [indiscernible] (1:02:33) becomes fully functional.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, it's too hard to say. We're all very intrigued with it. We are. We're very intrigued with
the concept of it and how it could structurally change a lot of the processes we do. And by the structural change, i.e.,
reduce costs for us and our clients. I think it's going to take some time to get there, to become fully functional.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you. And then just coming back to the sovereign wealth funds, two questions on
that, or two parts – one question, two parts. One, the drop in the deposits in the foreign offices, was that attributed to
the sovereign wealth funds pulling money out? And second, what's the total dollar amount under management in the
quant funds with the sovereign wealth – your sovereign wealth business?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The drop in the deposits I don't think had anything to do with the sovereign wealth funds.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Gerard, the drop in deposits is consistent with what we thought would happen when rates
move and there were better alternatives that's been staying on our balance sheet for low yield.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I don't know if you can speak – we can't – I don't think we can speak...
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: We don't comment on the size of the assets under management for sovereign wealth funds,
specifically. But given that we're a significant player, we're seeing what the rest of the industry is seeing and that is
certain sovereign wealth funds are liquidating their assets and continuing to follow their social agendas and using
money within their own countries. So, we're no different than the rest of the industry in that regard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Sure. I agree. Okay. Thank you guys.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Gerard.
Gerald L. Hassell
All right. Well, thank you very much, everyone, for dialing in. We really appreciate it. If you have further questions,
Valerie and her team look forward to hearing from you. And I'm sure we'll run into all of you pretty soon. So, thank
you very much again, everyone.
