I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Ginter, Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.
Matthew Ginter
Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 business review. You'll see a list of
upcoming events and dates on slide two. We will hold our next Investor Meeting on Tuesday, December 16, at the

Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. The third quarter for 3M was marked
by a steady execution and strong growth delivered in a mixed global economic environment. For the fifth consecutive
quarter, we posted organic growth in all business groups and all geographic areas. Our team's execution also produced
raising margins and the highest quarterly sales in 3M history. At the same time, we made investments in research and
development and our commercialization capabilities to ensure long-term success.
Let me take you through a few highlights of the quarter. Earnings rose to $1.98 per share, up 11.2% year-over-year.
Sales were $8.1 billion at 3M record. Organic growth was 4% company-wide on top of 6% growth in last year's third
quarter. Leading the way with 5% growth was Health Care, a business that is pioneering medical advancements in
emergency rooms, hospitals and dental clinics around the world. Electronics & Energy grew a solid 4% with particular
strength in our electronics business. Industrial also grew 4% with a special encouraging growth in the United States.
Consumer delivered 3% growth including significant gains in our do-it-yourself business. Safety & Graphics also grew
3% led by our Personal Safety division. Organic growth was positive across all geographic areas paced by the United
States at 6% and Asia-Pacific at 5%.
I'm pleased that operating margins are very robust. Margins rose to 23%, up 1.4 percentage points year on year. All
business groups delivered margins greater than 22%, another company first. Margin expansion combined with 4%
organic growth is further evidence our portfolio management actions are delivering hard results. Free cash flow was
strong in the third quarter, allowing us to deploy more resources to enhance the values of our businesses. And we
returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
On September 1, 3M also completed acquisition of the remaining 25% of our Sumitomo subsidiary at a price of $865
million. And three weeks ago, I was in Japan to visit our team along with our biggest customers. We discussed the
growth opportunities in the market around infrastructure, healthcare, consumer, and other areas. Our 3M Japan team is
excited to grow into an even bigger and more profitable enterprise.
Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance. We executed well and delivered strong growth across the
company.
Nick will now take you through the details. Nick?
Nicholas C. Gangestad
Thank you, Inge, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide five, where I'll review the third quarter income
statement.
Q3 was a strong quarter, and we are on track to deliver the sales and income targets that we communicated entering the
year. The company continues to operate well, with a good balance of growth, margins, and cash generation.
Third quarter sales were an all-time record $8.1 billion, an increase of 3% year on year, with 4% organic growth more
than offsetting the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income rose 9% to $1.9 billion, and earnings per share rose 11% year
on year. We generated good productivity in Q3 and increased operating margins by 1.4 percentage points while
investing in important programs for the future.
I'll dig a bit deeper into the components of the third quarter margin improvement. Organic volume leverage added 20
basis points to third quarter operating margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling
prices contributed 80 basis points year on year. Underlying selling prices remained firm across many of our businesses,
supported by technology innovation and strong new product flow. Raw materials were again lower versus last year's
comparable quarter. Commodity prices remain steady, and our sourcing teams continued to create new opportunities to
reduce costs across the globe.

Lower pension and OPEB expense added 50 basis points to third quarter margins. Strategic investments reduced third
quarter margins by 40 basis points. This includes increases in new disruptive R&D programs, business transformation
and ERP costs, and restructuring.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 10 basis points, and the Treo acquisition was just slightly dilutive to
third quarter margins as we integrate that business. Inge also mentioned that we acquired the remaining 25% minority
equity position in Sumitomo 3M on September 1. But because that subsidiary was already being fully consolidated in
our results, it had no impact on operating margins. It was, however, $0.01 accretive to earnings per share in the third
quarter.
Finally, productivity and other items added an additional 50 basis points to margin year on year. Earnings were $1.98
per share, an increase of 11%. Foreign currency impacts reduced earnings by $0.02 a share in Q3 given the broad-based
strength of the U.S. dollar. And the higher tax rate reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. Average diluted shares
outstanding declined by 5% versus last year's third quarter, which added $0.10 to third quarter earnings per share.
Slide six outlines the details of our third quarter sales change. Worldwide, organic local currency growth was 3.9%,
with volumes up 3.2% and selling prices up 0.7%. We've now achieved 20 consecutive quarters of positive organic
sales growth. The Treo acquisition added 10 basis points to sales growth, and the stronger U.S. dollar reduced third
quarter sales by 1.2%. On an all-in basis, sales rose 2.8% versus the third quarter of 2013.
Organic local currency sales growth was positive across all major geographic areas, making this the sixth consecutive
quarter that we have done so. The United States outpaced all geographic regions in the third quarter, with organic local
currency growth of 6%. U.S. growth was led by Industrial at 8%, Safety & Graphics at 7%, and Health Care at 6%.
Asia-Pacific organic growth was 4.9% in Q3. Health Care and Electronics & Energy led the way with growth of 9%
and 7% respectively. Organic local currency growth was 7% in Japan or 3% excluding Electronics. China/Hong Kong
grew 4% organically in Q3 or 3% excluding Electronics against a challenging double-digit comp growth in last year's
third quarter.
EMEA posted organic local currency growth of 0.8% in the third quarter. Central-East Europe and Middle East-Africa
each grew in the mid-single digits while West Europe declined 0.5%. While we have seen pockets of slowing in some
West European countries, our teams there are executing well in the face of some economic headwinds. Organic growth
within EMEA was positive in Health Care, Safety & Graphics, and Industrial, but declined in both Electronics &
Energy and Consumer.
Finally, Latin America-Canada grew 0.4% organically, with Health Care leading the growth. Mexico generated
double-digit organic growth and Brazil was up mid-single digits. Venezuela remains challenging, but our team is
managing through the situation well, and the currency risks are under good control. Revenue was down in the third
quarter in Venezuela, which reduced organic growth across Latin America-Canada by six percentage points.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Turn to slide number seven. Free cash flow was strong in Q3, with 103% conversion versus
61% in last year's comparable quarter. Operating cash flow increased $560 million, driven by multiple factors,
including higher net income, lower working capital, lower pension contributions, and lower cash taxes. Year to date is a
similar story with 91% free cash flow conversion versus 76% in 2013. We expect full-year conversion will be in the
range of 95% to 100%, up from 90% to 100% previously.
Full-year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which is consistent with our
prior view. We continue to manage the company towards a better optimized capital structure. Our plan calls for
additional balance sheet leverage, which we'll use for two purposes. One, to expand our businesses, and two, to
increase cash returns to shareholders. We are executing on that plan in 2014 and beyond. For example, as Inge
mentioned on September 1st, we closed on the acquisition of the remaining 25% non-controlling interest in Sumitomo
3M for approximately $865 million. We have also paid $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of cash dividends
during the first three quarters of 2014, up $365 million versus 2013.

And in terms of buybacks, year-to-date gross repurchases were $4.4 billion, up $835 million year on year. We now
expect full-year 2014 repurchases will be in the range of $5.5 billion to $6 billion versus a previous expected range of
$4.5 billion to $5 billion. Net debt at September month end was $3.5 billion, up $2.3 billion versus year end 2013, due
to both higher debt levels and lower cash balances. Next, I'll go through the results for each of our business groups
starting with the largest business, Industrial.
Please go to slide number eight. We had a good third quarter in Industrial with sales of $2.8 billion and 4.2% organic
local currency growth. This strength was broad-based as nearly all businesses posted positive organic growth. Our
aerospace and commercial transportation business generated double-digit organic local currency growth and we also
saw a strong growth in 3M purification, automotive OEM, advanced materials, and industrial adhesives and tapes. The
United States was by far the fastest-growing region of the world for Industrial with 8% organic growth in the quarter.
Again, U.S. growth was broad-based with notable performances in three of our heartland businesses namely automotive
aftermarket, abrasives and industrial adhesives and tapes along with aerospace and commercial transportation and
automotive OEM. Elsewhere around the world, organic local currency growth was 4% in Asia-Pacific, 1% in EMEA
while Latin America, Canada declined 1%.
Industrials' organic growth continues to outpace that of worldwide industrial production and it's clear we are taking
share in some key industries. Automotive OEM is a good example where 3M's 7% organic growth in the third quarter
was three times the rate of global automotive builds. Third quarter operating income in Industrial was $660 million and
operating margins were 22.2%, up a full point versus the third quarter of 2013 and in line with recent quarterly trends.
Let's now look at Safety & Graphics found on slide nine. Third quarter sales in this business were $1.4 billion, up 3%
on an organic local currency basis. Organic growth was led by our Personal Safety business along with Traffic Safety
and Security systems. Sales declined organically in roofing granules. As with Industrial, the United States led all of the
geographic regions with 7% organic local currency sales growth in the quarter. Personal Safety products and Traffic
Safety and Security systems again led the way. Organic growth was 3% in EMEA, flat in Latin America, Canada, and
declined 1% in Asia-Pacific.
Operating income in Safety & Graphics was $340 million and operating margins increased 1.6 percentage points to
23.5%. Strong operating leverage along with the benefits from recent portfolio actions helped drive the increase.
Please go to slide 10. Our Electronics & Energy business continue to post solid results in the third quarter. Sales were
$1.5 billion and organic local currency growth was 4%. Operating income was $338 million and margins rose 1.8
percentage points to 22.5%. Organic local currency sales grew 8% on the electronic side of the business due to solid
and customer demand combined with successful spec-in wins at several OEMs. In Energy, organic local currency sales
declined 2% in the third quarter. The electrical markets business was flat in the quarter, while telecom and renewable
energy both declined year on year.
On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 7% in Asia-Pacific, 3% in the United States, and were up
slightly in Latin America, Canada. EMEA declined by 6% in the quarter. We have a strong group of businesses in
Electronics & Energy strengthened further in the past couple of years by a multiple actions to better align to our
customers and improve the portfolio. The team continues to execute well as evidenced by the growth and margin
improvement seen throughout the first nine months of this year.
Please turn to slide 11. Health Care had another very good quarter with sales of $1.4 billion and organic sales growth of
5.4%. Every Health Care business posted positive organic local currency sales growth led by double digit performances
in both drug delivery and health information systems. We also grew organically in all major geographies with
Asia-Pacific up 9%, the U.S. and Latin America, Canada up 6% and EMEA up 3%.
Health Care's third quarter organic sales growth was 11% in developing markets marking the 11th consecutive quarter
that we've grown at 10% or higher. Developing markets represent substantial opportunities for 3M and we continue to
build our capability to capitalize on future opportunities. Third quarter operating income in Health Care was $432
million and margins were strong at 31%. Including some modest dilution from Treo, which was acquired on April 1 of
this year.

Integration efforts are tracking to our expectations and the business is exceeding its sales and profit objectives. Last
year's third quarter margin of 32.1% included a 1.4 percentage point benefit from a gain on the sale of a non-strategic
asset. If I adjust for this year's acquisition and last year's one-time gain, margins increased 70 basis points year on year.
Health Care is a strong set of businesses and one of our highest investment priorities. Over the past several years, we've
made substantial improved investments to bolster our Health Care businesses in China, Germany, Poland, Thailand,
India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Last week, we announced a $58 million capacity expansion in the
United States to support growing demand for 3M medical tapes, dressings, surgical drapes and other wound care
products.
I'll wrap up with the Consumer Business Group found on slide number 12. Third quarter sales in the Consumer
Business Group were $1.2 billion with organic local currency growth of 3%. Consumer is home to several of 3M's
best-known power brands such as Post-it, Scotch, and Scotch-Brite. For the retail consumer, these are household names
but in fact, many other 3M brands are also enjoying success in the marketplace. Take for example, our Filtrete brand
filters, which significantly improve air quality in the home. This business grew double digits organically in the third
quarter as we gained share in the U.S. and expanded the category globally.
Our Command brand adhesives also generated double-digit organic growth in the quarter boosted by a strong
back-to-college season. College dormitories are growing market for 3M Command solutions because our products
eliminate the need to pound nails into walls when hanging pictures, decorations or other items. Filtrete and Command
help propel our do-it-yourself business to 10% organic growth in the third quarter. Sales in the Consumer Health Care
and Homecare businesses also grew organically in Q3 while stationary and office supply was down slightly.
Looking at the Consumer business geographically, organic local currency growth was 5% in Asia-Pacific and 4% in the
United States. Back-to-school sales were strong in the U.S. mass retail channel. Consumers' organic sales were down
slightly in both EMEA and Latin America, Canada. Operating income was $272 million with operating margins of
23.2%. That wraps up my review of the quarter, please turn to slide 13 where I will address our forward outlook.
Three quarters in, we are updating our guidance for the full year. We are expecting earnings to be in the range of $7.40
to $7.50 per share versus a prior expected range of $7.30 to $7.55 per share. With respect to organic local currency
sales growth, we are narrowing the range to 4% to 5% versus a previous expected range of 3% to 6%. Given recent
strength in the U.S. dollar, we are now estimating that foreign currency impacts will reduce sales by approximately
1.5%. Previously, we anticipated a 1% FX headwind.
From an earnings perspective, FX for the full year is now expected to be an approximate $0.15 per share headwind,
$0.10 of which has occurred in the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate $0.05 of FX headwind in Q4. Our tax
rate estimate is narrowed to 28.5% to 29%. And finally, as I mentioned previously, free cash flow conversion is
expected to be between 95% and 100% for the year, up from a prior range of 90% to 100%.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Inge for some additional comments.
Inge G. Thulin
Well thank you, Nick.
As I look across our enterprise, one eye is always on the microscope driving results day-to-day, months-to-months,
quarter-to-quarter and I remain very pleased with those results. The other eye is on the telescope, ensuring we are
investing for the long-term prosperity.
Three strategic levers are strengthening our foundation for the future. The first is portfolio management. I mentioned
our Japanese acquisition along with portfolio actions in Electronics & Energy. Earlier this year, we also realigned
divisions in our Safety & Graphics Business Group. And on Tuesday, we took action within our Industrial Business
Group. Our Personal Care division was merged into Industrial Adhesives and Tape division. This will increase
customer relevance, create broader research and development and manufacturing capabilities, boost efficiency, and

position the business for greater success.
The second lever is investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It generates unique solutions for
customers and raising value for shareholders. That is why research and development is in the center of our plan. We are
increasing research and development investment to about 6% of sales by 2017. We are also funding 26 product
platforms specifically aimed to create new sustainable growth through disruptive technologies. I'm very encouraged
that we are beginning to see initial product commercialization from some of those programs, in health care,
infrastructure, consumer, and other markets.
In September, we opened our 46th global customer technical center in the United Kingdom, which showcases the
breadth of our technology. Those facilities provide an ideal setting for our scientists to meet directly with customers
and explore solutions to their unique challenges. This is a very important element, as 3M is in the business of inventing
things that are both new and useful. These investments are critical to bolstering our competitive edge into the future.
The third lever is business transformation. This will allow us to deliver quicker and greater value to customers by
creating a more agile 3M. The backbone is the global ERP system. We are currently live in five countries. Most
recently we also successfully deployed our largest European distribution center in Jüchen, Germany. With each
deployment, we are learning more and using those lessons to refine our plans going forward. I remain encouraged by
our progress, and I will give you a further update on our December 16 investor meeting in New York.
To support our ERP system, we are also in the process of creating a standardized global business process. Ultimately,
this will leverage 3M's size and scale to drive productivity and improve service to customers. Those are the three
strategic levers propelling our forward view. Yet underpinning each strategy we adapt is the 3M team. Our company
has many core strengths. Chief among them is our people, their creativity, their skill, and their ability to execute no
matter the force of external headwinds.
I thank our entire 3M team for delivering a strong third quarter even in the mixed global economic environment.
Because of them, we are delivering consistent results today while remaining on track to meet our long-term targets.
Thank you for your attention.
With that, we now welcome all your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Thanks, everybody. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Inge, the numbers look great, obviously, but you did mention some macro concerns, particularly
in Europe. Is there any sense that you see, particularly in, now that you, at least have half the month of October through
that your customers are starting to get concerned about macro, some inventory destocking, any real slowdown, or is this
volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace maybe a little bit ahead of itself?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: We see what you see. And as you're calling out, you're talking about Europe a little bit, right?
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yes.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: So I think for us in the quarter, as you see in our result for West Europe, we slide down slightly
versus Q1 and Q2. There was, I would say, a small temper in Germany relative to the industrial sector. But the
consumer and retail piece in that market, meaning the domestic business, was still doing okay if you talk about
Germany as a country.

An interesting thing in Europe was that there are many countries there that have dragged the performance in West
Europe as of the last couple of years, like Iberia, Italy, Benelux, in some cases Alpine, and they show slight growth. So
even we saw growth in the UK as well. So I would say that we saw a slight decline in the industrial piece, but it's not
alarming by definition for us. And when we look upon data, when we look upon IPI growth, GDP growth, PMI growth,
et cetera, you can see a temper specifically in PMI that is related to the manufacturing space but is not a concern at all.
I would say also when we look upon West Europe in total, we had a slight decline in growth. If you pull all pieces
together, we can in fact pace that down to some utility businesses that are project-based that we had a comparison that
was a little bit tougher for us, and that business is coming back next year. So I would say that we got sidelined in terms
of West Europe if you combine it with total international.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: And, Inge, how about China? We see good and bad over there. Last time I was there, it seemed
like half the businesses were fine, half not fine, but your business in China I think if my notes are right has been
slowing a bit the last several quarters if I back into it. Are you seeing anything there that causes concern?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: We look upon the same metrics as I talked about for Germany, so IPI, GDP, PMI, et cetera.
And when I look upon that for China, it looks actually slightly better than the figures I talked about for Germany. So
for us, we had a 4% growth in total. If you exclude Electronics, it was 7%. So we are mid to high single-digit base
business, and that is where we have been for the last, I would say, one to 1.5 years.
So for me when I look upon China, looking forward, even if they are building out, as we all know, they are building out
a domestic business that is good for 3M with our Consumer and Health Care business, and even if there's a little bit
pressure on their export business, I would say for us, we see now us to be in mid to high single digits, and it's very
consistent for the last couple of quarters. So it's not – from that perspective looking forward, it's not an alarming figure
for me.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, very helpful. I'll pass it on. Congrats, guys, and good luck.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you very much.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ramanan Sivalingam>: Hi. Good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Ramanan Sivalingam>: Inge, good morning. Inge, a very, very strong margin quarter obviously, the best I think
since 2010. As we go through Q4 into 2015 segment wise, where do you see upside or downside to margins?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: We would talk more in December, December 16, relative to 2015. And as you can see, we have
improved this year very much in Electronics & Energy. That was based on the plan right? So you recall that business
and we go back now a couple of years, we have done a lot in that business in order to improve our performance, both in
terms of growth and margins. So you have seen that we constantly have moved them upwards. And we have said for
this year that they should come closer to 20%, maybe not the whole way to 20% for a year, but that is where they will
be. And you also know that three of the businesses are basically on corporate average in terms of margin and then you
have health care that is slightly higher I would say.
So you will see us be able to continue the work we're doing in our portfolio and so forth, but I don't know that I can at
this point in time call out someone. I think you look upon it. It's very robust and broad-based now which is good for us.

<Q - Ramanan Sivalingam>: Sure, that's very helpful. And then, may be one quick follow-up. This move we see in
energy space, does it have any impact that you can see on your energy business or on your raw material side?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Are you specifically talking about oil prices?
<Q - Ramanan Sivalingam>: Exactly.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Ram, there's a portion of our raw materials not a significant portion that are based on
oil prices. Right now, we don't expect a significant impact from that. If we do look forward into the coming year we've
had a year, a couple of years where raw materials have been a tailwind to us and we do expect that to continue into
2015.
<Q - Ramanan Sivalingam>: Understood, thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question/observation, if we net out productivity and investment, it seems that we have
turned positive for the first time since I think, Inge, you have become this company's CEO, and I'm just wondering...
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Positive in terms of what?
<Q - Andrew Obin>: We find that out the margin impact, right?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Okay. Yes, you mean that? Okay.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Or investment and productivity, right?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yes. Yes. Yes.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: It turned quite negative in 2012 and then it has been negative in its first time but it's now a
contributor.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And I'm just wondering, is that sustainable or do we revert back to being negative as you
continue to invest for repositioning?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Andrew, there are several things driving that productivity that you're noting. With the
growth we're seeing, we're seeing improved factory utilization. But also what we're seeing in our productivity
improvement is the result of our prioritization and portfolio management, that you are seeing a difference there. Our
business model is to drive those productivity improvements and as we talked about with our strategic investments to
invest that to improve our capability going forward.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Right. But do we think we're going to go back to sort of where it's a driver margin or do you
think it can actually turn positive with sustainable as positive or neutral?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Andrew, I don't see us going back into negative productivity with the current
economics situations we're facing. I see it continuing neutral to slightly positive but some of that consumed by our

continued strategic investments.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Sure. The second question, just can you, guys, give us more color on Brazil? Because it's just –
it's an area we get a lot of questions from investors. It seems to be a concern but you keep posting positive numbers.
Can you just give more color on industrial versus consumer businesses and if you're seeing any sort of yellow flags?
You keep telling us you guys are going to do okay. I'm believing you keep doing okay, but any color will help.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yes, we were positive in Brazil this quarter and as you probably recall, last quarter was more of
a concern. So, we actually turned more positive in this quarter. We had the 4% organic local currency growth, and by
the way, we are at 15% organic local currency growth in Mexico. So I would say when you look upon it, we have a big
industrial business down there and they grew at the average of the company.
So I see Brazil was type of average in terms of the growth, type of mid-single-digit for this quarter and my own
prediction is it will be slightly better as we move ahead. Now when you talk about some others and their performance
and so forth, I cannot comment for that but I can tell we have been in Brazil since 1946 as we have probably talked
about before so we have a very solid organization there that where we have all function in place. We have a strong
manufacturing footprint in order to deliver in that local market. We have a very capable research and development
organization. And we have a commercialization on that we, as you know, always go in with first.
So I think one of the success factors for us is we have all functions in place in Brazil and been there for a long time.
Know the market, know the culture, we're able to develop solutions for their market and produce it there in their home
country. So I think that's maybe one differentiator for us versus some other people but we saw a slight uptick in this
quarter versus last quarter and very happy with that business and I'm more optimistic moving forward than opposite.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Fantastic. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Hey. Thanks and good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: I guess impressive margin performance. That one point forward be even higher I guess if you
– we exclude that health care gain as well. But I'm trying to just maybe understand what's implied in the margin side. I
know you don't want to talk about 2015 but at least the fourth quarter. In terms of what you're expecting for those
dynamics on that breakout chart that you gave us on page five, I mean how should we be thinking about some – how
those – any major changes and any of those pieces might look over the next quarter anyway?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: As I look out in the next quarter, we expect still some continued benefit on price raw
materials. Pension of course will continue as a benefit and productivity probably still continuing as a benefit. FX right
now, which was fairly neutral on the third quarter, I think it's more likely to think of that as a negative in fourth quarter.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay, all right. And the other question is, I guess over a long period of time, various
management and 3M have talked about the sustainability of health care margins. And we've often heard about whether
that's in the mid-20s%, high-20s%, low-30s%. Inge, maybe you just provide a little bit of your perspective there.
Should we really be thinking at this point that there's no reason to believe that you can't sustain R&D investments, sales
investment and still deliver those kinds of margins? Or is there pricing pressure in some of the various developed
countries that is down to make that more challenging?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, high-20s% or 30s% or low-30s%, they are very good. And we have a very effective
model and we are very confident that the solutions that we are providing both in the developed world and the

developing world, will let us continue to be competitive not only in the marketplace in terms of market share but also
due to our capabilities in manufacturing, which is a very strong side for us to have manufacturing capabilities that is
holding our cost on a very low and competitive position. So, if you think about the health care space generally, for
many, many decades there will always be pressure in those markets. I can recall myself when I lived back in Europe
early 1990s and so forth there was this German Health Care Reform Act. It was exactly what is going on from time to
time in countries.
So we are used to be able to scale and leverage our businesses as we go ahead. So I'm not overly concerned about us
being able to maintain margins at the very high level. Now we are continuing to invest and you've seen and when you
look upon our mix, 75% of our business in health care is in developed economy and only 25% in developing, and the
growth will come there over time and we are able to with new product and technical solutions, able to put new price
points based on the evidence of improved customer satisfaction in that segment. So it's a good space for us and we
continue to invest and we are very, very local in all those markets and domestic market, local market is good for us. We
know how to do that.
<Q - Steven Winoker>: Okay, fantastic. Just one point of clarification also, based on your Venezuela comment, so just
to be explicit, Latin America, Canada would've been 6.4% ex-Venezuela. Is that – did I understand that correctly?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: You understand that correctly.

Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So first question is on free cash flow and the balance sheet. Nick, maybe can you provide a
little bit more detail on the strong free cash flow conversion this quarter? I mean was there anything one-time like an
inventory flush that helped it. And then on the balance sheet, specifically, you guys called out an increase of $1 billion
in buyback. Is a net buyback also increasing by $1 billion?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, a couple questions there. First of all on the free cash flow, no, there is not one
particular thing that's one that up. It is a combination of several things. Good inventory management, continuation of
low needs to be funding a strong pension, good CapEx spending in line with our expectation. It's really a combination
of several things that are resulting in that 103% free cash flow conversion we saw this quarter.
To your second question, the $1 billion raise on top and bottom, and top and bottom of the range on gross share
repurchases, that $1 billion would also apply to the net share repurchases range too.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. That's helpful, and then maybe staying on the balance sheet for a second. Inge,
perhaps you can provide a little color on the M&A environment. Clearly, you got the Sumitomo deal done. Maybe you
could talk a little bit about the pipeline, what you're seeing out there today?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yes, the pipeline is good for us as we look upon it. We have done a couple of acquisitions
during the last 12 months as we talked about. Sumitomo was one that maybe you guys were not thinking so much about
before we did it, but it was a very good one if you look upon the financials there, and we did Treo which was a smaller
one. And as Nick said, we are executing that very, very well actually ahead of both top and bottom line relative to
expectation.

So every business group has a good robust pipeline and we are looking upon them. I think the important thing for us
when we look upon them, we need to make sure that first of all, it fit into our portfolio now that is categorized in terms
of where we would like to go. And then also the four fundamental strength of 3M, which is around technology,
manufacturing capabilities, brand and the global capabilities, so we need to make sure that those four fundamentals are
direct linked in so we can drive additional value as fast as possible when we do them.
So I would say the pipeline is okay. The multiples are maybe too high based on how we think about it today. And as
you know, the primary strategy for us is organic local currency growth and that is why we are beefing up the
investment in research and development. And when I look upon what we are delivering from an organic local currency
perspective and done now for quite some time in the range of, as you know, we have our 4% to 6%. I'm happy with that
and I think that's one of the things we have to remain focused on; that acquisitions would be complementary and they
should be strategically important, and we should be able to drive value immediately for us and for you.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe if I could sneak one more in on the Electronics & Energy
margins that the margins the last three quarters have been incredibly good. So maybe talk about the sustainability of
what you're seeing in that specific business.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: So first of all, we have to go back and think about what we did in that business. We started by
realigning those businesses and reduced a number of touch points out to the customers. And we did that, it's two years
ago now since we realigned that organization and formed an organization that did a couple of things: first of all, be able
to touch to end markets; be able to connect back to our technology platforms; and respond much faster with solutions to
a very fast-moving market, so I think that was a key element. And we also made sure that we could get better asset
utilization as we aligned the businesses. And as you know, that will also then drive productivity in the organization
structure, et cetera. The business have gone since it was formed over two years ago I think from 15% – 17% and now
we're at 15% – 17%. I think we started at 17% this year. We're attaching closer to 20%, as we have said, for the year.
That business by definition is a little bit more volatile than the other businesses for us, but our expectation here at 3M
and on that business is that they should be part of almost close to the average of the company as we move ahead. So I
think we are at a much better place today based on the streamlines work we had done around the organization structure,
which all have been to the benefit for the customer in terms of responsiveness and for us relative to asset utilization.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.

Our next question comes from the line of Ajay Kejriwal of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Ajay.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: So U.S. really strong here, we actually see acceleration. It looks like you had 2.6% in first
quarter, 4.5% second, and now 6%. And I guess it's not easier comps because you had a really good quarter last year as
well. So, Inge, maybe share thoughts on what's driving this? What are you seeing broadly? How much of this growth
here is end market versus some of the work you're doing? And might this be some restocking that could be
contributing?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: First of all, the business, if you look upon our businesses, we had good growth in all of them,
the five business groups in the United States, led by Industrial. So Industrial had 8% growth in the United States, but
you had also Health Care of 6% and you have Safety & Graphics of 7%, so very strong robust growth. In our view, it's
not build of inventory in the channels as we can see it. The economy has improved and we are able to capitalize on that.

Now if you think about what we have done at 3M, and I don't know if you recall that, but let me take you back 2.5
years, more than 2.5 years when we start to refocus our U.S. organization. We had at that point in time, very much an
organization that the many functions were global versus total accountability and responsibility relative to execution on
the United States subsidiary, if you remind that discussion. And that work started actually in May of 2011 and have
continued since in terms of making sure that there is a specific execution arms for every division in the United States,
as well as we have had in Germany and Japan and Chile and Russia, et cetera.
So I think there are two elements into it as I reflect on it. One is that we are capitalizing on the economic situation in
the United States. And number two, I believe that we also have moved our organization to a much more focused
execution model in the United States so it's both and it's broad-based as I said. We have business here growing 6%, 7%,
8% in the United States in the core, so that's very, very good. And we have seen a tick-up here shortly, as you said.
From Q1 to Q2 to Q3, we see an uptick in the growth in the United States.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Excellent, that's very helpful. And then, Nick, maybe on the tax rate, so it's gone up a little bit
here. I guess part of it is mix. But how should we think about the trajectory as you implement some of the planning
initiatives, say, into next year?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, every quarter, as you can imagine, there are puts and takes that caused the rate to
fluctuate some up and down. We had some benefits third quarter last year not repeating. We also had a one-time
expense this quarter actually related to your more long-term question, a one-time charge related to the establishment of
our distribution center that we set up in the EMEA region. And so as you think about this long term, we've guided to
expecting a 27% tax rate by 2017, and we see ourselves on track to that.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good morning, just a couple things. I know you don't want to get into a big discussion about
next year, but with all the global gyrations, I thought maybe some of the non-operational things you could at least give
us a little insight on, right? State of the globe maybe is anybody's guess. But pension has kind of come back to the fore,
is possibly an issue for companies, and we've got this mortality table dynamic out there. So I'm wondering if you could
give us a little bit of color there, if there's anything to think about. And then just on FX too, I mean, we can all kind of
try to work through our own guesstimate, but is there anything to be aware of for 3M on how you're hedging or
translation versus transaction, to just kind of be mindful of as we try to think about what next year looks like?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, Jeff, a couple things. Of course, you know we'll share full details in December on
many things. But for a couple that you're asking about, I think they're both worthy of mention right now. First of all, on
the second part of your question on FX, with the movement we've seen in the U.S. dollar in recent weeks, our estimate,
if we were to take FX rates as they exist right now, is that year on year in 2015 we expect about a $0.10 headwind on
earnings per share. That's – and that's after hedging impact, and in comparison as to a $0.15 headwind that we're
expecting in 2014.
On your first part of your question on the pension, multiple factors going into that. The asset returns that we're
experiencing this year, the discount rate expectation, and the mortality table. If I take all three of those in combination,
we're looking – we're estimating it, at least a $100 million headwind going into 2015 on earnings per share – on our
earnings next year. I think that covers what you're asking, Jeff.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yes, it does, and maybe just one more and I'll move on. I think your tax rate has crept up this
year in your guide because you were anticipating the extenders and everything, and it looks like that's not happening.
But should we expect any tax rate headwinds? And I kind of ask the question in the spirit of this U.S. strength. Is there
any kind of move in the mix of your earnings that are actually tax rate negative that we should be thinking about, or
anything else that's idiosyncratic to 3M that may affect the tax rate?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Yes, Jeff. The tax rate is impacted by our mix of profits we earn around the world. Our
current guidance of 28.5% to 29% takes into account that current mix we're expecting for 2014. And on the extenders,
we currently are still building that into our estimate for 2014 and if it doesn't pass, that would likely put us at the high
end of the range that we've talked – that I've talked about.

<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Clearly some very good execution against the tougher forex and global environment out
there. The margin was definitely stronger than we were expecting. I guess in the context of what I see here is kind of a
75% incremental margin year-over-year, and the thing that kind of stands out the most, obviously, is this productivity
line. Utilization I kind of understand. What do you mean by portfolio management exactly? What is that?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Portfolio management, Steve, is some of the actions we've been taking as part of our
strategic investments to in some cases combine businesses for efficiency and better relevance to our customers and as
well as some restructuring expenses that we've taken. That – when we say portfolio management, in that regard that's
what I'm talking about.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: So it's not like a year-over-year – this is like blocking and tackling on cost take-out from
business combinations?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Exactly.
<Q - C. Stephen Tusa Jr.>: Okay. And then just in the fourth quarter here I guess, it seems like a pretty steady state
organic growth you're guiding to; any kind of movement around the various pieces of the business geographically in
the fourth quarter?

for the year and we feel confident around that.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Good morning. Just on – Nick, you mentioned $100 million for the pension at current discount rate.
Does that include mortality tables because I get $100 million just with discount rates, but you mentioned mortality
tables as well?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Nigel, that's taking three things into account: us adopting the new mortality table; a
roughly 50 basis point drop in our discount rate; and the asset returns that we have experienced and are expecting to
experience for 2014.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, that's very helpful, thanks. And then obviously the margin expense has been discussed ad
nauseam so far. If I just dig into the next layer, looking at the SG&A as a proportion of sales down I think about 70
basis points year over year and R&D flat, and so I'm wondering. Given that global IPI has come in a little bit weaker
than we'd all expected, is there any element of just putting them back a little bit on growth investments, a bit more
action on cost control at this point just given the movements we see in our SG&A and R&D?
<A - Nicholas C. Gangestad>: Nigel, what we're seeing on the movement there is function of our normal drive on
productivity. It's not really a change in our trajectory on our growth investments that we're making. Those are
continuing. We are year on year seeing a pension benefit that's impacting SG&A. And then to the later point I made,
the portfolio management where we've been taking some restructuring actions, we're starting to see some of the
benefits of those manifest in our SG&A expenses.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, that's great. And then finally, Microchip born, if you like, in the electronics end markets
earlier this month. Are you seeing any weakening at all in those end markets for 3M?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: No, we did not see that at all. So our Electronics business did very well. I think we called it out
with 8% organic local currency growth, so we didn't see anything on that. I think the external data at least going back to
Q2 was indicating then that market went sideway overall. So now then it's for you if you in that segment and depending
who you are in that segment, then is coming down to execution, make sure that you capitalize on the market overall but
based on our portfolio we didn't see that.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, thank you very much, guys.
