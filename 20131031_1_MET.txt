Welcome to the MetLife's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will
conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's obligations and
financial results in the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ
materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including
those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in

Thank you, Marla, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2013 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly
financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable

GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net
investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant
impact on GAAP net income.
Now, joining me this morning on the call are: Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and
John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today
to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including: Bill Wheeler, President of Americas;
Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another good quarter. Third quarter 2013
operating earnings were $1.5 billion, up 6% over the third quarter of 2012 and operating earnings per share were $1.34,
a 2% increase over the prior year period.
Growth on a per share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of
Alico. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter. Operating earnings exceeded our plan, but were down from
the level reported in the second quarter. As anticipated, certain favorable developments highlighted in the second
quarter did not repeat in the third quarter.
For example, we said on the second quarter earnings call that variable investment income was expected to decline in
the third quarter. Pre-tax variable investment income was $236 million in the third quarter versus $312 million in the
second quarter, a reduction in operating earnings of $0.04 per share. Despite this decline, investment margins were
favorable again this quarter. The average investment spread across all U.S. product lines was 221 basis points, which is
in the middle of the approximately 200 to 250 basis point range of the past few years.
MetLife's investment spreads have been resilient, despite a prolonged period of low interest rates. This performance has
resulted from effective asset liability management, good variable investment income and income from derivatives,
many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low interest rate scenario. Our strategy to
right-size the Variable Annuity business and grow emerging markets was evident in the third quarter results. Variable
annuity sales were down 41% from the prior year period, while emerging market sales rose 21% in our Europe, Middle
East and Africa segment and 4% in Latin America. Growth in Latin America was below trend, as a result of a large
case sale in the prior year period. Excluding this large case, sales growth would have been 11%.
In addition to higher sales from existing businesses, our grow emerging market strategy will benefit from three recent
developments. The first, our acquisition of AFP Provida in Chile, will have an immediate positive impact on earnings.
The other two, a start-up operation in Vietnam and a representative office in Myanmar, are consistent with our
long-term strategy to expand MetLife's footprint in Southeast Asia. We closed on the acquisition of Provida, the largest
pension provider in Chile, on October 1. Our accretion estimate is roughly $0.15 per share in 2014, consistent with the
outlook we provided when the deal was announced in February. Accretion in 2013 will be less than anticipated,
because the deal closed two months later than we had assumed. As a result of this transaction, MetLife's earnings from
emerging markets are expected to increase from 14% of total company earnings to 17%, putting us well on the way to
our 2016 goal of 20%.
In late September, we signed an agreement with the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, or BIDV, to
establish a Life Insurance joint venture in Vietnam. This joint venture with Vietnam's third-largest bank includes an
exclusive bank assurance distribution agreement to sell MetLife products through BIDV's 120 branches and 500
transaction offices. In addition, on October 7, we received approval from the regulatory authority in Myanmar to
establish a representative office in the country. While these developments in Southeast Asia are immaterial for earnings
in the near-term, we are excited about the long-term potential in these fast-growing Southeast Asian markets.

Let me now turn to a discussion of risk and return. With upward moves in equity markets and interest rates, we have
been asked recently if better return prospects in variable annuities increase our appetite for this business. Given this
question, it is timely to provide perspective on how we think about risk and return overall at MetLife. We know we
must accept risk to earn an appropriate return for our shareholders, but determining the type of risk is a critical
management decision. Relative to a few years ago, we have been actively diversifying MetLife's risk profile. Our
strategy to grow emerging markets and shift the sales mix away from market-sensitive products to protection-oriented
products should translate to a more balanced risk profile. Less concentration of risk and reduction in so-called fat-tail
risk should result in a lower cost of equity capital. A lower cost of equity capital, coupled with targeted ROE
improvement, should be positive for our valuation over time.
We want to limit our exposure to any one risk factor, even if current returns are attractive in the related line of business.
For example, while we are pleased with new business returns in variable annuities, we have to be mindful of the size of
our Inforce business when we establish our risk budget for future sales. While balance sheet risk is a primary
consideration for capital-intensive products, such as variable annuities, we think that earnings volatility is a primary
risk factor for protection products, and that political risk is a primary consideration for emerging markets.
For protection products, policyholder claims will sometimes exceed pricing expectations and cause an earnings
shortfall. For example, this quarter, we had below-planned underwriting results in Group, Voluntary & and Worksite
Benefits and a reserve increase on Group Disability contracts in Australia. While protection-oriented businesses may
miss earnings from time-to-time, we believe that these businesses pose modest balance sheet risk relative to more
market-sensitive capital-intensive products. Furthermore, returns are very attractive in a number of our Protection lines
of business. For example, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits is one of our highest return segments, even with less
favorable underwriting performance this year.
For emerging markets, political factors will sometimes generate earnings headwinds. Recent examples would be the
potential loss of future earnings related to proposed changes in Poland's pension system, which we discussed on the
second quarter earnings call, and fiscal developments in Mexico, which John Hele will discuss later on this call. We are
willing to accept political risk in emerging markets, because we believe this risk is diversifiable and because the
products sold in these markets generally have a more favorable risk-return profile and growth outlook than products
sold in developed markets. Importantly, a balanced approach to risk should produce better and more predictable free
cash flow, which is a critical driver of shareholder value.
Next, I'd like to provide a brief update on U.S. regulatory matters, which impact the level and timing of capital
management. As we discussed last quarter, MetLife remains under Stage 3 Review by the Financial Stability Oversight
Council for potential designation as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution, or SIFI. While we do not
believe that MetLife is systemically important, we continue to make the case to policymakers that applying
bank-centric rules to the business of insurance would constrain our ability to issue guarantees and increase the cost of
financial protection for consumers. In light of Prudential Financial's decision not to challenge its SIFI designation in
Federal District Court, I suspect you may be wondering what MetLife intends to do. Although it is too early for us to
make that decision, we are not ruling out any of the available remedies under Dodd-Frank to contest a SIFI designation.
Finally, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing plans for our December investor call. We are taking a different
approach this year and will no longer give earnings per share guidance. Instead, the call will provide information that
should improve the market's understanding of MetLife's businesses, including our outlook over a multi-year period. I
do not believe that we should continue with a practice, solely because it is the way it has always been done. After
careful study and deliberation, we have determined that EPS guidance no longer makes sense. Others in the Financial
Services industry seem to share this view. Half of our North American peers and most of our global peers do not
provide earnings guidance. In addition, the largest U.S. banks do not provide earnings guidance.
Our new approach for the December call will be consistent with our internal emphasis on long-term strategic and
financial goals. And it should shift the discussion to our business model, which is the real driver of shareholder value
over time. Also, it is difficult to predict earnings for life insurers with large capital market-sensitive businesses, so
guidance has historically had limited value. While we are rebalancing our business mix, we will still have meaningful

exposure to the capital markets for the foreseeable future. We will continue to provide the investment community with
our view of run rate earnings, along with important earnings sensitivities. In addition, we will increase transparency by
expanding our discussion of key financial metrics and business drivers. In total, all of these inputs should create a more
informed view of MetLife's future prospects.
In closing, let me say that, after several consecutive quarters of solid performance, and results this year that are above
plan, we feel very good about our fundamental business prospects.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance
margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and
capital. As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and operating
earnings per share of $1.34, up 2% year-over-year.
This quarter included three notable items. The first relates to our Group Insurance business in Australia. As Steve
referenced, we have strengthened Group Total and Permanent Disability, otherwise known as TPD, claim reserves in
Australia, which reduced operating earnings by $57 million, net of reinsurance, or $0.05 per share. Our decision to
increase the TPD reserve by 45% this quarter was based on the review of our own recent claims experience and
consideration of the worsening trend for the industry. We believe there are several factors driving this trend, including
economic stress, increased claim size and greater awareness of benefits.
The second notable item resulted from our annual actuarial assumption review, which we accelerated from the fourth
quarter to the third quarter to be in line with our annual goodwill testing. While there was no charge related to
goodwill, there was a modest above and below the line impact from the assumption review. The portion related to
operating earnings was a favorable $28 million, or $0.03 per share. However, the total impact, including the favorable
impact to operating earnings, was a $69 million reduction of net income.
Although we had various assumption changes in the quarter, the only meaningful update was in retail annuities.
Assumption changes in retail annuities resulted in a $41 million increase in operating earnings and a $48 million
reduction of net income. The positive impact above the line primarily related to an increase in some of our persistency
projections and lower expenses. Higher persistency is a positive for operating earnings, because of higher expected
base contract fees, but can be a negative for net income, because of higher potential claim from living benefit
guarantees. We have made no further changes to our GMIB dynamic lapse function and emerging experience is still
consistent with the change that we made last year.
The third notable items was in our P&C business. We had lower than budgeted catastrophe losses of $14 million after
tax and a favorable prior-year reserve development of $7 million after tax. Therefore, the total benefit to operating
earnings was $21 million, or $0.02 per share.
Turning to our bottom-line results, third quarter net income was $942 million, or $0.84 per share, and included net
derivative losses of $355 million after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was driven primarily by three items
that we consider to be either non-economic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment: number one, an increase
in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the
British pound and euro; and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program. Changes in
interest rates in the quarter contributed about 60% of the net derivative loss, while foreign currency and MetLife's own
credit impact combined for most of the remaining balance. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.99 at
September 30, up 2% from $47.20 at June 30.
Turning to margins, underwriting was mixed, but generally unfavorable again this quarter. The mortality ratio in Group
Life was 90.3% in the quarter, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 88.1% and at the top end of the target range of
85% to 90%. The less favorable mortality was driven by large claims in Group Universal Life and Variable Universal

Life.
The mortality ratio in Retail Life was 73.1%, better than our expectation and the 91.3% ratio in the third quarter of
2012. This result was due to favorable direct claims experience in both Variable and Universal Life and traditional Life.
However, the benefit accrued more to reinsurers than MetLife the quarter because of the nature of the claims. We
expect both the direct mortality ratio and the percentage of claims reinsured to return closer to plan levels in the fourth
quarter. As a reminder, useful rules of thumb are a 1% point change in the mortality ratio equals to a quarterly
operating earnings impact of $8 million to $10 million for Group Life and $2 million to $3 million for Retail Life.
Retail Life underwriting margins in the quarter were not as favorable as the direct mortality ratio would suggest,
partially because of the reinsurance impact and adverse experience in Individual Disability.
The non-medical health benefit ratio was 90.5%, up two percentage points from the prior year quarter of 88.5% and just
above the top end of the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary driver for the increase in the ratio was weaker
underwriting results in Group Disability due to higher severity. Incident rates were generally in line with the prior year
quarter and plan. As a reminder, a 1% change in the non-medical health benefit ratio equates to an operating earnings
impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis.
In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 92.6% for Retail and 90.2% for Group.
Year-over-year results were better in Retail and somewhat weaker in Group. Overall, as mentioned earlier, catastrophes
were lower than budgeted in the quarter by $14 million, or $0.01 per share. The combined ratios, excluding
catastrophes, were 86.3% in Retail and 87.5% in Group.
Next, let me turn to investment spreads. As Steve noted, investment spreads have remained strong and within the range
of the past few years. However, we did experience a sequential decline in three of the four product spreads reported in
our quarterly financial supplement, with the simple average declining 23 basis points including variable investment
income and eight basis points excluding variable investment income. In the third quarter, pre-tax variable investment
income was $236 million, or $153 million after DAC and taxes, slightly below the mid-point of our 2013 quarterly
guidance range. Variable investment income was down from the second quarter, which was at the top end of our
guidance range, primarily due to weakness in hedge fund performance and a return to more normal private equity
returns, partially offset by higher bond pre-pays.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.3% in the quarter versus 24.4% in the year-ago period.
Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 23.6%
versus 23.8% in the year-ago period. We are pleased with this performance, as it reflects progress in our strategic goal
to reduce gross expenses by $1 billion and net expenses by $600 million. Through nine months of 2013, gross expense
saves were $394 million, while net saves were $269 million, after adjusting for reinvestment of $28 million and
one-time costs of $97 million.
I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter and focus on areas where our results seemed to differ
from analyst expectations. Retail operating earnings were $659 million, up 34% versus the prior year quarter, driven by
strong performance in both Life and Other and Annuities. Life and Other reported operating earnings of $237 million,
up 16% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower DAC amortization and lower policyholder dividends. These
were partially offset by less favorable catastrophe loss experience from an exceptionally good prior year quarter and
lower variable investment income.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $422 million, up 47% versus the prior year quarter. The drivers included
higher fees from separate account growth, resulting from strong investment performance, lower ongoing DAC
amortization, and favorable assumption unlockings. The initial market impact was favorable to operating earnings by
$27 million after tax, which is $3 million less than the prior year quarter. As a forward-looking rule of thumb, a one
percentage point change in the S&P 500 equates to approximately $5 million to $7 million of operating earnings
annually.
Variable Annuity sales were $2.7 billion in the quarter, down 41% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We expect
full-year VA sales to be at the top end of our $10 billion to $11 billion target. As of September 30, the net amount at

risk for all GMIB riders was down to $931 million, which compares to $2.5 billion at March 31, as presented at our
May Investor Day. The net amount at risk for all GMIB Max contracts is only $2 million. In addition, only 7.3% of
total GMIB contracts were in the money as of September 30, which compares to 17.9% at March 31, which was also
presented at Investor Day.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $226 million, down 20% year-over-year. The
primary drivers were weaker underwriting results in Group Life and Disability, higher expenses due to reinvestment in
the business, and less favorable catastrophe experience versus a favorable result a year ago.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 13% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency
basis. These results reflected the impact of: favorable one-time adjustments, particularly in the prior year; higher
expenses due to sales initiatives in the region; and weaker underwriting results, partially offset by net favorable market
impacts.
Premium fees and other revenues were up 14% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong
growth across the region. Sales growth was only 4%, but excluding one large group case in the prior-year quarter,
growth would've been 11%.
I want to comment on two topics that are important to consider for future earnings for Latin America, Provida and
fiscal policy changes in Mexico. As Steve noted, we closed on the acquisition of Provida. With the completion of the
tender offer on October 1, we currently own 91.4% of Provida at a cost of approximately U.S. $1.85 billion. Provida is
performing well and in line with our expectations. Our ownership percentage is less than we had modeled, but this is
fully offset by our lower opportunity cost of funds.
In Mexico, we are assessing the potential impact from fiscal policy changes currently being implemented. We believe
the annual impact could dampen operating earnings by approximately $25 million.
Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $257 million, down 1% year-over-year, but up 7% on a constant currency
basis. Operating earnings were dampened by the previously discussed reserve strengthening in Australia and an
unfavorable impact from the assumption review, partially offset by a tax benefit in Japan. Adjusting for these items,
operating earnings were 17%, driven by business growth and lower expenses. While we were pleased with the
underlying performance in the quarter, we do not believe that 17% is a sustainable growth rate. As anticipated,
surrender activity of non-yen fixed annuities in Japan returned to a more normal level in the third quarter. We believe a
more normal level of quarterly earnings for Asia is approximately $280 million to $300 million.
Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, up 37% year-over-year and 28% on a constant currency basis,
driven primarily by: business growth across the region, especially in Russia, Poland and Turkey; lower expenses; and
certain one-time items. This was a strong quarter for EMEA. A more normal level of quarterly earnings is in the low to
mid-$70 million range. Premium fees and other revenues were up 8% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency
basis, driven by strong growth in Russia and the impact of the Aviva acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. Overall
sales growth for EMEA was 10%, driven by emerging market growth of 21%, most notably in the Gulf, Turkey and
Russia.
Now, I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$4.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually so we do not have an
update for the third quarter. In Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 913% as of the second quarter of 2013.
For our domestic insurance companies in the third quarter, preliminary statutory results are operating earnings of $720
million and net income of $475 million. Statutory operating earnings were down $382 million from the prior year,
primarily due to higher taxes of $365 million in the current quarter as the result of various tax adjustments.
For the first nine months of 2013, statutory operating earnings were $2.1 billion, and statutory net income was $1.2
billion. Total adjusted capital for our domestic insurance companies is expected to be approximately $27.6 billion as of
September 30, down 5% from December 31, primarily due to dividends paid of $1.3 billion. Unrealized losses
essentially offset net income.

And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Thanks, good morning. I had a question about health care reform. Wondering how meaningful
of an opportunity you think that could be for MetLife over the next several years and also what your strategy is to
participate in private exchanges.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, Ryan. It's Bill Wheeler.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Hey.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: So there's a lot of aspects to health care reform, so I'd break it down in a couple ways. One
is, we are – our Dental product is on a number of these state exchanges that are up now or selling now. Obviously, our
sales are pretty nominal. But – and we have also put our products, not just Dental, but a broad array of products on a
number of private exchanges. I think we are up to 10 private exchanges. And our expectation has been, for a number of
years, is that employers are going to start and employees are going to start using these exchanges to buy benefits and to
give employees more choice in the type of voluntary or worksite benefits they provide. And so a big strategy for us,
which we've laid out previously, is to expand our product set and our enrollment capabilities in the voluntary worksite
aspect of the business. And so we think that is a big opportunity for us and a big source of growth in our group area.
Now I guess I will also just say that the last thing that I think is happening right now is, of course, the Affordable Care
Act is having lots of difficulty. And I think one interesting aspect is, I believe that you're going to see a lot of
employees really start to value their employee benefits and the benefits they get from their employer, and I think be –
and value them more highly. And I think in the long run, that's going to be a really good thing for our Group business.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Thanks. And just a follow-up, in addition to your typical suite of group and voluntary benefits,
will you be looking to be a bigger player in supplemental health as well?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, yes. Labels are – let's be careful. So we definitely will be a bigger player in Critical
Illness and Accident in Health products, but I would – the true Med Supp kind of products, I don't think we're going to
be entering.
<Q - Ryan Krueger>: Understood. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Next we'll go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Good morning. Thanks so much. Wanted to first touch just on VA, obviously, you
and the industry have done a lot in terms of managing down sales, done everything from increasing fees, lowering
guarantees, et cetera, and yet these things still kind of seem to stick and sell. And you just saw a competitor look at
doing a reinsurance transaction or announce a reinsurance transaction to keep capacity in the market. And wondering if
this is something you would consider, potentially as you continue to work on customer-centricity.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Chris, it's Bill again. Sure, I mean, I think we'll look at this transaction. I mean, this is – I
wouldn't – we obviously read that announcement with interest. And the devil is in the details. And we're going to try to
understand the details of that trade. Look, we always look at ways to manage our capacity and capital, but I think Steve
made it pretty clear earlier in the call, we've – we're going to rebalance the risk profile of MetLife. And that means we

are going to stay in the Variable Annuity business, but we're going to run it a certain way. And I think that's – and I
think that way is working.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay. And then one for Steve and maybe Chris, if you could comment just some on
the operations in Japan, I guess there's been some increased press and chatter around maybe some elevated turnover of
management, certainly changes in commission structures that you guys have talked about the past. Just wanted to kind
of get your assessment of the strategy in the region, and what you guys are doing to kind of continue to accelerate
growth while maintain good returns.
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Sure. Let me take that. It's Chris Townsend here. So first of all, in terms of the
management changes, yes, we have changed some of the management there. [indiscernible] (34:45) is our CEO of that
business. He's been the COO of that business for approximately three years and has a very deep life insurance
background and has good tenure in Japan as well. The bench in Japan is very deep. And we've supplemented that in
terms of some of the new areas we're looking to build capability in with some strong external hires. So we're very
comfortable with the management team we have in Japan.
If you look at the business overall in Japan, we've said to you for a number of quarters that our bank sales are soft,
given the fact that the Nikkei and TOPIX have performed so well in all that volatility in the yen. What that's led to is
rather depressed sales in the fixed annuity foreign currency products. But that should be bounced back this third quarter
now. Bank sales are up about 54% sequentially, but they're still down 20% year-on-year, and what that's meant overall
is that Japan is down on sales about 4%.
What I would say is that A&H sales in Japan are up and across the region were up about 9% on A&H. So again, we
feel pretty good in terms of the mix of the business we've got. The A&H portfolio overall is competitive. You'll hear
that from a number of others who are approaching this market, but we feel that the deep experience we've got, plus that
multi-channel platform, which is rather unique for us in the Japanese market, gives us a great ability to grow that
business very well in terms of the bundling ratio we have across the other life products.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay. And then just new business returns, any sense of kind of what you're pricing
for or seeing?
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Yeah, we're pricing for a 15% [ph] EC ROI (36:26), as we've told you a number of
times before, and that's across the portfolio. So clearly, there's going be some products which perform better than others
in different cycles. And we're continuing to tweak that portfolio in line with some of the volatile macroeconomic
conditions. So as interest rate changes, reserve rate ranges, we'll tweak our portfolio, but overall, our portfolio's
exceeding the 15% [ph] EC ROI (36:52).
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay. Thanks so much.

And next will go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Morning. First question for Steve, just the decision to discontinue the explicit earnings
guidance, can you give a little more color behind that decision in terms of why discontinue it? And relatedly, are there
any meaningful changes to the growth rates that you had previously discussed, either domestically or internationally, as
we think about 2014, 2015? Because that's obviously a logical question is is part of what's behind this the fact that the
news may not be as good?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hi, Tom. We really looked at all the literature that was written, that has been written, on
this issue giving earnings guidance. There's some literature that says you should give it. There's lot of literature that
says you shouldn't give it and they give the pros and cons and so on. The bottom line really, from our perspective, was
if earnings guidance really provides information that's useful in investors and analysts better understanding our
business and earnings for the coming year, then we should give it. And our view was, because of the capital

market-sensitivity of our overall business and the impact of things like the equity market returns, that it just wasn't all
that useful to people to get our earnings guidance on a specific point or number for EPS in the coming year.
We thought that if we gave you further information, more information, other parts of our business and sensitivities, that
people could build their own models based upon their view of, let's say, what the S&P 500 will do next year or what
interest rates would be or other factors that could influence the short-term earnings of MetLife.
There is some literature that says that those who drop earnings guidance do so, in some cases, because their prospects
aren't as bright as they had been or they're going through some transition in their business model. That is not the case
for us. This really was a fresh look at should we give guidance or not give guidance, as if we were just starting off as an
IPO, would you, should you really do this in our business or not? We looked at our peers, like we said in the script
earlier, that it's pretty split in the United States in terms of providing guidance in our industry.
In Europe, most don't give guidance in our industry. And then other financial institutions, especially the larger banks
that have the same kind of sensitivity to capital markets, virtually none of them give guidance. They give a lot of
components that allow people to come up with their own numbers. We just thought that was a better way to do it. And
we thought if we are starting off today fresh, that's what we would do.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Understood. Yeah, appreciate that response. The next question I had is for John or Bill. The
higher severity of claims in Group Life and Disability, is there a chance that this might continue, that this might be a
sign of some pricing actions you need to take, any clarity there?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, Tom. It's Bill. Well, when we have a chance to re-price cases, we obviously look at the
individual experience, and I'm sure there will be some cases we'll re-price and raise prices. That's just the nature of the
beast in the pricing cycle. But because the underwriting results were really about incidents, not – or really about
severity and not incidents, that kind of tells you it's more than likely more random and – than expectations, and we do
see this occasionally. I guess we feel that – and it was severity, higher severity in both Group Life and in Disability, so
I think we feel that this is sort of normal underwriting volatility, if you will, and doesn't cause us to think that we're
going to have to significantly change our pricing expectations.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay, got it, and then just one last one, the Mexico, the comment on fiscal policy changes
having a $25 million negative impact, is that going to impact your goodwill related to that, some prior acquisitions at
all?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Tom. This is John. No, we don't believe this would impact our goodwill.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.

Next we'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Hi, good morning. I just have a question for you on the regulatory front. So recently the Fed,
among some others, issued a proposal that looks like it's going to further increase the liquidity requirements for some of
this – or for the systemic banks, but that proposal, at least by our read, seems to specifically exclude this requirement
for SIFI insurance companies. I guess my question is two-fold. Is that consistent with your read as well, that it would
exclude insurers? And second, do you think it's going too far if we read into that exclusion of insurers an increasing
recognition by the regulators of some of the key differences between traditional banks and insurance companies, at
least in terms of balance sheet and liquidity profiles? I guess I'm asking, Steve, you mentioned continuing to sort of
work to educate regulators, so do you feel like you're making any real progress on that front?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hi, John. We've read that rule as well, and that is our interpretation, that designated
non-banks, SIFIs in the insurance space, would not be subject to that rule. That's our interpretation of what we read.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay.

<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: So it's consistent with what you said. And in terms of what should we interpret from that,
I think it's a positive. I don't want to read too much into it, but clearly regulators are looking at the differences in the
business model of banking versus the business model of insurance. There are significant differences. Banks rely upon
much more on short-term funding. They have more asset liability mismatches as part of their business model. And we
rely upon largely longer-term funding sources. Overall, we match our assets and our liabilities, so those kind of run on
the bank issues that can exist in a crisis situation don't really apply to the insurance industries.
So I think there's becoming greater recognition of the differences in the business model between our two industries in
Washington. And we've worked hard, as others have as well in the industry, to try to provide insights and help in
Washington in terms of understanding our business model. And we have to all acknowledge that insurance has been
regulated now for decades at the state level, not at the Federal level, so they're starting from a point in terms of
overseeing our industry that's fairly new for them. So it's understandable that there is kind of a education process going
on. I think this is a positive sign, but again, I don't want to read too much into it.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Yeah, I understand. Thanks for the response. And then I just have one question on pension
closeouts. Given obviously some great equity market strengths and good investment performance, and at least here
recently some slightly higher longer-term rates, it looks like funding status, sort of across the Fortune 500 defined
benefit pension plans, has really gotten much, much better. I'm just wondering, maybe for Bill, if that's helping to
improve the dialogue and the opportunity set, and what your outlook is there.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Hi, John. Well, yeah, with regard to pension closeouts, I don't think there's any doubt that
the environment is getting better. And so, and we see that in our – what I would call our normal business new business
pipeline. It's growing. It's in terms of the amount of transactions that are out there to do, but they're not jumbo deals. I
mean, the jumbo deals are – I mean obviously, they're by their very nature they're kind of one-off, and we don't have
visibility on big jumbo deals right now. But I would say the more traditional smaller cases, the pipeline is large. And
so, our expectation is that there's going to be more volume there.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. So – and that's what I was sort of most curious about. As these funding gaps sort of get
closer and closer to zero or at least lower, would company CFOs and Treasurers essentially decide, hey look, this is
getting much better, we don't need to pursue this, or would they go the other way? And it sounds like you're saying it
goes the other way.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: I think so. We're seeing number of transactions, sizes are getting a little bigger. There's
clearly a lot of activity.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Thanks very much.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore. Your line is open.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to ask a question about the annual assumption review,
John, I think you talked about, particularly in the VA business, a good guide above the line, and a $90 million kind of
hit below the line. I was wondering if you could just expand on really what drove maybe the $90 million, and I assume
it was the lapse rate assumption. And does it in any meaningful way change, kind of, the all-in economics of the Inforce
VA block in your view?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Mark. This assumption review, we included some GMWBs that we have and some LWG,
and we are now more experienced on those, and looked at the lapses and installed a lapse function closer to what we
did a year ago for the GMIBs. We didn't have enough experience on this block until this year on that block, and so it
drove the same sort of structure where you saw more persistency expected over time, which drives higher core fees in
the business. So you amortize over a longer period of time, but then you have a higher cost of the benefit below the
line, which is where the fees – the rider fees for these benefits feed below the line into net income to match against the

derivative hedging that we do against it. So we try to match the revenues in net income with the costs there, and that's
why there's a higher net present value of future costs for those withdrawal benefit costs.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: I guess any change in, kind of, how you view the economics of the business?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: No. I mean, this changes it a little bit, but in terms of the overall book, we view the new
business as well priced. The older book needs capital and has a lower ROE than the new business. I would like to point
out that in this whole assumption review across the U.S., there wasn't any change to our thinking of long-term interest
rates, and we did adjust our maintenance expenses in the Retail Annuity business. We're a little lower. We've got a
larger book and that helped a little bit.
The other major assumption that we haven't looked at yet, that we spoke about at Investor Day, is what we do with
annuitization rates, and we still – although those are favorable, we haven't made any assumption changes on those yet.
We're leaving that as is. We need some more time before we would think about changing those.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, that's helpful. Just a quick question on the Australian business, I guess when you
talked about Mexico, you talked about a $25 million potential kind of hit to earnings going forward. You took a charge
in Australia similar to what others have seen. I'm just curious what the delta on earnings of the Australian block, kind
of from what you've experienced to what you would expect going forward, will be.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We don't expect a dramatic change to the ongoing profits in Australia. That makes $20
million, $30 million a year. And we did a reserve charge on this business. This business has been around for a while.
It's a rider to peoples' pension savings programs. And there's been an industry change in the incidents in these business.
We only had a few cases, a handful of cases, where we've had to adjust, and two, in particular, drove most of the
reserve change. We've done extensive work on this. It's been reflected across the industry and we've set the reserves
appropriately.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: So the $20 million to $30 million contribution should still hold going forward
essentially?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Yes.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
And next we'll go to the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I just had a question on spreads and thinking about the modest
declines on a adjusted basis. Corporate Benefit Funding, that's been a segment that's been a positive offset there. Could
you just remind us the liability and asset structure of Corporate Benefit Funding in terms of why spreads there have
positively increased over the last four or five quarters?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Sure. So Corporate Benefit Funding, the liabilities are very long and they're often fixed in
terms of the interest rate assumptions that are embedded in the liability. So it's a very fixed rate liability and it's long.
So the way the target investment portfolio there would have more variable investment income in it, more private equity
investments, real estate, et cetera. So if those investments perform, which they have, obviously, and we've had outsized
performance in that particular part of the portfolio, it will do well. The other thing, too, is the only place where – so we
have the ability to invest very long and, obviously, match quite well. And I think that's why that portfolio holds up
much better than others, which I think are shorter-term liabilities.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: I might just...

<A - John C. R. Hele>: Add to that. Because we have quite a deal of assets in here, we often use this for securities
lending programs. And so far this year, we've had a pretty steep yield curve on the short end and that's benefited the
additional benefit we get from securities lending in this portfolio. So that's a function of just the very steep yield curve
on the very short end.
<Q - Seth M. Weiss>: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And just in terms of thinking about the volatility on the
adjusted spread, is that mostly from bond pre-pays? This is looking across the four different units or are there other
elements that could cause the adjusted spread, that you now provide us, to bounce around?
<A - Steven J. Goulart>: Hi. It's Steve Goulart. Just on – if we look at the quarter, John went through some of the
details on [ph] VII, (53:00) but so we did see hedge funds and private equity returning to normal or even lower than
planned. But bond prepayments have been strong for the year and particularly for the quarter. And again, because of the
process, the time it takes to complete a prepayment, we actually have pretty good insight into what the fourth quarter
will look like as well. And so I think we're anticipating prepayments to be a good contributor to our [ph] VII (53:27) for
the fourth quarter and why we'll probably be near the top of the expected range, as well.

And next we'll go to the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Thanks. Good morning. First question for John on holding company cash, I think you said
$4.8 billion, down from $6.5 billion in the second quarter. I'm guessing most of that is the Provida payment. Just
wondering as you look across the fourth quarter, should we expect any big pluses and minuses with respect to the
holding company cash?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: We expect to be at the high end of our range we gave you on Investor Day, so you're pretty
close there.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. And is there anything in particular that's sending you to the high end of the range or
just better earnings?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: No. There's no big – there's some pluses and minuses always we have in cash in a company
this size. So it just trends along. We have dividends paying out. We have cash coming in, so it should end up to be at
the high end of our range we had.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. And then I guess more of a philosophical question for Steve on the dividend,
obviously, earlier this year, you increased your dividend, I think, to a payout ratio of around 20%. As we think about
how you're thinking about dividend growth going forward, should we anticipate that that dividend will probably grow
in line with earnings, meaning you'll be at a stable payout ratio, or do you anticipate that that payout ratio might start to
climb in the future?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Suneet, our goal is to increase dividends at a fairly steady pace over time along with our
earnings. But as we've mentioned before, because of the uncertainty around regulation, we have to take into account
whatever it is we learn from potential new capital rules that might apply to MetLife and factor that into our
consideration and our judgment in terms of how to handle dividends going forward.
<Q - Suneet L. Kamath>: Okay. And then just the last question, I wanted to follow-up on, I think, one of Tom
Gallagher's questions that I'm not sure you answered about the – anything changing in terms of the guidance. I guess if
I think back to November of 2011, when we did the interest rate discussion, you talked about a sort of an 8% earnings
growth rate in a normal environment, maybe 4% excluding – in a low interest-rate environment. I know we're going to
get a lot more detail in December in terms of sensitivities, but, at a high level, would you argue that that guidance
would still be appropriate, particularly given some of the changes you've made in the U.S. business around shrinking
the Variable Annuity business and making some adjustments on the UL with the no-lapse guarantee?

And next we'll go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Hi. I had a couple of questions. First, on the assumptions embedded in your Australia
charge, you took a pretty large charge, but what gives you the comfort that you are adequately reserved there? And the
reason I'm asking is other companies have taken similar charges as well, some before you guys, and, in many cases,
they've taken repeated charges. And then secondly, you mentioned the $25 million impact from the fiscal changes in
Mexico. Can you just discuss this in a little bit more detail and the potential steps that you could take, if there are any,
to mitigate the impact?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi, Jimmy. This is John. So this has been an industry trend and, of course, some reinsurers,
who can see across the whole industry, reacted last quarter. As I said, we only had a handful of cases, although they
were larger cases, where we've been looking at this trend. So we've studied it very carefully. We've benefited from
speaking to the reinsurers and thinking about this across the board. We've done extensive studies on this and we believe
we are adequately reserved. However, if things change again in the future, you can always – you may have to relook at
it again, if trends change from where they are. But we believe we've captured the current trends underway in this area.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Jimmy, it's Bill. With regard to Mexico, what's going on there is the Mexican Congress has
been going through a series of fiscal reforms, or approving a series of fiscal reforms, announced by the Mexican
President, Peña Nieto. And I guess I would say that we believe some of those changes with regard to taxes, we can
mitigate. And some we probably will not be able to. And so there our – sort of our best guess, but we're not done with
our work yet, is that the impact might be $25 million after-tax next year. And it's, there's taxes on corporate income.
There's taxes on dividends. There's other government programs which we participate in that might be changed, so
there's sort of a package of things going on. And my guess is is we'll give you a little more color on that in December.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: And then maybe if I could ask just one more on guidance, and I think there's always
skepticism in a company's withdrawals guidance on whether it signals that things are getting worse, at least in the
short-term. And you gave reasons, which are all valid, but especially it's difficult predicting where the markets are
quarter-to-quarter and having to adjust. But people could always use their own market assumptions anyway, so that was
the case even when you were giving guidance before.
And even though most of the banks don't give guidance, most insurance companies do. So I was wondering if there's
anything more behind that. Maybe, like obviously, if a company does give guidance and it sort of forces management
to focus on the short-term a little bit just to be able to hold that – hold the results up to that. So, maybe discuss a little
bit more why this is not a signal that things are getting worse, and there was something else besides the items that you
mentioned that went into your decision.
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: I think you hit one of the items that is worth highlighting, Jimmy, which is sometimes
giving a point estimate, or even a range for next year's earnings, can make management teams and companies focus too
much on short-term results. So our goal here is to increase shareholder value over time. And when I say over time, I
don't mean over a decade, but I mean over the next few years. And we have to just make sure that that's our focus as a
company. We're going to give a lot of inputs for all of you in December on our Investor Day call to construct your own
models in terms of your assumptions around interest rates, equity values for the next year and so on, to create your own
number that you come up with.

But as we look back and we looked at our own earnings guidance numbers over the last decade and said how close
were we to what the actual results turned out to be, what did the Street come up with on their own after they adjusted
our guidance, and we weren't that great in terms of predicting, frankly. So our view was we're spending way too much
time on factors that really are not within our control, like equity values in the coming year and so on. And rather than
have that be such a big piece of the conversation, let's shift it to our business model, our strategy, the things that really
matter, the sensitivity analysis that we go through. So I think you'll see in December, we're going to give you more
information than they've gotten before from us, but you're just not going to get a point estimate for next year's earnings.
