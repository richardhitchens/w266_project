Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we've delivered another strong quarter with
comparable sales growth of 5.2%. Comp growth was driven by a 2.9% increase in comp average ticket and a 2.2%

increase in comp transactions.
The team executed our plan and collaborated across the organization to respond the challenges. We implemented a
coordinated effort to stagger our Spring Black Friday events with a controlled cadence, as Mike will describe further,
and we're well prepared to meet customers' needs for the season.
Our ability to adapt difficult operating conditions was tested by the prolonged labor dispute at West Coast ports and I'm
pleased with the team's diligent effort to minimize the impact these challenges created. I would like to thank our more
than 265,000 employees in the field and our support centers for their hard work and dedication to serving customers.
Comparable sales growth for our U.S. home improvement business was 5.3% for the quarter. And while we saw
stronger performance in areas of the country, where weather was more favorable, specifically in the West and in
Florida, all 14 regions generated positive comps.
Additionally, our team in Canada delivered their eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps in local currency and
their highest quarterly comp performance since we entered the market in 2007. We recorded positive comps in all 13
product categories, with particular strength in appliances, as well as seasonal categories, including outdoor power
equipment and seasonal living.
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive our sales growth.
For the quarter, we drove 76 basis points of operating margin expansion, despite experiencing some discrete pressures,
as Bob will detail. And we delivered earnings per share of $0.70, a 15% increase over last year's first quarter, which
was in line with our expectations.
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of stock
under our share repurchase program and paid $222 million in dividends.
Looking at the balance of the year from an economic perspective. Key drivers of home improvement industry growth,
job and income growth, home buying and home price appreciation remained aligned for modestly stronger industry
growth. At the same time, lower energy prices should fuel stronger consumer spending in 2015.
We continue to see steady recovery within the housing market, including positive trends in turnover, and moderate
home price appreciation as measured by the FHSA, the broadest measure of home price growth, which is more in line
with our store footprint.
We're also encouraged by the results of our first quarter consumer sentiment survey, where we continue to see
homeowners' views around personal finances and home values improve. According to the survey, homeowners are
shifting more of their spending to home improvement. As a result, their intentions to begin a home improvement
project in the next six months were the highest in the six years, and these planned projects are now almost evenly split
between discretionary and non-discretionary.
Our key priorities in 2015 should allow us to capitalize on opportunities within an improving economy. We are
pursuing further top line growth by differentiating ourselves with better customer experiences and improving our
product and service offering for the pro customer.
We also remain committed to improving our productivity and profitability with opportunities in the few specific areas;
including store payroll, marketing, and leveraging our scale to get cost savings on indirect spend. In addition, we
continue developing Omni-channel capabilities as part of our long-term commitment to meet customers on their terms,
whenever and wherever they choose to engage with us.
The execution of our strategic priorities alongside an improving macroeconomic backdrop, together with our keen
focus on productivity and profitability give us confidence in our business outlook for 2015. Thanks again for your
interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.

Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everyone. We executed well in the first quarter, growing both average ticket and
transactions. We drove traffic to our stores through our Spring Black Friday event; align to the expected arrival of
spring from the Deep South to the North.
To ensure our stores are ready to provide inspiration, information and products to customers, we used our enhanced
sales and operations planning process to coordinate inventory flow, advertising, product displays and training. And
when the situation at the West Coast ports had a complexity to our Spring preparation, our transportation and logistics
team successfully collaborated to reroute product to other ports. As a result, our in-stock levels remain high. In fact,
sales in our seasonal living category, which includes our highest concentration of imported products, such as Patios and
Grills exceeded our expectations.
We are pleased with our first quarter results, notwithstanding some weather driven softness, keep in mind that the
outdoor selling season extends well past Memorial Day. To this point and the second quarter sales have exceeded our
expectations. So we remain confident in the full-year guidance we provided last quarter.
Looking at category performance, we recorded above company average comps in appliances, outdoor power equipment
and seasonal living. We achieved double-digit comps in outdoor power equipment, as Walk-Behind and Riding
Mowers drove strong performance in the West and South.
We offer a wide range of mowers, so our customers maintain the yards and we continue to provide compelling and
exclusive innovations like, our home channel exclusive Husqvarna, all-wheel-drive mower, and our recently launched
Troy-Bilt FLEX product.
The outdoor living experience we introduced last year drove high single-digit comps in our seasonal living product
category and across all three geographical divisions. This particular customer experience most benefits our Patio and
outdoor fashion areas, which recorded strong comps again this quarter over double-digit comps last year.
We continue to see strong sales of Patio furniture and robust attachment of replacement cushions and other outdoor
accessories. As a reminder to create our outdoor living experience, we took advantage of our largest store format to
produce the showroom fill, which included removing 15 bays of steel racking and opening up 35% more space for
curative style.
It helped customers envision and create the outdoor space; we displayed Patio sets with coordinating rugs, umbrellas,
and accessories like pillows and planters, along with grills, and other outdoor products, just as you would expect to see
in your own backyard. We're very pleased with the continued performance of our outdoor living experience.
In appliances, we drove double-digit comps for the second consecutive quarter. Lowe's offer some leading appliance
brands such as Whirlpool, Kitchenaid, Bosch, Samsung, LG, Electrolux, Frigidaire and GE. And we further
strengthened our offering with our home channel exclusive channel of the Frigidaire Pro appliances series, for
customers who aspired to have a look and feel of commercial grade appliances in their home. This exciting launch
provides great value with high-end commercial like aesthetics and quality in an accessible price point.
In addition to great brands, we provide service advantages of next day delivery and haul away, as well as in-house
facilitation of repairs and maintenance. To further enhance on the appliance shopping experience, towards the end of
last year, we worked with our vendor partners to introduce 17 kitchen suites to each store.
Each suite includes four coordinated appliances, a refrigerator, a range, a microwave and dishwasher. These suites
helped customers quickly visualize our full set of new appliances will look into existing or remodeled kitchen.
We're also excited about HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams, an exclusive for Lowe's in the home channel. This is the
first time in more than 40-years that Sherwin-Williams branded products are available to another retailer. Our brand is
the number one purchased Libor in paint, and Sherwin-Williams is the most recognized brand. We expect the addition
of HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams to appeal to both DIY and pro customers. Its long-standing reputation for
quality, as well as the color expertise of HGTV allows Lowe's to offer customers the top brands they trust for their next
paint project.

We announced this exciting addition in December and set product in all stores by the end of April. Earlier this month,
we launched a full national advertising campaign in conjunction with Sherwin-Williams in digital, TV and print. The
early customer responses to this home channel exclusive brand into the HGTV curetted color set has been positive.
Supporting our Omni-channel approach to retailing, we are cross-merchandising the Sherwin-Williams brand in key
areas throughout the store like kitchen vignettes, bath vignettes, and Home Decor, while also leveraging our Color
Visualizer on lowes.com. This visualizer helps customers to find the perfect color for their walls by virtually painting
their own home or experimenting with the sample room.
Then you can come order a paint sample for shipment directly to the home or come into our stores for help pulling the
project together with our specialists. Combined with our outstanding Valspar and PPG, Olympic brand partnerships, we
expect to grow traffic to our stores and increase overall market share in paint.
We also continue to strengthen our portfolio of pro focused brands. We recently finished rolling out brands such as,
Kobalt Mechanics Tools, GAF roofing and Owens Corning insulation. And we continue to collect feedback from our
pro customers and store employees to identify other local and national brands that best meet the needs of pro
customers.
Along with strengthening our brand portfolio, we recently made the new LowesForPros.com site available to all pro
customers. Our focus on brands as well as our recent prelaunch of LowesForPros.com are part of our broader
commitment to build on our strong foundation for the pro.
This foundation includes dedicated service in our stores, inventory depth aligned with the needs of the pro and our five
ways to save value proposition. And our fill based pro account executives and national accounts team make it easy for
medium to large-sized companies and government entities to do business with us.
In addition to our efforts to drive top line growth, we continue to focus on driving productivity and profitability. For the
quarter, even with double-digit growth in categories like appliances and outdoor products, we maintain a flat gross
margin rate, demonstrating our ability to drive profitability, while capitalizing a big ticket market share opportunities.
We accomplished this by continue to partner with our vendors to drive innovation and improved first cost and by
leveraging supply chain fixed costs. Our stores, once again, effectively managed payroll hours and solid comp sales
growth, increasing sales per hour by approximately 4% and driving 13 basis points of payroll expense leverage.
They drove this while achieving record customer satisfaction scores and best-in-class inventory shrink performance.
We also drove productivity and marketing by increasing our presence in targeted digital media and leveraging our
investment in MyLowe's. And we'll continue to identify and implement additional expense efficiencies throughout the
year by consolidating the procurement of similar types of goods and services across our corporate and store functions.
Likewise with solid depth of high velocity items and job [ph] bulk quantities in place and through continued application
of improved analytics to a thoughtful line review process, we're able to hold inventory per store roughly flat and
increased inventory turns by 17 basis points.
As you can see, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and the progress we're making on our initiatives to drive
top line growth, productivity and profitability. And we look forward to sharing further progress with you over the
course of the year.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's and I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Sales for the first quarter were $14.1 billion, an increase of 5.4%. Total
average ticket increased 3% to $66.63 and total transaction count increased 2.3%. As discussed on our fourth quarter
call, we had planned for normal weather and thus for Q1 to be our highest comping quarter of the year.

In fact weather in the Northeast was colder than normal and colder than last year, while the West and Florida
experienced the opposite. Therefore, the net impact of weather year-over-year was not the tailwind we expected. As a
result, our sales for the quarter were slightly below our expectations, but we're still confident in our outlook for the
year.
Comp sales increased 5.2%, as comp average ticket grew by 2.9% and comp transactions were up 2.2%. Looking at
monthly trends, comps were 5.1% in February; 6.6% in March; and 3.8% in April. Gross margin for the first quarter
was 35.47% of sales, essentially flat to last year and in line with our expectations. With positive rate movement from
value improvement, which is offset by 15 basis points of pressure from mix of products sold.
SG&A for Q1 is 24.16% of sales, which leveraged 60 basis points. Expense leverage was driven by advertising, store
payroll and impairment. Advertising leveraged 25 basis points driven by the efforts to improve productivity that might
shared. Store payroll leveraged 13 basis points as we continue to optimize our staffing model.
In the quarter, we had $8 million of long-lived assets impairment, compared with $23 million in last year's first quarter,
resulting in 11 basis points of leverage. Also, there were numerous expenses that leverage between 5 basis points and
10 basis points in Q1. These items were somewhat offset by bonus which deleveraged 35 basis points.
Our bonus accruals are based on actual performance to-date relative to plan. Record customer satisfaction scores,
coupled with solid Q1 performance this year relative to a tough first quarter last year, resulted in higher bonus expense
and therefore deleveraged year-over-year.
Depreciation for the quarter was $365 million, which was 2.59% of sales and leveraged 19 basis points compared to
last year's first quarter as a result of higher sales and assets becoming fully depreciated. Earnings before interest and
taxes increased 76 basis points to 8.72% of sales.
On our Q4 call, we discussed the pressure that gross margin and bonus expense would have on first quarter's
flow-through. The 18 basis points of flow through per point of comp about 1% in Q1 was modestly better than our
expectations coming into the quarter.
Interest expense at $134 million for the quarter deleveraged 2 basis points to last year as total debt increased 1.2 billion
versus first quarter of 2014. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, which was higher than the fourth quarter
due to the expiration of certain tax provisions.
The higher rate relative to last year was primarily due to a tax settlement in Q1 2014 and negatively impacted
first-quarter earnings per share comparisons to last year by approximately $0.06. Earnings per share of $0.70 for the
quarter was in line with our expectations and represented a 14.8% increase over last year's $0.61.
Now to a few items in the balance sheet, starting with assets. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was
$1.4 billion. Our first quarter inventory balance of $10.6 billion increased $99 million or nine-tenths of a 1% [ph] over
Q1 last year. Inventory turnover was 3.78, an increase of 17 basis points over Q1 2014. Asset turnover increased 11
basis points to 1.7.
Moving now to liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $8 billion, increased $972 million or 13.8%
over Q1 last year. The increase in accounts payable was due to the timing of purchases in the quarter versus last year.
At the end of first quarter, lease adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.11. Return on invested capital increased 232 basis
points for the quarter to 14.34%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flow was almost $2.5 billion. Capital expenditures were
$232 million resulting in free cash flow of over $2.2 billion. Free cash flow was $446 million, or 24.8% over the same
period last year.
In the quarter, we repurchased 13.6 million shares for $1 billion. Our Board also approved the new 5 billion share
repurchase authorization. At quarter-end, we had approximately 6.4 billion remaining under share repurchase
authorization.

The remaining $109 million of share repurchase is shown on the statement of cash flows; less the shares withheld from
employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding liabilities, as well as the timing of share repurchase settlement across
quarters.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook. As Robert noted, economic
forecast remained aligned for modestly stronger home improvement industry growth in 2015. While we are optimistic
about both the macro forecast and our improving execution, we continue to take a prudent approach to our 2015
outlook.
For the year, we expect a total sales increase of approximately 4.5% to 5%, driven by comp sales increase of 4% to
4.5%, and the opening of 15 to 20 stores, which include Orchard and two City Center locations. We're anticipating an
EBIT increase of 80 basis points to 100 basis points and are targeting 25 basis points to 30 basis points of EBIT
expansion per point of comp above 1%. While this is our expectation for the year, there will be some choppiness
quarter-to-quarter.
Specific to the second quarter, there would be some gross margin pressure associated with the additional costs related
to the West Coast ports issue, as well as one more quarter of impact from increased promotional intensity that began
Labor Day last year.
For the year, we expect that most of the EBIT improvement will come from SG&A. Expense leverage will come from
store payroll, marketing, bonus and leveraging our scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spent. In addition, we
expect fixed leverage associated with sales growth.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 38.1%. The higher rate relative to 2014 is a result of the settlement of prior year
tax matters recognized in Q1 2014. The higher tax rate impacts earnings growth by roughly $0.06 per share. For the
year, we expect earnings per share of approximately $3.29, which represents an increase of 21.4% over 2014. We are
forecasting cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.1 billion.
Our capital forecast for 2015 is now approximately $1.4 billion, which is roughly $200 million higher than planned as a
result of acquiring certain, targeted assets in Canada. This results in an estimated free cash flow of $3.7 billion for
2015. We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25 times lease adjusted
debt-to-EBITDAR target. Our guidance assumes approximately 3.8 billion in share repurchases for 2015.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.

First question. I know you just spent a lot of time discussing sales trends, but maybe if you could just help us
understand better, the sales deceleration in the month of April, so the final month of your quarter, because that was at
odds with what your competitor said yesterday about their trends, so maybe just some more color there please.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So a couple things, Brian. First, as we think about the 3.8% for April relative to the 5.2% for the quarter, we did see
some softness -- weather related softness in some areas of the country for our seasonal categories. But as Mike said in
his comments, we are exceeding expectations in May. So we're comfortable with what we are seeing regarding those
seasonal categories, those parts of the country where weather has improved.
As it relates to what our competitor reported yesterday, if we take a look at -- so we're in a four, five, four calendar, if
we take a look at our performance on a four, four, five, which takes out some of the Easter shift noise that would have
crossed our fiscal March and April this year, we would have reported essentially a 5% comp for all three months of Q1.
Brian Nagel, Analyst
Got it. That's very helpful. And the second question I have -- there was news out over the past few weeks or a month or
so about the flooring category and some of the actions you have taken. Maybe just update us there on kind of what
Lowe's is doing in the flooring category and if that had any impact upon the Q1 results?
Robert Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Brian, this is Robert. I will describe the impact on the Q1 results, but I will get Mike to address the details of
what we are doing in the flooring category. Mike?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Yes, sure. There were some couple of articles, there were some articles out around two issues, one was relating to
formaldehyde in particular with -- one particular partner. So, what we did in essence was we took -- we put the
products from that particular partner on hold and we will go ahead and we will review the certifications. All of our
partners require to give a certification. We are reviewing the certification and making sure that there aren't any issues
and so, we will work through that.
As we look at our portfolio, we are very comfortable that we don't have issues. Our vendors are largely U.S.; they've all
certified with us that there are no issues. So we are very, very comfortable that we are in a pretty good place on this and
as we said there was no issues relative to flooring in the quarter.
With respect to phthalates, the other concern that was raised on vinyl flooring specifically, more than 90% of our virgin
vinyl flooring today is phthalate free, we will move that to 100% by year-end. And again, we're comfortable that there
is no big issues and as we work with our vendor partners and we continue to scrub this, we are not finding any issues as
well.
So, we don't see any impact in the quarter and frankly our flooring business continues to do well and our reviews with
our vendor partners continues to give us the kind of expected results that we expect.
Brian Nagel, Analyst
Great. Thanks Mike. Very helpful. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Jason Smith, Analyst
Hi, guys. This is Jason Smith on for Laura. Thanks for taking my question. I know you guys touched upon some of the
new products introductions in the appliance category. But can you kind of give us a better sense as to just overall what
drove the double-digit performance in the quarter and what you are seeing in the competitive environment?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Sure, a couple of things. We talked towards the middle of last year of -- making sure that our promotional cadence was
aligned with what we saw in the market. In addition to that we have more space dedicated to the appliance category and
certainly most if all of our competitors and we offer the full way of brands, and so we like how we are positioned and
go after market share in appliances.
We've done a couple things, we continue to launch exclusive innovative products like the Frigidaire Pro series that
we've talked about, that's our home channel exclusive. And we also put in kitchen vignettes, so that customers who
walk-in and see full vignettes of appliances and shop the different brands looking at how a kitchen would look, be it a
recently remodel kitchen or an existing kitchen with full of vignettes, and we've seen a couple things coming from that.
First, our appliance sales remain strong, double-digit both this quarter and last quarter. We've also seen an expansion of
number of appliances per ticket. And so we feel real good about our position in the appliance business, feel real good
about initiatives and we feel real good about the support our vendor partners continues to give us to ensure that we
retain the number one position in appliances.
Jason Smith, Analyst
Okay, great. If I could just add one quick follow-up, any early feedbacks from the LowesForPros now that it's open to
everyone?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yes, Jason. This is Rick. Early on, we continue to get good feedback on the site. We've gone through the actual soft
launch of that site on May 5. Currently, we have done no incremental marketing to the site. So what we're seeing is the
gravitation of normal traffic to it. But we've been very pleased with the organic search and the organic growth of the
site and we will continue to generate more awareness and more traffic as we continue to move throughout Q2. But so
far, we've been extremely pleased with the interaction to the site, the number of registrations to the site and the activity.
Jason Smith, Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you.

Hi. Two things. First of all, could you give us an update in terms of the online, the results, the growths you are seeing
in that, as well as the new efforts that you are implementing with them online?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yes, Eric. This is Rick. A couple of things. As we look at dotcom sales for the quarter, they grew 25.5% on a comp
basis. Q1 traffic was up double-digits to the site and our conversion rate improved as well from an overall perspective
for the quarter. The great thing was we saw both traffic and double-digit rates every month of the quarter and
improvement in conversion for every month of the quarter.
A few things that we continue to do, Mike talked about the new paint configuration tool that was launched to help
customers visualize paint in their home. We made several other strategic changes to the site throughout the quarter as
we continued to look for ways to improve the site along with other filtering process, improving better filtering and
better search terms.
We also introduced three other aspects to the site. We introduced new 360 product views to about 11,500 of our highest
viewed items, which give customers the complete view of the item across all aspects. We also introduced product
videos to 214 different items that enhance the video capabilities of the customer to actually see the site, see the item
and actually interact with it to a greater degree. And then, we also enhanced the images to 9,400 items on the site in the
quarter as well to make sure that we did showcase the product in a much better way to the customer.
So extremely pleased with the growth that we saw during the quarter, most pleased with the improvement in
conversion, which I believe is a result of the improved search terms for filtering and the incremental ads to product
content that we've made to the site during the quarter.
Eric Bosshard, Analyst
And then a follow-up. Mike, I would be interested in the magnitude of changes that you are making within
merchandising, within LowesForPros. It seems like a number of things are going on at the store level. Curious how the
organization is digesting that, if this is net benefiting the business, if there are periods where there is some disruption as
you implement these? How would you evaluate the pace of digesting the changes that you are implementing?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
There have been a number of changes over the last, I'd say, two years. I think the team is working through them well.
We don't spend lot of time talking about some of the new tools that have been deployed, like space planning, some of
the workflow tools for our review process, some of the improvements in pricing tools that give to a mark-down
optimization and promotional management, the efficient item assortment tools.
We've rolled out a number of tools in the merchandising space to make the merchants certainly more data driven as
well as more effective. When you couple that with our approach to go after more of that pro business that also
facilitated the need for the merchants to do some things very different and look at how we approach brands relative to
national brands versus private label brands in those categories that is very heavy to pro. We're doing a lot of things very
different.
Here is how I would answer that, I think you see a difference in our stores. I think our merchants and our vendor
partners are excited about the changes that we've made. I think they like the success that we see in growth and I think
they are working through it well. I am very proud of how the merchants have digested and I'm equally as proud at how
much support we've gotten from our vendor partners as we continue to work with these changes.

Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Eric, this is Rick. I would just add from a store perspective that you look at many of these new initiatives, they have
been ongoing for some time now over the last three years. I give Dennis Knowles and the store teams a tremendous
amount of credit for the number of hours that we've invested in training our associates over the past two years on the
utilization of these tools and what these sets mean to our stores.
So, you mentioned LowesForPros.com, you think about the Pro, it's really been a three-year journey of implementing
brands, implementing inventory levels, implementing processes, organization design and the addition of LowesForPros
with just the last component of that. So from a store perspective, there's been a tremendous investment in training,
communication and dialogue to make sure that we're able to execute these programs as they roll out.
Robert Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And Eric, this is Robert. We think about everything that Mike and Rick just described including the product resets to
come within the pro focused brands, like Mike talked about in this comments in the first quarter, Sherwin Williams,
significant reset to take place at the stores. It was done over the first quarter layering on top of that the training that
Rick just mentioned for all of the associates at the pro desk, those types of things. And then being able to deliver the
results that we delivered in the quarter. We are investing a lot for the future but we are also doing it with the cadence
that allows us to deliver great results like we did for the quarter. So I am pretty proud of what the team has been able to
execute.
Eric Bosshard, Analyst
Perfect. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.
Gregory Melich, Analyst
Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the trend through the quarter and where we are
into the second quarter. And Bob, if you look at your presentation, you can just see how the comps get more difficult
all the year. Help us to understand how you see the year playing out in terms of what might be your hardest comp, the
rest of the way or your easiest comp to build up to our full-year plan?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So we talked about the first half being stronger than the second half, but we also talked about as the year
progresses, our two-year comparisons -- two-year stack progressively increasing. So you heard the guys' just talk about
a lot of the work the team is doing to improve our offering and our execution to the customer. Robert talked about
modestly improving environment for home improvement.
So we do recognize that we are going against tougher comparisons. But on balance, the macro should be more
constructive as the year progresses relative to 2014. So we are still confident with our plan for 2015 our ability to
execute against that plan.

Gregory Melich, Analyst
And it sounds like you think the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, given all those things wrapped
together is actually reasonably even. Is that fair?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Not quite fair. I think, I would say that our outlook has modestly decelerating comps, Q1 to Q2 to Q3 to Q4, and that
somewhat reflects the tougher comparisons from last year. But as I said, we do we expect the two year stack to
modestly improve as we progress throughout the year as well.
Gregory Melich, Analyst
That's great. And if I could have a follow-up question, just to understand a little bit on SG&A, the bonus expense
deleverage. So we were below plan, but we deleveraged bonus. Could you help us understand that a little bit better as to
how the absolute level versus the plan, like why do we delever if we were below plan?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So, a couple of things, Greg. First, we were modestly below our sales plan. We improved flow through relative to our
expectations, so the earnings came in on plan. Still, we accrued generally speaking on target for bonus for Q1.
However, as Mike indicated, we had record performance from our customer satisfaction scores.
So the approved -- the only aspect of plan that was above -- only aspect of bonus that was above plan was the customer
focus program for the store associates. The majority of deleverage came because of the softness last year, because of
the dramatic performance below plan last year caused us to unwind some bonus accruals.
So coming into the year, we had anticipated having deleverage in Q1, that's one of the pressures that I talked about on
the Q4 call is we would have some bonus deleverage in Q1. It was a little bit higher than expected, because of the
record customer service scores that were recorded.
Gregory Melich, Analyst
Great. And then just quickly, paint was a below average category. Now that you are through that transition, any
estimates as to how much that could have hurt the quarter and just remind us how big paint is as a category for you
guys or what that could mean going forward?
Robert Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I will have the guys jump in, but as I said, we are through with the transition, Greg. We basically had the national
launch of Sherwin Williams basically right at the beginning of second quarter. We've got all the products in place,
everyone trained. It was a below average category which I think is also what we saw from an industry standpoint that
paint was a little bit below average in the first quarter.
So we probably had some disruption. I don't know that we got an amount quantified, because it was kind of a reset as
we went through the quarter. So I don't know that we have quantified that but certainly, I think we've got the ability to
show great strength as we now are backing up the national laws of advertising.
Mike, was there anything you wanted to talk about?

Yes, I'd just to add that we are really not disappointed in Q1. We knew that we had to get through a transition. We are
through the transition. The national advertising campaign is kicking in. We are actually very optimistic about it in the
back half of the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.
Dan Binder, Analyst
Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the staff optimization work that you are
doing. And then if there were any other notable categories that were softer than planned other than paint?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Dan, this is Rick. I will start. As we look at the quarter, we continue to optimize our labor to our customer traffic. I'm
extremely pleased with the stores and what they were able to do in the quarter. We hired approximately 51,000
employees in the quarter and during that transition, we were also, as Bob said, able to record customer satisfaction
scores across our stores during that timeframe.
Productivity increased -- from a sales per hour perspective increased 4%, driving the 10 basis points of leverage. We
continue to look for ways to optimize the store labor model to traffic, as well as to maximize any of our non-selling
areas to make sure that we are doing everything we can to drive productivity from those areas and put those hours back
to the sales floor.
We looked at, of course, our delivery productivities, we are seeing improvement there, we are seeing improvement in
capability builds, the technologies that we are deploying and through a scheduling process as we continue to match our
customer employee hours to customer traffic.
So those things, I think, are really helping us from a productivity standpoint and a staffing optimization standpoint,
continue to maximize hours on the sales floor to meet the customer traffic to drive continued improvement in close
rates during those peak times of day.

So I will just talk to the merchandising divisional performance. If you think about the ones that were above the average;
appliances, outdoor power equipment and seasonal living, they were extremely strong, I mean, well into double-digits,
very, very strong.
We had a couple that we felt real good about that don't show up in the above average, tools and hardware, flooring,
millwork, kitchens as an example, were great, great performers. I think where we saw pressure was primarily in paint
and lumber and building material. And so, in lumber and building material, we understand that there certainly was a bit
of a weather impact. We can track that one back. Paint, we saw pressure but we expected it as we worked through the
transition.
Robert Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And Dan, this is Robert. Just a reminder, all categories were positive in the quarter.
Dan Binder, Analyst
Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.
Seth Basham, Analyst
Good morning. My question is around sales trends again, just making sure I understand this a little bit better. Because
even on a two year stack basis, Bob, we saw a pre-market deceleration in trend in April relative to earlier in the quarter.
Is there anything about that month that you can speak to, particularly given the fact that weather in the Northeast started
to improve significantly then?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So, Seth, as I said to the earlier question, a lot of it was driven through discrete weather across the country, not just
Northeast where we saw some seasonal pressure. That was for a couple of weeks towards the end of the month.
However, we have seen trends improve in the seasonal categories in those geographies. So, no real concern from
opportunity to hit the Q2 and 2015 outlook.
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
Yeah. And Seth, I'd just add one thing too as we continue to look at the quarter especially for the North. As Mike said
in his opening comments, we stagger our Black Friday events, so our Black Friday events in the North and the upper
North actually moved into Q2 this year and not Q1. So that's some of the things that we are realizing as well in Q1.
Robert Niblock, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
And Seth, just to bring it into perspective here, this is Robert. If you think about looking out over the balance of the
year and you look at our comp guidance this year, our comp guidance is basically in line with the comps we delivered
last year. If you think about last year coming out of the first quarter, we had 0.9 comps, so we had a big deficit to make

up going over the balance of the year.
Obviously, the first quarter this year we got a 5.2 comp in the first quarter. So we are running ahead of what our
trajectory or what our guidance is for the entire year. So obviously, coming out of the first quarter we feel much better
about being ahead of what we guide to for the year than the position we were in last year when we had a large deficit to
make up so.
Seth Basham, Analyst
Great. That's helpful. And then a follow-up question is just around big-ticket sales. Pretty big deceleration in big-ticket
comps despite double-digit comps in OPE, appliances, seasonal living. Were there categories that you can point to that
drove the deceleration?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
So we did see a pretty strong performance of 7.7% comp is good performance, big-ticket that were driven by OPE and
appliances. We also saw some good movement across all -- moving up across all categories in ticket size. So we really
not disappointed at all with the big-ticket performance in the first quarter. Obviously, there is a lot more momentum in
Q4 last year that drove all categories higher, but certainly not disappointed with the big-ticket performance in Q1.
Seth Basham, Analyst
Got it. Thank you.

Judy Merrick, Analyst
Great. Thank you. And just understand as you are --
Operator
Judy, your line is open.
Judy Merrick, Analyst
Thank you. And just -- as you are looking, as you are dedicating more space to these kitchen suites, have you seen any
more strength across categories aside from appliances?

Page 15 of 18
I will start, Judy, and then I will let Mike jump in on top of that. When Mike talked about the kitchen suites, he is really
talking about relaying the existing space that we had in the department and the way that we are arranging our offering
of appliances into more of the suite versus an individual all washers together, dryers, those type of things. So we
haven't really dedicated more space from an overall appliance standpoint, it's just the way that we're going to market
with those appliance categories. So in that respect, you should see more space allocation impact on other categories.
Judy Merrick, Analyst
Okay.
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
And then, just as an example, some of the categories where we are seeing strength, we certainly saw it in the appliance
business as I mentioned. We see it in cabinets as an example by having the kitchen suites that are now in the stores
sitting next to cabinets. As customers start to engage in some of those remodel projects in the kitchen, it's easy for them
to shop our stores and pull that project together.
We saw strength in areas of flooring as well, and so, we are pretty optimistic on how the customer is engaging with us
to continue to execute through those kitchen projects. I think -- and I don't know if you want to talk to the project
specialist performance as well, Rick, which is also a good indicator.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. As we say Judy, the interiors or services business grew above the company average for the quarter. So we still
see continued strength across our services business. In particular, we continue to see our exteriors and interiors
programs work extremely well which benefits from the experience creation that we are doing across categories.
And I think one of the big things that Mike and Robert highlighted is, again, it is important to understand as we talk
about suites, we are not talking about extended cabinet space, we are talking about how we display the appliances
together in the appliance department and pulling together the appliance, the range, the dishwasher, the microwave into
a set where they are actually showcased together versus being spread across the appliance department, which makes it
easier for the customer to visualize that set in their home.
Judy Merrick, Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar.
Jaime Katz, Analyst
Hi, good morning. Can you guys just clarify the 3.8 billion of share repurchases? Is that with the debt issuance or could
there be some incremental repurchases with additional leverage?

Page 16 of 18
So, we do plan to issue incremental debt during the course of the year as we manage to the 2.25 times target. So, our
outlook does contemplate managing up to that target relative to the 2.11, we finished first quarter to achieve $3.8
billion. That was our guiding target and we will continue to assess that as the year progresses, but that's where we sit
today.
Jaime Katz, Analyst
Okay. And then I know that it was commented that flooring was slightly below average. But I am curious if you guys
saw any benefit from the brand equity at Lumber Liquidators falling a little bit? Was there any sort of traffic uptick in
the category that you guys saw as negative publicity surrounded sort of your peer?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
I don't want to talk to our competitor, but what I would say is that our flooring business performed very well and when
we look at the categories under flooring, we did see strength in laminate. We saw good performance in tile and there
was a little bit of pressure that we saw in carpet. And we are always sensitive to watching carpet because we have a
very strong carpet offering, in particular with our STAINMASTER which is an exclusive brand.
Jaime Katz, Analyst
Okay. And then lastly, with inventory turns, they were able to tick up despite West Coast port issues. Do you guys have
any thoughts on where you think that metric could go maybe closer to the end of the year?
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So we are targeting roughly similar growth that we saw in Q1, 15 to 20 basis points improvement for the year in
inventory turn improvement.
Jaime Katz, Analyst
Okay, thank you.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Thank you. Regina, we've got time for one more question.

Our final question will come from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.
Budd Bugatch, Analyst
Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I guess, I'm still confused a little bit about the merchandising
performance, because I don't ever remember seeing it so lopsided with above average and below average categories.
And maybe you can just shed a little bit of light because I know we had strong performance, I think we call that in all
three of the above average areas. Is there any reason to be concerned about that performance and help us maybe

Page 17 of 18
understand that?
Michael A. Jones, Chief Customer Officer
I can talk to that, Budd. The appliances, outdoor power -- it's the simple math, the appliances, outdoor power
equipment and seasonal living are up extremely strong compared to where the average is, and we looked at this a
couple of times as well. If the appliance outdoor power equipment and seasonal living weren't in strong, strong
double-digit like we have, then the spread wouldn't be as broad as it is.
When we go through each of the divisional performances and we look at which ones fell just below the average as a
result of the strength that we saw in the above average, as I said earlier, tools and hardware, flooring, kitchens and
millwork did extremely well, extremely, extremely well. And where we saw real pressure was in paint and lumber and
building materials specifically.
So I wouldn't be worried about the spread. I think for us the bigger question was could we take in this much of the
appliance business and outdoor power equipment business and still manage to a flat gross margin and we are very
comfortable that we are able to take in that much market share and hold gross margin about flat.
Budd Bugatch, Analyst
Okay. All right. That's helpful. Also I heard LowesForPros is doing well, but I'm not sure if I heard anything about the
pro penetration or if you heard or quantified any of that any way toward sales or how do we look at that?
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Budd. This is Rick. We continue to be very pleased with our performance in Pro as Pros continue to respond to
our value statements or five ways to save, as we continue to get the great brands into our stores and continue to get
those areas working for us. We still see great performance.
When you look at Pro, it was in line with the company from a total sales perspective. We still see solid growth in
applications for credit, which to me is a leading indicator of the strength of the category and what we are doing, so we
still saw solid growth from that.
As well as when you look at both ticket ranges as well as comps by tickets size, the Pro categories grew at positive
performance across all ticket sizes and all ticket ranges. So, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Pro
especially as they continue to respond to our initiatives and our brand offering but overall it was still in line with the
company performance.
Budd Bugatch, Analyst
And, Rick, the penetration as a percentage of sales? I think you quantified it last quarter.
Robert F. Hull, Chief Financial Officer
Stayed the same at 30.
Rick D. Damron, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah. Right at 30, Budd.
