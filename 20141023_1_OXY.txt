Christopher G. Stavros
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We generated core income of $1.2 billion for the third quarter of 2014
resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.58, a decrease from both the year-ago quarter and the second quarter of
2014. The decline in core earnings was attributable mainly to lower realized oil prices on a worldwide production and
the sharp decline in trading performance on a sequential quarterly basis.
For the fifth consecutive quarter, we continued our strong domestic oil production growth. We met our guidance and
achieved a year-over-year domestic oil production increase of 20,000 BOE per day or about 8% led by our Permian and
California assets. We also repurchased 4.7 million shares of our stock during the third quarter and ended the period
with $2.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet.
Oil and gas core after-tax earnings for the third quarter of 2014 were $1.1 billion, $90 million lower than the second
quarter of this year and $236 million lower than last year's third quarter. For the third quarter of 2014, total company oil
and gas production volumes averaged 755,000 BOE per day, an increase of 19,000 BOE in daily production from the
second quarter and 6,000 BOE per day from the same period a year ago which excludes production from the Hugoton
assets for all periods.
Our third quarter 2014 realized oil prices of $94.68 per barrel fell by $5.70 compared to the second quarter realizations
of $100.38 a barrel. In the third quarter of 2014, after-tax core income for our domestic oil and gas operations was $538
million. On a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis, results at our domestic operations were negatively impacted by
lower realized prices across all products. Improved volumes, however, offset roughly a quarter of the earnings decline
caused by lower prices.
On a year-over-year basis, domestic operations declined by $252 million after-tax, which reflected the impact of lower
realized oil prices, partially offset by increased oil production volumes. The lower realized oil prices were impacted by
the large differentials we saw in the Permian Basin. Willie Chiang will provide a more in-depth discussion around
Permian differentials later on in the call.
Total domestic oil and gas production averaged 475,000 BOE per day during the third quarter of 2014, up 11,000 BOE
per day sequentially. Domestic oil production was 282,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, a new quarterly
record for Oxy. Domestic oil production volumes increased by 20,000 barrels per day from the year-ago quarter with
our Permian Resources business growing its oil production by 26% to 43,000 barrels per day. On a sequential
quarter-over-quarter basis, total domestic oil production growth was 6,000 barrels per day.
International after-tax core income was $624 million for the third quarter of 2014 with results improving by 8%
sequentially due to a lifting in Iraq, which had none in the second quarter, and higher sales volumes in both Colombia
and Qatar. Income for our international oil and gas operations remained about flat versus the year-ago period.
International oil and gas sales volumes rose by 4,000 BOE per day on a sequential quarter-over-quarter basis. The
improvement was largely due to higher volumes in Colombia, which experienced fewer pipeline incidents in the period.
Oil and gas cash operating costs were $14.89 per barrel in the third quarter of 2014 compared to $14.68 per barrel in
the second quarter. Taxes other than on income, which are directly related to product prices, were $2.64 per barrel for
the third quarter of 2014 and $2.80 for the first nine months of the year. Third quarter exploration expense was $53
million.
Chemical third quarter 2014 pre-tax earnings were $140 million compared with second quarter results of $133 million
and $181 million in the year-ago quarter. Although slightly below our guidance, the sequential improvement in the
third quarter was due to higher caustic soda prices and volumes along with lower natural gas costs offset by lower

vinyl's margins resulting from rapidly escalating ethylene costs. We expect our fourth quarter pre-tax chemical earnings
to be about $115 million, reflecting a seasonal slowdown due to the combination of maintenance outages, holiday
shutdowns, and some customer initiatives to reduce year-end inventories.
Midstream pre-tax segment earnings were $125 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to $219 million in the
second quarter and $212 million in the same period a year ago. The 2014 sequential quarterly decline in earnings
resulted mainly from much weaker trading performance driven by sharp commodity price movements during the
period. Partially offset by higher income from power generation and the domestic pipeline businesses.
In the first nine months of 2014, we generated $8.6 billion of cash flow from operations before changes in working
capital. Working capital changes decreased our cash flow from operations by $416 million to $8.2 billion. 2014
year-to-date cash flow from operations declined by approximately $1.6 billion compared to the same year-ago period.
The first nine months of 2014 included tax payments of $570 million related to the gain of the sale of the PAGP units
and our Hugoton assets in the first nine months of 2013 included the collection of a tax receivable.
Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2014 were $7.3 billion net of partner contributions. Our capital outlays
included $410 million associated with the Al Hosn gas project and $275 million for the BridgeTex pipeline.
During the first nine months of this year, we received proceeds of $1.3 billion from the sale of our Hugoton assets and
spent about $425 million toward domestic bolt-on acquisitions. We issued $1.6 billion of commercial paper during the
latter part of the third quarter as part of our short-term cash management process, which has already been repaid. After
paying dividends of $1.6 billion, buying back $2.1 billion of company stock and other net flows, our cash balance was
$2.9 billion at September 30. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 16% at quarter end. Our 2014 annualized return on
equity was 12%, and return on capital employed was around 10.5%.
Earlier this month we received cash proceeds of approximately $5 billion from the bond offering completed by
California Resources. IRS rules mandate that the use of these proceeds be restricted to share repurchases, dividend
payments, or debt retirement. We will be receiving an additional $1.2 billion of cash from California Resources
concurrent with the spin-off in late November. The use of these proceeds will be unrestricted.
The worldwide effective tax rate on our core income was 40% for the third quarter of 2014, and we expect our
combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter to remain about the same.
Lastly, I'll outline some guidance and a few points on our reporting disclosures for the fourth quarter. Due to the recent
sharp decline in oil prices and the completion of the California spin-off at the end of next month, it will be difficult for
the financial community to predict our earnings per share for the fourth quarter. When Oxy completes the spin-off of
California Resources at the end of November, we will reclassify the financial and operational results to discontinued
operations for our core results disclosure.
As such, our fourth quarter core income will exclude all of California results and income on a reported basis will
include two months of California results. Total year results on a reported basis will include 11 months contribution
from our California operations classified as discontinued. Included in the IR supplemental schedules is a pro forma
table segregating Oxy's sold and spun off domestic production from our ongoing operations for the historical quarterly
2013 and 2014 periods.
For the fourth quarter, we expect to see continued production growth from the Permian Resources. In addition with the
start up of the BridgeTex pipeline, Oxy will capture a portion of the spread between LLS and WTI Midland on
approximately 200,000 barrels per day of oil transported to the Gulf Coast. Willie will discuss the benefits of the
BridgeTex start-up in a few moments.
We expect our international volumes to increase in the fourth quarter with the Al Hosn Gas project coming online and
the positive impact of volumes for our production sharing contracts that are sensitive to the decline in oil prices. On a
go-forward basis, excluding California, price changes at current global prices affect our quarterly earnings before
income taxes by $29 million for $1 per barrel change in oil prices and $6 million for $1 per barrel change in NGL
prices. A swing of $0.50 per MMBTU in domestic natural gas prices affects quarterly pre-tax earnings by about $15

million. These price change sensitivities include the impact of production sharing contract volume changes on income.
Our fourth quarter 2014 exploration expense is anticipated to be about $60 million pre-tax.
I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen who will provide an update on some of our strategic and growth initiatives.
Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Chris. The overall business is operating well and our increased investment focus in the Permian Resources
operation is evidenced by the 24% year-over-year growth in total production. Other long-term investments such as the
BridgeTex pipeline and the Al Hosn Gas project should also begin contributing to our results in the current quarter.
We continue to make steady progress towards furthering our strategic initiatives outlined a year ago. The spin-off of
California Resources is on track and we expect to distribute approximately 310 million shares of the new California
company to Oxy shareholders at the end of November. California Resources completed its debt financing earlier this
month and distributed approximately $5 billion in cash to us as a tax-free dividend on October 9. The dividend of $1.2
billion in proceeds from the term loan credit facility will happen concurrent with the spin-off.
After the spin-off and for a period lasting up to 18 months, Oxy will retain approximately 75 million shares of the
California company. At some point during this period we intend to conduct an exchange offer for the remaining
California shares for Oxy shares, further reducing our own shares outstanding.
Over the years, Oxy has made significant investments in California oil and gas and has built a solid business. With the
separation of these assets, the California operations will be classified as discontinued. The resulting impact is expected
to provide lower unit rates for cash operating costs, DD&A and F&D costs for Oxy as well as improved reserve
replacement ratios on both a historical and an ongoing basis.
Regarding our interest in the Williston/Piceance Basins, given the current product price environment, we plan to
operate these assets with less capital in order to generate free cash and shift our investment towards our higher growth
and higher return operations in the Permian Basin.
In the Middle East, we continue to make progress in negotiation with our partners towards a partial monetization with a
goal to improve the business's ability to grow profitably from a somewhat smaller base. Over time we expect to achieve
a similar balance in our asset mix, with roughly 60% of oil and gas production coming from the United States. Over
time we also expect to monetize our remaining interest in the GP of Plains All American Pipeline, which is currently
valued at more than $4 billion, in addition to some other midstream assets when market conditions warrants.
We expect to generate a large amount of cash proceeds from the initiatives I've mentioned. While we expect the bulk of
these proceeds will be used to repurchase our own shares, we also hope to invest in the business through attractive
bolt-on acquisitions in our core area of the Permian Basin. Opportunities may exist for accretive property acquisitions
that have current production and growth prospects and also complement our existing acreage. We have no intention of
acquiring public companies since their current pricing reflects high oil prices and a near-perfect outcome for
production.
Since the end of the third quarter of 2013, we have repurchased approximately 31 million shares of the company's stock
for nearly $3 billion. The board recently authorized the repurchase of additional 60 million shares of the company's
stock, leaving the program with 76 million shares. We are currently undergoing our annual capital budgeting process
and are mindful of the recent decline in oil prices. A significant amount of long-term investment including the capital
for BridgeTex pipeline and the Al Hosn project is nearing completion. We expect our overall capital program to decline
in 2015 given the absence of California and the completion of multiple long-term projects. We also expect significant
decline in our spending in the Middle East as we begin to reap the benefits of some of our earlier long-term
investments.
The vast majority of capital budget next year will be allocated to our domestic oil and gas drilling operations, where we
will maintain flexibility in our budget. We also expect that since the service companies were happy to raise prices when

oil was going up, that they would be just as happy to have their prices lower in the future.
Some of the reduction in the program in our long-term project will be allocated to profitable growth opportunities in the
Permian Resources, Midstream and Chemicals. If lower crude oil prices persist or fall further, we will adjust our capital
program to manage within our cash flow probably by reducing or not growing as quickly in the back half of the year.
We plan to provide more detailed capital program for 2015 during the fourth quarter earnings call early next year.
Excluding California, we expect to see an acceleration of total oil and gas production growth in 2015 given the ample
opportunities for capital deployment in the Permian Resources and the ramp up of production from Al Hosn. In the
United States, we expect Permian Resources to deliver production growth of at least 20% in 2015, primarily from oil.
We expect the Resources business to exit 2014 at over 80,000 BOE a day and to exit next year at over 100,000 BOE a
day. Our total domestic production, excluding California, should grow 5% to 8%, reflecting a modest decline in our
natural gas and NGL volumes.
In the Middle East, first production of the Al Hosn Gas project is anticipated later this quarter. Oxy's net share of
production is expected to ramp towards 60,000 BOE a day during the first half of next year. Company-wide and
excluding California, we expect our total oil and gas production to grow 8% to 10% next year.
While a recent sharp decline in oil prices may provide some headwinds to the business in 2015, our commitment to a
conservative balance sheet with low-cost oil production gives us confidence in our operations and the capacity to make
targeted property acquisitions. We expect our cash balance to exceed our total debt by the end of this year. Oxy is built
to thrive in an environment where our core property is in the Permian EOR business and production sharing contracts
in the Middle East, which provides relatively stable cash flow.
Following the execution of the California spin-off, Oxy's philosophy of disciplined capital allocation will continue. Our
core business will continue to focus on delivering moderate volume growth, generating higher earnings and cash flow
per share as well as improved financial returns. Our Permian Resources business will represent the key area of growth
within our domestic operations.
I'll now turn the call over to Vicki Hollub for an update on our activities in Permian Resources.
Vicki A. Hollub
Thank you, Steve. In last quarter's call, I discussed our progress toward reaching 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day of production in 2016 by achieving the following goals: first, correlating rock and fluid properties to production
performance across Oxy's entire Permian acreage position; second, optimizing development strategy and design to
unlock full primary development potential, and third, efficiently accelerating full scale development and production
growth.
We made significant progress on these goals in the third quarter, and continue to improve and optimize our simulation
designs for each build and bench. In addition to testing slick water and hybrid fluid systems, we are testing and
analyzing other key variables such as pumping rate, pad volumes, proppant type, proppant concentrations, surfactants,
cluster count and spacing, clusters per stage, and alternate technologies to plug and perforate. Our efforts are driving
significant improvements in well productivity in our Delaware and Midland Basin assets.
In the third quarter, Permian Resources had daily production of 77,000 BOE per day, which is a 7% increase from the
72,000 BOE per day that were produced in the second quarter. We produced 43,000 barrels of oil per day for the third
quarter. This is a 26% increase from a year ago and an 8% increase from last quarter. During the third quarter, our
capital expenditures were $472 million. We operated 24 rigs and drilled 75 wells including 44 horizontals. We placed
71 wells on production including 36 horizontals.
The number of wells drilled and placed on production was adversely impacted by delays attributable to flooding which
occurred in September. This impact reduced the number of horizontal wells placed on production by approximately 10.

We've increased the number of frac spreads in the fourth quarter to address the additional carry in well inventory. In the
fourth quarter, we plan to operate an average of 30 rigs and exit the year with 34 rigs. We expect to drill 80 wells and
place 75 wells on production including 48 horizontals.
Before discussing the third quarter activity in greater detail, I would like to share some more information regarding the
drilling potential we see on our acreage. Oxy's unconventional plays in the Permian are spread across two million acres
in the Midland Basin, Central Basin platform, Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Our teams continue to utilize our
extensive knowledge in appraisal work to characterize prospective benches and target landing zones within each bench.
To date, we've identified approximately 7,100 potential well locations. Overall, more than 92% of the locations are
horizontal, and our results confirm the economics of horizontal wells exceed most vertical wells.
In the Delaware Basin, we have currently identified 4,250 horizontal locations with 1,450 in the Wolfcamp A and B
benches. The majority of these locations are in our operated areas in Reeves County. The Bone Spring potential is
equally as significant, with 1,500 potential locations. These are primarily located in New Mexico and could increase
with further success in Texas.
In the Midland Basin, we've identified 23 (sic) [2,300] (22:15) horizontal locations and 1,050 of these are in the
development phase, targeting the Spraberry, Wolfcamp A and B benches. We are highly encouraged with the recent
results of these benches achieved through our frac design optimization and increases in lateral lengths.
In the Delaware Basin, we operated 11 horizontal drilling rigs and one vertical drilling rig in the third quarter. We
drilled 41 wells and placed 40 on production. In our Barilla Draw acreage, we placed eight horizontal wells on
production in the Wolfcamp A and B benches. These wells achieved a peak rate of 1,355 BOE per day and a 30
day-rate of 1,067 BOE per day. Our Ryman 14 #5H well achieved an average peak rate of 1,600 BOE per day and a 30
day rate of 1,365 BOE per day.
We completed our first Delaware zipper frac on the Anna Katherine #5H and #6H, reducing completion costs by
$700,000 due to the efficiency gain from simultaneous operations. These two wells achieved an average peak rate of
1,600 BOE per day and an average 30 day rate of 1,225 BOE per day. The production rates achieved on our wells
placed on production in the third quarter are significantly above our first half 2014 rates. This increase is directly
attributable to the breakthroughs we are achieving in our optimization program including increasing sand
concentration, lengthening laterals, and optimizing cluster spacing.
Additionally, our Wolfcamp A wells are matching the 900,000 BOE type curves and production from our horizontal
wells in the Delaware Basin is averaging 89% total liquids, 77% oil.
Our appraisal efforts in the second Bone Spring and Wolfcamp C benches in the Delaware Basin continued in the third
quarter. We're exciting to see enhanced performance from the Bone Spring and anticipate further gains as we
incorporate learnings from the full core we acquired in the third quarter. These learnings will drive improvements in
2015. Additionally, we are encouraged by recent results achieved in the Wolfcamp C. Our Totsy 206H well achieved
an average initial rate of 1,356 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 912 BOE per day.
In the Midland Basin, we operated eight horizontal drilling rigs and four vertical drilling rigs during the quarter. We
drilled 34 wells and placed 31 on production. We are very encouraged by the results in the Spraberry bench and plan to
accelerate development of this bench in 2015. During the third quarter, we placed the South Curtis Ranch 3526H well
on production, this well was completed in the Lower Spraberry bench and achieved an average peak rate of 934 BOE
per day and an average 30 day rate of 913 BOE per day. We have two additional Spraberry wells on flow back with
initial production results that look similar to the South Curtis Ranch 3526. These wells are exceeding the 700,000 BOE
type curve.
In the Spraberry Wolfcamp A and Wolfcamp B, we placed 11 horizontal wells on production in the third quarter with a
peak rate of 731 BOE per day and an average 30-day BOE rate of 541 BOE per day. Production from these wells
averaged 91% total liquids, 81% oil. We continue to gather and evaluate cores, cuttings, advanced logs, microseismic,
tracers and pressure data to link reservoir characterization to well performance. We have recently acquired 474 feet of
continuous horizontal core from one of our Wolfcamp B wells. This will allow for better definition of lateral reservoir

lithologic variations and enable us to tune those differences to open-hole logs to optimize placement of perforation
clusters and improve frac design. We're making significant progress in our design optimization efforts and are
confident this will translate into further improvements in well productivity in upcoming quarters.
For example, at Dora Roberts, we drilled a 10,000 foot lateral in the Wolfcamp B bench. This well, the Dora Roberts
4027H achieved a peak rate of 1,437 BOE per day and a 30 day rate of 671 BOE per day. This well is exceeding the
650,000 BOE type curve. Additionally, we recently drilled the Hendrix 1H well at Guitar that achieved an average 30
day rate of 775 BOE per day.
In closing, Oxy's program in 2014 is designed to delineate and appraise our acreage in order to maximize both ultimate
recovery and financial returns. We continue to make rapid progress translating the knowledge gained in our appraisal
efforts to create value from our own conventional acreage. We have positioned the required resources to execute
accelerated development in 2015 but maintain the flexibility to optimize our portfolio and pace. We're on target to
deliver a 15% to 18% production growth in 2014 and remain confident that we will achieve our target of 120,000 BOE
per day in 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Willie who will provide you an update on the Permian marketing strategy.
Willie C. W. Chiang
Thanks, Vicki. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to just take a few minutes to briefly update you on our midstream and
marketing strategies in the Permian. It's particularly important in today's market environment to maximize realized
value for our production and our strategy to do so is primarily by ensuring access to markets. Now I spent some time
last earnings call on our midstream strategy to show you how we're trying to develop and secure takeaway capacity in
the Permian Basin. I have a slide 29 that shows our strategy, which is really focused on two new key takeaway points,
Colorado City, which is the origin of the BridgeTex pipeline, and Midland South, which is the origin to key third party
pipelines, Longhorn and Cactus. These takeaway points complement our Centurion gathering system by providing us
the additional access to multiple markets.
Now as you're aware, the BridgeTex pipeline commenced service this September, and together with the start up of
some additional pipelines in the next few months, we expect differentials to return to levels that will reflect the
marginal cost of transportation.
Slide 30 shows the pricing differentials for Midland WTI versus LLS. During takeaway constraint periods, you can see
the LLS Midland differential widened to $30 a barrel and has averaged approximately $16 a barrel over the past four
years. In 2014, the LLS Midland differential has averaged $12 year-to-date, and today, it's currently roughly $10 a
barrel.
Our unique upstream and midstream perspective to the Permian Basin has enabled us to be a driving force behind the
construction of new pipeline infrastructure as well as takeaway capacity from the basin.
Slide 31 shows how we view the key value components for infrastructure projects such as BridgeTex. As a standalone
pipeline investment, we look at tariff revenue to ensure a solid return consistent with our targeted rate of return for our
domestic midstream projects. This can generate cash of roughly $1.00 to $3.00 a barrel. Second value driver is when
we enter into long-term and cost advantaged transportation commitments on pipelines as a shipper. This gives us
sufficient access to markets compared to other transportation routes and options. Depending on the project, advantaged
tariffs can add another $1.00 to $3.00 a barrel of incremental value.
However, the point I want to make is that the critical value for Oxy is really to avoid discounted prices that result from
infrastructure constraints and unplanned outages. The value is significant, and if you look at the past four years can be
$10 a barrel or more.
Now our significant takeaway commitment on BridgeTex is a great example of how we capture this value, and in
today's market, is roughly $1 million a day for Oxy. Our Permian Basin strategy utilizes all these value drivers to reach

Now this really positions us well to continue to grow our production, maximize realized prices, and capture market
opportunities.

Hey. Thanks, Willie. And, Denise, we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come
from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Steve, my first question is most of your large-cap E&P peers are
increasingly live within cash flow or more limited by their balance sheets. Given Oxy's under-levered balance sheet
versus anybody, other than a super major, would you be willing to outspend cash flow in a downturn as a method to
right size your balance sheet? Really I guess what is the right or targeted capital structure for Oxy moving forward?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, first, I would argue, we're better capitalized than the majors. So I think they're over
leveraged, myself. But anyway, I think as Chris pointed out, we're going to have a lot of cash at the end of the year
from a variety of sources, mostly from the California business. Some of that, of course, will be used to reduce our share
count, maybe the bulk of that to reduce our share count. We continue to look for opportunities to grow the business, in
the Permian, through investment. Our drilling program may be in line with cash flow. If we see other opportunities,
small property acquisitions or even medium-sized ones, we'll use our balance sheet to do those, and those would
effectively be an increase in the program in excess of cash flow. So I think we have always had a balance of drilling
and acquisitions. It's more shifted clearly to drilling now, because we have so much to do, I don't think you'll see
massive changes in our leverage, but you will see, obviously less equity in our equity count as we buy down a lot of
stock.
So I think there'll always be a balance. If there was a sharp reduction in oil prices that created more buying
opportunities, we wouldn't hesitate to increase our leverage to grow the business. So I think that from our perspective,
this is sort of good times. I sort of know what to do at $75 oil or less, but I have no idea what to do at $120. So I think
this is really good times for us. It may not be good times for people who use our stock as a proxy for oil price. But as a
fundamental business matter, it's these cyclical downturns is where you use the balance sheet to build the business. I
think that's, I'm hoping a lot of happy talk now, especially from service companies about how this is temporary. I don't
know how anybody knows that.
But if I could predict oil prices, I'd be sitting on a beach in Galveston, wouldn't come to work and wouldn't mess with
this production business. So I think that as a practical matter, this is a volatile time. There may be a recession
worldwide, I don't really know. I don't see that. But a little lower oil prices I think can take some of the buoyancy out of
it and gives us some opportunities to add to our business. So our goal is to grow our earnings per share, our reserves per
share, our cash flow per share through a combination of share reduction and hopefully building the business either
through drilling or acquisitions and maybe both.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Clearly, we're well-positioned for a down market. And maybe a related question, but on buybacks,
you used to have a slide where you built up to a 100 million share buyback. And I guess there's two questions. It's not
included today, if there's any change in thought there. And secondly, when you did the 100 million share potential

buyback, it was determined when Oxy was $100 a share, it's $89 today. All things being equal, it will be lower
following the CRC spin. And at the same time, the elements that are funding the buyback are largely flat. So I guess
how you do think about that, which is approximately about a $1 billion delta, or is it...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We denominate the stuff in shares because that's the way we think about it. How many
shares are we are buying back. We're fairly somewhat disciplined in making sure that we don't buy shares at prices that
are in excess of our finding and development cost. So I think that's the way we sort of look at it. We announce the share
repurchases as we actually have the cash in hand. It's not intended as a forecast of what we might ultimately do. As
more cash comes in hand, you should expect that the share repurchase authority would rise. So it wasn't the 60 million
shares we've added, so we've got 76 million shares I think roughly left to go. You should view that as sort of the
cash-in-hand number, not the ultimate. The ultimate will be dependent on the pace of proceeds from various things. So
I think we're not trying to forecast, we're going say this is what we've got in our hand now. If it turns out that we have
excess money because the price of stock is too low, we'll adjust the share repurchase to higher numbers.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Got it. Got it. I mean, how would we consider a timetable for the buyback, given it's significantly
higher than a level historically? Or is it still just going to be a level-driven program?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's driven principally by the stock price. So we look for buying opportunities in the market
when people become irrational.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Got it. Appreciate it, guys. Thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from Doug Terreson of ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Christopher M. Degner>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Steve, I have a couple of questions about the main E&P business. First, from a strategic
perspective, there's been commentary about divestitures in Oman and other countries. And so whether or not you
comment on assets individually or the position in MENA in general, I wanted to see if we could get an update on likely
strategic outcomes there and/or the environment for monetization in MENA in general, which you've talked about in
the past. And then the second question is, you guys mentioned that Al Hosn's going to start up on time in the current
quarter, which is good. And so the second question is whether it's going come in on budget as well. So two questions.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The second we'll have Sandy answer the budget question, well it's a sort of one-word
answer. But on the overall reduction, it's sort of one at a time. But our objective is the same, one way or another to get
value out of the Middle East business, some by selling it and maybe some by speeding up the cash out of the asset
where it's more difficult. So one way or another we're basically using the business to downsize the size of that business,
make it less important in the company. Still an important part, but it's gonna be a lot of cash is going to come out of that
business one way or another over the next few months.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: And so I think we're going along, it's slower than I would like of course. But to some extent
by being too anxious sometimes you get a worse result than you might get some other way. So Sandy will answer the
question on budget here.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - Edward A. Lowe>: The answer is one word, yes, we are on budget. It's a well-planned project and well-tended.
The start-up sequence has been initiated and we expect to have some product sales in the quarter.

Our next question will come from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Steve, I also have two questions. I guess my first one's for
Vicki. I really want to talk about the Permian or ask about the Permian growth trajectory that you've provided for us.
Your run rate since you ramped up the rig count is about 5,000 barrels a day of per quarter. And I realize it's very
simplistic just to look at the absolute move sequentially, but you are significantly accelerating the rig count and the
backlog, it looks like. So I'm just trying to reconcile a substantially higher activity level with a similar quarterly rate of
growth, at least implied by your projections for the next couple of years. That's my first question. I've got a follow-up,
please.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'll let her answer the question, but I think I wouldn't confuse our expectations with our
promises. There's probably a wide difference between them. Go ahead, Vicki.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah, Doug, originally we had not planned to reach the exit rate this year with 34 rigs, but
we've accelerated our development a little bit. And as you've noticed, we're a little bit behind on some of our wells
completed, but we've added another couple of frac spreads. So now as of first of November, we'll be at seven to address
the well inventory. And with respect to the rigs going forward, we still intend to stay somewhat as per the schedule that
we had showed in our last presentation. We're just seeing a little more opportunity here to get a little bit ahead of the
game.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So this is not a working interest issue or anything like that, Vicki, in terms of subsequent wells
from here having a lower working interest. Maybe you could give us an idea of what that actual working interest is.
Thanks.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Well, we kind of gave you an indication on the slide in the presentation that for the Midland
Basin, generally speaking our working interest is close to 92% overall. And in the Delaware Basin, around 76%
generally speaking.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay. Thanks for that. Steve, my follow-up is really I realize we're going have to wait on the
capital until the end of the year, but just as an order of magnitude, I was wondering if you could help, given all the
moving parts with California going, BridgeTex and Al Hosn largely done. What I'm really trying to get it is how you
think about balancing spending with the dividend as opposed to asset monetizations funding the buyback? How should
we think about dividend policy? And maybe a broad scale of spending for next year, if you could? Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's hard to do the budget right now because there's a number of moving parts and we have
to talk with our partners in the Middle East about the size of the program there. And I'd just as soon not telegraph our
thoughts right now. But I think our Permian program, certainly for the first half of the year, will be what we told people
it would be. I don't expect any real change in that. Some of the other stuff may be tweaked a little bit in some of the
other programs. We just don't know, but as far as the dividends are concerned, I think you go back to the slide we've
only shown for, I want to say 10 years, but I think Chris is shaking his head that it's more. It says after maintenance
capital, which is making the company safe, the next line is dividends before growth.
And so we view our commitment to the shareholders on dividends to be part of our overall commitment. How much
exactly you're going to raise the dividend by, remains to be seen. And you know, there's obviously a little confusion
with the lower oil prices, but I think we've raised the dividend I think for a dozen years. I don't think we're going to
break the [indiscernible] (44:08) next year. And so I assume the dividends will go up. We've got a lot of cash, and a lot
of projects to fund almost anything we want to do, and so I don't think anybody should be concerned. We're focused on
making sure that the drilling program delivers the results it's supposed to deliver. If it delivers the results it's supposed

to deliver, there'll be plenty of money over the next two or three years for dividends, dividend growth, continued
dividend growth, and share reduction, and lots of growth in the business.
So if we deliver the results that we're doing so far and our plans are pretty much on target, there'll be plenty of cash
flow, and I don't think anybody should worry about where it will be a couple of years from now. Next year is going to
be a messy year; you've got comparisons against a company with a different set of assets. We're going to have some
sales of things next year, and the share count is going to be really confusing.
For example, the pro formas now for this year use the average shares outstanding for the year to do the BPS
calculation, which is a lot more than the shares outstanding right now, never mind at the end of the year. So a lot of
confusing numbers over the next year. But I think if you focus, if I were looking at the company, I would focus on our
program in Permian Resources, and our cash generation in the rest of business, and I think we've now fixed the
realization issue out of the Permian Basin that we faced the last three or four years. And unfortunately, we may have
fixed it for everybody in the basin, but certainly, we fixed it for ourselves. So I'm pretty optimistic about where we are
next year.

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from Leo Mariani of RBC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Yeah. Hey, guys. I was wondering if you could address a little bit more of the comment that you
all had made about potentially moderating activity. I think the phrase you guys used is, if oil prices stay here or move
lower and you kind of referred to the second half of 2015, is there any kind of, more granularity you can give around
that? I recognize the budget's not done yet and there's moving parts. I know you have ambitious plans to ramp up the
rig count in the Permian. Is there any scenario you can sort of paint, whether or not you stop ramping rigs in the second
half of the year, would you actually drop rigs? Can you maybe just talk through that a little bit?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think we have any plans to drop rigs. The ramp rate is what we would fool with,
because the businesses would continue to drill wells put them on stream, generates cash, more cash than some people
are outlooking. And so I think we'll be okay, and we certainly have the financial flexibility to weather that. On a
long-term basis, we're fairly optimistic about oil prices over the next year or two. I don't know but I think on a
long-term basis, the industry – well, despite what people say, the U.S. business is not healthy at $70 oil. And so, I think
higher oil prices are in the cards over time.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. And I guess just in the Permian, could you guys maybe talk to what type of well costs
you're seeing on the Midland side as well as the Delaware side?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, Vicki, can probably answer that.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah, depending on the debt in the Midland Basin, we're seeing well costs that are in the $7
million to $7.5 million range for our South Curtis Ranch and some of the areas around that. In the Delaware Basin in
Texas, we're seeing well costs in the neighborhood of $8.6 million to $8.7 million. And our drilling costs have been
improving through some of our efficiency initiatives, but it's really the completion costs that are driving our total well
costs right now. What we've done recently is increase the size of our frac jobs, which is giving us better productivity
and what we think will be better ultimate recoveries. So when you're seeing higher well costs for us, it's because we're
increasing the size of our fracs.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: That's helpful. Is there any kind of, like, approximate lateral length you can sort of put around
those well costs at all?

<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Around the $8.6 million to $8.7 million, that's generally a lateral length of about 4,500 feet to
5,000 feet. And in South Curtis Ranch area, our lateral link is around 6,100 feet.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. That's helpful. In terms of your Bakken and Piceance assets, I guess you had it in your
slides that you guys plan to limit capital there. Could you talk about longer-term plans for those assets? I know you'd
spoken in the past about some of the Bakken properties, and also putting the Piceance assets into a JV for maybe an
eventual IPO. And I guess you also talked about additional midstream sales when market conditions warrant. Can you
maybe just talk through strategically how you're thinking about those assets?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, the issue in the Bakken is it simply doesn't, can't compete for the returns that are
being earned in the Permian. It's not that they're bad assets or anything; it's just not competitive in our portfolio. So –
and the Piceance is all gas, and gas is tough to compete in this environment. So – and I don't see any way to change, I'm
not bullish about gas prices. I don't see any real way to change the relative competitiveness of North Dakota versus the
Permian. We can move oil out of the Permian by pipeline. That's a much more efficient way to move oil than by train.
So I just think that it's just what will not, for our portfolio, won't be able to compete. So ultimately, we'll have to deal
with that.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: All right. That kind of implies an eventual disposition, I would assume, at some point?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, I mean – yeah, sure.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Right now it's a little noisy because...
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Yeah.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: So – it's probably not the perfect time to be doing that.
<Q - Leo Mariani>: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.

The next question will come from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yes. Good morning. An intriguing comment from you there, Steve, just on saying cash flow's
being underestimated. I mean, obviously oil prices make a lot of volatility. But maybe some color on that. Is that
because you think your promise is going to be exceeded by your expectation of volumes? Do you think it's because
cash margins are being underestimated as you shift to drilling in the Permian? Is it Al Hosn? Or is it all three and
something else?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Generally, I think people have underestimated the cash flow that will come out of the assets.
They basically take what we did this year and add 2% or something to it and then adjust for price. The Al Hosn project
will certainly add. There's other things that I think will add. But I think we show you, I think, in this – there's a
difference without – we look different without California. And we give you some numbers to help you model that. We
don't know what the DD&A rate will be next year, because it depends on reserves. But the underlying DD&A rate, for
example, without California in the United States is lower. And so – and same thing with operating costs and other
things. So I think people are just sort of taking the old numbers, because that's really all they had. But I think as you
look at it, maybe a little more careful modeling with the new numbers might be more helpful for people.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Okay. Great. And then a question on the Permian. I mean, obviously, if you look at the
Midlands, you've outlined Dora Roberts, South Curtis. Maybe, I mean these are sweet spots in the northern Midland,
but it's not a huge amount of acreage, but it will be very productive. And then in the Reeves, Barilla Draw area, you've
got these fantastic results again. And that's obviously a larger acreage position. So that drives growth over the next five,

maybe six, seven, maybe even longer years. When I look at the rest of the Permian, and particularly say if oil prices did
have a longer excursion to the downside, how do you think the returns stack up? And I'm particularly looking at the
New Mexico, Delaware. What's the sort of breakeven oil price you need for getting an acceptable return to drill there?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, I get to take a longer view, I guess, because it's a smaller proportion of my age. So if I
look back two, three years ago, what we thought about the Permian Basin, and what we thought internally, forget what
other people were saying, and I look at the programs that have been proposed now, it doesn't even look like the same
company. And I think as we progress, we continue to find new things that we didn't think of before that will add
considerably. I think the business – ultimately, if oil prices stayed low, whatever you want to call the current price at
this level or lower, for an extended period of time, margins historically have adjusted by the reduction of service costs.
I mean, you're not going to get an environment where oil prices stay at say $75, or whatever you think, for four or five
years, and service costs are going to be the same. It just isn't going to work. And so part of the gain sharing and loss
sharing here will be from both parties. So all the money isn't going to just go into service company coffers, and we're
going to work for free. Not just we, but everybody. So I think in the end, it will equilibrate, and we'll generate
acceptable returns.
We think there's a lot of economic oil at $75, economic meaning we earn 15%, 16%, 17% returns. Do I think there's a
lot of economic oil at $50? No, I don't. And somewhere in that range, but it also depends on service costs. But if oil
prices go back to $100 or whatever again, service costs will rebound with that. So I just think that this thing will work
itself out over a one or two-year period. And I hate to say it this way, but I sort of look forward to a little stress and
some of the crazy stuff sort of goes away for a while. And that gives sort of rational people an opportunity.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then a final question, just on the 2015 production outlook, that's very helpful, 8% to 10%.
And you can see obviously the great contribution from Al Hosn, which will probably still have a bit of tail end to
contribution maybe even in 2016, as well. And then obviously reducing activity in the Midcon. Do you think the
Permian, I mean it seems to me in the well results and the activity level, do you think the Permian can provide an offset
to keep that production growth sort of at a similar pace in 2016? Or does it just naturally slow as Al Hosn comes down?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No. Al Hosn won't. Well, Al Hosn will be eventually flat.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: That's what I'm saying [indiscernible] (56:25).
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, but I think at Al Hosn, it's possible that over the next few years the plant is larger
than it needs to be for the deliverable gas, and so, and the country continues to need gas there and the resultant liquids
of course. So I think over time, there'll be an expansion probably, and it's really up to the government. And so there will
be, Al Hosn is not through, so I think as we look at 2017 and 2018 and 2019, we'll see more growth out of Al Hosn, at
some point it will level off, that's true. But I think it'll probably continue to grow. Because once you spent the base
money, the incremental capital will have really good returns, I think. So I think that'll do better. I think the Permian
Resource business has the potential to cover to continue to grow and maybe grow better going forward as we work
through some of the historical issues. So I think we've got more acreage and more will prove up.
The Barilla Draw didn't exist a year ago. I mean, the land did, but the concept didn't exist. And so I think there's a lot of
good concepts out there. Some will work and some won't. And some are, I think, over-promoted by some but it's hard
to imagine that on 100,000 acres, you're going to have four billion barrels of reserves. But I think rational expectations
are good for the basin. I think the Permian Basin is the best basin in the United States and will be for the next 20 or 25
years.

<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: Good morning. The first question I wanted to ask refers to slide 27, the SCR 3526H
Spraberry well, is the early shallow decline consistent with your expectations? And does this early positive result have
any influence over your Spraberry appraisal plans going forward?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: Yeah, we're still evaluating that South Curtis Ranch 3526 and the shallow decline on that is so
far good news for us, but we still want to see a little more production data from that to determine what's causing that.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: Great. Thank you. And just as a broader question, just looking at your plan as it's unfolded in
the Permian over several quarters, it doesn't really appear to encompass the Central Basin Platform, where some peers
have drilled some noteworthy horizontal wells. I was wondering if you have any horizontal exploration potential in that
area.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: We feel like we have a lot of potential on the Central Basin Platform, and that's just one of the
areas that we have yet to get to. We're working on a fairly structured plan with respect to our exploration, our appraisal
and our development programs. And so what we showed you on the slide that has the breakout of the zones that are
currently under appraisal and currently under development, that list does not include what we're doing from an
exploration standpoint. So our exploration group, one of their key areas to focus on over the next couple of years will
be the Central Basin Platform, where we do have significant acreage and we think there is a lot of potential there. So it
just hasn't gotten in the queue yet, but it's something that we're optimistic about.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: That's a nice problem to have. Thanks very much.

Our next question will come from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Hopefully I'm on. Anyway, quick question on the OpEx side. A
couple of years ago started an OpEx reduction effort obviously it was successful this time around talking about OpEx.
And then last night on the call with CRC, they talked about higher gas prices. I was wondering ex-California if you
could walk us through what sort of the OpEx issues are here and how much of that is due maybe to just temporary gas
price increases and how much of it is a function of maybe changes in what you're doing in the Permian Resources area.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Just as you look at our OpEx, I think there's a cost of energy which is buried in OpEx,
because we use a lot of electricity to run pumps and such. And so some of that's in energy and some of it is basically
driven by the EOR business, where the gas, the CO2 is tied to oil price and they use a little more CO2 and we expense
that, it shows up as an operating cost. And some of it is we increase the work-over activity principally in the EOR
business. So when you look at our numbers for operating costs in the United States, the overwhelming driver is the
EOR business which is basically a low capital business but a little higher operating cost business than, say, the
Resources business, which is a high capital business and a low operating cost business.
So what you see is as we put more CO2 in the ground, as we try to repair the wells, you get more operating costs. And
we try to optimize that. And what we look at is the base, the underlying operating costs, not so much what we're doing
from quarter to quarter. We can't do anything about CO2 prices or anything like that. So I think it's a mix of things, but
the driver for operating costs for Oxy, excluding California, is the EOR business, which is a large business. And its
principal expenses are not capital, but rather operating costs. So it just looks a little different than you might be used to.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: So with California soon to be gone, I mean...
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yeah, we actually show you somewhere. Chris?
<A - Christopher G. Stavros>: Yeah, we gave you a pro forma slide table in the IR schedules that shows pro forma
without California and the Hugoton for cash operating cost, DD&A and some other metrics and also production. So
you can sort of go back and model it off of that and you'll see what happened over that period of time.

<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. We'll do that. And then the other question I had was along the lines of catching up on the
well completions and the addition of the frac spreads in West Texas. Any chance for upside performance in terms of
production there relative to the guidance? Or is that all fully incorporated in the numbers?
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: That is incorporated in our projections for production, so we do expect to catch up and we've
accounted for that.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think what he's asking is have we been conservative in the number or not.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: I'd say that based on the performance we've seen thus far, I'd say that's a conservative number,
actually. It's an achievable number.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Well, that's very helpful. Thank you.

And our final question will come from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning or whatever it is.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Yeah, afternoon, I guess. A couple of high-level strategic questions. Firstly, do you think you've
been behind technically in the Permian? Do you think you can get ahead? And do you think any kind of technical
advantage is sustainable in U.S. unconventional given the commoditization of the activity?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We'll start with, yeah, we're behind. I think somewhere earlier I said if I look at what the
presentations internally were two years ago and I look at the quality and the detail in the current presentations for next
year's program, doesn't even look like the same company. So I think we've made a lot of progress. We're blessed with
good acreage, which compensate for whatever to some extent. So I don't think there's much. I always believe that it's
the acreage or the reservoir that overwhelms over time. Technology spreads quickly so there's no secret sauce that lasts
very long.
So I think as a practical matter, I think we're where we need to be in technology. There's always going to be
improvements. Whether you have relative improvements against other people, I don't know. But over time, the
technology spreads very quickly because we see lots of wells, so it's not really something that's hidden from us. So I
think we're where we need to be from a skill set at this point, we were behind, there's no argument about that. But we
are fortunate that we have an exceptional acreage position which, in the end, the reservoirs matter.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: I guess the argument now would be that you were in early, relatively speaking, and paid less,
but above all the early entry allowed you to get the better acreage. Is there any other proof, by the way, that you have
better acreage? How can we show that?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, maybe Vicki can tell you about that.
<A - Vicki A. Hollub>: I'd like to build on Steve's comments with respect to your first question initially. Technically,
we have teams here with Oxy that I think could compete or beat any other teams in the Permian Basin at this time.
From a success standpoint in the unconventional plays, one of the critical things is to understand what the reservoir is
and what the reservoir's telling you.
We don't believe that these plays should be called statistical plays. We think that you've really got to understand what
the reservoir is. And based on what the reservoir is, you design your completions and your frac jobs. And I think right
now we're probably one, if not the only company, one of the few companies, that's actually taken a horizontal core.
And along with our vertical cores, our 3-D seismic, our microseismic and all the additional work that we're doing

around reservoir characterization, I think nobody in the Basin is any further along than we are with respect to that.
But I think with that said, the industry as a whole still has a lot to learn. We're all very early in this – in the
development of these unconventional plays in the Permian. So I still think that we're going to continue to learn,
technology will continue to advance. And I think that as it does, I expect over time for costs to come down on – at least
from the drilling standpoint and possibly from the completion standpoint. We've got some plans in place over the next
six months to do some things I think that could have a significant impact on our productivity and ultimate recoveries,
but it's just a matter of working those costs to make sure that they're economical for what we want to do. And as I said,
technology over time, the cost comes down, and so I think we'll be able to do some things that will certainly help some
of the areas that previously had not been as good as our Delaware Basin area. So there's – I'm sorry, now I've forgotten
your second question.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: No, I was just saying, if there's some way that we would be able to show easily that your
acreage is superior to someone else's?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, we've got so much of it that's – some of it's going to be better and some not. I mean, if
you compare it to some guy that's got 100,000 acres and that's his whole position, who knows? But I think if you look
at the overall result and you say we started from a standing start two years ago, and we'll pass 80,000 acres at the end of
this quarter, and we'll pass 100,000 acres by the end of next year for sure. So I just look at, from a standing start two
years ago, we'll be one of the biggest producers in this unconventional in no time, when our whole business historically
had been an EOR business.
So I – it's whatever you want to think, but I think there's always somebody who's got 40,000 acres that's real good. The
question is, can you have 2 million acres that's real good? And I think we've got enough 40,000-acre pieces that we
could compete with anybody. If we took one of our 40,000-acre pieces or 100,000-acre pieces and people were saying
what a wonderful company it is, it's as good as the "Snake Company" or whatever it's called.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Good. I have a couple of quick ones, Steve. The investment in Midstream simultaneous with the
sell-down of the GP of Plains All American, I assume that means that you wouldn't be continuing to want to own those
assets long-term. And further to that, does the deliberate naming of Permian Resources – rings a bell with California
Resources. I wondered if that was a potential spin candidate, and I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: On the Midstream, I mean, our goal is to – I think as Willie pointed out, our goal is to make
sure that we get the best possible price for our product and we're not disadvantaged. We've gone through several years
of disadvantage. If we can do that without spending capital to build pipelines, we're happy to do that by committing for
space and reaping the advantages of owning space. And so, I think you should view it as a – its purpose is basically to
make sure we get good prices for oil. If we could monetize, take back some of that capital somewhat some way and put
it somewhere else with new – higher returns, we're definitely going to do that.
As far as the name is concerned, I – that's sort of an accident. I wasn't all that wild about the California Resources
name. But I think that – I don't think you should view it as a spin-off candidate at this point. It needs right now the cash
flow from the rest of the business to accelerate its drilling. And it's unlike California, California is actually a good
business. It's just – but it's in a mature phase where it can be self financing. The resource business needs cash to grow,
and it's just not the right time to even think about something like that.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Thank you very much.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.
