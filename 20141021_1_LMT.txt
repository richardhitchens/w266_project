Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As we review our financial results
and key accomplishments in the quarter, as well as provide a brief update on some of our strategic initiatives. As
today's release details, we continue to drive towards achievement of our full-year goals with another quarter of solid
operational and financial results. Although we continue to face global economic challenges, these results reflect the
execution across all of our businesses, as the corporation continues to operate a very strong level in returning value to
stockholders while providing critical solutions to our customers.
The daily focus and efforts of our team are the foundation of our ability to deliver broad based results across the
corporation, and I thank them for their ongoing contributions.
Turning to our financials, while Bruce will cover the results in detail later, I want to particularly highlight our
continued exceptional cash generation. This quarter, we achieved approximately $1 billion in cash from operations,
bringing our September year-to-date cash generation to over $4 billion.
Strong cash generation is the longstanding hallmark of our corporation and continues to be a differentiator, as we return
cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, while also making appropriate investments in the
business. Our strong and growing cash generation enabled by our Board of Directors, enabled them to approve two key
cash actions this past quarter.
First, we increased our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share and $6 annually. This action represents the 12th
consecutive year that our dividend rate has been increased by double digit percentages.
Second, we also increased our share repurchase authority by $2 billion, bringing our total current share repurchase
authority to almost $4 billion and providing additional flexibility to continue to make future share repurchases. Beyond
the board actions, we recently completed our annual financial planning process and projections of future financial
metrics. I'm excited about the robust cash generation that the plant projects going forward and our ability to implement
strong actions to deploy cash back to stockholders.
In light of our future projective cash flows, we are implementing a new cash deployment initiative, in which we
anticipate reducing our total outstanding share count to below 300 million shares over the next three years. Share
repurchases of this magnitude, coupled with our dividend payments, would result in our returning the vast majority of
annual free cash to stockholders over the next three years and continue our long-standing strategy of disciplined cash
deployment and value creation for stockholders.
Moving to operations. While numerous mission success events were achieved across the corporation, I want to
highlight two major events achieved by our Space Systems business. In September, our team successfully inserted the
MAVEN spacecraft into orbit around Mars. Space Systems constructed this spacecraft for NASA and also provides
flight operations control of the vehicle as it surveys the upper atmosphere of Mars. These surveys will provide vital
data to scientists, seeking to understand how the loss of atmospheric gas to space change the Martian climate and
potentially provide valuable insight into atmospheric dynamics here on Earth.
Another area, where key accomplishments were achieved by space is on the Orion program. This quarter, the inaugural
spacecraft was successfully fueled at the Kennedy Space Center and is progressing towards integration with the Delta
IV launch vehicle in November. The program continues to progress and is in the final stages of preparation for its
initial unmanned test flight, scheduled later this year in December.
Orion remains an essential national asset in returning the capability of manned access to space to our nation in the
coming years. We are proud to be serving as the prime contractor on this program, and progressing on this critical

capability for NASA and our country.
I'd like to briefly switch to international activities and provide an update on noteworthy achievements in this
strategically important area.
Progress this quarter was seen both in new strategic partnerships and new business awards.
In the area of new international partnerships, we opened a new space technology office in the United Kingdom. This
office will expand our in-country relationships with UK companies, government agencies and universities. We are
looking forward to applying our 50 year heritage of space systems expertise to develop opportunities in environmental
monitoring, space exploration, global security and secure space communications.
And we also opened a new space object tracking site in Australia to construct a more detailed picture of space debris
for both government and commercial customers. This site will use electro-optical technologies and will complement
radar tracking systems, such as the U.S. Air Force's Space Fence program that we were awarded last quarter.
Beyond our footprint expansion initiatives, new business awards from international customers this quarter included
receipt of an $800 million contract from the Australian Department of Defence to develop a centralized information
processing environment.
This program will significantly improve the efficiency of data delivery by consolidating the department's 280 data
centers into 14. Additionally, we were very pleased that the Republic of Korea finalized its formal selection of the F-35
for their fighter replacement program and have announced their intent to sign the Letter of Offer and Acceptance
between the United States and Korean governments for 40 F-35 aircraft.
This program is valued at nearly $7 billion for aircraft and associated support activities. These recent actions and
awards are representative of the growing level of activity that our international strategic initiatives are generating.
I'm pleased to report that we are projecting achievement of 20% of international sales content by the end of this year,
achieving a goal we outlined to you a few years ago. Growth in international business content is an essential element in
our ability to generate future sales for the corporation.
Projected international sales growth will help offset the impact of U.S. government budget pressures on domestic sales
levels. With growing international demand expected for our products such as the F-35 fighter and missile defense
systems, I am increasingly confident that our annual international sales content could increase to 25% or higher in the
next few years.
Before turning the call over to Bruce, I wish to note that we are very proud to have recently been named to the Dow
Jones Sustainability World Index and to two Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Change Management Indices. We are
the only U.S. aerospace and defense company to earn a spot on the World Index. And our CDP awards marked the
fourth consecutive year our corporation has been recognized for exceptional performance.
These prestigious awards reflect our continuing pursuit of sustainable practices through innovation, transparency, and
sound governance. They also reflect the broad commitment of our workforce to help engineer a better tomorrow.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through the details of third quarter and full-year financial performance, and our 2015 financial
trend preview. And then, we'll open up the line for your questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thank you, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the web charts that we included in our earnings release today.
Let's start with chart 3 and an overview of the quarter. As I'm sure you're aware, shortly after the second quarter
earnings call, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014, or HATFA, was enacted. And because this
legislation extended the methodology for determining discount rates used for pension contributions established by the

MAP-21 legislation in 2012. It will have a significant impact on our results for the quarter, the year and longer term as
well. We'll describe the impact this had on the quarter below, but we'll also spend quite a bit of time in upcoming charts
describing these future impacts to you.
Sales in the quarter were $11.1 billion, in line with our expectations though down slightly from last year. Segment
operating profit was also as expected at $1.3 billion with our segment operating margin remaining strong at 12.1%. Our
net earnings from continuing operations increased 5% to $888 million. And this is where we first see the impacts of the
HATFA legislation. The effect of the legislation lowers our FAS/CAS income for the year by slightly more than $70
million, and requires a retroactive adjustment in the third quarter, amounting to $55 million or $35 million in net
earnings.
Without this adjustment, net earnings would have increased by 10% to $923 million. We'll see the remainder of the $70
million adjustment hit in the fourth quarter. Our earnings per share from continuing operations increased 7% to $2.76 in
the quarter. And again, these results were dampened by the impacts of the HATFA legislation in the quarter, which
amounted to $0.11 of earnings per share.
Without this retroactive adjustment, our EPS in the quarter would have been $2.87, up 12% in the quarter. Our cash
from operations continues to be very strong with just under $1 billion generated in the quarter, stronger than we had
expected. So I think we had another solid quarter of results and we're well positioned to finish the year consistent with
our guidance.
If you'll turn to chart 4, we'll highlight just how strong our cash from operations has been this year. Our cash generated
in the quarter was almost $1 billion and this represents a 10% increase over our level from a year ago. And on a
year-to-date basis, our results are even stronger with $4.1 billion generated the first three quarters, up 13% over the
comparable time period last year.
Chart 5 shows our cash deployment actions through the third quarter, with dividends to-date of almost $1.3 billion and
share repurchases of approximately $1.7 billion, we've returned nearly $3 billion to shareholders through the first three
quarters, representing 82% of our free cash flow through the same timeframe. And as Marillyn said in her remarks, we
also increased our dividend in the quarter by a 13%, the 12th consecutive year we had increased our dividend level by
10% or greater. This payout level begins with our fourth quarter dividend.
On chart 6, we'll explain the impacts of the HATFA legislation enactment in more detail. As I mentioned earlier, the
legislation was enacted after the July earnings releases and in simple terms, it impacts us by extending the methodology
used to determine discount rates for ERISA contributions that was put in place with the MAP-21 legislation. That
methodology was an attempt to recognize the unprecedented low interest rate environment we were experiencing,
which would have required making significant cash contributions to pension plans.
The impact of the MAP-21 methodology decreases each year and would have phased out by 2016. Under HATFA, this
methodology will now be extended, so they will begin to decrease in 2018 and phase out by 2021. It has the effect of
lowering CAS cost, as well as the ERISA contributions from what they otherwise would have been had MAP-21 not
been extended. As you'll see the impacts of these changes are somewhat mixed. They result in reduced pension funding
requirements in the near-term, but also lower recovery of pension contributions as it lowers CAS costs in the near-term.
And while lowering near-term CAS cost improves our overall competitiveness and lowers the required levels of
customer funding. It also will lower our reported earnings per share in the near-term.
I'll get into more specific detail of these impacts on the next page, but overall, we think these changes provide relatively
neutral economic impact while having a negative impact on near-term GAAP earnings.
Chart 7 provides more detail into how the HATFA changes will affect our pension recovery and funding requirements
over the next three years and these projections are based on the underlying assumptions for our pension plan as shown
on chart 14 in our appendix web charts.
Focusing on the column labeled 'Before HATFA,' we were expecting to recover more than $7 billion through our CAS
pricing between 2015 and 2017. We also would have had $3.5 billion in required contributions over that same period,

resulting in a net $3.8 billion in pre-tax pension cash recoveries. As you can see in the column labeled 'After HATFA,"
we now expect to have CAS pension receipts of $5.8 billion, while reducing our required pension contributions to $1
billion over this time period, resulting in a net $4.8 billion in pre-tax pension recoveries.
As you'll see in a couple of charts, we intend to make this required $1 billion contribution in the fourth quarter of 2014,
creating a three-year pension funding holiday and allowing additional cash deployment opportunities to shareholders
over the next three years.
The bottom two bullets on the chart describe what these changes mean relative to our approximately $10 billion of
pension prefunding amount. By 2017, we will recover just under $5 billion of that amount and by 2020, we will recover
a total of just over $8 billion. With this level of pension recoveries, we would expect our cash from operations to be
greater than or equal to $15 billion over the 2015 to 2017 timeframe.
On chart 8, we provide our updated outlook for 2014. We're maintaining our orders outlook for the year, while we're
ahead of our orders planned for the first three quarters, we have the large C-130J multiyear order plan in the fourth
quarter, which could slip into 2015.
We're providing point estimates for both sales and segment operating profit, as we are increasingly comfortable with
our ability to achieve these levels and both of these are above the midpoints of our prior guidance.
We also provided our usual sales and segment operating profit outlooks by business area in the appendix to our web
charts today. Our FAS/CAS pension income is lower by about $70 million as previously discussed, but we now expect,
our other unallocated expenses to be lower by a similar amount resulting in $5.6 billion of operating profit.
We are now guiding our earnings per share to the high end of our previous guidance at $11.15 per share, which
includes the negative impact of $0.14 per HATFA. And with the additional $1 billion contribution to our pension trust
this year, our cash from operations is now expected to be greater than or equal to $3.8 billion.
On chart 9, we provide our preliminary look at our 2015 financial trends. We expect our 2015 sales level will decline
by a low single-digit rate from our expected 2014 level, a little lower than we previously expected. We had previously
thought 2014 would represent the trough year of sequestration's effect on our top line, but that has now moved out a
year, as we've continued to see downward pressure primarily in our Services businesses.
We expect our segment operating margin will remain strong at between 11.5% and 12%. Our FAS/CAS pension
income grows to about $650 million in 2015, after the effects of the HATFA legislation and assuming the discount rate
remains at 4.25% at year-end 2014. Our return on assets is 8% in 2014 and based on the additional $1 billion in
incremental pension funding in the fourth quarter of 2014. Again, that would allow for no required pension
contributions from 2015 to 2017.
Beyond 2015 with the same assumptions for our discount rate and return on assets, we would expect FAS/CAS income
to continue to grow to about $1 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion by 2017. And because we're eliminating our previously
planned $1 billion pension contribution in 2015, we anticipate increasing our share repurchases to at least $2 billion,
about $1 billion more than the level required to offset the amount of share creep expected during the year. This will be
a good start to reducing our share count level below the 300 million share amount within the next three years that
Marillyn mentioned earlier.
Finally on chart 10, we have our summary. Our third quarter and year-to-date performance continued to be very solid.
Our results leave us well-positioned to achieve the full-year guidance we provided. And we continue our longstanding
commitment to returning cash to our shareholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Shannon?

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just – a couple of quick ones. Just first on the sustainment weakness, you called out in
Aeronautics in the quarter. I wondered if you might give us some color about what that related to and whether that was
tied to in-theater operations or something else?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I'll take that one on, Carter. So the sustainment weakness scenario was really think of it
is predominantly F-16, although a little bit in our Kelly business as well. The F-16, you should think of a couple of
things going on there. We have a couple of large international F-16 mod programs that are starting, but they started
later than we had anticipated or they will start later in one case than we had anticipated.
And while we previously kind of expected to have some existing older mod programs sort of feather into these newer
mod programs, we now have a bit of a lowering point or a trough before we start to see the new programs pickup
speed, and that's what driving the numbers down a little bit in F-16. On the other hand, for the F-22 program, this is a
bit of good news can also be bad news in some respects.
We provide the sustainment of the F-22 aircraft in the field and the aircraft are actually performing better than our
expectations and I believe better than the customers' expectations. And so because of that, because our readiness levels
and the like are up higher than we expected them to be at this point in time. We're actually seeing a diminished level of
spares requirements and other sustainment activity to support the aircraft at that level. So, while that's terrific news for
our products, terrific news for our customer, it does result in a little bit lower sales for us in 2015 than we previously
planned.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. You may begin.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Hey Bruce, a question for you on the cash flow outlook over
the next three years. You're going to do $3.8 billion this year, which includes roughly $2 billion in pension
contributions that won't be there in the 2015 through 2017 period. That would suggest, on average, $5.8 billion and yet
you're guiding to, on average, $5 billion in cash flows 2015 through 2018. Can you talk a little bit about the puts and
takes that are going on with cash flow outlook?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, sure.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Where might we come under? Where might we go over?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Let me try to take shot at that, Jason. So, I think you're – the back of the envelope math
you did would be exactly right, $3 billion with $2 billion pension contribution why wouldn't that equal $5.8 billion next
year? The short version answer to that is think of that as primarily cash taxes. So, the additional $1 billion that we're
contributing in 2014 think of that as about a $350 million swing that we won't get that tax deduction, if you will, in
2015 and somewhat seems old at this point in time, but we also had a tax refund in the first quarter of this year, about
$250 million.
So between the two of those, think of it as, what, $600-ish million or so. And I think we've – the one thing I would add
that may help a little bit in the discussion also is while we are saying greater than or equal to $15 billion, we do expect
2015 cash flow to start with a 5, obviously at this point and time, but I would expect that year-over-year our cash from
operations would actually increase over that number between 2015, 2016 and 2017. So we're actually feeling good
about the statement of greater than or equal to $15 billion.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Safran from Buckingham Research. You may begin.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Let me ask you a different sort of question on cash flow here. Marillyn, I heard in your
opening remarks, and I just want to get a little specific. Previously your stated goal was to return 50% of cash to
shareholders, and I recognized you've been doing more than that. But the $2 billion in share repurchases on the slide
plus the dividend indicates, now you're looking closer towards a 100%, assuming my math is correct here.
So I want to know if thinking about this rate and does it represent a change in your cash deployment strategy, should
we be thinking now that you're going to return more like a 100% of free cash flow to shareholders?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, you've got the math exactly right, Rich, that's exactly how that totals up. And so we
are indicating to you that we are going to be returning more cash to the shareholders over the next few years. As Bruce
just outlined, we're going to have good solid cash flow. And so we intend to be more focused – as we look back, we
have been providing more than 50% for the last few years. But we intend to continue to do that, so we continue expect
– still expect to have strong dividend, we still, then as Bruce has outlined, we're progressing toward a share level –
outstanding shares of 300 million. Bruce, do you want to add anything this?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Rich maybe just a couple of moving pieces that maybe not be readily apparent there.
So we have about – we're probably in the year about 316 million shares or so outstanding. And so we also have, at the
end of the year or as we sit here today, about 6 million options outstanding as well that we would expect to be exercised
over that three year period. Plus as you know we provide executive compensation RSUs plus matching on our 401(k)s
and the like that will probably add another 10 million shares or so. So if you just think of it in terms of what the
absolute number of shares would have to be there, it's probably the 16 million shares to get down to 300 million plus,
some of the creep that we just talked about. So at least as we look at it, and we look at our operating cash flow over the
next three years, I think your math is pretty much spot on. It does pretty much require us to do about 100% of free cash
flow over the next three years and that would be our intention.

Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Bruce, if I assume every segment except IS&GS has the same top line rate of change in 2015
versus 2014 as it did in 2014 versus 2013. I would need IS&GS to be down about 10% just to get the total company
down 1% and the low single digit comment suggests, it could be more than one. Is that kind of the right number for
IS&GS next year or is there another segment that is incrementally worse than what you previously thought for 2015.
And if you could just give a little detail on why IS&GS is still dragging at that kind of decline?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So let me give – maybe just go around and try to touch on all five business areas, at
least at the top line, Noah, because I think they're not quite right in the way you did the math to come up with that
number. So...
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay.

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I think IS&GS, if we looked at 2015, will probably be down mid single digits, maybe slightly
more than that. And that's probably pretty evenly split between our civil and the defense and intelligence lines of
business there. And what we're seeing there is, this is a portion of our portfolio that is – always has been, I should start
with that, but always has been and seemingly has gotten increasingly competitive in nature to the point where we're
even seeing several of our follow-on contracts, where we're the incumbent and we won the follow-on contract. Those
are being awarded at lower levels than the prior contract were being awarded at.
We're also seeing the disaggregation of some contract opportunities into sort of multiple elements of that contract that
enable additional competition. So that's a little different environment than we had expected to be in as we were trying
to forecast what 2015 would look like a year ago, but that's the reality of where we are today. I think the piece that
you're probably missing a little bit is, we're going to be down somewhat in Missiles and Fire Control probably more
than you're expecting. So Missiles and Fire Control, in total, is probably got to be down, about a similar amount like,
maybe a little bit less than IS&GS.
And most of that is because of – we do have a pretty good-sized services business within Missiles and Fire Control, our
technical services business. And that is also experiencing the similar sort of hypercompetitive elements that we're
seeing over in IS&GS, and so that's going down. We're also down slightly or expect to be down slightly in 2015 in our
air missile defense volume. This is both PAC-3 and THAAD, and that's simply reflecting the lower quantities of
missiles that were left a couple of years ago, if you will kind of in the sequestration timeframe, that are finally playing
out in 2015.
I think Aeronautics is probably – and I think, you've got this one right, Aeronautics is probably pretty comparable to
where we'll finish 2014, although that's probably a little lower than we had expected it to be primarily for the reasons
that I described to Carter's question. I will point out that may not be clear. We are down, we always were expecting to
be down in Aeronautics for F-16 deliveries from about 17 in 2014 to about 11 or so. So think of that as like one a
month of F-16 deliveries next year. And that combined with the sustainment activity that I mentioned to Carter is the
reason that we're actually seeing a flat year-to-year situation. What's sort of lost in all of that is we have a pretty
significant reduction in SDD on the F-35 program, but the F-35 production program is growing at faster than a 10%
rate from 2014 to 2015.
Space is down slightly. Next year, you should think of that as sort of low single digits, that's primarily because we had
two launch vehicles that we recognized as sales for in 2014. We'll have no such launch vehicles in 2015. We also have
slightly lower government – we actually had one launch vehicle, but we also have the Orion ETF, which is yet to take
place, that will take place in December of this year. So, that's a higher volume for Orion as well compared to 2015.
We also have lower government satellite volume expected next year, and that's partially offset by the volume from our
Zeta acquisition, but net-net, Space is still down. And then lastly, the one kind of outlier in all that discussion is MST.
And we're actually expecting MST to have potentially a little bit higher sales, maybe low single-digit, higher than last
year, and you should think of that as primarily because of the new start activity on some of our programs such as the
Space Fence program, the Combat Rescue Helicopter, and the presidential helicopter. So, hopefully that gives you a
little more added color there, Noah.

Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Your may begin.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I'd like to hone in on the F-35. It looks like your margin on the LRIP contracts, in aggregate,
was down a little bit year-on-year for the second straight quarter. I'm just wondering if you could highlight kind of
what's – what your expectations are there? Is there any risk reduction activity possible in Q4 and going into next year
and maybe just more qualitatively comment on what's happening? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Joe. I'll take a shot at that. So, I think the primary reason that F-35 looks that way is, we
actually had some risk retirements on the year before that were not replicated in 2014, and we're obviously booking

those now at the higher rate that resulted from those step-ups 2013, but we have no similar level of step-ups in 2014.
Now, actually as we look at 2015, I think the F-35 production volume in part, because we do expect to make some
step-ups next year that we didn't have in 2014.
We would actually expect to see the production volume or the production return on sales actually increase next year as
oppose to decrease. So, we're slowly getting there and it's a bit of a slog to kind of go take a program as large as F-35
from a development to a low-rate initial production to a full-rate production program, but we're getting there. And those
step-ups depend on risk retirement events and the phasing of those things changes practically with every single lot. I am
happy that we've just finished all the F-35, LRIP 5 deliveries and we're going to start delivering LRIP 6 aircraft this
quarter.

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned of Sanford C. Bernstein. You may begin.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: On Missiles and Fire Control, when you look at the next year and backlog, backlogs were
down in this quarter. You talked about the service part of this. But if you look at the sort of the broader business both
not serviced, but both the U.S. and international, since that's a big part of it. Can you talk about how the backlogs look
for those pieces and if you're seeing the order flow come in and the timeframes that you would have expected to? Are
we going to see those parts of the business up some in 2015?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So just to be clear, Doug, you're talking of Missiles and Fire Control by itself and sort of the
international content there?
<Q - Douglas S. Harned>: Yeah, Missiles and Fire Control if you considered the services portion of it, the U.S
equipment portion of it, and then the international part, how are those moving in terms of orders and when we should
see the revenues from those orders?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So Doug, as I said previously, that the technical services piece is definitely going down
and, accordingly, the backlog associated with business is going. That's almost all the U.S. dominated services if you
will. The International business is expecting to increase both backlog and sales going forward. We've already got – in
fact, hopefully, you saw there's – today's announcement we had the turret contract for the UK scout vehicle. This is a
subcontract arrangement to – actually our facility in the UK was awarded today, that's worth about $1 billion, that will
be recognized as an order in the fourth quarter. We also had the PAC-3, order for government of Qatar that occurred in
the quarter. It's already happened. That's about $0.50 billion. And as we look forward, there's quite a few international
air missile defense activities. Those, as you can well appreciate, those tend to be lumpy and little bit hard to predict, but
we would expect backlog in Missiles and Fire Control to grow in 2015 compared to 2014. And we would continue to
expect the international content of both in terms of sales as well as backlog to grow from 2014 to 2015 as well.

<Q - Hunter K. Keay>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Bruce, I was wondering if you could sort of dive in a little
bit about -- talking about the components of some of the margin erosion that you're expecting to see next year at the
segment level. Is this – maybe parse it out for us between how much of it is sort of a pricing issue with regard to sort of
mix shift? Maybe the customers renegotiating some fixed-price contracts that are rolling off or you're just getting some
more development work? Or is it more just sort of a volume driven sort of efficiency issue?

<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I don't think it's as simple as either one of those Hunter. So let me – I probably should
have done this when Noah asked this question. But let me try to address that here with you. So, we're guiding towards
or at least the trend information that we provided, we said we probably come between 11.5% and 12% next year. The
biggest reason for that – the biggest single reason for that is we're expecting close to about $100 million of lower equity
earnings from our United Launch Alliance joint venture. And you should think of that as being probably about three or
so, fewer launch vehicles in 2015 compared to what was launched – or what's expected to be launched in 2014. And it's
also the mix of those vehicles, not every launch vehicle that gets launched by United Launch Alliance has the same
level of profitability. It depends on which vehicle and when that vehicle is actually contracted for. So again, because
the quantities of mix changes, think about it as being about $90 million lower.
We're also seeing lower margin expectations back on the IS&GS from the competitive pressures that we talked about
earlier on the sales discussion. So, I would expect to see IS&GS margins down probably 20% basis points, 30% basis
points, somewhere in that range, about half of it sort of due to competitive pressures that we see that are affecting the
sales as well as the bottom-line there and probably the other half is – and this is probably a little bit of a good new
story, other half of margin pressure comes, because we're – we've won quite a few large international multi-year
contracts. So think of this as programs like the – for the Australian Department of Defense where we're providing the
IT services for them, think of it as a number of command and control programs for international customers. And
whereas, the vast majority of IS&GS business tends to be very short-cycled in nature. These are a little bit more longer
term contracts. And as you might expect, we'll start booking those contracts at lower profit rates, in part, because
they're new customers and they're longer duration contracts as well.
I also mentioned that we have about $50 million of higher expenses next year 2015, because of intangible amortization
and transaction expenses associated with the deals that we are closing this year. And we also have, within that $50
million, about $20 million or so of research and development expenses that are hitting the bottom line for our Sun
Catalytix R&D efforts. This is – you may have read about this, this is our sort of our energy storage, pre-revenue kind
of business that we acquired. It does require some continuing R&D expenditures and this is a non-FAR, non-DoD
business where the R&D hits the bottom line. So, collectively, again, between the transaction expenses and Sun
Catalytix, about $50 million higher next year than last year.
Despite that, I actually went back and looked at what we provided last year at this time and last year, for 2014, at this
time, we were guiding towards about 11.5%. I'll say the same thing this year that I said last year which is, as I look
forward, I think we have similar levels of opportunity to do better as we did in 2014. As we said here, looking at 2015,
but we have to make those happen and that's the reason we have made those happen yet and we'll see how that
progresses throughout the rest of the year.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Thanks for taking my question. Marillyn and Bruce, there's no doubt that Lockheed has a
differentiated core competency in aerospace and, particularly, if you assume that you win the Long-Range Strike
Bomber like we do, but when you look out a few years, at a certain point, you'll have effectively tapped out of the
organic growth opportunities that the Air Force, so to speak, has the offer. And I wonder if you could talk a bit about
how you see the shape of the company evolving in the longer-term. Where do we find the growth from there? Do we
start looking more closely at M&A or do we evolve more into sort of a pure cash return vehicle? What's next?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well I think as you talk about the outlook for aircraft and aerospace, in general, it's still a
very positive for us. We're going to have continue to see F-35 grow well into the future. I mean we often talk about
how it's very similar to the F-16 program. Today we have a program of record of over 3,000 aircraft and the F-16 we
sold something like 4,600 of them and we still have continued demand for the F-16 and that's how we expect the F-35
to go. So while there is a program of record with the U.S. government on the number of aircrafts that they're going to
buy. We have a lot of interested countries, internationally, that have yet to come online in that procurement process.

Lot of partners, as you know, eight partners around the world. Now three FMS customers with Israel, Japan and now
South Korea and we expect additional customers, plus some of those customers are early on in what their needs are,
and I expect that they will look at additional tranches of aircraft over time, much as they did with the F-16 program. So
we'll continue to be a strong aerospace company going forward into the future. It will be a major element of our
business. Likewise, the missile defense arena is going to be a continued demand, that's a very important element of our
business and there is strong demand internationally even as we look at our needs domestically, we expect that there will
be additional opportunities domestically, but if you look at THAAD, PAC-3, Aegis, Aegis Ashore, even MEADS we
expect going forward.
Another area that we're moving into and have invested significantly in and have a tremendous product for is the Joint
Light Tactical Vehicle, that's a big opportunity as we look forward. Littoral combat ship and the work that we're doing
in that arena, there is interested international customers for that. In fact, we just launched the latest LCS in Marinette
Marine this past week and we had international customers that attended that ceremony, so that they could – they're
interested in our products. So we think there will be a demand for that as we go forward.
The C-130J, that aircraft continues to be in demand. We've got a solid backlog of aircraft and we expect that there'll
continue to be others. And now that we've rolled out our commercial version. We expect those commercial customers
that today are flying L-100s to fly the LM-100J in the future. So that will continue to look at variance of the C-130J just
as we have for many, many years going forward.
So, I mean, I've kind of walked around some of the top products in our portfolio, but as Bruce mentioned earlier, big
opportunities in mission systems and components on various other platforms such as the Combat Rescue Helicopter,
the Presidential Helicopter, the MH-60 Romeo that we're selling around the world, that we do the mission systems for –
out of our mission systems – simulation and training continues to be a strong demand for that. And as – over time
they'll continue to be. And as you mentioned, our teaming with Boeing on the Long-Range Strike Bomber, we expect
we're well positioned to win that opportunity.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Stallard of RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much. Marillyn, a question for you. There's been some comments out of DC, that
maybe the U.S. Defense industry is not investing enough of its own money in R&D and perhaps returning too much
money to shareholders. I was wondering if this is a comment that you've heard from your customer and how they might
respond to your latest announcement today on the buyback?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, yes we have heard that from our customer that – a concern by our customer that we
lose our technological superiority in this period of time when there are budget pressures and it's a down market. I would
tell you from the Lockheed Martin standpoint, we have increased our R&D, from last year to this year by 13%, we're
going to increase another 5% this year or so. And we'll continue to – so we're at the highest percent of sales that we've
ever been in terms of our research and development and we'll be higher in 2015. We will continue to invest.
But I do think an open communication with our customer, especially with the Department of Defense, is really
important and we are in constant dialogue with them on what areas that we want to invest in and how that aligns with
what they see as their priorities in the future. A lot of our products, as you know, require a lot of development on the
front end such as F-35 or as we look forward to JLTV that we've talked about, and a variety of them. So as we come
out with products, we're constantly investing. But we're investing in new technologies. We're looking at how do we
help our customer get an advantage over our adversaries. We have things going on that we can't talk about on this call,
but certainly there's a lot of investment in new materials and new capabilities that we think our customers will need.
So yes, we're hearing it. And I think from the Department of Defense standpoint, because they recognize that. I think
they will, in turn, be looking at making sure that they invest in new technology and we expect to participate in that
opportunity.

We do cooperative research and development with universities and with other government labs as well. So when you
look at our percent of IRAD, you have to add to that the things that we're doing there and CRAD type of things. We are
a major provider to DARPA. So the work that we do with DARPA is another other example. So when you total it all
up, you can't just look at one number on the balance sheet, you have to take into account the type of work we do, the
complexity of the products that we produce and how much research and development that takes on the frontend in the
development phase as well as our independent research development in our work with DARPA and our CRAD.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. You may begin.
<Q - Myles Alexander Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping, Bruce, maybe you can touch on the profit
adjustments not related to volume and kind of what's baked into 2015. It looks like, maybe for this year, you'll be
running somewhere 32% to 33%. And then also, if you can just clarify on the sustainability of unallocated expense
being at this level? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So I think you're about right, Myles. I don't quite have the number in my head. But we
were a little bit lower in the fourth quarter in terms of our profit adjustments. So, I would expect that we probably
rebound a little bit at least as we look at the planning for the fourth quarter. I mean obviously those can move out if we
don't sort of accomplish all the events that we hoped to that result in those risk retirements. But as we look here today,
we would expect to bounce back up a little bit, and that would end the year at about the level you said, I mean
somewhere probably in the 33%, 34% of total profitability. I would think next year is probably fairly comparable,
we've kind of tossed out the 30% to 35% as sort of where we expect to be. We're a little bit higher than that last year,
but that's about where we expect to be going forward.
And then as far as the other unallocated, I would not expect it to be quite at the level we are forecasting for this year in
part, because, I mean there's a lot of moving pieces in that as you can well appreciate. But we had some question in
corporate costs, they got resolved in our favor during the quarter. There was a fairly – the largest piece of those moving
pieces and I would not expect that to replicate in future quarters. So this is a bit of an outlier.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - Ross D. Cowley>: Good morning, everybody. This is actually Ross on for Rob. I was just hoping to get a quick
update on the expected timing for the signing of LRIP 8 on F-35 and any of details you could provide regarding that
contract?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, LRIP 8, we are progressing well on the negotiations. So I think that we expect to
see a closure on that in the near term. It's for 43 aircraft, is the number of aircraft in that lot, so we'll see a larger
number of aircraft in LRIP 8.
So we're in – it's progressing very well, and we've had good discussions with our customer, and we expect to conclude
the negotiations in the near term.

much.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So actually, we had two. We said there are contract reserves and probably better stated
is sort of legal reserves. One was to resolve a legal matter and the other one was sort of create a provision for a legal
matter. Two different items, about the same quantity of each of them. So, a total about $30 million in the quarter. I
think we released that in the earnings release.
C-130 deliveries, we do expect to end the year about 24 – we're at about a 24-aircraft build rate and you could possibly
have one slip here and there between years, but I don't expect that to happen in 2014, we're tracking well to that
schedule. And I would think 2015 would be a similar level as the 24 aircraft.
And then, I think your last question was on F-16 and what's the profitability of that. Because we're losing volume of
aircraft quantities, obviously, the profit dollars associated with those aircraft quantities will go down. I wouldn't expect
to see a huge drop-off from a margin perspective year-over-year, because of that, I mean the aircraft quantities that are
being delivered. I still think we'll have comparable margins and the sustainment activity, including the mod work that
we do, is also fairly comparable to the aircraft business that we have there. So it may not be as self evident as when the
quantity drops, the profitability also drops – the margin also drops, because I don't think that's the case there.

Thank you. Our next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. You may begin.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hi. Good morning. Couple...
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: ... little ones up patched together. C-5 deliveries next year and do we get any chance of
getting above the zero margin. And then on the F-35, if you could breakout the revenues by the different LRIPs and if
there is any international revenue starting to pick up next year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, George, I'll take that one. So C-5, we are expecting to increase the rate. You should
– I think we'll do probably six maybe seven C-5s this year. We're actually performing well in that program. I think we
grow that number to about nine expected deliveries next year. So we will see some volume increases associated with
that. I do think – I think there's a chance that we'll see some profitability increases, George, on that, we're performing
much better, as we perform throughout 2014 towards the end of the year than we were even at the start of the year. And
assuming that trend sort of continues into 2015, I think that creates the possibility for that.
I think we talked on our previous call about – there is definitely some what we call over and above work that we think
we have entitlement to that we do believe we can get reimbursed at some point in time, that has not yet played out. But
we continue to believe we have that entitlement, which would allow more than what I'm talking about just through, I'll
say, ordinary program performance improvements year-over-year.
So I'm feeling better about the program going into 2015 than I am – than I was into 2014. The international revenue on
the F-35, it's – the quantities are growing and just roughly, I think, if we were to kind of pull out a number, it's a little
bit out of – off the top of my head. But we're probably somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in international
revenue this year, and we would probably expect to grow that number above $2 billion of the total F-35 revenue for
next year.
So it's growing at a fairly fast clip by itself. Again the program – in total, the production program is growing more than
10% year-over-year from 2014 to 2015. So international, you would expect to do that as well.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Hi, Gary.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Gary.
<Q - Gary S. Liebowitz>: Couple of quick ones. First, for your three year cash flow outlook, how should we think of
capital expenditures over that period?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, you should think of those as being fairly similar to the level we had in 2014, Gary.
We're right at around $1 billion between PP&E, capital expenditures and our capitalized software. And that's about the
level we see in the future. It could be a little less than that, maybe a little more than that. But for planning purposes, I
think we're at about $1 billion a year.
<Q - Gary S. Liebowitz>: Great and my second question, and I apologize if you addressed it already. The sales
outlook in space that you took up to $7.9 billion this year, what was behind that increase?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, we're getting – again, I think at the beginning of the year, we have probably a little
more conservatism for some of the lighter in the year delivery events that were going to occur, including the Orion ETF
launch, which should be pretty spectacular, by the way, on December – in the early part of December of this year. So
that's – that now we feel highly confident that, that's going to occur. That was one of the reasons we're probably a little
more conservative with our guidance early in the year.
We've also made two acquisitions in the year Zeta Associates, which is the larger of the two, and Astrotech, which is a
little smaller, but we're getting additional revenue from both of those as well.

<Q - Joe W. DeNardi>: Bruce, I'm wondering if you could talk about, given some of the budget uncertainty,
obviously, we've had over the past couple of years is – I think there's more confidence that, that bottoms out in 2015.
Does that change the way that you think from a cash deployment perspective kind of balancing the dividend, buyback
and M&A, and clearly the M&A side hasn't been a big piece of it in the past couple of years, is that – do you see that
changing at all over the next few years?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so – boy, I sure hope, Joe, that we do see the bottom out in 2015, that we kind of teed
up we thought that was going to occur in 2014, and we were at least a year off there. So, as we look today, I think that
we do expect that to sort of bottom out for us in 2015, and we get back to a period of growth in 2016. It's kind of what
the budget would indicate. I'm watching, in particular, the FY 2016 budget request and whether or not they sort of stick
within the sequestration levels or actually potentially base it more on the actual threats and the strategic direction that
the DoD needs to go into. I think that's going to be an interesting one to watch.
As far as how that plays relative to our cash deployment? I don't see that having any necessarily large impact on how
we would think of cash deployment activities. I think we've given a little more insight into that by what we talked about
today with the higher share repurchases that we plan over the next three years at least. And as I always say with the
dividends, I think our track record on dividends is the best indicator of what we'll do going forward. So, I'll probably
leave it at that and turn the call back over the Marillyn at this point.

reiterating that the corporation had another solid quarter. And we continue to be well positioned to deliver substantial
value to our customers and shareholders as we progress towards a successful closure of 2014. So thanks again for
