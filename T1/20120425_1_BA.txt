Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we may include in our discussion this morning
are likely to involve risks, which are detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the
forward-looking disclaimers at the end of this webcast presentation.
Now I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everybody. Let me start today by addressing the evolving business
environment followed by some thoughts on our performance during the quarter. After that Greg will walk through our
financial results and outlook, and then we'll take your questions.
Starting with the business environment on slide 2. As the global economy continues to recover, albeit at a slow and
somewhat choppy pace, airline industry fundamentals remain intact. Global demand for commercial airplanes is strong
and growing. Emerging markets are driving the expansion of airline fleets worldwide, growth that complemented by
the ongoing retirement and replacement cycles for airplanes in developed markets.
Passenger air traffic remains resilient, with airline load factors and utilization rates continuing at or above peak levels.
Although cargo traffic remains below long-term trends, it appears that this market is stabilizing, and it is projected to
improve in the second half of the year.
Despite the ebbs and flows of the Eurozone debt crisis, we foresee aircraft financing as broadly adequate throughout
2012. Boeing airplanes are attractive, value-creating assets, and sources of financing for them remain broad and
diverse.
The high cost of jet fuel remains a key concern for our customers and has been focused more than ever on ensuring that
they have the most fuel-efficient airplanes with which to compete, a dynamic reflected in our solid first quarter quarter
total.
The combination of strong market demand and our customer preferred portfolio of products and services that delivers
superior fuel and operational performance positions us exceptionally well for the future. Delivering our record backlog
faster to speed the flow of new airplanes to customers and open additional positions for sale remains a priority.
Production rate increases planned over the next three years will increase our output by more than 40% in support of
these objectives.
While damage from the recent severe weather in Wichita has not had a significant impact on our operations at our
facility there, we are working closely with our major supplier partner, Spirit, as they continue to manage the challenges
of their stressed infrastructure. We will continue to assess this evolving situation. However, we believe the impact to be
manageable.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security. Declining U.S. defense budget and shifting program priorities continue to
pressure domestic markets. We were generally pleased with how Boeing programs fared in the president's fiscal year
2013 budget request, which contained strong support for the majority of our programs, including the F/A-18, P-8A,
Chinook, Apache and Osprey. We also see clear alignment in the proposed budget and the Defense department's news
strategic guidance with several of our targeted growth areas, including space, unmanned, ISR and cybersecurity.
We have been anticipating and preparing for a declining defense environment for several years. While the potential for
sequestration has created additional uncertainty, we believe we are well positioned for continued success with our
portfolio of proven, affordable and reliable systems and services; our focus on innovation and strong execution across
our programs; and our relentless effort to maximize efficiencies and reduce infrastructure costs.
Furthermore, we continue to foresee significant upside potential in growing international markets where we have made
substantial share gains in recent years and expect to generate up to 30% of our revenues just a few years from now.

In the first quarter, we went under contract for 84 new F-15s for Saudi Arabia, which will keep the F-15 viable for new
sales for many years. And we secured several important C-17 foreign sales. These and other international orders led to
a 20% increase in backlog for our Defense, Space & Security business.
Overall, despite pockets of economic uncertainty and U.S. defense budget pressures, the size and strength of our
markets remain attractive and growing in the aggregate. Our total company backlog increased $24 billion in the first
quarter and is broadly diverse by region, product type and customer. We anticipate this orders trend will continue and
we expect a book-to-bill ratio greater than one in both of our main businesses this year.
Turning to the first quarter highlights on slide 3. We delivered strong operating performance across our core production
services program in the first quarter while achieving some key milestones in both commercial and defense. Commercial
airplanes generated healthy margins of 9.9%. We delivered 137 airplanes, including five 787s and six 747-8s, and we
recorded net orders for 412 airplanes, including 301 firm orders for the 737 MAX. Customer response for the 737
MAX remains very positive. We continue to convert existing commitments to firm orders as planned, with a total of
451 recorded to date.
Key deliveries for the first quarter included the one-thousandth 777, the first 747-8 Intercontinental VIP airplane, and I
should say Lufthansa will be receiving their first Intercontinental airplane today if everything goes as planned, and the
first two 787s powered by GE engines. In addition, the first 747-Intercontinental airplane, as I mentioned, it will be
delivered to Lufthansa hopefully today.
The 787s in service with launch customer ANA and now Japan Airlines are performing well, with high dispatch
reliability rates and a very favorable passenger response to the features and capabilities of the airplane. We recently
transitioned the 787 production line to a build rate of 3.5 per month in final assembly in Everett, marking the second
successful rate increase in the past six months.
Condition of assembly and out-of-sequence work continues to significantly improve as we work closely with our
supplier partners. These gains are driving productivity and demonstrating the ability of this production system, which is
increasing our confidence as we systematically ramp up to higher rates and reduce the amount of post-assembly change
incorporation required on each airplane.
We continue to estimate that the first 787 to go straight from final assembly to the flight line without a stop in our
modification center will be a unit in the mid-60s rolling out of the factory this summer.
Later this week we will roll out the first 787 assembled in Charleston, South Carolina. Delivery of that airplane from
our new Charleston customer delivery center is expected in midyear. We continue to increase the rate of 787
production. We expect to increase it, I should say, to five per month by the end of this year, which tracks to our plan to
reach a rate of 10 per month in final assembly by late 2013.
Progress also continues at the Everett mod center to complete work on the airplanes that have come off the line but
require further change incorporation work. With dedicated resources in place we are using proven repeatable processes
to track the scope of work required on each airplane, maximize learning and reduce cycle time. As a result we are
seeing performance improvements with each airplane delivery.
Steady progress has also been made on development of the 787-9, with engineering design tracking to plan in support
of first delivery scheduled for the second half of 2013 and first delivery – first flight, I should say, scheduled for the
second half of 2013 and first delivery in early 2014.
I'd be remiss at this point if I didn't mention a very proud moment for all Boeing employees that came in March, when
the National Aeronautics Association recognized the 787 with the most prestigious award for aerospace excellence, the
Collier Trophy. We are extremely proud of the game-changing technology embodied in the 787 and the associated
value it provides to our customers, and I'm equally proud of the team that got the job done.
Shifting to the 747-8, the 14 freighters now in service with five customers are performing extremely well. Progress on
the production side is steady too as we continue the transition to reach a production rate of two airplanes per month this
summer.

In addition to its sales momentum the 737 MAX achieved a major development milestone in February when we began
the final phase of wind tunnel testing. Design details are maturing to plan, and we are on schedule to reach firm
configuration in 2013. We are working closely with our supplier partners to ensure successful production rate increases
not only on the 787 and the 747-8, but also on the 737 and the 777.
Production rate on the 737 is planned to increase to 38 per month in the second quarter of 2013 and then up to 42 per
month in the first half of 2014. Production on the 777 program will increase to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of
2013. These two franchise programs continue to generate substantial value for all of our stakeholders.
In Defense, Space & Security, this quarter we delivered 30 aircraft and 3 satellites, generating solid operating results
and margins of 9% across our well-balanced defense portfolio. In February we marked the one-year anniversary of
receiving the U.S. Air Force contract to build the KC-46A. This program continues to be a successful team effort
between the U.S. Air Force and Boeing. Over the past year the program completed all milestones on or ahead of
schedule. In March we began the preliminary design review with the U.S. Air Force, which is expected to complete
later this week.
Additional key highlights in this sector included delivering the first P-8 low rate initial production aircraft, completing
preliminary design review for the commercial crew space transportation system, and the launch of our new 702 small
satellite product line with an initial contract for four units.
Our total company backlog of $380 billion is close to five times our current annual revenue estimate. This record
backlog positions us for significant growth potential in the years to come. And we continue to improve productivity and
competitiveness throughout the business.
Now over to Greg, who will discuss the first quarter financial results and our outlook. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll begin with the first quarter financial results on slide 4. Revenue for the quarter was
$19.4 billion, up from last year, driven by higher commercial airplane delivery volume. Net earnings were $1.22 per
share, including $0.11 per share impact for a reduction in a litigation related reserve. Operating margins of 8.1% and
operating cash flow of $837 million reflect strong performance across our core businesses.
Let me discuss our commercial business on slide 5. Boeing Commercial Airplanes first quarter revenue was $10.9
billion, up from last year, reflecting a planned and successfully executed increase in airplane deliveries. Commercial
operating margins were 9.9%, up from a year ago, reflecting the increased deliveries, strong core operating
performance across the business and lower R&D expenses. This was partially offset by higher period costs which do
include 787 fleet support and the dilutive effect of 787 and 747 deliveries.
During the quarter we extended accounting quantities on the 777 by 50 units and the 767 by 6 units. The financial
impact of these extensions in the quarter was not significant, as volume benefits are balanced with anticipated
competitive pricing environment.
Gross inventory for the company included approximately $22 billion related to the 787 program, an expected increase
of approximately $1.8 billion during the quarter. As we've mentioned previously, we expect gross inventory for the 787
to increase to $24 billion by year-end 2012 as we continue ramping up production rates, but this growth will moderate
as deliveries increase.
Included in the work in process inventory are the deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the program was
$11.9 billion at the end of the first quarter and includes approximately 53 airplanes still in process.
As I stated on the fourth quarter, the deferred production balance will continue to grow as we increase production rates
and introduce the 787-9 derivative, peaking at slightly over $20 billion and then declining after the program achieves
the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level. Improving profitability on both the 787 and 747-8 program

continued to be a top priority for us as we proactively work opportunities to offset risk and improve margin.
Commercial Airplanes won 412 net orders during the quarter valued at $21 billion. The commercial backlog remains
strong with over 4,000 airplanes valued at a record $308 billion.
Moving now to slide 6 and we'll discuss the Defense, Space & Security business. Boeing Defense, Space & Security
reported first quarter revenue of $8.2 billion with operating margins of 9%. Boeing Military Aircraft quarterly revenue
increased 27% for the quarter to $4.3 billion, driven by the successfully completed key development milestones on the
F-15 Saudi program. Operating margins remain strong at 10.1%.
Network and Space Systems revenue of $1.8 billion decreased last year, driven by the expected lower volume
associated with the Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. As anticipated, operating margins decreased to
4.1%, primarily due to lower volume and program mix in our satellite business.
Global Services and Support revenue increased 13% to $2.1 billion for the quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue
on integrated logistics support.
Operating margins were very strong at 10.9%, reflecting performance improvements on multiple integrated logistics
programs. Defense, Space & Security backlog significantly increased in the quarter to $72 billion, driven by F-15 and
C-17 international orders. Over 35% of our current Defense backlog represents international business.
Now let's turn to slide 7 to discuss our other businesses. Boeing Capital generated $38 million in segment earnings in
the quarter. The portfolio balance declined to $4.2 billion on normal portfolio run-off and asset sales with no new
aircraft volume in the quarter. During the quarter, Other segment expense was $79 million, while unallocated expense
were essentially flat year over year, reflecting the $131 million reduction in the litigation-related reserve, which was
offset by higher pension expense this year.
Let's turn to slide 8 and we'll discuss cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $837 million of operating cash,
reflecting increased commercial deliveries and advance payments as well as progress payments on the Saudi F-15s. We
expect cash flow to build over the course of the year as commercial deliveries increase, and we will continue to execute
our disciplined cash management actions.
Turning to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion of cash and marketable
securities. Our cash and debt balances reflect the first quarter repayment of $774 million of BCC debt. Our cash
position continues to provide strong liquidity and positions us well going forward. Capital expenditures of
approximately $424 million were as expected.
Turning now to Slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2012. Our financial outlook continues to be balanced, reflecting
strong operating performance on our production and service programs, and has consideration for uncertainty and risks
associated with ongoing business growth. We are increasing our earnings per share guidance to be between $4.15 and
$4.35 per share to incorporate the reduction in the litigation-related reserve. All other financial guidance remains
unchanged.
Commercial deliveries forecast remains at about 585 to 600 airplanes. Our forecast continues to include a combined 70
to 85 787s and 747-8 deliveries split roughly equally between the two programs.
Overall, we're pleased with the first quarter performance as the core operating engine continues to deliver strong
results. We expect that performance to continue as we remain focused on production program profitability, rate
ramp-up and ongoing productivity improvements.
Now I'll turn it back to Jim for some final thoughts.

Thanks, Greg. With a strong first quarter, we've built on our momentum from 2011 and increased our confidence in
meeting our goals for 2012. Our priorities and focus for the year remain the same: production ramp-up and profitability
across all our commercial airplane programs; successful execution of ongoing development efforts on the 787-9, 737
MAX, and the Air Force tanker; and repositioning our Defense business while extending our core programs and
expanding internationally.
Now we'd be happy to take any questions you might have.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Jim, when we look at the 787, cost still looked very high to us based on deferred production
numbers, and presumably you'll be able to take a step function down in those costs at some point. And perhaps that
point is when you get out in the line numbers in the mid-60s, in order to get the program on a track that's clearly
profitable and ensure that your suppliers can uniformly deliver, first, do you expect by midsummer when you get into
those line numbers that you'll have high confidence that you're on that track? And what operational and financial goals
are you following so that you'll know you're there when you've made it?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, it's a timely question. I just got back from Everett and Charleston taking a look at
the lines. Doug, I think our confidence grows every day, quite frankly, in our ability to deliver the learning curve that
underlies our plans. I think we do have a high degree of confidence that the mid-60s line number will have the
production line flowing exactly the way we want it. And the change incorporation side of Everett is also performing
well on those planes where we did have a significant amount to rework, and that is going well too. I mean as we modify
more planes there's a learning curve involved there too, and we are on track with both the regular production and the
modification.
I would also add that Charleston looks very good, and you're going to see the rollout of the first airplane later this week
and delivery this summer. And I think the learning curve progress in both places are giving me more and more
confidence every day that the costs that underlie our plans are going to be met.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: But are you expecting though that there is a point in time when we should see something that
moves significantly lower? What I'm getting at is a lot of times in the early stages in a program you may not come
down that learning curve smoothly but might have break points that you see a drop down and then you reset. Are you
looking for something like that?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. I think the way – oh, sorry. Go ahead, Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, just let me try to take a shot at this, Doug, and give you some perspective. Certainly
when you look at a unit cost, from a unit cost perspective, from the first airplane that was delivered say to like line 60,
we're seeing about a 40% to 50% reduction in unit cost, and that's truly coming down that learning curve. Now there's
no question it's bumpy when you look at it per unit because some of those airplanes have been in flow longer than
others, but when you just generally look at the trajectory it is coming down the curve that we would expect.
When you ask what do we look at specifically? Obviously we're tracking airplane by airplane versus what we would
consider our target and budget. We're looking at out-of-position items on every airplane, shortages, what condition of
assembly, quality, slow time, how many hours we're burning per job versus what we budgeted, and all that obviously
giving us the confidence to make either the next rate break or overall indicators of the production health of the system.

<Q - Doug S. Harned>: So by midsummer you're expecting – right now things are lining up as you would like them to
for midsummer when you get to this simply a smoother flow?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, and we'll still have planes in change incorporation at that time, Doug. Okay? But
we'll be working that down, which is the second element of the equation as that gets worked down on plan. And by the
second half of the year you should notice a significant decline in the number of those planes hanging around and
delivered to customers. And so it's a combination of both the production line smoothing out beyond line mid-60s and
change incorporation planes being delivered. I think it's going to give you the same confidence we have today.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: All right, Doug.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: You're welcome.
Operator
And next go to Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, Jim and Greg.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a clarification and then a question. Greg, on the accounting differences in the quarter it
looks like you had just about just over $1.2 billion. I wondered if you could comment on what the gross amount would
have been for the development programs and whether that was materially higher than the net that you reported for the
quarter.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: So on that difference, roughly about 80%, 85% of it was 787 related.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: If that helps you.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Yes, and so the remainder would have been 74, but on a gross basis was that in excess of
$1.2 billion? And we had positive, negative in some of the other programs.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. No. There was positive particularly on 777 and 737. That was about $150 million to
$200 million.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. Great. And you stated briefly that improving profitability on the 87 and 47 was a
focus. Would you think it's possible – I mean I'm not thinking short-term here, but per that comment would you think
it's possible to increase the reported margins on these programs without seeing block extensions? Is that something
that's within the realm of...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, it is. I mean certainly block extensions would help, but putting that aside, just to give
you some – I talked about it on the last call, but we're looking obviously within the factory, and some of the stuff we
just talked to Doug about, but also within the supply chain we've got about 300 to 400 different projects in work right
now that are all around profitability. So as those mature, and some of those obviously won't all come to fruition, but the
ones that do mature, then we'll put them in the booking rate.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: What's the general timeline on those sorts of project?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: They really range, but we've got a good process in place for identifying them and then
bringing them to maturity, but just depending on how complex they are, Carter, depends on how we can get

comfortable that we could really capture the productivity that maybe was initially identified as we went through the
process. And as I said, we're doing that with our supply chain as well and utilizing our experience with this and some of
our Lean experts and bringing them out to the supply chain and we're going to be doing a lot more of that going

And we'll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Sam.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit about your guidance? You basically said nothing really changed
other than this reserve reversal, and yet there was significant upside in the quarter and I'm trying to think about – what's
not sustainable? We know the 87's going to drag down the BCA margin, but the flip side is certainly NSS margin was
well below what you're saying it's going to be for the year.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: So you can just talk about the remainder of the year.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sure. Well, as you said, we had a great first quarter and off to a great start, but it's early.
When you look at the balance of the year, I think we've got great plans in place to execute, but we do have as you said
the dilutive impact on the margins on the 87 and 47. We've got some plans for investment and some productivity tools.
As we get these programs at a higher rate, we're again looking for further opportunity to streamline the production
system and lower flow times. Obviously we've got some taxes with those higher deliveries in the back half for the year.
And then we do have some provisionings for just risk and uncertainties that are tied to – in fact we've got a make
another rate break, which again I think we got good plans in place in place to do on the 87 and we've got a 47 rate break
coming up.
So we're just kind of provisioning for that as we execute. Now if we execute through that, that'll certainly give us more
confidence and we'll come back to you.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: And anything about NSS, why margins were so low this quarter and why they should
recover to kind of 7.5 over the course of the year?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes. I mean – so some of it is volume. It's just BCTM coming down as we expected. We
have fewer launches in the quarter and then we had a mix between on the satellites between government and
commercial. And then some adjustments, some small adjustments to EAC, so that's basically it. We see good plans in
place to recover this, be within our guidance for the balance of the year.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I'd like to come back to the 87, which is a couple more numbers, probably the only ones you
haven't provided, and could you give us the WIP at the end of the quarter, the total WIP on the 787? I'm also
wondering, Greg, if you could break out, this might be helpful, the $1.2 billion increase in deferred production cost? Is
there any way of breaking that out between unit excess over average and change incorporation? I think that might give
us a better sense as to how things are tracking.
Finally, on the same point, and sorry for the three-part question, but it's all kind of the same thing. You already gave a
nice number of 40% to 50% reduction in unit costs on the 87 thus far. I'm wondering if there's somehow you could
quantify the improvement you're seeing in change incorporation because certainly it looked like you had some setbacks
during the quarter. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, okay. Let me start there. I mean yes, when you look at those units, as I said, 40%, 50%
on average is what we're seeing. On the change incorp airplanes, certainly they're all different depending on what
condition of assembly and what changes need to be put in place. So what we have there is kind of traditional metrics in
place about cost per job and how many open jobs are left, et cetera, by airplane, by section of the airplane, and that's
where we look at the productivity there of are we achieving the plans that we have in place there or not. I would tell
you as of now we're within our plans of what we had initially thought that it would take to complete those airplanes,
we're coming down that trajectory. So certainly still a lot of work to do there, but we're making good progress.
I would tell you we're trying to take advantage of learning in a nontraditional assembly environment where we've got
the airplanes broken out depending on the number and the complexity of the jobs open, and we've got mechanics
assigned to the same job. So an example, if you're assigned to take this wire harness out on this airplane, you're taking
it out on future airplanes, and we hopefully capture learning and we've experienced that up to now. So I think we've got
that well understood, but certainly a lot of work in front of us, but I think it's operating very well.
Your other question on 787, it's about $22 billion gross inventory.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: What was the WIP portion of that though if you have that? I got the other numbers off the
call.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: It's about 17.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: 17. Of the $1.2 billion in deferred production costs during the quarter, could you break that
out between the two components? What's unit 50, whatever? And what is fixing up unit number 15?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, most of it is in the factory, not in change incorp.

was about two thirds of that, so let's call it $216 million. And then using the numbers you just gave us, the $216 million
has dropped about $10 million a quarter. I calculate $196 million for Q1 in deferred production per unit and a total unit
cost about $279 million, so down 13%. That $279 million based on the comment that you made earlier about a 40% to
50% drop, am I to understand that that gets down to the $200 million level of $190 million by the time we get to that
line number you talked about?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: I mean, it's 40% to 50% from the first delivery to about line 60.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Oh, and that's where I'm getting...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: That's on average. That's an average, but I can tell you, and hopefully this answers your
question, but we're seeing unit cost improvement on the airplane quarter over quarter.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: From a deferred production basis, maybe this is in the best way to talk about it, you've done a
little over, about $10 million per quarter. How do you see that curve continuing over the rest of the year by quarter?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Ask me that again. I'm sorry.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Well, so we've gone down about $10 million per quarter in deferred production on a unit
basis.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: So let's call it $216 million in Q3 or $196 million in Q1. Does that $10 million start to
expand and accelerate each quarter from here on out? How do we think about that $10 million evolving?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No. It does. It does, but as I said earlier on, when you look at it on a unit basis, it's not linear
because of the different airplanes that you're delivering. So you're delivering some out of change incorp, you're
delivering some out of final lines. So you're not going to see the linear effect quarter over quarter, here but overall we're
seeing improvement on a unit cost basis.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Is it fair then, Greg, to ask the question what should the number be on that 60 – on that first
airplane that avoids the mod?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: What number?
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: On line 60, since that aircraft is now a mod-less airplane according to what Jim said it doesn't
have that stop, that interim stop. What should the deferred production be at that point? You will have gotten the
out-of-sequence stuff out of the way.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I mean all I can tell you is on a unit basis, it's a 50% improvement. That's what we
look at. Obviously we look at the deferred production, but we're looking at improvements and coming down learning
curves we look at it on a unit-by-unit basis, and that's essentially what we're seeing right now.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. And then just to finish up on the topic, you said $24 billion at the end of the year in
terms of 78 inventory I think you said.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: What is that number when deferred production stops growing, out a couple of years from
now? Which I think is what James guided to maybe a few quarters back.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, I don't think we've talked about that specifically. What we did talk about is that
deferred production will hit about $20 billion in 2013 and then as we continue at 10 per month that will start to burn
off.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. Thanks very much.

We'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: I wanted to go back to the few questions ago on the full year outlook. I believe last quarter you
said that you expected 20% of the full year earnings to land in the first quarter.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: And you now have 29% of the full year earnings having occurred in the quarter, 27% if we take
that 11 out of the numerator and the denominator. So that would either mean that one, your full year number is just too
low, or two, you had a decent amount earnings occur earlier in the year than you anticipated. Can you say which of
those it is, and if it's the latter, what happened?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, we had obviously had the one-time on the legal reserve and then we had Saudi. So as
you know, we started that contract early and we reached an agreement and we were able to meet those milestones and
capture that revenue in the first quarter, all in the first quarter. So that was pretty significant and not something that
we'd continue through the balance of the year.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. That's helpful. And just on the balance of the year, to get into the BCA margin guidance
you have to have significantly lower BCA margins than you did in the first quarter, and you've talked about what some
of those inputs are. The one I struggle the most with is just the new program period expense. Can you quantify as of
now how you expect that to play out through the rest of the year?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Purely on fleet support or just in general?
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Yes, well, both if you can.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, I mean we expect fleet support to kind of moderate now that we've reached the level
going from Q4 last year to Q1 this year. So we expect that to moderate, but there is some increases in period expense,
like I talked about earlier, that we're expecting in the kind of third, fourth quarter timeframe. That combined with the
dilution is really what's driving that. And as I said, we're provisioning for some uncertainties as we get through these
rate breaks, which we certainly plan to. We've got good plans in place. We'll readdress it.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Can you quantify what the fleet support is and what the other period expense is?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No. I mean they're essentially in line with what we had this quarter and primarily all driven
by 87.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Okay. All right. Thank you.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I think we beat the rest of that to death. You signed an agreement with Embraer. You've
been able to extend the C-17 line. The F-15 capability on the Saudi airplane is better than the U.S. Air Force has today.
Could you talk about what you're doing to make that military portfolio more attractive?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, you've named a couple of things right there. I mean I think the C-17 affordability
and acceptance on a global basis is progressing. The F-18, which you didn't mention, is a highly affordable aircraft. The
last multi-year took significant cost out of the aircraft and shared it with our customer. I think our satellite business, if
you look at the market share associated over the last 12 months and also going forward, looks very promising. You've
seen an expansion of our product line in the satellite business to the medium power and the smaller satellites, both of
which have good launch orders.
I think the helicopter business remains very committed too even in a very difficult budgetary environment, and our
position in the helicopter business is about as strong as you can get, and that's clearly because any conflicts that can be
envisioned out there in many ways are buttressed by a strong position of being able to move troops around regionally
quickly.
And then of course, we've invested significantly over the last few years either through prototyping or external growth
and acquisition in cyber unmanned and ISR. So we're trying to position ourselves well for that world that's coming at
us. And when you add it all up, both on market share on the international side is increasing and our position within the
U.S. budget is strong. And I didn't even mention P-8 and tanker, which are the two growth programs that are on top of
all of that.
So we feel like – it's a down environment in defense. We feel about as well positioned as we could be and as you know
we're addressing the cost issue very aggressively on top of all of that.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, maybe I don't want to take too much, but is there anything more immediate, for
example with Embraer in Brazil, clearly the Pentagon recognizes the need to improve relationships there and you've
signed some agreement. Is this a foreshadowing of an improvement in your competitive position or is it still a long
putt?
<A - W. James McNerney>: When you talk about – I see.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: F-18 sales in Brazil. Sorry.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, so when you say Embraer, you're talking about some localization efforts we've got
in Brazil. I see. Yes, I mean, the F-18 Brazil competition is along with similar competition in the UAE and other places,
I mean we have some significant international opportunities. I think we have a good shot in Brazil.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Just one quick numbers follow-up. If I look at your pre-R&D numbers on commercial drag
versus a year ago, they're about 300 basis point difference. Is that most of the period cost and other items you've
addressed? Because it sort of masks what would appear to be productivity improvements in the core business.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, I think you've got it, Howard. That's it.

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Just a quick question on the 37 and the 777. Can you talk about both the pricing environment
as well as the productivity environment on those two programs and what your view is on margin rates for those two
programs as you look out over the next couple of years?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think the summary on pricing on 777 is steady, steady she goes, capturing value, in
many ways a uniquely positioned airplane today. And significant productivity associated both with better conversion
and with taking up rate. So the margin environment there, I would say, is good and favorable going forward.
37, all of the comments I just made on productivity apply: significant productivity, both absorption kind of productivity
due to increased rate as well as conversion productivity per unit, slightly more aggressive pricing environment due to
the introduction of the MAX and the Neo. So there's launch customer kinds of pricing that have happened in a few
cases. But I think at the end of the day we anticipate about half of that market, which is a big number, and we see a
pricing environment that's not too different than the pricing environment we've had historically, after we get through
some of the launch customer pricing, which is part and parcel with our business.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great. So does the productivity gain offset the pricing pressures so that margins can remain
resilient? Or do we see some pressure on margins?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, well, our philosophy is that we don't let pricing get in the way of margins and the
answer to that is productivity. So that's the plan.

And we'll go to Heidi Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: Great. Jim, a question for you. I've been thinking about your product line-up versus what your
airline customers seem to want and the sort of growing trend towards up-gauging. Can you talk to us a little bit about
what your strategy is to address the airline needs that currently operate 757s on the North Atlantic and the 57 users
where they can't replace their planes with A321s or 900ERs or if they have to choose they appear to be leaning toward
the A321 versus the 900ERs. What's your strategy to fill that hole?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think job one is to get the MAX in the marketplace. And as you point out, the
MAX-9 and the A321 do fill a lot of that mission. Now admittedly I think when you compare it only to a 757, there is a
bit of – you've either got to stretch the A3 – stretch in the sense of stretch economically or mission-wise, the -9 or the
A321 and to some of the thicker routes that the 75 is involved with. And I think we're trying to think through exactly
how to fill that market, but the largest part of that segment is going to be filled by the larger versions of an aero body,
but there's some product planning we have yet to do and we'll announce that in due course.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: All right, great. And a follow-up to Jason's question, some of us are hearing anecdotally that the
A321 Neo pricing is either at current 320 prices or in some cases seems to be below. So did I hear you correctly in
terms of what you've intimated on pricing on the MAX, that you offset efficiency with possibly deleterious pricing?
But is there also embedded escalation to help offset that?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, it does. I mean, you know the equation. I think there are some competitive
environments where the price, like it often does in these introductory environments where the price was pretty
aggressive, even more aggressive than an immediate productivity plan to offset the margin we have today. But our
judgment is that over the long term, as you look at history and how these kind of pricing environments sort out, even
when you're conservative, we feel comfortable that productivity in the long run on a program basis can offset the
pricing, any pricing environment we see.
<Q - Heidi Wood>: That's terrific, Jim. Thanks so much. Very helpful.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Cai.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: This is the first quarter I can remember in history when you didn't have some kind of slip or
screw-up on the 787. So you reiterated your guidance for 35 to 42 deliveries this year. Could you give us some color in
terms of how that rolls out by quarter? And are there any opportunities now that you seem to have it under somewhat
better control to exceed those numbers or to be at the upper end as opposed to just getting in at the low end?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Cai, I would just say overall, as we've said, as we get beyond the engineering change and
we stabilize the production base this business will become more and more predictable in terms of its projected
execution. And I don't know whether to laugh or cry at the award you just gave us. First quarter ever. But having said
that, we have increasing confidence that as the issue becomes more and more centered on production execution, which
this company does pretty well, and we reduce the risk significantly on change incorporation and supply chain, we have
growing confidence.
Now, the guidance we've given you has some back-end-loadedness to it and that's just because that's the way the
production ramp is happening and that's the way the learning improvement and change incorporation is happening that
Greg talked about. And so I would say while there may be an opportunity to do better than the low end of that
guidance, and I think there is, but the guidance is what it is, I think the ramp nature of it leads us to be conservative and
to call it that way as we sit here today.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. And could you give us some update in terms of your head count at BCA? Has that
peaked? And what should we look for going forward in the implications for productivity?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, go ahead, Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yes, Cai, it does peak this year. And then as we kind of ramp out down on the development
program and come up more on the production programs and then with productivity, it comes down in 2013. That's the
projection right now.

days that Pat talked about I think back in February?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, I think – as I think we told you then and as we feel today the fix was understood
quickly. It had to do with workmanship. The workaround was quickly identified. I think it is now has dovetailed both in
the change incorporation and the line. I think roughly 14, 15 airplanes have already been reworked. I think in our world
it did have a schedule impact within our month-to-month schedules, which we don't share with you, that doesn't impact
our guidance for the year at all, but I would say understood, fixed, moving forward and we're in good shape.

<Q - Rob Stallard>: Thanks so much. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Rob.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jim, you mentioned in your prepared comments the production rate increases that you have
planned for the next three years at BCA. But there's been some industry commentary that perhaps you and Airbus could
be oversupplying the market. How do you get yourself comfortable that your customers are not over-ordering and
there's not double-booked slots [indiscernible] (55:02)?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I mean obviously we manage a process that tries to separate the wheat from the
chaff implied in that question. We work very closely with our customers, understand the financeability of what they
want to do, understand their fleet plans. In many cases, as you know, Rob, the demand for these airplanes is driven as
much by fuel efficiency as it is by supporting growth. So the price of oil where it is and where most people think it's
going to go – a lot of the demand is driven by replacing older aircraft or aircraft that may not – and this may happen to
a greater degree today than it has happened before because financial markets remain open to finance these things, and
this is all about improving the bottom line of the airline.
So it's some growth particularly in Asia, Middle East. It's replacement in the developed markets supported by financing
that's there that would ask all the questions you'd be asking about is this a bubble? Can you support the growth? Are
you going to be in business? And if we get to the point of seeing it differently we'll adjust our plans.

And we'll go to John Ostrower with the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Morning, guys. I have a question about...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, John.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: The prospective takeover of – the American Airlines merger between US Airways and American
Airlines there. Can you give some thoughts on what that merger would mean for your order backlog? Obviously there's
US Airways, which has been leaning towards Airbus for the last more than a decade. Can you just kind of share your
thoughts on what it might mean for actually reaching 42 a month and really holding there for a while in Airbus?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, obviously we'll confront whatever environment we find, but I think American is
working through the process now, and we support them emerging from this thing as a stronger airline. If at that point a
merger makes sense to the two managements of the company, we'll support that as well. Obviously US Air does have
more Airbus airplanes than Boeing airplanes right now and American's got more Boeing airplanes than Airbus
airplanes, and that's because of the missions they fly. We've seen mergers before. If it happens – it's not clear that this
one's going to happen by the way in our view, but if it does we'll confront the environment that we've confronted before
and we tend to do pretty well.

Our next question is from Chris Drew with The New York Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: Yes. Hi, Jim and Greg.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Hi, Chris.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi.
<Q - Christopher Drew>: If we can go back to tankers for a minute. As you look back now over the past year do you
have any better sense of why Airbus didn't bid lower as a first – EADS didn't bid lower? First question. And then the
second, there's been various stories about whether it's costing you – how much more it might be costing you or the
government than you expected. If you could sort of address where all that stands now.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, it's hard for me to know exactly why Airbus did what they did or didn't – or EADS
in this case. I will say we were aggressive, as I've said, and we worked our supply chain very, very hard and got the
same kind of commitments from them that we in turn were making to the Air Force, which is a fixed-price
development environment. So a lot of elbow grease, a lot of working with partners in advance to get to a number that
we thought was aggressive but responsible. We have known all along that the tightest part of the program for us will be
the development phase, which is what we're in right now, but we're hitting every milestone.
I believe based on what they've said publicly our customer is happy with the progress. We're focused on it every day,
and there's no doubt that this is an aggressively bid program, but the warfighter and our customer is benefiting from our
efficiencies. The last thing I'd say is that we brought together the defense side and the commercial side of our company
together more aggressively than we've been able to do historically, and we took a lot of inefficiency out of teaming
together as one Boeing to get this pricing capability where it should be, as well as working with our supply base. So

And next go to Mike Mecham with Aviation Week. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Mecham>: Good morning. I'd like to follow up a little bit on the situation with where you are in the 737
MAX, also where you have been hit and how from the situation in Wichita. Which programs, if there is any particular
program, stands out as perhaps taking the most problem with this? If you can.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. Sure. I mean, just an update on the 737 MAX program, we're on schedule. We have
got the statement of work that we're going to do and not do. We'll have firm configuration next year. We think we've
struck the right balance between containing the work statement to reduce risk and providing the new engines and some
other tweaks that bear only on the efficiency of this airplane for our customers. So we're feeling good.
I think Wichita, as you know the Spirit operation supports a number of our programs. Where they have the most
content is the 737, and they've been back to work full-time starting this Monday after roughly a week's delay, and we
are cautiously optimistic that there will be no material impact to our programs, any of our programs, this year. We'll
update you if any of that changes.
<Q - Michael Mecham>: Is there any part of this natural disaster situation in Japan and elsewhere that has caused the
company to rethink? Or have you launched any rethink of your various facilities around the world? And just exactly
what threats they're under and how they and you need to respond?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think you've seen us take some moves to diversify our manufacturing base
somewhat, Charleston as an example, and that is an element of the thinking.

Our next question's from Brendan Kearney with the Post and Courier. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brendan Kearney>: Good morning, Jim and Greg.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Brendan Kearney>: Jim, two quick questions. First, you said the first delivery from South Carolina will be
midyear in summer. Is that different from the June and second quarter estimates that other company officials have
offered? And then second, you noted you were here in Charleston yesterday. Are you making a return trip to Charleston
this week for Friday's rollout? And which musician do you hope to hear perform at that event?
<A - W. James McNerney>: No, no, to answer the first part of your question, no change. Those are one and the same
comments. I'm just using slightly different wording.
<Q - Brendan Kearney>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And Jim Albaugh will be leading the entourage on Friday.
<Q - Brendan Kearney>: Oh, okay. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: You're welcome. Operator, we have time for one last question this morning.

And that'll be from Steve Wilhelm with Puget Sound Business Journal. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Hello, gentlemen. I just have two quick questions. One is could you just characterize the
production lines in Everett and Charleston and just how they're different, what ways they're approaching things
differently or their learning curves are different because of their experience in doing this? That's one question. And
secondly, there's been a lot of rumors about a gear turbo fan option for the MAX. I just wondered if you could address
that.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes. I mean I think – the point of the two production lines in Everett and Charleston is
more that we're trying to make them the same than we're trying to make them different. We're trying to leverage the
same processes, the same learning, across our company. So leaving the change incorporation side of Everett aside for a
second, the two production lines as we envision them and as we are managing them, we're trying to duplicate and learn
rather than separate and be different. What was the second part of your question?
<Q - Steve Wilhelm>: Gear turbo fan.
<A - W. James McNerney>: The gear turbo fan. Right now as I think we've announced many, many times, we are
working exclusively with CFM on the MAX and we're very happy with the development there. We're confident that we
can meet the targets that our customers need and that we've promised them. So that's our plan going forward.
