specifically noted otherwise. We've posted supplemental information on our website, including company restatements
that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance.
It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning and thank all of you for joining us. In a few minutes, we'll walk through
our results for the quarter and provide color on markets and business performance. Before we do that, I want to discuss
our actions to build and deliver value for shareholders as we sharpen our competitiveness and confront our most
immediate challenges.
We continue to manage the company knowing that sustained growth and competitiveness require a dynamic, agile
organization that is deeply connected to customers and markets. Our businesses and corporate functions are constantly
working towards that goal. This is how we step up to market challenges, outperform the competition, and grow.
Continuing macroeconomic uncertainty and resulting slowing demand in certain sectors are reminders of why agility
and productivity must be a way of life.
Today, we are announcing additional actions we have launched to improve competitiveness and accelerate
market-driven innovation and growth by fine-tuning the organization, eliminating costs and expanding targeted
productivity programs. This effort is somewhat, surgical in that each of our businesses have assessed what action, if
any, is warranted versus their market condition and competitive set. Our actions reflect differential management of the
portfolio and not a one-size-fits-all approach.
I'd like to underscore some of the more important elements of what we're doing. Recent transactions involving
Performance Coatings and Danisco advanced DuPont's vision to be the world's most dynamic science company, with a
long-term strategy of driving competitive advantage in Agriculture and Nutrition, Advanced Materials, and Industrial
Biotechnology, all of which represent high growth, high-margin opportunities. Over time, you will begin to see the full
effect of these transactions as we redeploy capital and fully integrate Danisco and Solae, generating new growth
opportunities in high-margin parts of our business. We set aggressive cost targets for these transactions. In the case of
Danisco, we're delivering $130 million in cost synergies by year-end, well ahead of the original schedule.
In the case of DPC, we will eliminate $230 million in residual costs associated with the divestiture. We will take the
same disciplined approach to eliminate these costs as we have in addressing the Danisco cost synergies. Based on what
we learned during the separation process, we identified additional actions to reduce corporate costs to further simplify
and streamline our global infrastructure. We are better aligning the design and cost of corporate functions with business
growth strategies and the expected impact of changing market conditions.
In addition, current uncertainty in the global economic outlook, softer demand in certain markets and strength in others,
require realigning business resources to match current growth opportunities and increase responsiveness to rapidly
changing market realities. Businesses have identified cost-saving opportunities by optimizing supply chains,
consolidating facilities, and refining their organization geographically, to improve competitiveness and margins.
It's important to recognize that these actions unlock capital, drive science-powered innovation, and will deliver growth
faster. In order to ensure continued competitiveness at both the function and business levels, our leaders identified
actions to deliver $220 million in savings. This combines with the elimination of $230 million in residual costs for a
total of $450 million in benefits. This restructuring work is in addition to ongoing productivity programs that address
costs and working capital.
All these actions are part of a continuum for DuPont, but they obviously take on particular importance given the
quarter's results. Business results in the third quarter reflect continued weak market conditions in Europe and
uncertainty in Asia. The bright spots were strong performance in Agriculture, Nutrition & Health, Industrial
Biosciences and Performance Materials. The most challenged segments this quarter were Performance Chemicals and

Electronics & Communications.
Agriculture market fundamentals remained strong, supported by robust demand and a healthy outlook for farm income.
You will recall last year, this segment delivered outstanding growth in sales and earnings in Latin America. And
despite such a strong third quarter comp and a 10% currency headwind, Ag sales were up 4% this quarter. We remain
bullish about the growth opportunities for our Feed and Crop Protection businesses as the Latin American planting
season continues in the fourth quarter and the northern hemisphere season gets underway. And we are bullish on the
solid momentum we have heading into 2013.
Our Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences segments grew 10% and 5% respectively when excluding currency
impact. Both businesses delivered impressive earnings growth with PTOI margin expansion of 300 basis points in the
quarter. These results demonstrate outstanding work by the businesses to deliver customer value through innovation
and deliver cost synergies from the Danisco acquisition ahead of schedule. Performance Chemicals earnings were down
37% which reflected earnings decline in both businesses within the segment. Weaker economic conditions, particularly
in China and Europe are reducing demand for TiO2 and fluoropolymers specifically connected to construction and
infrastructure. These businesses continue to focus on customer service, drive fixed costs and working capital
productivity and in the case of TiO2, reduce cost by shifting to lower cost or blends.
Electronic & Communications' earning decline was essentially all related to weak Photovoltaic markets and an
oversupply of PV modules. Trade actions in the United States and trade investigations in the European Union add to
market uncertainty and are negatively impacting demand. The bright spot in this segment was the Consumer
Electronics market, bolstered by demand for smartphones and tablets.
Now I'm going to turn the call over to Nick to go through third quarter financials and after the segment reviews, I'll
share perspectives on key markets going forward. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with the details of the quarter on Slide 3. Underlying
earnings from continuing operations of $0.32 per share were down $0.28 versus the prior year. This decline reflects the
market conditions that Ellen just covered as well as $0.28 of headwinds from currency, taxes, lower pharmaceutical
income, non-cash pension costs and exchange losses.
Consolidated net sales of $7.4 billion were down 9% versus the prior year. Volume declined 5% as increases in
Agriculture, Performance Materials, and Nutrition & Health were more than offset by declines in Performance
Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. Volume in Asia Pacific declined 10%, primarily due to lower TiO2 and
Photovoltaic materials volume. Excluding Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications, Asia Pacific
volume was up slightly year-over-year.
Local selling prices increased 1% with declines in Asia Pacific partially offsetting gains in the other regions. The single
largest driver for the drop in local prices in Asia Pacific resulted from the decrease in silver costs related to our Solamet
paste, which as we've discussed with you before is passed through direct to the customer. For more information
regarding the company sales by geographic region, please see Slide 4.
As Ellen mentioned earlier, today we announced a restructuring plan, which is summarized on Slide 5. This plan will
deliver total pre-tax cost savings of $450 million by eliminating corporate costs previously allocated to Performance
Coatings, while taking additional cost cutting actions to improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver $300 million of
savings in 2013 and the full amount in 2014.
Our targets have been established from the bottom up, with specific projects already identified and rigorous monitoring
and accountability in place. To achieve these savings, we expect to record a restructuring charge of about $210 million.
$152 million of this charge was recorded in the third quarter, with the balance to come in quarter 4. These actions will
make us a leaner, more agile company and better position all of our businesses for future growth.

I'd like to point out that the savings associated with the restructuring plan will essentially offset the dilutive earnings
effect associated with the divesting of the Performance Coatings business. And speaking of the Performance Coatings
divestiture, the transaction is progressing as planned, and we expect to close the sale in the first quarter of next year.
We estimate the after-tax proceeds will be about $4 billion. This is a preliminary figure recognizing the tax calculation
is complex and involves many factors that are not yet finalized. We'll provide you a final number when the sale closes.
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 6, which
is shown on a continuing operations basis. First, higher local selling prices resulted in a $0.05 per share benefit.
Excluding currency, variable costs were a $0.17 tailwind as raw material, energy and freight costs were down about 5%
versus the prior year. While we recognize these costs will be lower in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect an
increase of about 1% for the full year. Excluding the impact from portfolio changes, our overall 5% volume decline
reduced earnings by $0.15 per share.
Let's move to fixed costs, which reduced earnings by $0.08 per share, excluding currency volume and portfolio
changes. This change reflects 3% of higher non-cash pension costs and a $0.02 lower plant utilization charges as well
as higher spending on growth investments, primarily R&D and marketing initiatives in the Agricultural segment. The
lower plant utilization charges did not represent increases in spending but rather were primarily the result of lower
volumes in Performance Chemicals and Electronics & Communications. These are fixed manufacturing costs normally
reflected in inventory that are expensed when production rates drop below normal operating levels. This helps to ensure
our inventory values are not inflated.
Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, we have delivered approximately $285 million of fixed cost
productivity to date, well on our way towards exceeding our commitment of $300 million for the full year. I'd like to
reiterate what Ellen said earlier: the restructuring plan we announced today is in addition to these ongoing productivity
programs.
Year-over-year, currency was a negative $0.13 variance in the quarter. At current exchange rates, we expect about
$0.27 headwind for the full year on a continuing operations basis. This equates to about a $0.05 headwind in the fourth
quarter versus the prior year.
Moving on, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.02 variance in the quarter. As is typical, the detailed
reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release to show you the extent that our hedging program had on
our earnings as well as the effective tax rate.
Income tax was a $0.05 headwind. This represents the difference between the base tax rate of 24% this quarter and 17%
last year. The higher base tax rate primarily reflects an increased proportion of earnings in high tax rate jurisdictions as
well as the absence of the U.S. R&D credit and other tax provisions which expired at the end of 2011. For the full year
2012, we expect the base tax rate on a continuing ops basis to be about 22%.
Lastly, reduced Pharmaceutical royalties were a 5% hurt. We continue to expect full year 2012 Pharma pre-tax income
to be approximately $65 million or $225 million less than that in 2011.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 7. Third quarter free cash flow on a total company basis was about
$250 million or $350 million less than last year. On a year-to-date basis, total company free cash flow was about $800
million lower than last year, primarily reflecting the $500 million contribution to the principal U.S. pension plan that
we made earlier this year, as well as some other one-time item payments. In light of our current operating environment,
we have reduced our planned capital expenditures for the full year to about $1.9 billion or 10% below our previous
guidance.
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our AA2 rating and work to maintain the associated
metrics that support that.
Our long held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the
opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. Last month, we paid our 432nd consecutive quarterly dividend.

In summary for the third quarter, our market environment was a dynamic one. Our businesses executed well as they
faced a wide array of market conditions. Each business has externally benchmarked performance targets against which
they are all executing well while outperforming their peer set.
Turning now to the rest of the year on Slide 8, we expect the full year 2012 earnings from continuing operations to be
$3.25 to $3.30 per share excluding significant items. This outlook primarily reflects sequential lower earnings in
Performance Chemicals and Agriculture in the fourth quarter versus the third. Karen will provide some more detail
when she covers the segments.
Lastly, I want to take a moment to reflect on how the recent portfolio and restructuring actions fit with our long-term
strategy. The DPC divestiture coupled with the Danisco acquisition last year are consistent with our intent to focus on
high growth, high margin opportunities with innovation critical to success. Today's announcement around restructuring
actions will help mitigate the earnings dilution from the DPC divestiture while positioning our businesses to be more
agile and profitable long-term.
In addition, we continue to exercise good financial discipline and make decisions in support of our strong balance
sheet. Our focus on our disciplined processes around innovation, productivity and differential management and our
strong execution are the key enablers to our success. With that, let me turn the call over to Karen to review the
segments. Karen?
Karen A. Fletcher
Thank, Nick. Turning to Slide 9, our Agriculture segment continued the momentum established in the first half,
underpinned by a strong start to the southern hemisphere season against a backdrop of tight global grain stocks and
sound market fundamentals. Third quarter sales of $1.4 billion grew 4% with gains in volume and local price partially
offset by currency, primarily the Brazilian real.
Typical seasonal losses increased to $85 million as sales growth was offset by unfavorable currency, continued
investment in research, selling and agronomy positions in our North America and Brazil businesses and multiple
product launch activities.
Reviewing the individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $601 million were up 1%. Volume gains
in insect control products and fungicides led the way with local pricing gains in all segments, largely offset by the
unfavorable impact of currency.
Regionally, we grew in the key markets of the United States, Latin America and Europe, overcoming the negative
effects of currency. Our blockbuster insect control products powered by Rynaxypyr are on pace to grow 20% this year.
In the third quarter we successfully launched Cyazypyr insect control products in Argentina and Dermacor insect
control seed treatment in Mexico. We continue to pursue registrations of these complementary insect control portfolios
in additional countries and markets.
In combination, these new innovative technologies, derived from the same novel chemical class, are on track to achieve
our goal of $1 billion in annual portfolio sales in the next few years.
Moving to the Seed business, third quarter sales grew to $822 million, up 6%. The quarter reflected strong performance
in Latin America, South Africa and South Asia. In Brazil, summer season corn sales are up despite hectares shifting
from corn to soybeans. We expect pricing and share gains in summer corn following a successful 2012 safrinha season.
These successes are the result of a multi-year plan to invest in our research, production and go-to-market capabilities.
Growers continue to see robust performance and insect control with our hybrids containing the Herculex 1 insect trait.
This summer, we've expanded grower options as we launched Optimum Intrasect in Brazil with two modes of action
for above-ground insect control. Recent investments in soybean production and distribution capacity are also paying off
as Brazilian growers are increasing demand for locally developed high yielding high-quality Pioneer brand soybeans.

The USDA won't issue final 2012 acreage until January of next year, but we can share some preliminary results based
upon the resent October report. We held North America corn market share flat in 2012, following gains of six points
since 2008. Double-digit pricing gains and the highest-planting corn acres since 1937 resulted in significant growth in
corn sales. Soybeans also experienced significant sales growth from improved price realization and higher planted
acres. Soybean market share is projected to be flat to slightly down following gains of more than 10 points since 2008.
Finally, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which is advanced this year, due to the
early planting season and the widespread drought conditions. Growers planted Optimum AquaMax on over two million
acres in 2012, and these products performed exceptionally well. AquaMax hybrids stayed healthier longer, and most
importantly, delivered more bushels at harvest. On more than 4,000 side-by-side comparisons with competitive
products, preliminary 2012 yield data shows an advantage of more than 8% with AquaMax products in water-limited
environments.
Our Optimum AcreMax 1 and AcreMax Xtra, triple-stacked hybrids containing the Herculex rootworm trait performed
well under this year's heavy corn rootworm infestation and drought stress. We will round out the lineup in 2013 with
the addition of Optimum AcreMax Xtreme, which contains dual modes of action for both above and below-ground
insect control. AcreMax Xtreme recently received all necessary regulatory approvals for grain import into major world
markets, so we look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest results in the next few weeks.
Moving now to the segment outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect significant sales increases versus a tough
prior-year comp. Seasonal fourth quarter losses will be substantially larger year-over-year and about double the size of
the third quarter loss as sales growth is moderated by higher production costs, new product launches in Crop Protection
and Pioneer and continued growth investments. We now expect full-year margins for the segment to be about flat
year-over-year, which actually is an improved outlook from earlier this year and a tribute to solid execution by both
businesses.
Looking forward to 2013, the fundamentals for Agriculture remain strong. As we prepare for the upcoming safrinha
season in Brazil and the spring planting season in the northern hemisphere, our teams are working diligently with
farmers to supply them with the seeds, crop protection products and knowledge to meet the world's growing need for
feed, food and renewable resources.
Moving to Slide 10 for Electronics & Communications. Sales of $607 million were down 28% primarily due to soft
Photovoltaic volume and lower silver cost pass-throughs. On a sequential view, growth in Photovoltaic materials
declined due to inventory destocking throughout the PV value chain. In addition, trade actions in the United States and
investigations in Europe are creating downward pressure on end-use demand. In consumer electronics, we continue to
see strong demand for our market leading materials, fueled by ongoing growth in smartphones and tablets. And our
Packaging Graphics business remains stable.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be essentially flat with a substantial earnings decline. As a reminder, fourth
quarter 2011 results included a $20 million licensing payment. If we exclude this item, earnings would be up
substantially. With respect to the Photovoltaic market, we lowered our outlook for PV installations in the second half,
reflecting today's market environment and pending trade actions. Our current estimate is that global PV installation
rates for 2012 will be flat to low single digits, depending on the fourth quarter installation rates. There are no major
subsidies expiring at year end which has historically caused spikes in fourth quarter demand.
DuPont products like Solamet and Tedlar remain industry leaders and we are committed to our mission of being the
leading supplier of differentiated materials for Photovoltaics and consumer and other electronic markets.
Now let's turn to Slide 11 and Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $292 million were flat as 7% volume growth
was offset by the unfavorable impact of currency. Volume growth occurred in all regions, and reflects continued strong
demand for DuPont Sorona renewably sourced polymer for carpet fiber and growth in key enzyme businesses from
new product launches. PTOI of $42 million was up $8 million or 24% on higher volume and the realization of cost
synergies related to the integration of the Danisco enzyme business. Enzyme sales for ethanol were significantly lower
as spreads between ethanol and corn prices continue to challenge the ethanol industry.

Moving to the fourth quarter, we see sales up moderately and PTOI up substantially as we continue to realize cost
synergies from integration. As a result of these productivity gains and improved margins in Biomaterials, full-year
margin is expected to be up over 3 percentage points compared to prior year.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for Nutrition & Health. Strong execution in the quarter resulted in the business posting sales
of $876 million with earnings of $87 million which are up 58%. All product lines contributed to solid 4% volume
growth, led by enablers, Solae soy specialties, probiotics, cultures and sweeteners. Local pricing improved in all
regions as continued mix enrichment and pricing actions in response to key raw material increases were offset by the
negative effect of currency.
Our global teams continue to focus on growing the business while integration remains on track to deliver meaningful
revenue and cost synergies. Our innovation and productivity mindset is evident as full year margins will be about 10%,
which is a three percentage point improvement over 2011.
Moving to the outlook for the remainder of the year, we expect moderate sales growth despite the impact of currency
and substantial earnings growth with the benefit of continued cost synergies. Sequential margins will be pressured
down in the fourth quarter due to raw material inflation.
Now let's discuss Performance Chemicals on Slide 13. Sales of $1.7 billion were down 19% with 18% lower volume,
and 1% lower selling price versus an extremely tough comp in 2011. Titanium dioxide and fluoropolymer volumes
were pressured by a decline in spending in infrastructure and construction in Asia Pacific and ongoing weakness in
Europe. PTOI of $372 million was down 37%, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable currency. One bright spot was
the continued robust demand in Industrial Chemicals for cyanide and aniline. Despite the weaker quarter, year-to-date
segment PTOI is down only modestly when compared to last year's strong earnings performance.
For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down significantly and earnings down substantially. We expect continued
softness while TiO2 producers reduce existing inventory levels. On a positive note, customer inventory levels have
declined from previous highs and long-term industry fundamentals remain solid.
Long-term growth remains tightly correlated to GDP so for now, we continue to stay close to customers and drive
productivity and we look for this market to bottom in the first half of next year. We see several potential triggers for
recovery including new investment in Asia infrastructure, some stability in Europe and the continued recovery and
growth in the U.S. housing market.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 14, Sales of $1.6 billion were down 8%, primarily due to lower selling
prices and currency. Packaging volumes remain stable and modest improvement in automotive were partially offset by
unfavorable currency and softness in Asia Pacific electronic markets.
PTOI of $306 million increased $75 million on value pricing, lower feedstock costs and positive mix. Continuing
productivity efforts also contributed to margin expansion. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales down modestly with
global auto builds flat and continued soft demand in industrial and electronics markets. We expect PTOI to be up
substantially versus weak comps on lower costs and value pricing.
On Slide 15, we'll cover the Safety & Protection segment. Sales declined 7% on 4% lower selling prices due to
unfavorable currency and 3% lower volume. The volume decline was primarily due to stalled infrastructure projects in
China, weaker industrial conditions in Europe and the U.S. military delaying tender orders. PTOI was down 13%
primarily due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency.
For the fourth quarter, sales are expected to be essentially flat. We see continued softness in industrial markets and
inconsistent spending in the public sector. With the continued new home construction rebound in the U.S., we are
seeing a pickup in sales of Tyvek HomeWrap. While this is off a very small base and we do not foresee this being a big
needle mover in the near term, we expect the increased demand in this market will continue into 2013.
Fourth quarter PTOI is expected to be down moderately due to weaker mix and unfavorable currency. Going forward,
S&P will see significant productivity improvement in the future years from the restructuring plan that we announced
today. So with that I conclude the segment update and turn the call over to Ellen.

Ellen Jamison Kullman
Great. Thank you, Karen. Staying ahead of market trends and taking action to position ourselves well for what lies
ahead are cornerstones of how we operate.
As we head into the fourth quarter and beyond, we are laser focused on those principles that keep us competitive and
drive our growth. We continue to execute well in most parts of the company and certain segments such as Agriculture,
Nutrition & Health, Industrial Biosciences and Performance Materials are outperforming despite market volatility and
soft macroeconomic conditions. We are addressing our challenges head on. We must continue to stay close to
customers. We do this routinely to understand their needs and develop new products that capitalize fully on market
rebounds and support attractive margins.
This connection is also how we gain insight on demand signals, which is critically important when markets are volatile.
Our focus on market-driven innovation and the new products we deliver are intrinsic to several opportunities we see for
growth heading into next year. First, our Agriculture business is poised to have $10 billion in sales this year. We're
heading into 2013 with strong momentum. We've made tremendous progress in our Seed genetics and our Crop
Protection pipeline over the past decade and been rewarded with market share and excellent growth in the U.S. and
internationally. And this includes very attractive returns. Everything is in place to continue that track record next year.
Second, 2013 is a foundational year for some of the important long-term growth opportunities in Industrial
Biotechnology and OLEDs. There are short-term milestones to watch for in these areas that include breaking ground on
a commercial cellulosic ethanol plant and steps that we and our partners take to scale up, validate and move closer to
commercialization of DuPont OLED technology.
A third opportunity for innovation is in Automotive where market continues to recover and we're aggressively building
on our strong presence. In July, we announced an expansion of our successful innovation center in Nagoya, Japan, and
last week we announced the opening of an automotive innovation center in Detroit. In these centers we collaborate with
customers and tap into our global network of 9,500 scientists, chemists and engineers to hear directly from our
customers and deliver innovative solutions to help them gain competitive advantage.
Overall, our transformation continues. Actions we've taken to differentially manage our portfolio are shifting us
steadily towards higher growth, higher margin businesses. Ongoing productivity, coupled with restructuring actions
announced today, keep us efficient, effective and competitive and our market driven innovation continues to
differentiate us in the marketplace, providing our customers with the innovative solutions they need to compete and
creating value for our shareholders. So Karen, back to you.

Okay, thanks, Ellen. Sandra, let's open up the lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes, thank you. Ellen, I wanted to get a little more color on your TiO2 outlook. Specifically
what – I know you gave segment price volume data but what are you seeing on pricing and volumes? How steep is the
downward trajectory this quarter and how do you see the business unfolding next year?

<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so certainly we are in the midst of a changing market condition over this past
quarter. Coming through the second quarter we saw improvement in that market. And with kind of the step down in
Asia-Pacific in economic activity and infrastructure investment in China, we saw volumes fall there.
We saw the volume decrease obviously in the quarter and expect volume and price pressure to continue in the fourth
quarter. Sizing that, we have done that in terms of putting forward our guidance for the year-end estimate and the range
that you've seen there is inclusive of what is a substantial decline in Performance Chemicals earnings along with the
seasonal losses in Agriculture.
As we look out next year, Don, we do see that there are some things moving in the favor of stabilizing forces around
TiO2. If you take a look at housing market improving, what, some 21% year-over-year and the [ph] season (41:14) that
will come in the U.S. in the second quarter, and China which is expected to resume some infrastructure investment as
their change in government takes place. Customer inventory levels are normalizing and so yeah, it's going to be a tough
end of the year, but we see stabilization occurring in the first half of next year. And as the macroeconomic picture plays
out, we can get more specific on that.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, can you talk about use of proceeds from Coatings and potential for share
buy-backs given your current share price? Thank you.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Well, Nick, why don't you start on that for Dave?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Sure. Hi, David. When you think about the proceeds, I talked to you today about what
the dollar value is now sized to be on an after-tax basis and as I mentioned, we need to finalize that as the sale actually
closes. But I think a good basis to be thinking about right now is around that $4 billion number after-tax proceeds. And
the first thing we're going to do is, as I mentioned, we want to make sure we maintain that strong balance sheet. The
AA2 rating is very important to us. So strengthening that balance sheet is one of the key criteria and one of the first
things we're going to be looking to do there.
Subsequent to that, what we're going to be doing is looking at returning excess cash to our shareholders as we always
talk about doing unless we have a compelling investment opportunity. That investment opportunity could be capacity
increases, could be opportunities around further investments in some of the R&D work. It could be potential
acquisitions. So there's a lot of ways in which that could manifest itself.
The other thing is obviously when you think about returning value to the shareholders, the fact that we've had 432
consecutive dividends displays our commitment to the dividend program and ultimately board decision there as to
dividend. And share buyback you mentioned, we have active share buyback programs in place, David and we continue
to operate against those. Primary purpose there is to make sure that we don't have dilution in the earnings from any of
the management options that would be exercised over the course of time.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. With regard to your Seed business in North America, would you
comment on prospective pricing prospects for 2013 relative to the range of positive 5% to 10% that your competitor put
out? And specifically address AquaMax, your yield differential of 8% there, what you're looking at on pricing and
acreage for that product, please.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yes. Kevin, we're really very pleased with how our Agriculture business has
performed through this season and is performing in Latin America. We see that value proposition on the Right Product

Right Acre and the improvements in our product portfolio that Karen mentioned as she went through the segment
remarks are really having an impact in our position.
We have launched our price card. We do price locally. I think that – I'm not going to size that today, but because – we
do it on a customer-by-customer basis, and those discussions are going on right now. But I think it's a very positive
environment from a value that we will continue to supply next year with our new products, with Xtreme, with
AquaMax. And I can tell you that the early indications are early orders are strong. So we see this environment very
positive going forward and will be pricing it as we come through and have that order book filled.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yeah, hi. A quick question on Photovoltaics business. Can you discuss how much of this decline
is cyclical versus secular and when do you think this business can return back to its former level? And then just
quickly, Nick, there was a charge in the segment in thin films, maybe you can add some color to that.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, I'll take the first one, and Nick can be additive. So I mean if you take a look at
PV, we were coming through – the second half of last year, obviously, there was inventory buildup in the value chain.
That was righting itself and we were seeing improvement in that industry coming through the first half of this year.
And then there is overcapacity from a module standpoint, coupled with trade actions taken that have really created – the
best thing I can call it is confusion, uncertainty, that is impacting demand.
Now I think it might take more than a quarter or two to play this out. Our expectations as we look forward is that these
things will work their way out, but our expectations are sales next year, 2013, are going be flat-ish with 2012. Now, we
do believe longer term, as this works through, that the – with where module pricing is versus grid parity, that we are
believers that this industry has a solid future and will continue to get back, longer term, to double digit growth. It's just
not going to happen in 2013, is our view of the marketplace today. Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: I'm sorry, P.J., on the second piece that you talked about, which is the impairment
charge that we took and if you size that, it was $150 million impairment charge relating to this segment, E&C. This
related to the thin film PV modules and systems that we manufacture in China. This did not have anything to do with
materials such as the Solamet or the Tedlar. This was around the thin films module manufacture. And the reason is
what Ellen already articulated for you. The uncertainties going on, the pricing pressures, the margin compressions,
resulted in us taking that impairment in the quarter.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning. Can you remind me of the timing of your TiO2 expansion over the
next two years? And then secondarily, can you talk about changes in incentive compensation in the third and in the
fourth quarter, in the light of your earnings perhaps not being as strong as you had initially hoped?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So, we had a broad program on expansion that included remount in every facility we
have, and a second line in Altamira. Those expansions were to take place in 2012, 2013 and 2014, with Altamira
scheduled to come on very late in 2014, early 2015 kind of timeframe. This is a business in a market that we evaluate
those and bring them on in a very disciplined manner and we'll continue to gauge the market in depth, but we're
committed to those expansions. And I think that they'll serve us well over the long term, because continued demand of
TiO2 is going to continue to grow at about GDP. So whether it's delayed a quarter or whatever, time will tell as this
marketplace plays out. But we think it's solid.

Your second question was around the impact of – obviously, our compensation programs will be lower, based on the
impact of the second half of the year. I'm not sure there is a materiality to the impact on our earnings from that
standpoint, but those estimates will be lower as our earnings will be lower for the year.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert A. Koort>: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just provide a little more clarification
on a couple of the restructuring charges. I'm interested on the S&P side. It looked like that was about 40% of the
severance, but that segment might be 10% or 15% of sales. So what's causing sort of the excessive adjustment there?
And then, what is it in industrial polymers that's requiring an impairment charge? I thought those markets were maybe
a bit healthier. So is there one or two product lines that are causing that?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. Nick, why don't you give him some clarity here?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Sure. I think, Bob, when you look at the overall margins of S&P, and you can see
what our long-term objectives are and where we're driving to achieve, couple that with the market conditions that we're
facing right now and the slower – in the Industrial segments, I think you can understand why S&P is driving for some
of those restructuring changes, and why they represented $55 million out of the total $152 million of charge in the
quarter.
It's ways that we're going to drive to achieve those long-term margins that we realize, or that we projected, as the
market continues to come back for us. On the polymers side, I think what you're probably referring to is the impairment
charge there, and that was a $92 million impairment charge. And this related to our neoprene facility. This is a product
that's supplied into the industrial polymer sector of belts for mining industry, that type of thing. And what we've seen
there is, margins deteriorating, pricing under pressure, raw material increases, and those market conditions resulted in
us taking that impairment of $92 million in the quarter.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning. Just one quick follow-up in terms of metrics on titanium dioxide. You
indicated that you saw inventory levels were coming down to more manageable levels. If you could give us metrics
there? And then, also on the foreign exchange side, we don't often see this order of magnitude negative impact for
DuPont on ForEx, and I gather a large part of that was Latin America. Can you talk about your pricing strategy down
there? How much is in local currency? How much is in U.S. dollars? And how much do you anticipate this continuing
into the fourth quarter?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. So thanks, Frank, for the question. Now, on the TiO2 question, if you read
through to what our customers in TiO2 are saying in their releases are, in – especially in the U.S., they talk about
destocking is largely complete. They talk about normalizing inventory levels. So those comments are really drafting off
of what our customers are saying in the industry, which is a gauge in terms of the whole value chain and where
inventories are, and I think a positive one for really going into next year and the season. You talk about the Brazilian
real, and Nick can comment on that.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Yeah, so when you think about Ag and the pricing in the region, in Latin America,
you got local currency pretty much in Brazil around our corn supply. And when you think about Argentina, that would
be done in the U.S. dollar basis. And when you think about the currency change that has occurred in the quarter, for the
real, we were at 1.63 third quarter last year. And it's at 2.03 third quarter this year. So you can see the significant
change in the currency, and that 20% difference really is part of that $0.13 currency impact I talked about. And you
didn't talk about, ask about euro, but euro's same sort of magnitude. You're talking about, last year it was 1.24 and this

year, it's 1.44. So the currency impact did have a significant impact of the overall EPS.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike J. Ritzenthaler>: Hi, good morning. For the newest restructuring effort announced this morning, can you
help provide some context around the geography component for the calculus of trimming the work force versus the
business line? And I guess, in the broader context, you've been focused on productivity for several years, which of
course has been beneficial. But at what point are there diminishing returns? I think in the previous question, you had
answered about S&P, at what point are there diminishing returns as you see some end markets such as housing turning
the corner?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Thanks, Mike, for the question. The impact of the restructuring hits all regions of the
world. So if you think about even the residual costs from DPC, that residual cost resides in every region of the world.
And we don't size it by geography. We allow our businesses and functions to talk to their people locally, which is
where those conversations should take place. So it's an overall type of thing. And the businesses, I would describe it
more as surgical in terms of looking at their value change and making the necessary structural changes that they need,
regardless of where it is in the world, to react to a changing environment.
And so when you think about productivity, it is kind of a funny story. We learned a lot by doing the separation from
DPC that allowed us to think about how we operate from a corporate, core and infrastructure standpoint; it really
enabled us to take additional action at this time and to really streamline our corporate functions and support for our
businesses, to be much more efficient and effective in getting the necessary work done.
And from a business standpoint, as you know, businesses do, product lines move. Businesses, each one has their own
particular cycle. But some of these things are to create renewal or head room for investments in new products and
research and development in different areas. And so it's more of a renewal standpoint from them. And with the size and
breadth of our product line, I think there's always going be opportunities to do that, depending on our ability to
innovate and really replace ourselves, right, out in that marketplace. So it is about getting back to focusing on creating
momentum, streamlining the headquarters and the corporate staffs, and really allowing the businesses to respond very
agilely in a very uncertain environment.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks. Two things. First, when I look at infrastructure investment in China, it looks like it
rose in September. It's been positive all year. Residential's been flat since April. So can you help us understand what
specific end markets you're feeling the pressure in? And then second, just a quick question, of the 1,500 people, how
many of them are outside of DPC?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah. So the 1,500 people are not in DPC. So DPC, we are in the process of standing
that up as we separate. These 1,500 people are either in – as part of the residual costs, or part of the other actions that
we are taking from a business or functional standpoint.
As far as China goes, it's always interesting to try to get underneath those numbers. But if you think about housing,
commercial construction and residential construction are not providing any lift from a China standpoint. And if you
take an example, like if you think about fluoropolymers, that goes into wire cable, and that's basic to a lot. But it's not
showing any progress. And so it impacts a lot of different industrial and transportation and construction type of
markets. The bright spot we see in China is automotive, and Nutrition & Health and Agriculture. And those are the
three areas that we continue to see movement in, but on the Industrial side or the Construction side, we don't see any
meaningful activity.

Thank you. The next question is from Chris Nocella from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris J. Nocella>: Yes, hi. Just thinking about 2013, given your long-term guidance for 7% sales growth and
12% EPS growth, and given that 2012 may set a lower base than previously expected, can you maybe frame your early
outlook in 2013 in this context?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Yeah, so let me talk about 2013 for a minute. I think that that might be helpful. So if
you talk to our economists, they are projecting it to be, GDP to be a little lower in 2013 than it is this year. Western
Europe, zero. Asia growth, everybody pegs it comparable to 2012, but I think it's very different depending on sector.
North American GDP they're expecting to grow less than 2012 due to the many uncertainties that we see, at least
impacting the first half of the year, like the debt issues, fiscal cliff and the election outcome.
But if you take a look at the sectors where we participate; Ag, strong fundamentals, global stocks remain tight, prices
are good from a farm income standpoint, but they're volatile. We've got excellent momentum from our 2012 product
performance and the early orders that we're seeing now for a strong 2013 strong season. Planted acres are forecast to be
very good for Brazil, safrinha, and North America, and so we're very focused on really delivering the growth that we
see there. Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences, continued margin expansion through cost synergies,
delivering on the synergies from the acquisition. You saw the kind of margin expansion we saw. They've got new
products in the pipeline and innovation coming. And I think we'll see continued performance improvements there.
If you take a look at Performance Materials, auto builds are forecast to be up maybe only 1%, 1.5% next year, so off its
5%, 5.5% base this year, but growth. And our innovation centers are really helping us with penetration on these
advanced polymers into that industry.
So let's talk about things like Safety & Protection. The restructuring actions will take hold. We'll see savings in that
segment next year that'll help expand margin, in addition to U.S. housing improvement that will help bolster up them.
And Electronics & Communications, I've already stated that in PV, we expect it to be flat year-over-year. And the
improving part of that will continue to be the strength in smartphone, tablets and things. And P-Chem, as we said, we
expect the Performance Chemicals, the TiO2 market, to bottom in the first half of 2013 and that longer-term, TiO2
demand will continue to correlate with GDP.
So overall, there's a lot of positives and then there's some areas that we have to really focus on, like TiO2 and really –
and getting PV to really work through some of their issues, as they are. And so 2013's going to really be determined by
the macroeconomic environment and what happens from the United States coming through the election with these
issues. So I think we've got a lot of strength going with us for it and we're on top of the challenges we have to see
where that'll end.
