Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Thanks, John. As you can see from our earnings news release this morning, we had a very strong first quarter,
delivering a double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth and beating our original forecast.
We're very pleased with our start to the year and our outlook for the remainder of 2012. As a result today, we're raising
our ongoing EPS guidance range for the full year 2012 by $0.05 on both, the bottom and the top of the range, reflecting
another year of top tier performance.
For the first quarter, we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share of $1.03, an increase of 13.2% over the prior year.
Sales increased 5.9% on an operational basis that is excluding an unfavorable 1.3% impact from exchange rates which
was driven by strong performance across a number of our products and businesses, reported sales increased 4.6%.
Emerging markets broadly defined sales increase more than 10%, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange
with double-digit growth in key emerging markets across the businesses. We also saw meaningful improvement in the
adjusted gross margin ratio, up 260 basis points from the prior year to more than 61% as a result of the many margin
improvement initiatives we're implementing company wide.
In the quarter, we drove better margin performance across our major businesses, including proprietary pharmaceuticals,
vascular nutritionals and diagnostics. We delivered more than 13% ongoing EPS growth and a 150 basis point
improvement in our adjusted operating margin, while continuing to invest in the businesses. Ongoing R&D investment
was 10% of sales, reflecting continued progress across our new product programs. We also accelerated SG&A
investments behind many of our key products and businesses to drive future growth.
In the non-operating section of P&L in the quarter, the net foreign exchange gain loss line was unfavorable $58 million
compared to 2011. Other income in the quarter included $60 million favorable resolution of contractual agreement.
These two items therefore offset the quarter with neutral effect.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2012, we're raising both our ongoing earnings per share guidance range, $0.05
on both ends of the range, to $5 to $5.10. With our planned separation on track for completion by the end of the year,
the guidance we provided, continues to reflect a full year outlook for the company in total.
Regarding sales growth for 2012, we continue to forecast operational growth in the mid single digit. Based on the
current exchange rate we continued to expect a negative impact of exchange on sales of approximately 2.5% for the full
year. As result, reported sales growth as expected to be in the low single digits in-line with the forecast we provided in
January.
Also for 2012, we're forecasting continued improved in our adjusted gross margin ratio, which we continue to expect to
approach 62% for the full year. This reflects efficiency initiatives and favorable mix, partially offset by the expected

decline in U.S. lipid sales and promised royalties.
We're forecasting continuing investments to drive growth in 2012 and beyond, with full year R&D of 9.5% to 10% of
sales and ongoing SG&A somewhat under 28% of sales. Overall, we continued to expect to expand our operating
margins by around 100 basis points in 2012.
We're forecasting ongoing net interest expense of approximately $425 million and we continued to expect an ongoing
tax rate of 14.5% to 15% for the full year 2012.
Turning to the outlook for the second quarter. The forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $1.20 to a $1.22 with
forecast of specified items of $0.07 in the second quarter, primarily reflecting costs of previous restructuring and
integration action. This forecast excludes future onetime costs related to the separation.
Our operational sales growth in the second quarter, that is growth for exchange is expected to be in the mid
single-digits. At current exchange rates we'd expect a roughly 3.5% negative impact from exchange in the second
quarter, resulting in reported sales growth in the low single-digits. We're forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of
approximately 62% in the second quarter, an increase from the second quarter of 2011.
As mentioned remain on track with our plan to separate Abbott into two leading healthcare companies. One in
diversified medical products and the other in research based pharmaceuticals. We believe this separation will provide
two unique and compelling investment opportunities for shareholders.
Our transition organization has been fully engaged in the separation since our announcement last October. This is the
same organization that executed the separation of our hospital products business and successfully integrated our key
acquisitions. We're currently working through many details of separating the two organizations. There is a significant
amount of work to do, but the process is going well and is proceeding according to plan. Last month, we announced
that the new research-based pharmaceutical company will be called AbbVie.
The AbbVie name connects the new company to Abbott and its heritage of -- science and Vie which suggest the Latin
route for life, calls attention for the vital work the company does. During the second quarter, we expect to file the initial
Form 10 with the SEC or AbbVie.
The Form 10 will provide historical results for AbbVie on a GAAP basis for the past three years and for the first
quarter of 2012. These historical results will include an allocation of certain costs, previously held at the corporate level
to the business. Amendments I typically made to the Form 10 disclosures after the initial filing, as more information
becomes available for disclosure, including quarterly results. We'd expect amendments to our filing as well, until it's
declared effective, which is expected to occur later in the year.
A historical balance sheet is not expected to include an allocation of debt to AbbVie such as debt, as such debt was
incurred for the total Abbott operations and was not associated with specific AbbVie entities. The final or effective
Form 10 will however include pro forma adjustments to reflect the impact of debt levels, cash balances and interest
expense for AbbVie as an independent company.
The Form 10 is one element in our communications plans for AbbVie and for Abbott, post separation. We will also
have comprehensive Investor Relations efforts throughout the year to provide investors with information on the two
companies as we progress towards the seperation.
So in summary, we're off to a great start in 2012, beating expectations for the first quarter and raising our outlook for
the full year. This outlook again reflects strong and top tier performance as we execute the steps necessary to separate
Abbott into two leading healthcare companies by the end of the year.
With that, let's turn to the business operating highlights. John?

Thanks, Tom. I'll start with the diversified medical products businesses and then Larry will discuss the propitiatory
pharmaceutical business. Sales for our diversified medical products businesses increased mid single-digits in the first
quarter, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange.
We also continue to expand operating margins on a quarter across our diversified medical products businesses
including nutrition, diagnostics, vascular and diabetes care. Let's start with nutrition, where global sales in the quarter
increased more than 10%, driven by strong growth in both the U.S. as well as international. In the U.S., sales increased
11% as we continue to maintain our strong market positions in both the Adult and Pediatric Nutritional segments. U.S.
Pediatric Nutrition sales increased more that 15%. We continue to gain share and maintain our strong leadership
position in the U.S. Infant Formula market with Similac.
We expect continued strong growth of this brand throughout the year, as we launch new products to support Similac in
the pre-nail segment of the market. Our toddler brand, PediaSure continues to grow at a double-digit pace. U.S. Adult
Nutritional sales increased more than 7%, driven by double-digit growth of both, Ensure and Glucerna.
We expect Ensure and Glucerna collectively to generate roughly $2 billion in full year sales this year, globally. Earlier
this week, we initiated a construction of the new liquid manufacturing facility in Ohio that will primarily support the
growth of our U.S. adult business.
Abbott is the worldwide leader in adult nutrition and as the baby boomer demographic ages, we expect continued
market expansion of the Adult Nutritional segment. Outside of the U.S., sales increased to approximately 10% on an
operational basis in Nutritionals, including the negative impact of foreign exchange, reported sales increased more than
9%. This growth was driven by 13% growth in Pediatric Nutritionals with double-digit growth in the Infant Nutritionals
as well as PediaSure.
In the first quarter, we initiated more than 10 new product or geographic launches, each of which is helping to drive
market share gains. Emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of our total nutritional sales and they increased
double-digits this quarter.
In addition to driving sales growth, the key priority for our nutrition business is the expansion of operating margins.
We've implemented improvement plan to expand our nutrition margin from the low teens that we saw last year in 2011
to our target of more than 20% by 2015.
We have numerous efforts across the business with four main drivers of margin improvement. Those are product cost,
reducing packaging costs; ingredient costs and material costs; manufacturing or we're building plants closer to our
customers, particularly in fast growing, emerging markets; distribution, where we're going direct to customers in key
geographies and customer mix, where we're improving both our product and geographic mix to focus on more
profitable segments.
We're implementing the majority of these improvement initiatives here in 2012, which are expected drive significant
Nutritionals operating margin expansion in 2013 and beyond. As we look ahead to the second quarter in our Global
Nutritionals business, we expect high single-digit growth on an operational basis and mid to high single-digit growth on
a reported basis. In the U.S., this includes high single growth and internationally, this includes the high single-digit
growth on an operational basis and mid single-digit on a reported basis.
Let's move onto our Established Pharmaceuticals Business or EPD, which includes international sales of our branded
generics portfolio. Sales in the quarter increased 2% on an operational basis, including 3.5% negative impact of foreign
exchange, reported sales declined low single-digits.
Emerging markets now represent nearly 60% of total EPD sales, where many of the pharmaceutical markets are
growing at a strong double-digit pace. We're growing faster in these markets as we continue to expand our presence
and launch new brands, packaging enhancements and new formulations.
In the first quarter, EPD's operational sales in key emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Russia and China increased
collectively, 17%. Our large and glowing portfolio of more than 500 established pharmaceuticals, consists of trusted
well-known brands that are broad-used throughout the world.

Over the next several years, we expect to bring the benefits of these medicines to much broader patient populations
through registration across multiple geographies as well as launches of improved formulation to enhance efficacy and
improve convenience.
So looking ahead to the second in EPD, we expect low single-digit sales growth on an operational basis and a low
single-digit decline on a reported basis, which includes for this division, an expected negative impact of foreign
exchange of more than 6% in the second quarter.
And our global diabetes care business, worldwide reported sales declined 2.4%. U.S. sales increased more than 7% as
we continue to execute on our strategy to drive share gains among the insulin using patient population. We also
recently launched InsuLinx in the U.S., which is our new Blood Glucose Meter specifically for this segment. InsuLinx
has a touch-screen interface and several personalization features designed to improve the diabetes management
experience for patients.
International sales in our diabetes care business declined 7% on an operational basis, including the negative impact of
exchange, reported sales declined 8.7% due in part to certain reimbursement changes in Europe as well as overall
market softness. The negative impact in Europe was partially offset by stronger growth in emerging markets.
So looking ahead to the second quarter in diabetes care, we expect low to mid single-digit sales growth on an
operational basis and low single-digit reported sales growth. In our core laboratory diagnostics which includes
immunoassay, hematology and blood screening, global sales in the quarter increased more than 6% on an operational
basis, reported sales increased 5%.
In the U.S., sales increased nearly 13%. This strong growth was driven by continued uptake of our prism blood
screening system, and good momentum that began in the latter part of last year with several key account wins and
continued strong commercial execution. Outside of the U.S., operational sales increased 5% and reported sales
increased 3%.
We delivered strong growth in emerging market with sales in China, Brazil and Russia collectively increasing 25%. In
each of these markets, we continue to expand our presence with numerous new account wins internationally, including
the largest private laboratory in Latin America.
In point-of-care diagnostics, worldwide operational sales this quarter increased more that 19% and in molecular
diagnostics, world wide operational sales increased nearly 8%, reported molecular sales increased 6%. Looking ahead
to the second quarter in our global diagnostics business, we expect mid to high single-digit growth on an operational
basis and mid single-digit reported sales growth.
So moving on to medical devices and our Vision Care business, where global sales this quarter increased low
single-digits. This was primarily driven by mid single-digit growth in cataract, our largest, most profitable and fastest
growing segment within Vision Care. We also saw continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets such as
India and China.
Looking at the second quarter in our Vision Care business, we expect low single-digit sales growth on an operational
and reported basis. In our vascular business, excluding certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues, worldwide
vascular sales increased nearly 4% and U.S. vascular sales increased 8%.
As expected, reported sales decreased 5% this quarter as a result of more than 50% decline in royalty and supply
arrangement revenues including Promus. As a reminder, the third party distributor for Promus, is transitioning away
from this product as we approach the end of our distribution agreement this year.
Our vascular business also delivered strong growth in key emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil, which all
increased at strong double-digit growth rates. Sales of our XIENCE drug eluting stent franchise this quarter were a
record $404 million, representing global growth of nearly 7%.

Abbott holds the clear global leadership position as the world's number one drug eluting stent company. U.S. Science
sales increased more than 19% this quarter driven by the recent U.S. launches of XIENCE nano and XIENCE PRIME
as well as share gains from key account wins in the U.S. as we further penetrate competitor accounts and broaden our
overall footprint.
More than 60% of our drug eluting stent's sales occur outside the United States. In Japan, which is our second largest
geographic segment, we hold market share of more than 40%. We recently received approval for XIENCE PRIME in
Japan and now have the exclusive position in the long length everolimus-eluting stent segment.
Also contributing to vascular sales growth this quarters, was Endovascular sales, which increased nearly 5%. In the past
year, we've launched seven new Endovascular products, including most recently U.S. approval for Absolute Pro, our
new self expanding stent for peripheral artery disease.
In our vascular pipeline, we recently presented two year data on our absorb -- Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold or BVS,
which demonstrated impressive efficacy and safety results, for the treatment of coronary artery disease. We also have
two clinical trials underway, studying BVS for peripheral disease. We continue to expect the full commercial launch of
absorb in Europe, by year-end and plan to initiate our U.S. clinical trial, later this year.
MitraClip which is our product for the treatment of mitral regurgitation continues to see strong demand outside of
United States, with sales of 25 million this quarter. So as we look ahead to the second quarter in our Global Vascular
business, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange as well as certain royalty and supply arrangement
revenues.
We expect sales of our underlying business to grow in the high single-digits, including the expected decline of royalty
in supply arrangement revenues as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange, we expect reported sales to decline
low single-digits in the second quarter. As a reminder, the Promus transition will be completed by the end of the year,
positioning our Vascular business in 2013 for stronger reported sales growth.
Finally, as Tom mentioned, the adjusted operating margin in the first quarter for the total company, increased
approximately 150 basis points over 2011. Nutrition, diagnostics, vascular and diabetes care contributed this expansion
with most of the diversified medical products businesses, each delivering at least 100 basis point or more margin
expansion in their businesses.
In nutrition as I mentioned, we expect to expand the operating margin from the low-teens to-date more than 20%. This
quarter, we saw a good progress towards that goal. In diagnostics, in addition to strong sales growth, we continue to
expand our operating margins, following a record year of profitability in 2011.
As a reminder, this business has had a high single-digit operating margin, just a few years ago. This quarter, we
delivered an operating margin in the high teens. We're applying many of our key earnings from the work we've done to
improve profitability in our diagnostic business, to our efforts to improve profitability in our diabetes care business,
where we continue to see good improvement on the bottom line.
And in vascular, despite the decline in Promus revenues which were expected, we delivered operating margin in the
high 20s in the quarter. We expect continued steady margin expansion for our diversified medical products businesses
over the course of the year and going into 2013 and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Larry to cover our Proprietary Pharmaceutical business. Larry?
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, John. Worldwide proprietary pharmaceutical sales increased more than 8% before the negative impact of
exchange. On a reported basis, sales increased 7%, including growth of 6.6% in the U.S. and nearly 8% internationally.
In immunology, global sales of HUMIRA increased more than 19% before the negative impact of exchange.
Performance was driven by international sales growth of 17.4% before exchange and U.S. sales growth of 22.7%

consistent with the underlying trends we saw throughout the quarter.
HUMIRA continues to whole the number one global share position. We continue to see strong market growth both in
the U.S. and internationally with HUMIRA demand outpacing the market. We're continuing our development efforts
for HUMIRA, including the study of new indications.
We recently received approval from the European commission for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, making HUMIRA
the first and only self-injectable biologic therapy for this disease. The approval also marks the seventh major indication
for HUMIRA in the European union.
We also have a number of other inductions currently in late stage development, many of which are unique to
HUMIRA. HUMIRA's utility across a growing number of diseases is one of the many attributes that set it apart from
other agents. HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the
product in 2012.
Moving on to AndroGel, where U.S. sales were approximately $230 million, up more than 23%. AndroGel holds the
number one market share position in the testosterone replacement market where growth has been driven by increase in
diagnosis and treatment.
AndroGel 1.62, our new low volume formulation has quickly become the second most prescribed therapy in the
market, second only to our older formulation AndroGel 1%. U.S. sales of Creon were nearly $70 million. Creon
maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market, where we continue to capture the vast majority of new
prescription starts. U.S. sales of Lupron were $140 million.
Our six month formulation approved last year, continues to perform well, driving share gains and expanding our
category leadership. U.S. sales of Synthroid were approximately $130 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintains
strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share, despite the entry of generics into the market, many years
ago.
Moving on to our more mature lipid franchise, where U.S. TriCor and Trilipix sales were $254 million and sales of
Niaspan were $190 million. Our lipid franchise has been impacted by softness in the overall branded cholesterol
market, as well as continued impact from last year's Accord and Aim-High study results as we've previously discussed.
So as we look ahead to the second quarter, in our Global Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business, we expect mid to high
single-digit operational sales growth and a forecast for approximately 3% negative impact from foreign exchange.
Moving onto our proprietary pharmaceuticals pipeline where we continue to make good progress. We currently have 30
compounds in human trials, including numerous medicines and development with breakthrough potential. Let's start
with immunology, where we have a number of next generation programs underway, all with an objective to raise the
bar with differentiated efficacy and safety. This high bar is important as we believe the success of new compounds will
be based on their ability to offer incremental efficacy and safety benefits beyond what's currently available for
physicians and patients today.
Our DVD-Ig hold promise in the treatment of RA as well as other conditions. This proprietary technology unites two
antibodies into a single molecule. Last year, we initiated a Phase 1 study in RA, for ABT-122 which combines the
established mechanisms, anti-TNF and IL-17 with the goal of elevating efficacy and improving the overall clinical
profile.
Our anti-CD4 biologic, BT-061 in development and partnership with Biotest is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for
RA and psoriasis. The way we've structured the collaboration, allows us to evaluate Phase 2B data prior to co-fuding of
Phase 3 program. And the product will need to demonstrate a clinically meaningful efficacy benefit, greater than
currently available therapies to clear the hurdle for advancement.
A recently announced agreement with Galapagos to develop and commercialize the next generation oral JAK1 inhibitor
is structured similarly. We believe this molecule which preferentially targets the JAK1 pathway, differentiates it from
other JAKs in development and may lead to a better overall profile. The Galapagos compound is currently in Phase 2A

development, with the potential to start Phase 2B next year. We are also evaluating a number of other oral candidates,
including an internal JAK1, a SYK inhibitor, as well as next generation anti-inflammatory modulators or AIMs to our
collaboration with Reata.
Moving on to chronic kidney disease, which is also on the rise, driven by higher rates of diabetes, obesity and an aging
population. Bardoxolone is a promising treatment in Phase 3 development for CKD with our partner Reata.
Bardoxolone is a Nrf2 activator, a novel mechanism that improves the kidney's ability to filter and remove waste from
the body.
Results from the Phase 2B study of Bardoxolone were unprecedented and showed a significant and sustained
improvement in kidney function. No other treatment to-date has demonstrated the ability to reverse the progression of
this disease. The Phase 3 study called BEACON is an outcomes based study, designed to assess bardoxolone's ability to
both stall or prevent chronic dialysis, kidney transplant, a cardiovascular death in stage four patients, a group that is just
free dialysis.
Enrollment has been very brisk, which reflects the significant need for new therapies in this disease. We expect results
from this 2,000 patient mobile trial in 2013. Also in development for the treatment of kidney disease is atrasentan.
Results from a Phase 2 dose ranging trial, showed atrasentan reduced protein in the urine, a symptom that is often
predictive of renal function. We would expect atrasentan to be complementary to bardoxolone within our portfolio. A
Phase 2B study is currently underway with results expected later this year.
Moving on to neuroscience, where we're developing compounds to address conditions such as Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, schizophrenia, pain and MS. Daclizumab is a next generation biologic and development for MS. Last year
Abbott and our partner company announced promising results from the first of two registration studies.
The first -- the Phase 3 study called DECIDE is ongoing. In this study, we hope to confirm the findings, observed in the
Phase 2 trial. If successful, we believe a significant reduction in disability and annual relapse rate against an active
competitor will be data that is unique to this promising and highly active treatment. Results from these study are
expected in 2014 with potential commercialization in 2015.
We're also developing an intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. The gel, currently in
advanced clinical development in the U.S. and marketed as Duodopa in Europe, consists of two compounds with
proven efficacy in this disease; Levodopa-carbidopa. Through unique delivery system, the intestinal gel is infused
directly in to small intestine via a portable pump.
Yesterday, we announced results from a Phase 3 trial, showing patients treated for 12 weeks reported significant
improvements in disease symptom versus the oral forms of the products. The results from the study will be presented at
the American Academy of Neurology Meeting, later this month. We expect our U.S. registration submission to occur
this year.
Endometriosis and fibroids are both associated with a number of symptoms including a pain and infertility. Our
partnered compound elagolix has the unique profile that provides symptom reduction for avoiding the adverse effects
that can sometimes be associated with current treatment. The Phase 2 clinical program for fibroids is currently
underway and the Phase 3 study in endometriosis is expected to begin this quarter.
Moving onto oncology, where we're focused on developing targeted treatment than inhibit tumor growth and improved
response to common cancer therapies. Elotuzumab has been developed with the partner company, for the treatment of
multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer. Phase 2 data suggest the potential for improved efficacy
versus current treatments. A Phase 3 study for Elotuzumab is currently underway. We also have active part and Bcl-2
inhibitor programs as well as a number of other early stage, oncology compounds in development.
And finally turning to our rapidly advancing HCV program, where we have a broad portfolio with compounds
expanding three mechanisms of action, including protease, non-nucleoside polymerase and NS5A inhibitors. Recent
data suggest that combination regimen will likely prove to be the most effective approach and we're well positioned in
that regard, given our portfolio.

Earlier this month, abstracts for the upcoming EASL meeting were published online, including results from two of
Abbott's Phase 2 interferon-free HCV studies, PILOT and CO-PILOT. In the CO-PILOT study, two different doses of
our protease inhibitor ABT-450 plus our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor ABT-333 and ribavirin were
administered for 12 weeks. The result showed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post treatment in 93% and 95%
of treatment-naïve genotype 1 patients.
And these patients' response was independent of HCV subtype, host IL28B genotype, our dose level of ABT-450. The
PILOT study evaluated treatment with ABT-450, plus another of our non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, ABT-072
in ribavirin for 12 weeks.
The result showed sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post treatment in 91% of genotype 1 treatment-naïve
patients. Both regimens were well tolerated and the most reported adverse events were mild in severity. Full results
with longer term follow-up data from these studies, as well as the number of other abstracts will be presented at the
EASL meeting this week in Barcelona, Spain.
We're building on the PILOT and CO-PILOT results with data from our larger global Phase 2 clinical trials. These
studies include various combinations with all three compounds in our portfolio, both with and without ribavirin, as well
as evaluation across various HCV genotypes.
Additional data from these studies which are planned for presentation later this year, will shed further light on our
promising program. We have a high level of confidence that our HCV compounds in development will dramatically
change the treatment landscape. We expect to start Phase III studies in 2013 with commercialization in 2015, putting us
in a very competitive position from a timing perspective.
So in summary this quarter Abbott delivered strong double-digit performance with ongoing EPS growth of more than
13%. And we raised our ongoing earnings per share guidance for the year. We remain focused on the process of
separating Abbott in to two leading healthcare companies which is on-track to be completed by the end of the year.
And with that Tom, John and I will be glad to take your questions. Operator?

Yes, congratulations on a wonderful quarter yet. As we think about operating margins, Tom I mean you clearly, and
particularly on the nutritional side John laid out very thoroughly and clearly some of the drivers there. Can you a talk
little bit more, just over the next couple -- looking ahead over the next couple of years and as the company separates,
what is the biggest margin drivers beyond this nutritional program, is it diabetes, what's next? And is this going to be
the similar problems that you laid out for nutritional or is that more about cost? Just, again any perspective would be
welcome, where do we go from here?
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
I think what John said in his remarks is a good representation of the way we are approaching and I think our experience
in diagnostics really helped a lot in this regard. And we talked about this in the past, what that team did is they didn't
limit their analysis of their business to just the cost area. They really looked comprehensively at the P&Ls all the way
from the top to the bottom line. They did a lot of thinking through mix, product mix, customer mix, profitability by
customer segment and they did some very good analytics and addressed some of the challenges there, that really
weren't evident as we looked at these businesses differently prior to their, to the work that they did in that area.
And we really taken that approach and that template and brought it over to the other businesses and very
comprehensively looked at each. So as John described in his nutritional discussion there it's a pretty broad range of
things beyond just the cost area. And our other business have done similar exercises.
In terms of what's going to drive operating margin improvement for the diversified company, certainly the biggest
opportunity over the next two, three years is nutrition. I think that's where we see the highest ramp. We were in the 13
range I think in operating margin couple of years ago. And we see a very good path to 20 here in the next two, three
years and we have a very thorough plan to get there. So that clearly is the biggest mover. But every single business is
continuing to execute their programs again similar to what diagnostics did. And we see steady improvement in each
business, including diagnostics. While we've gotten that business up in to the upper teens, we clearly see that getting
well into the 20s in the next couple of years as well as they continue to execute.
So it's a way of doing business. It's a continual process and I think across the businesses, it's going to contribute to a
good margin expansion element of the diversified company as we move forward.
Rick Wise
Thanks. And follow-up with two product or division related questions. Core Lab you had sub 13% excellent
performance. Maybe highlights some other pipeline products and how sustainable. And last on Absorb given that you
launch later this year, maybe you could update us in terms of just some basic expectations about the penetration, the
product's likely to get in the first year or so post launch? Thanks again.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Yeah, let me take the first part. So Absorb has been doing well in a limited clinical setting, as we've describe before.
And then we expect full commercialization launch later this year. The reaction has been very good from clinicians
around the world. And as you know the data results, that we've showed so far are similar to what we've seen with
XIENCE and XIENCE PRIME in terms of safety profile and the efficacy. So very encouraged there. And as I
mentioned later this year plans to start the U.S. trial remain on track there. So it's a good story there.
in Core Lab it's been, it's interesting because it's a business frankly that we haven't talked a lot about the different
products and tests like we used to, but there's has been a number of new products that have been launched, new assays.
PRISM obviously has been important as that expands, we'll have good growth there with both of those system,

particularly in some emerging markets around the world where markets like China we've grown in excess of 35%,
we've grown twice the market. Brazil we've had very good traction with our vitamin D and Chagas test.
Russia's growing in excess at 30%, it's off a smaller base but we are really investing in some of those emerging markets
and leveraging our overall global leadership position. It's definitely making a big difference. And then as I mentioned
in my remarks we did win the largest private laboratory in Latin America in the first quarter of this year. So those are
the good things.
The European market's been a little challenging, I think for everybody. Other competitors have talked about that. But
that's one of the things that you have to deal with and you plan for. We also had some specific tests in the pipeline last
year, for example the vitamin D test that I mentioned launched a number of new assays this year, include diabetes and
cardiac markers. And then we have other things that we've done in that business, as you know with our acquisition of
STARLIMS, that was our first entree into informatics and we've launched what we called OneLab which is an offshoot
of the STARLIMS systems that's gaining some good traction and giving our customers some options that they didn't
have before.
Rick Wise
Yeah, thank you, John.
Operator
Thank you, our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
Michael Weinstein
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one, let me ask on the Hep C. So what are we going to see
additionally at EASL that we didn't see in the Abstract?
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Yeah, most of our abstracts Mike, this is Larry, contain the information that we have at EASL. So when they posted
earlier this month that pretty much encompassed all of our data. And again the key data there for us would be the
CoPilot data which showed very strong SBR 12 rates of 93% to 95%. And then PILOT also was very strong, SVR
rates, SVR24 actually at 91%. So, but most of the abstracts that have been released back in early April will be
comprehensive of what we have at EASL this weekend.
Michael Weinstein
One of the questions that people had, has been down to that on the street, post the release of the abstracts. The
difference in the response rates between the non-CC naïve patients and those that are non-CC treatment failure patients,
interferon failure patients. Do you have any thoughts as to why there is such a difference in response rates between
those two groups? Obviously -- is small but there is a pretty strong difference there.
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Well, people who are non-responders are certainly the most difficult to treat, right? And this data that we have right
now is kind of our first foray into that group and it does only include two of our agents, the protease inhibitor as well as

the polymerase.
And so as you know, we've got additional studies underway, CC as I mentioned later this year that are inclusive of the
NS5A which we believe to be a much more potent group, but that 47% SVR rate within that non-responder group is
actually better than just about anything else that's been put forth to-date, including some pretty low level response rates
from the new class that we've seen here over the last six week. So, I would say that 47 looks very good, relative to
anything else that we've seen. And I think we'll see more again later this year, when we put together a more potent
agent NS5A in combination with this tough-to-treat patient population.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Yeah. And then of course Mike, the other data that we showed in the most prevalent form of the virus in developed
markets, the GT1 treatment-naïve patients that's where we saw the cure rates of, in excess of 90%. So those were
unprecedented types of results, it's obviously as Larry said, early data and we expect to have more data later in the year
on a broader patient population but clearly I think put us in a leadership position in HCV.
Michael Weinstein
Good. Let me ask one question of EPD. The performance this quarter was a bit light of our thinking, if it was up 1.8%
constant currency. At the analyst -- I mean you guys had talked about EPD growing mid to high single digits going
forward and I know emerging markets are close to 60% of the revenues. So help us out there. What is going on in EPD,
it's important because it's a third of the profits for new Abbott? So it's going to be a key driver. So, why is growth in
low single-digits right now, what isn't in that mid to high single-digit range you guys talked about?
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Yeah. Well, obviously that mid to high was a bit of a longer term target for this group. And the results in the first
quarter were very consistent with the guidance we've provided in January. And what's happening, this organization has
been in place for a little more than a year.
There are a number of their geographic expansion initiatives and product expansion initiatives which are just in the
early stages, programs such as the Zydus collaboration, which will bring new molecules to the market and some of the
payback and some of the commercial investments that have been made over the last -- over the first year or so, are still
a bit further out.
So, I think we're on track in the first quarter. We do expect growth rates to improve later in the year. There has been, as
you know there is a base part of this business that is the developed world that is growing a bit more slowly and in the
first quarter, we were working through a little bit of a headwind in some of the European countries there, as we
progressed through the year.
But I think the terms will get better in particularly the third and fourth quarter. And as we exit the year and our forecast
show that we'll be much closer to that range we talked about at the analyst meeting as we progress into 2013. So, we
expect better growth, I think you'll see it and we'll just have to keep monitoring it as we go forward.

Great. Thanks.

Thank you, Mike.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Golden Sachs.
Jami Rubin
Thank you. Just a few questions, Tom. TriCor, what are your expectations for revenues going forward, just given the
settlement that you've reached with Teva and Teva's commentary that the FDA has issues with their formulation, and
won't be launching this year. Do you anticipate that there will be other generics on the market and does your settlement
agreement allow for other generics to reach the market?
And then I have a follow-up question on HUMIRA growth, which has been quite remarkable in terms of the
re-acceleration we've seen with HUMIRA growth in the U.S. along with the entire anti-TNF -- and I am just wondering
what you think is going on and as you know there will be a JAK inhibitor potentially reaching the market in the second
half of this year and if your guidance for the full year incorporates a competitive dynamic and if you could just share
with us what your thinking is. Thanks.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Yeah, so this is Tom. On TriCor I mean, I've heard some of the comments you mentioned from Teva, but we can't
make assumptions on what they are going to do or not going to do and clearly they have a right to enter the market in
the second half. And so we continue to model that. I think even if there was somewhat of a delay there over the, even
the near term or the medium term, that's not real meaningful for us because clearly as we move in to 2013 and '14 these
liquid products are in their last phases and we don't have expectations for sales for those products. So that issue may be
a little more meaningful for the other company than it is for us, and we will see how it plays out in the second half.
John, you want to take -- Larry you want to take Humira.
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Sure. This is Larry. Hi Jami.
Jami Ruben
Hi.
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
The market growth has been very strong for biologics overall. And I think you'll see that our growth from a prescription
trend basis is growing even faster than the market. I think from an overall market we've seen a little more contribution

from the dermatology side which has very low levels of penetration currently. I think that lifting the overall biologic
market. I think unique to HUMIRA has just been some very strong commercial execution across all the categories. We
continue to see very good share momentum, particularly in dermatology relative to Enbrel as in the -- space relative to
the Cimzia's of the world.
We continue to see really nice market share gains there. In rheum it's held in there quite nicely for us as well despite an
increased level of competition from smaller players, who have garnered I would say pretty low levels of share overall.
Now you asked about our contemplation of potential launch of Pfizer's tofacitinib product. We pretty much have almost
like, in the TriCor situation, we have to assume that they will be successful with their ultimate approval on a PDUFA
date which I believe is in August. And so we've factored that into our outlook for the year. And certainly we feel very
good about our position, the strength of HUMIRA relative to that product launch. And but to your specific question yes
we have factored that into our outlook for this year.
Jami Ruben
And just Tom very quickly on your tax rate guidance for the year '14 and half of '15. Does that contemplated in R&D
tax credit, is that already in that number?
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial

David Lewis
Tom just want to the come back to EPD for a second. So it does appear the key emerging markets within the seven
performing actually quite well. So I wonder if the performance today which I know you hope to get better, is that more
a function of the BRICs not growing as fast as you want or expected or is the situation with the non-BRIC markets that
maybe more developed in nature or being pressured for economic reasons kind of at this current time?
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Yeah, it's the non-BRIC but we frankly as we look at this business over the long term, medium term we have factored
in to that the mid to upper expectation on sales growth, the fact that this base business will not grow as fast but as the
emerging markets grow as fast as we expect, and as it becomes a higher percentage of the business, I think it's going to
support growth in the range that we have targeted.
I will say as part, of the latter part of 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012 there is still is some residual austerity of facts
coming through in the developed world element of this business and that's a little bit of what you are seeing in the first
quarter, a bit of headwind but in the BRIC areas very strong double-digit growth and we are really pleased with how
the business is executing in those areas.
David Lewis
Okay. And maybe just a quick question for Larry on Hep C. Have there been any decisions made about, if you look at
the regimens in PILOT and CoPilot, which are those regimens, if any, are going to be brought into Phase III?
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
No final decisions on Phase III at this point in time. I would say one thing that we learned from PILOT, CoPilot though
is that we used ABT-072 in PILOT. That's our, again the polymerase inhibitor and we used 333 in CoPilot. As you can
see in the Phase IIb studies that we've described on clinicaltrial.gov, we are moving forward in Phase IIb with the
ABT-333 polymerase. But I think more importantly is the data that's coming from our broader Phase II program aviator
and navigator, that really combine and have various arms, that have again various combinations of these three
compounds with and without ribavirin that will really be the guide to what we move forward with into Phase III. And
again right now we are talking initiation of Phase III in 2013 but as you can imagine we're working very hard to have
that occur as soon as we can but that's our guidance today.
David Lewis
Okay, and maybe just one quick one, I am sorry, for John or Tom. You talked about nutritional opportunities, obviously
a significant driver of DMP growth. You talked about two different opportunities, the first which is a cost-driven
opportunity. The second is mix. So I guess I am just curious can both of those opportunities move forward
simultaneously, which we think of them as sort of a phased affect.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
No, I mean all of the margin initiatives are being addressed concurrently as aggressively as the organization can do it.
So it's going to -- there is no reason to phase things and there are numerous, numerous, literally over a 100 programs
that the business is executing on as we speak.

Great. Very helpful. Thank you.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Glen Navarro from RBC Capital Market.
Glen Novarro
Hi, Good morning. Two questions. One on HUMIRA, the OUS trends. Can you comment about, I can't imagine it's
entering new markets. So it must be indications. So maybe discuss what's driving the international growth. And then
my second question is on U.S. stent. Can you give a sense of what pricing's been doing in the market sequentially and
what DES penetration was in the first quarter. Thanks.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Let me take the last part first, Glen. So stent pricing actually has moderated nicely from what we've seen in as you
know last year, throughout the year. And I think the competitor saw this as well, was declining in the high single digits.
It's moderated to mid single-digit price decline. And that is a function of a number of different things. One on our end
is the launch of both nano and PRIME. So getting into the short lengths, the longer length -- small vessels and longer
lengths, excuse me. And those are premium products and I think that's helped to stabilize as well. And some other
competitive launches in addition.
So that's one thing. DES penetration has been around 80%. And with PROMUS out of the mix, as you know, two,
helps our overall pricing situation now that they are no longer part of that third-party revenue line in our overall
numbers. So DES penetration is good, PCA volume has been up nicely particularly outside of the U.S., in certain
emerging markets that's growing in the mid-teens. So the dynamics there are good for the underlying business, despite
the noise. And as I mentioned on the call it's really about setting up the business for much stronger growth in 2013 as
we get through this transition here with PROMUS coming out of the numbers for us.
Glen Novarro
Just to ask one follow-up, just U.S. PCI volume has that's been kind of tracking flat up a little, down a little. Any
indication what that was in the first quarter and the 80% DES penetration. Is that better than what we seen in the second
half of last year? Thanks.

Yes, it is slightly better. We were seeing pushing upwards of 80%, 79%, it's the first time we have got to 80 in a while.
And the U.S. PCI volume there has been relatively flat and down just very slightly sequentially. But as I mentioned up
kind of in the mid-single-double-digits worldwide and then certain international emerging markets been up quite
strongly.
Glen Novarro
And then just international HUMIRA growth?
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Sure. Yeah, I think it's a combination of factors Glen. Certainly, HUMIRA has a leadership position and as a leader,
grows probably in excess of the market place most quarters, that leadership extends across as I said now seven
indication. So it is somewhat driven by new indications.
It's also driven by some expansion in geographic presence, Japan continues to move forward nicely, we've launched in
China. I think in general, the overall driving factors is market growth, we continue to see across the major markets,
growth rates anywhere from 14% to 20%, just based again on the benefits that the product brings, relative to
downstream cost that can be incurred for naturally in the severity of these diseases. So, market growth is probably your
primary driver there in the international side and we're growing a little bit faster in those markets.
Glen Novarro
And that 14% and 20%, should we assume it's closer to 14% in Europe and 20% outside of Europe or is it little bit
slower in Europe?
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
The Europe, they're in that range.
Glen Novarro
Okay, very good. Thank you.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
You're welcome.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Thanks, Glen. And we have time for one more question.

Thank you. Our final question today is from Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.
Rajeev Jashnani
Hi, good morning.
John Thomas, Vice President, Investor Relations and Public Affairs
Good morning.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Good morning.
Rajeev Jashnani
Just a follow-up on EPD. I think you guys reported in 2011, pricing was minus one to two. Is that still kind of the run
rate you're seeing for that business?
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Yeah. That's probably about right a little, probably closer to two.
Rajeev Jashnani
Okay. Fair enough. And I guess just following-up on HUMIRA ex-U.S. I know you don't want to get too specific on
this, but is it reasonable to assume a double-digit ongoing constant currency type growth for that product, again in
international markets over the next few years?
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Though it's hard to project on that part Rajeev, but again, here we are in 2012 and those markets continue to grow in the
range that I just indicated, that's pretty strong growth. Now, certainly our product gets bigger and bigger every year, so
dollars of growth can continue to be quite strong, the percentages based on the way the numbers work, starts to come
down a little bit, but we foresee good growth there initially.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Yeah, I mean you recall from the October investor meeting, Rick Gonzalez talked about billion dollars plus in raw
dollars of HUMIRA growth over the next few years. So certainly as a percentage, that would be double-digits in '13
and probably '14. So, but that gives you an idea of what we think the continuing growth potential of the product is as

we look out two, three years.
Rajeev Jashnani
Yeah. No, that's very helpful. It just seems like, the product just continues to move ahead at a, such a brisk space. I
appreciate the color. Thanks.
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
The performance has been good and we think the durability is very strong as well over the long-term.
Larry Peepo, Divisional Vice President, Investor Relations
Yeah. And don't forget all the indications that we have and we just got another one as you know in Europe. So, it's the
utility of the product has been amazing and it's a great, great well-positioned product for the long-term.
Rajeev Jashnani
Thanks a lot guys.
Corporate Participant
