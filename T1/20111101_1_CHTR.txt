MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to Charter's Third Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Robin Gutzler. Ma'am, you may begin.
Robin Gutzler
Thank you, Felicia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2011 Third Quarter Earnings Call. This
morning, we issued a press release over PR Newswire at 8 a.m. Eastern Time detailing our results. This information is
posted on our Web site, charter.com, under Investor and News Center. The Web site also contains the presentation that
accompanies today's comments and can be found under Financial Information.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form
10-Q. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to
read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause
actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's
current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional

forward-looking statements in the future.
During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this
morning's earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures
with similar titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2010 and
2011. The pro forma results reflect the divestiture and acquisition of Cable Systems in 2010 and 2011 as if they had
occurred on January 1, 2010, unless otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rates we will be referring to this
morning are on a pro forma basis.
Joining me today – on today's call are Mike Lovett, President and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our CFO and Don Detampel,
EVP Technology and President Commercial Services.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett
Thanks, Robin. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with third quarter results in which we
grew our revenues 3% and adjusted EBITDA 3.8%, and generated healthy free cash flow. We accelerated growth in
our Commercial business, drove robust growth in our Internet business, and improved our margin by 30 basis points
compared to last year.
We also continued to take an opportunistic, disciplined approach to investing in ROI-positive projects, both organic and
M&A, as well as share and debt repurchases. We made meaningful advances in all four of our strategic priorities that
we outlined at the beginning of the year. Before we go into more details on our third-quarter results, I'd first like to take
a step back and update you on the execution of these strategies.
First, we're focused on fundamentally improving the customer experience, which is the foundation underlying our
future success. We're transforming Charter into a customer-centric organization, with a commitment to delivering
unmatched customer experience. We're improving our product offerings, as well as the quality and reliability of our
service. And while we're starting to see positive results in our operations and customer retention, we're still in the early
stages.
Takes time for these improvements to resonate with customers and to show up as meaningful improvement in overall
external customer satisfaction studies. But we're beginning to see results. The best evidence of our progress is new
customer satisfaction, which is more than 35% higher than for our more tenured customers.
And as I said, we're seeing results in our operations. Our efforts drove an 11% decrease in billing and service calls and
10% fewer service truck rolls in the third quarter compared to last year. And we continue to see improved customer
relationships.
In addition to increasing customer satisfaction, all of this generates bottom line savings.
Our second strategic priority is to lead with our superior Internet product in our sales, promotion and branding efforts,
to leverage our structural broadband advantage and create new customer relationships. While video is still an important
element of our business, we continue to lead with our strength in Internet.
In the vast majority of our footprint, we have superior Internet speeds and in less than 4% of our footprint, where we
overlap with FiOS and other fiber competitors, we have comparable speeds with our 60-meg residential product. Nearly
95% of our Internet customers have a broadband service of 12 meg or higher. Our advantage is evident; Charter's
Internet serviced received top rankings from PC Magazine and high marks from FCC – from the FCC in speed testing.
And Netflix has rated us the best performing cable or DSL Internet provider for the third consecutive quarter – time this
year.

Accelerated growth in the number of IP devices and bandwidth used in households will fuel the need for faster speeds
and greater reliability. Charter is uniquely positioned to provide those services. And in addition to speed, customers are
looking for a solutions provider as evidenced by the popularity of our Home Networking product. The number of
customers using our in-home WiFi service jumped 34% year-over-year, with nearly one in four customers now relying
on us for home wireless connectivity.
As slide three highlights, there's an opportunity to increase our Internet penetration, particularly in homes passed where
we don't have a Video customer relationship. We're seeing continued growth in penetration as our net gains of
non-Video homes again doubled, but a 10% penetration compared to well over 60% in homes where we have a Video
relationship, we feel we have an ample room for growth. We're growing share and forming new customer relationships
by creative marketing, increased education about Charter as a premier ISP provider and the use of non-traditional sales
channels.
Last quarter, we announced our partnership with Dish. We've been very pleased with the initial results where we've
seen a significant improvement in response rate and sales performance. As we ended the quarter, we started marketing
this across our entire footprint.
Another priority for us is to aggressively drive commercial growth. There's a significant amount of untapped
commercial opportunity in our footprint. We're making investments in people, processes and systems to extend –
expand our capabilities in these markets and extend our reach. Our Commercial, Internet and Phone businesses are
more growth oriented while our Commercial Video business is relatively stable. In Q3 we grew data and phone
commercial revenues by nearly 30% versus last year.
Cell backhaul is a key growth area for us. We have approximately 1,600 cell tower sites in service or under contract
and have a healthy sales pipeline. We're leveraging our existing infrastructure in technology and expanding our
products and services to capitalize on the commercial opportunity. We see upside in both the short and long term and
we'll continue to take an opportunistic approach to investing in and expanding this part of our business. We view it as a
key driver with attractive growth and return prospects.
And finally, our fourth strategic priority, changing the dynamic in video. While we view this as a longer term initiative,
we're taking actions now to enhance our video offering. We recently added the exciting new content for our video
customers, including NFL Network, NFL RedZone, HBO GO, MAX GO and Big Ten Network 2 Go and in a few
weeks we'll launch 3D content On Demand. In addition, we continued to expand our HD channel lineup. We're on
target to offer an average of 75 HD channels by year end and while we will have – we'll already have the most popular
channels available, we're planning to offer over 100 HD channels in key markets next year.
We're pleased that we made significant enhancements to the programming choices for our customers this year. At the
same time, we remain very concerned about the alarming rise in fees that local broadcast stations, regional sports
networks and national cable programmers are seeking for their content. In the case of local broadcasters, that content
has historically been free to our customers. And as we have seen in the increasing number of disputes between
operators and programmers, it's the consumer that ultimately gets hurt, either by losing access to programming, even
for a short time, or paying far too much. The model that the industry is currently working under is more than flawed
and in need of remediation.
As part of our continuing efforts to offer the best possible experience for our customers, we announced this morning
that we're launching a unique tool to augment the great content already available on charter.net that will enhance the
online user experience for our customers. The new Search and Discovery feature will organize video content already
available online through charter.net such as HBO Go and EPIX with online content from sites such as Netflix, Amazon
and Hulu into a single online directory. Rather than searching separate sites, content available from these multiple
sources will be integrated in one place making it easier for customers to find what they want regardless of the source.
We provide a superior Internet product ideal for streaming video. This is another example of us taking in an innovative
approach linking the value of superior speeds to customer experience. Over the next year, our customers will have an
increasing library of content to enjoy anywhere, any time on any device.

We've also initiated a key component of our next generation T.V. strategy with our TiVo pilot underway in Texas.
Early pilot participants have responded favorably to the overall service, particularly the improved recommendations,
user interface and search capabilities, all of which enhance the customer experience and should increase usage of our
On Demand library.
We'll complete a full production launch in Texas and conduct pilots in a few additional markets later this year, with a
full production launch enterprise-wide in the first half of 2012. As you can see, we're making great strides in improving
our video offering and we believe that these enhance our competitive position in video.
Looking ahead, we expect our broadband infrastructure to play an increasingly large role in consumers' lives, especially
as a their desire to view video content On Demand increases and the delivery of content evolves to IP. It is all about
services delivered over that platform and we want to provide the best delivery and experience. We believe this sets all
of our products up for success down the road.
Our strategic initiatives we have focused on in 2011 are now in place and are beginning to take hold and gain
momentum. That momentum was evident in the third quarter in our Commercial and Internet revenue growth. Looking
at volume, while digital and phone volume grew less in the quarter compared to prior year, Internet was stronger and
our video losses improved slightly. We also drove adjusted EBITDA growth, generated free cash flow, improved our
customer relationship trend and lowered churn.
I'll now turn it over to Chris to walk through the financials.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As shown in slide 5, we grew revenue by 3% in the quarter led by growth
in higher margin Internet and Commercial products. Internet revenue rose 8% driven by the addition of more than
190,000 new customers. Commercial revenue jumped 19% versus the prior year quarter supported by improved sales
productivity and line extensions for businesses and carriers.
Revenue from residential phone increased 4%, an area where we can do better despite the broader fixed line cord
cutting trends. Video revenues were down 1% driven by Video customer losses, partially offset by the price increases
in the quarter. In addition, we're still facing economic headwinds as it relates to cord shaving on video and demand and
premium channels, but did see some uplift in certain areas such as our sports tier due to the addition of new content as
Mike mentioned.
For both Video and Internet, the total revenue impact of the targeted price adjustments this past quarter was about $10
million. We're pleased with the minimal churn associated with these price adjustments, and keep in mind that we have
not yet seen a full quarter's impact to revenue, so Q4 will reflect a slightly higher run rate. Ad sales were down
approximately 3% on the prior year primarily due to lower political spend versus 2010.
Clearly, we expect Q4 advertising sales to also be lower year-on-year; last year's political campaign boosted Q4 sales
by about $14 million.
Looking at the makeup of total revenue on the pie chart on slide 5, we continue to diversify our revenue. And while
Video is still critical to our business, it represents only half of our sales now, down from 60% just a few years ago.
Increasingly, investments for the IP side of the pie, namely Internet, Commercial and Phone will bode well for Video to
Mike's earlier point.
Slide 6 highlights our Commercial business, which continued to accelerate, up 19% on prior year versus 11% in Q3 of
2010. The growth was driven mostly by new relationships with small and medium businesses and carrier customers.
We increased our commercial PSUs by 22% compared to last year excluding Video. In Q3, carrier space revenue rose
by 50% to $12 million in the quarter.
Turning to our Residential business on slide 7, our total PSUs were effectively flat in the quarter compared to $16,000
gained in Q3 of last year. As Mike highlighted, the downturn in PSU growth was driven entirely by slower Phone

growth as Internet gains and Video losses both improved on prior year. We achieved lower churn, but also saw fewer
connects.
In addition to ongoing low household formation, high vacancy rates and ongoing competition, we only started to see
the positive impact to our top line actions in the very tail end of Q3, particularly in Phone.
We also maintained our disciplined approached to customer acquisition. For the past year, we have suppressed direct
marketing to the higher credit risk segments of our service area. And while this segment formed a large portion of our
connects in the past, it represented an even larger portion of our disconnects and a disproportionate share of our cost.
But while we've benefited from the cash flow impact of our strategy, we cannot ignore the segment permanently. We
designed Charter Starter, mentioned briefly last quarter, to target these households with an attractive, yet affordable,
product offered in a more controlled low-risk manner.
Charter Starter is a triple play offer that includes base level video, Internet and phone products for $80 per month or
double play video and Internet for $65. There's a limit on the equipment and the amount of pay-per-view and Video On
Demand customers can take, as well as a required prepayment of the first month charges and install fee. And we're
looking to add a deposit requirement within the billing system in the coming months.
Recognizing that these customers may desire more, as they demonstrate payment history, we gradually expand the
offering. We tested the product during this past quarter and completed a soft launch at the end of September, ramping
up marketing efforts in October.
To clarify, our overall strategy's unchanged. Charter Starter strengthens our systemic credit controls and provides an
entry for new customers. So in and of itself, we don't see it as the near term material connect driver, but a controlled
and fair way to address the segment.
Even more than the industry focus on PSUs or RGUs, customer relationships really are the core focus area for Charter.
In the third quarter, our rate of decline in total residential customer relationships dropped nearly fourfold, the key driver
being our non-Video customer relationship growth, some 55,000 relationships, double the growth rate in last year's
third quarter.
Residential ARPU increased 3.5% from prior year, driven by the price increase, as I mentioned, and increased bundling
and advanced services penetration. Once we secure the customer relationship, bundling remains the key factor to
maximizing retention and up sell. And at the end of the quarter, 61.9% of our customers subscribed to more than one of
our products.
Moving to slide 8, while making positive strides in retention levels, we've experienced a decline in Video customers in
the quarter. Video customers decreased 65,000, and despite the price increase, a slight improvement over the loss of
66,000 last year. Of the 65,000 loss, 63,000 were basic analog, representing a disproportionate share of the video loss.
Digital growth slowed significantly compared to last year's third quarter as we completed fewer analog-to-digital
channel migrations, which traditionally drives digital upgrades. And while there's still an opportunity here as we get
further up the penetration curve in absence of stronger push, we will have less of an opportunity for digital conversion,
which impacts RGU and ARPU growth.
Video ARPU rose 4.3% year-on-year to $72.21 driven by the rate adjustments and higher mix of digital customer in the
base. Given the recent pressure on housing and ARPU lift from Video On Demand, premiums and digital upgrades we
see ourselves well-positioned when the economic climate does start to turn. And in the meantime, our goal is to
ultimately stabilize the Video business with the product developments and customer experience enhancements Mike
outlined.
Looking at slide 9, we achieved strong growth in the Residential Internet PSUs in Q3 as more and more customers
recognize our speed superiority. Overall, penetration reached 29.5%, but as Mike pointed out, we continue to have an
outsized opportunity in the roughly seven million non-Video homes passed in our footprint given the lower penetration
there.

Our Internet penetration of homes passed where we do have a Video relationship is well over 60%. We saw – and we
see no reason why seven million homes shouldn't be just as interested in our superior Internet product. We're
accelerating penetration in those homes, and as Mike mentioned, we're looking at innovative ways to further accelerate
growth.
Internet ARPU grew 1.8% primarily due to the price increases through broader penetration of our home networking
product, which grew to 23% penetration in the quarter. We grew Residential Phone customers at a slower pace than in
2010 adding 11,000 Phone customers during Q3 compared to 31,000 a year ago, primarily due to fewer upgrades from
our existing customers. We still think there's an opportunity to get back to the previous phone attached rates and we've
refocused our offer set both for acquisition and retention and shifted back to a higher direct response marketing mix as
compared to Internet and Video branding.
Phone ARPU dipped 1.1% compared to third quarter of last year due to an increase in value-based packages. As we
recognized the strategic importance of attaching Phone with our other products, we believe it's likely that declines in
Phone ARPU will persist.
On slide 10, looking at expenses and adjusted EBITDA, we achieved continued growth in EBITDA that outpaced
revenue growth reflecting year-over-year margin improvement. We grew sales from higher margin products and
continued to benefit from our customer experience and lifetime value strategies through lower service costs and bad
debt.
While total operating expenses rose at a slower pace than revenue, they increased 2.6% stemming from higher
marketing expense and programming costs, partially offset by bad debt savings. The upturn in marketing cost to 3.9%
of revenue reflected higher brand and media investment, channel development as well as increased marketing efforts in
Commercial. We saw programming costs rise 2.4% due to contractual increases net of the impact of customer losses.
Our outlook here has not changed. Unfortunately, we expect programming costs to maintain their upward trend.
Moving to slide 11, overall CapEx was 16.8% of revenue. Total dollars were up slightly as we spent more on line
extensions driven by Commercial and customer premise equipment. The increase was partially offset by timing our
strategic bandwidth initiative rollouts to avoid customer experience impacts and we're still on target to be largely
complete with DOCSIS 3.0 and SDV by year end.
Our estimated capital expenditures for this year remains approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and about three
quarters of our CapEx continues to be success based. Notably, Commercial CapEx totaled $48 million in the quarter,
41% higher year-on-year. And our total commercial spend now represents a $172 million of CapEx on an LTM basis.
Turning to slide 12, net loss was $14 million better compared to the year ago quarter as a result of adjusted EBITDA
growth and lower income tax expense partially offset by higher interest expense from the 2010 and 2011 refinancings
and an increase in depreciation and amortization from CapEx. We continued to generate free cash flow in the quarter
and our free cash flow totaled $91 million in Q3 of 2011 compared to $135 million last year. The decrease was caused
by changes in working capital, increased interest payments and higher capital expenditures partially offset by higher
adjusted EBITDA.
Working capital provided $36 million less cash in the quarter versus prior year driven primarily by the timing of
payments. As a reminder, our taxes are predominantly noncash due to our $10 billion tax basis and $6.9 billion loss
carry-forward position at the end of last year and we do not expect to be a significant cash tax payer until after 2017.
Cash tax payments for Q3 and year-to-date were $2 million and $7 million respectively, reflecting certain state income
taxes.
Now turning to our capital structure, we had $1.1 billion of liquidity at the end of Q3 and remain comfortable with our
maturity profile and leverage target. And we've demonstrated discipline in our balance sheet and return of capital
strategy. During the third quarter, we repurchased $193 million principal amount of our second lien notes in the open
market and immediately following the S&P U.S. downgrade, we'd launched a $200 million share buyback program. So
as of the end of the quarter, we purchased 2.4 million shares for $116 million. And on the M&A front, we've closed

several tack-on acquisitions in the quarter and continue to evaluate our opportunities for both acquisitions and
divestitures.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mike
Michael J. Lovett
Thanks, Chris. The fundamental changes we're making will continue to strengthen our business and yield positive
results laying the groundwork for future success. Meanwhile, we had another quarter marked by revenue and adjusted
EBITDA growth and continued healthy free cash flow coupled with disciplined execution of our strategic priorities.
Many of you know that a few weeks ago I announced that I will be stepping down as CEO of Charter following a
transition period. I'm comfortable that I'll be leaving Charter in a great position with extremely talented leaders and an
incredible group of employees. I remain confident that our strategy will drive profitable growth and build value for our
shareholders and that we have the momentum and the right leadership team in place to execute against that strategy.
Operator, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. This is Jeff Wlodarczak. I had two for Chris and then one follow-up.
Your marketing expense ramped in the third quarter, is that a reasonable run rate going forward? And then the CapEx
was quite a bit lower than at least we expected. Is it reasonable to say that you're probably going to come in at the low
end of your guidance for CapEx in 2011?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Sure. So on the marketing spend, if you take a look both sequentially and
year-over-year, it was about a $15 million increase. When you take a look at sequential, it's important to keep in mind
that Q3 does represent a higher acquisition period and so there's some seasonality there. I'm going to focus my
comments more on year-over-year because that's traditionally where we've talked about as opposed to seasonality.
So the $15 million increase year-over-year, about a third of that is coming from Commercial. There is a few million
that's inside there for some online branding and social media activities as well as different one-off activities. So that's a
few million that I would consider one-off. And the remainder of that is something that may be fair to consider as run
rate as well as the Commercial simply due to the fact that we've been investing in other channels with a retailer online
to expand our channel set. And while we continue to be in a really good competitive situation across all of our
footprint, it's fair to say that some of the cost-per-order continues to increase slightly there.
As it relates to the second question on CapEx, there was a fair amount of seasonality that was in there. Usually you get
a fair amount of connect volume, which was the case inside of Q3. What was offsetting that if you take a look in the
scalable infrastructure category, we pulled back intentionally on some of our DOCSIS 3.0 and SDV activity inside of
the quarter. These tend to be some of the most customer-facing months inside the year, and so tweaking the network at
the same time of having some of more service-related events that seasonally take place, we just pulled back a little bit.
So I think you'll see an uptick in that Q4. And as I mentioned, we do expect for DOCSIS 3.0 and SDV to be largely
complete at the end of the year.
I think the guidance that we've given is the 1.3 to 1.4, and if we'd plan to tighten that I think we would have. But I think
you can take a look at what we've done Q1 through Q3 taking into account both the volume for Q4 as well as the
comments I made about scalable infrastructure and kind of pinpoint from there.

<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Yeah. Fair enough. And then just one quick follow-up. Any color you can provide on
trends in the fourth quarter would be helpful.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: We did see – particularly as Chris mentioned with the marketing spend and a fair amount of
it back-ended in Q3, we see trends picking up. Still some headwinds economically, obviously, and some challenges, but
we do see some trends particularly on the Phone side picking up with the focus on direct response marketing and
returning back to the focus of the bundle.

Operator
Your next question comes from line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Hey. Good morning, guys. And, Mike, certainly wish you all the best going forward. I
just want to ask a couple of questions around sort of strategy on the business. You guys talked a lot about some of the
new initiatives. You report about 15% of your customers are non-Video and I know last quarter you talked about a trial
with Dish, looking at satellite plus Charter, data and voice. You've also rolled out this online portal to help customers
find sort of over-the-top content. Could you just sort of step back and how you're position the company in the market?
It seems to be a different approach than your peers, thinking about it more as an ISP and what that might mean to
profitability and free cash flow and returns over time, how you're thinking about that.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. Thanks, Ben. Certainly the Video business has its challenges. It's still a significant
part of our business, so we're not abandoning it by any means. But you're right; we do see ourselves and we're – a bit of
a mantra within the company is to think of ourselves as an ISP. And I think that not only drives the strength of our
superior broadband product and we're leading with that strength, but it supports the Video business and other products
and services over time, particularly as the infrastructure evolves to all IP.
I don't know, Don, if you want to add some color to that?
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Well I would just add that our announcement today regarding the enhancement to
charter.net I think is just a step in that direction. Fundamentally, we think that a massive amount of programming is
becoming available online in On Demand, which is great for consumers. But finding what you want to watch is really
painful. So what we're doing is, we're coupling our high-speed Internet with charter.net and introducing a service that'll
integrate and organize content from multiple sources. This includes our entitled content that our video subscribers have
the right to view as well as the over-the-top content from sources such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, which is an
industry first. So for us, it's about bringing simplicity to what is something now complex and leveraging our broadband
pipe.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: So, Ben, if you think about our – kind of our underlying theme of our strategy, it's leveraging
the capabilities and, frankly, the superiority of our infrastructure from a competitive standpoint and then linking it to
the – at the early stages, the in-home experience for the customer and being that solutions provider. And this is just the
first step towards that.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: How do you guys – I appreciate the comments. How do you think about getting that
search and discovery functionality, integrating it into the existing guide you have installed in your base and making it
easy for the customer to access that stuff through the television or connected device – connected set-top? Because still
people are spending the vast majority of their time watching video on TV versus on a PC or IP.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. I think the first step of that obviously is our deployment and our partnership with
TiVo and maybe, Don, you can talk about how we see the next innings.
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Right. Well, certainly, TiVo is a good next step. I mean I think everybody's aware that
TiVo is renowned for their search and discovery and recommendation capabilities. They've been at this for years. So
we think partnering with them really gives us a jump start. And although, unfortunately, from a programming

standpoint, we currently don't have all the rights we want to blend this content, clearly that's what consumers are
demanding and we believe over time we will have a similar experience available as well in the home.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Great. And if I could just ask one separate follow-up to Chris on the use of capital in the
quarter. Looks like you bought back I think a little over $100 million worth of debt and then on the buyback – on the
stock repurchase, you had a step down from, I think it was, August to September. Any thoughts you can share with us
on how you're looking at balancing all that and what's available to you in the market, et cetera?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, let me clarify the first one and then ask you a question back on the second
because I'm not sure I fully understood. So we've repurchased $193 million of principal amount of debt inside of the
third quarter. So I think at the time when we announced the buyback, at that point in time we also disclosed that we had
purchased $100 million at face value at the time. Through the rest of the quarter, we got up to a total of $193 million of
notes for the second lien 8% notes, which become due in April 2012.
On the second question you had...
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I guess you...
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah, I'll clarify.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: How do you look at buying back debt versus stock in the current environment given
where the stock is, given where the debt markets are? And maybe just update us again on sort of the leverage sort of
appetite at the company.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Understood. So I think we – the biggest mantra here is just being opportunistic with
the opportunities that provide themselves to us. We were already, obviously, purchasing debt in the open market when
you had the S&P U.S. downgrade. And it was in a very, very fast turnaround with our board that we decided in real
short order that we should go ahead and launch a buyback program. It's not at the stage of our target deleveraging to the
target leverage range of four to 4.5 times that we probably normally would have launched a formal buyback program.
But given some of the market dislocation that was taken at the time, we saw that as the unique opportunity, moved
really quick to take advantage of that. We had already been buying debt inside the market at what we thought were
attractive rates relative to an NPV basis for debt.
And I think that's the type of approach that you'll continue us to see to go after, whether it's being opportunistic on
M&A, acquisitions and divestitures, whether it's investing in the Commercial business and moving – advancing the
product set towards all IP or whether it's doing debt buybacks or stock buybacks. As I mentioned, at 4.7 times leverage,
it's not at the stage where we would have said let's go launch a formal return of capital strategy, but we took advantage
of what we thought was a pretty strategic opportunity to buy back the stock.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Stefan Anninger with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like you had substantial success
with your non-Video sub growth in the quarter. I think it's the highest – at least I can see on the trending schedule that
we've ever seen. In that vein, can you talk a bit more about your success with naked HSD? And I guess related question
to Ben's question, where are most of those customers coming from? Are they coming from DBS Households with
DSL? We know about the Dish deal. And are you able to pick up any U-verse subs?

And I guess on a related – excuse me, on a related note, one thing you've talked about in the past is getting consumers
to understand that they can order naked HSD without buying video from Charter and that's has been a bit of an uphill
battle given the long-term bundling sort of strategy you've had. It looks like that must be improving. And maybe if you
just could talk about how that's going.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, from a – Stefan, from a marketing standpoint, a lot of it is about education. So it's not
simply the value and the superiority of our product. It's education with regards to the fact that they can buy through our
high-speed product without buying video. And as you mentioned, I mean the legacy marketing approach for the entire
industry has been video first then other products second, I think that's a bit of a shift, certainly, for us here at Charter.
So a lot of it – our marketing and some of the uptick you saw on the marketing spend is around education relative to
that fact.
We've highlighted, as I mentioned in our comments, this morning that we've got 60% plus penetration of our broadband
product with our Video households and substantially lower penetration, roughly 10%, in non-Video households. And
that just doesn't seem logical to us when you have a superior product like our Internet product. A lot of our activity is
coming and our growth is coming from DSL, share flow is dramatically favorable not only to Charter, but I think the
cable in general relative to broadband. We are competitive and we feel we are competitive with U-verse, but I think the
dynamic competitively will shift as we roll out our TiVo product. I think TiVo in combination with multi-room DVR
and our broadband product gives us a real competitive edge to go win back households in the U-verse footprint.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Okay. That's great. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up with respect to your Dish
alliance. Are there subs that you are picking up in – with that alliance – they're existing Dish subs that have DSL, is that
correct? So you're marketing into homes that have – currently have DSL and Dish, is that correct?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: We're marketing to Dish households, but we're also marketing collectively to non-Charter
and non-Dish households.
<Q - Stefan Anninger>: Got it. And then with respect to U-verse in your footprint, as the footprint growth seems to
slow there, are you seeing any changes with respect to the number of customers that could defect over to U-verse or the
number of subs that you may be able to pick up from U-verse, et cetera?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. I don't – I think it's a little early to kind of declare some type of victory relative to how
things stabilize. But having been in this business for 30-plus years and competed with a number of – not only our box,
but other hardwire over-builders, you see a dynamic in 18 to 24 months where things really stabilizes – I use the phrase
it's like – it's Europe and World War I where the trenches are kind of dug and people are in them and movement doesn't
really take place. And I think we're probably heading into that stage where you see that type of stability. We really
think that we have an opportunity with the TiVo partnership in combination with our value of phone relative to them as
an incumbent phone provider along with superiority of broadband. We feel like we have an opportunity to win share
back.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I had two questions, first one for Mike
and the second one for Chris. First for Mike, on the wireless, you guys have consistently commented that Charter is
going to be a follower in terms of wireless and see what develops in rest of the industry. And we've seen other
operators looking to deploy WiFi in some of their footprints to add mobility to their data service. I mean is that
something that could make sense for Charter as well? Or do the economics not make as much sense for the company
given the footprint?

<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, Jason, it's a great question. I think as we mentioned, we're looking at WiFi in essence
within the households first, but certainly there's opportunity and we are exploring it within specific markets. You think
of some of the communities that we serve that are oriented towards that type of usage. I'll use Madison, Wisconsin as
one example. That might be an area that we look at deploying WiFi. Doing at across our entire footprint, the economics
– it's a little at odds relative to the type of footprint we have, but I think we could look at it surgically. And...
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: And then...
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: And that is something we're exploring. But first and foremost, we're driving penetration of,
in essence, WiFi Home Networking within the household first to hang multiple devices off it. And I'm very pleased
with the success we're having there.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Just a quick follow-up on that. Is there like a general rule of thumb we can use in terms of how
much CapEx it would cost you guys to build WiFi in terms of a cost per home that passed et cetera?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: That's not something that we're prepared to talk about today. I think given what Mike
had said, it's not the [ph] largest (0:37:00) priority today. And you'd take a look across our footprint, what it would be
like in L.A. versus what it would be like in Madison versus what it would look like in the Southeast, would be
dramatically different. So it's almost net even relevant.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Got it. And as a follow-up question to I guess capital return to shareholders, you've done some
opportunistic transactions so far and I'm wondering if your expectation is to implement something more sustainable
long term in the capital return program to shareholders over time? Or do you prefer this kind of opportunistic approach
that gives you a lot more financial flexibility?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think given where we are today at 4.7 times leverage, it's not something that we have
to decide today. I think there is some value to being opportunistic, as we've been so far. I suspect that if we were to
move closer to the four times range, we'd have to give people a little bit more color on that so that they can get
comfortable about how they'd think about the business.
But there's some real value to taking the approach that we've taken so far of being opportunistic. And I think along the
way really generating a fair amount of value for our shareholders as well as through example of buying back the debt –
of deleveraging along the way through uses of cash flow. So I think it's a very good question. For once we're at a stage
where we're well in or even at the lower end of our target leverage range and sitting on a fair amount of cash, which
when you take a look at the balance sheet today because we've been deploying capital, that isn't the case today. So it's
not something that we're particularly worried about today.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Good.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Hi. Good morning. Just had two questions. One, how are you thinking about CapEx next year?
I assume that Commercial and the TiVo launch are going to put some upward pressure on CapEx, while DOCSIS 3 and
SDV ending this year is going to put some downward pressure. Is one of those sides greater than the other? And also
how are you thinking about going all digital at this point? I know you've – I think you've done a trial testing that? And
how are you thinking about pricing the TiVo product as well? Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Why don't we start with the CapEx spend? I'll hand this over to Chris, but from kind of a
broad sense, the way we look at things and I think the pleasant fact of this business is we're – running about 77% of our
CapEx is success based. And where we see opportunity, be it this year or in future years – where we see opportunity
with healthy returns on investment, we're going to put the pedal down and we're going to make those investments. I

think from a detailed standpoint maybe, Chris, you could cover that?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. The fact is if you take a look at Commercial, you'll see that that's been an area
that's significantly accelerating, and then as you pointed out SDV and DOCSIS 3.0, we have caught up effectively in
those two areas. There are a number of different areas where we continue to invest in the business, whether that's a
rollout of the TiVo or whether it's setting the stage for the next generation IP and product set. At this stage, we're not
giving CapEx guidance for 2012, but we'll be doing that during the course of the next earnings session. So I think
you've highlighted exactly right, all of the areas that are going to be in flux. And as Mike mentioned, a lot of it just
depends on the success that we're having both on the residential side as well as the commercial side.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Right, and from an all digital standpoint, I think one of the benefits we have with the
platform is the investment we're making to switch digital to video is providing us – in essence we're mining bandwidth
for new opportunities, particularly linear HD content at this stage.
I think the fact that we've got a trial in place – it doesn't necessarily signal that we're going to be moving down the path
of all digital, we're just looking at the opportunities associated with it, not the least of which is mining additional
bandwidth, but there are other operational benefits that come with going all digital, such as effective service, security et
cetera. Whether or not we deploy that, we haven't made a determination yet, but we're pleased with the results that
we've seen in the trial.
The other opportunity we have in mining bandwidth is analog migration. And one of the unique aspects of Charter is
we've got a very robust analog channel lineup because of legacy issues. So I think there's more opportunity for us to
move analog into the digital platform, which again frees up additional bandwidth. So I think we have a number of
levers to pull, one of them being all digital. But as I said, we're pleased with the results of the trial on a number of
levels. And then from a TiVo standpoint, maybe Tom – or Don you can give an update.
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Right. With TiVo – so we have not released the specific pricing. I mean, obviously, as we
start to roll it out in Texas where we're testing the market in various price points there. So we'll be more very specific as
we move down the road. But I also would like to highlight regarding all digital I mean we increasingly are beginning to
think all IP versus all digital and in getting us there. And if you think about TiVo as a bridge to that path, it's an
important bridge because it is a device that is obviously an IP device and a linear device, so it starts us on that path – as
well our Next Gen Gateway product, which we'll start trialing next year. So as we think about all digital, we're really
thinking kind of one step further really how do we get all IP.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: That's all very helpful. Thank you. If I could just ask – just ask a follow-up. If you think about
– I mean some of the projects this year with SDV and DOCSIS 3.0, were – seemed to be sort of catch up one-time in
nature with the thinking that next year CapEx would go down assuming a similar kind of level of activity in the
business from a growth perspective. So is it fair to say that if CapEx were to be flattish next year that would imply
some sort of acceleration in the growth rate because it would be success-based CapEx that would be sort of replacing
some of the stuff that's more project-related catch up this year?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Generally, I think that's right although I'd focus primarily on the Commercial
segment. And – so if you think about the acceleration that's been taking place there, it's $48 million. There's really
different types of spend that are inside the commercial. If I can, maybe pass over to Don to talk a little bit about how
we think about the Commercial CapEx because some of the payback return is based on the segment versus carrier. It's
fundamentally different and it all ties back to some of the discussion we're having around IP. So...
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: And I think what Chris is highlighting here is our investment and cell backhaul. And
internally, we've kind of labeled this CapEx spend as smart spend, and let me elaborate a bit on what we mean by that.
As we deploy a lot of this cell backhaul, obviously that is the big IP pipe going out to these towers. Essentially, we're
prefunding our Next Gen IP network. Eventually, as we look five, seven years down the road, our view is that
everything will be riding this IP pipe. So as we look at the new cell backhaul contracts, we get a good, but it's generally
a longer payback under a pretty conservative model. But we think this has a lot of upside in a variety of areas.

Number one, it's pretty obvious that the kind of bandwidth that's being driven by these mobile devices. So as wireless
carriers continue to increase speed, we will obviously be a beneficiary of that speed increase as well – as we make these
builds, we do it passing a lot of businesses. And we are very selective as we make these builds to make sure that we're
going by businesses that as well we could bring on as customers.
And thirdly, our models generally only count one tenant per tower. And as Mike mentioned, we currently have 1,600
cell towers either in service are under contract. And as that universe grows, we're beginning to see opportunities to get
second and third tenants on those towers, which really makes this investment very, very attractive for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Hi. Thanks. Can you help us think about the margins over the next few quarters? You'll gain some
operational efficiencies, but you'll also be spending on the marketing front. So what's kind of a net impact on margins?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think as we've increased the marketing spend, we've been using the operating
efficiencies that we've been able to generate inside of the business to fund those marketing increases. Obviously, not
only is it marketing that we have to fund but unfortunately, it's the programming increases and the impact of the Video
margin that takes place there. But if you take a look at year-over-year, consistently throughout the quarters this year,
we've been able to increase margin at the same time increasing the amount of marketing spend that we're putting in
place.
I have to tell you that it's not the one key driver that we have inside the business, the biggest driver that we have is
achieving customer relationship growth and long term value for the shareholders, and it may mean that as a result of
that, due to timing of some of the spends or other considerations, you may see margins fluctuate a little bit here and
there. But generally, I still think there's a fair amount of opportunity on the operating cost side as we go through to
continue to fund the amount of marketing spend that we're looking to do.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: And I think that the key here, Amy -- to add to Chris' point is the operating efficiencies are
sustainable. They're not quarter-by-quarter, one-time events, they're sustainable improvements in the business, so we're
running a leaner organization as we go. And I think the investment marketing is really priming the pump for top line
growth.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Particularly as customer experience improves along the way because it – the
investment that we're making there drives a lower amount of calls to the call center, a lower number of service calls,
lower number of service-related truck rolls. And as Mike's highlighted, we're still in the early stages in terms of
achieving that customer experience.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. Thanks. And how do we think about high speed data ARPU? It accelerated this quarter.
Should we see that trend going forward? And how do we think about Charter Starter and the impact on pricing?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: I'll take the HSI and then maybe Chris can talk a little bit about Charter Starter. We'll see
opportunity – and we've highlighted the success we've had with our Home Network and our in-home WiFi service. And
on average, that generates about $10 worth of recurring monthly revenue. And I think driving deeper penetration of that
will continue to drive ARPU growth. We've made some tradeoffs relative to ARPU growth with regards to giving
speeds for free, giving upgrades in speed tiers to our existing customer base. We feel like that's the right investment

because it drives longer life time – customer lifetime value. So there are some tradeoffs there. I still think there's
pricing strength in our broadband product, but we're not going to play the rate card so heavily that we impact ourselves
negatively on share flow. I think this is more a share flow game than it is an ARPU game.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And on Charter Starter, I'm glad you've asked the question. I think there was a little
bit of confusion when we talked about this last quarter. The fact is that our strategy hasn't changed. We're really
benefiting from the fact that we've focused on the right customer segment to avoid people spinning in and out of our
products. What we did want to do though, is recognize that as economic conditions have been tough and as that
segment unfortunately, we believe has continued to increase, you can't permanently ignore the segment . And so what
you need to do is you need to find a fairer product that is available to address customer needs so that you don't
completely shut out a certain segment of the market that could potentially be growing. But in a way, that actually
makes sense from Charter's perspective as well. The way to do that is to make sure that the customer is getting into a
product that, a, they can afford and, b, when it rolls off promotion that it's not rolling off at a higher price point, so they
go from month 11 to month 12 and suddenly are no longer able to afford the product. So the product that we're offering
is at the rack rate and it's a limited product both in terms of the product itself as well as the equipment that's associated
with it as well as the pay-per-view and the Video On Demand.
As a result, what we did during this quarter – really the first step of that is implementing much, much tighter systemic
credit controls that makes it virtually impossible for customers in that credit class to get in the door. So that is actually
going to have a negative volume effect. Offsetting that though, is that we've started to increase marketing a little bit –
not going well out of our way to go make that our primary segment, but starting to increase marketing to that segment
again with a defined product that serves their needs and also makes sense for us.
And so I think at best at this point it's fair to say it's neutral, but cash flow positive, the approach that we're taking.
Could it be a more material – could it be a source of a larger connect drivers overtime? That's a possibility. But the
focus point here wasn't so much about getting the material connect driver or making us a focus onto that segment. It
was really about making sure that we had a fair product for this segment over time and in a way that made sense for us.
<Q - Amy Yong>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Just have one longer term question. As you – as consumer bandwidth demands
increase and you focus on the broad brand product as your lead product, I think there's a little bit of concern on the buy
side that there may be choke points sort of in the network that cause the CapEx on that part of the business to go up. So
do you think that's a reasonable concern? And maybe in the context of answering the question if you could just sort of
trace a bit from the consumers' home back into the cloud and qualitatively just tell us where is there a lot of head room
and where might you run into potential constraints over time? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Jason, it's a great question. I think since we've got an Internet guy sitting at the table in Don
Detampel, I'll let him answer that question.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: All right. Great. Thank you.
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Perfect. Thanks, Mike. You're correct in saying that we certainly anticipate strong growth
in our Internet product both from the commercial side and the residential side. As you think about our network, we
generally think about it in three pieces. The HFC, the Hybrid Fiber/Coax piece of the network, our regional core
networks and our national backbone are kind of the three components of our network. As we think about the capital
that will be required, clearly, the bulk of the capital is in the HFC plant.
So even though we have a very robust coax plant out to all of these residential and commercial customers, we know
that we will have to do node splits and increase capacity to keep up with demand. Now the good news is that

theoretically the coax plant we have in place out runs anything but fiber to the home. So we're in a very good position
there. But there will be continued spends and I think – and I'm not going to give any guidance, but I would think that as
we look into the future, there will continue to be some fairly significant investments, not in excess of what we're doing
today, but continued investments to keep up with the speed requirements.
In the Metro core and also the national backbone, those are fully fiber networks and they operate very similar to any
kind of Internet provider all through the day. And we can map that very accurately what the growth calls for. And it
will require capital, but not excessive capital there. So our main focus is really locking looking down on the HFC plant
and firming up our estimates there.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: And I think Chris can add some color relative to how we think about that particularly with
CapEx and viewing it as a success-based because it's driving additional monthly recurring revenue.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I agree. It's something that we debate inside the business quite a bit, but the reality is
that to the extent that traffic demand, whether it's upstream or downstream, is driving us to spend on what's called the
CMTS or node splits, we really view that as very, very positive capital. That's not unlimited and so that's something
that we do discuss inside the business in terms of how much do you really need to do.
But the fact is that if we're in a situation where we're having to spend some significant amounts of CMTS as well as
node splits in an increasing way – and I would caveat that could very well be the case, it would be fantastic news for
Charter. Because the reality is that when you're taking a look at competing against DSL as more and more people start
to hang multiple IP devices inside their home, it makes it all that more clear that DSL is fundamentally obsolete as
compared to a broadband cable connection inside the home. And so I think that's spend that we're really very happy to
be spending; we certainly view that as success based.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from a line of David Joyce with Miller Tabak & Co.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Thank you. Just was wondering if you could comment on the – an update on the amount of
your footprint that's covered by Verizon FiOS, by T U-Verse and CenturyLink? And you did say that your marketing is
focused on trying to increase phone attach rates, but I'm wondering if you've been seeing any uptick in consumers
going wireless only for the voice product?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. We see – David, in our footprint we've got – 30% to 35% is U-Verse overlap, less
than 4% is FiOS and/or other fiber providers. We've got some – a very small group of municipal fiber builds, the lion
share of that is FiOS and the CenturyLink, I apologize, Chris maybe you can answer that.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think it is around 10%.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Around 10% in CenturyLink.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: And in terms of just traditional telcos it's – 62% is AT&T coverage and then off that
about half of that is U-Verse.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: And I'm sorry. David, your other question?
<Q - David C. Joyce>: If you've been able to determine if consumers have been moving more towards wireless and
only voice services to help explain the meaning of the voice net ads.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. We – from a voice standpoint, certainly cord cutting is a challenge, not only for
Charter but for the entire telco industry. But the lion's share of the impact to us in net ads through the first three
quarters was our – by design a strategic shift to more brand-oriented marketing since we've emerged from our
restructuring.

We typically had spent virtually a 100% on direct response in media, and we shifted a significant portion of that in the
first three quarter of this year to brand and feel like we've laid the right groundwork for refreshing the brand, the
Charter link to our customer experience efforts. Now we've indexed back to a healthier balance and we'll see the results
and are seeing the results early in Q4 relative to more direct response in media marketing. So we see less of the impact
from cord cutting, more of the impact from our own strategic decisions to shift to a brand-oriented marketing.

Your next question comes from the line of Rich Tullo with Albert Fried.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Hey. Thanks a lot, guys, for taking my questions. Really congratulations on a strong
performance. As I look at your peers, I think you guys are doing a much better job at exploiting the opportunities that
are presented to you in the marketplace despite a tough economy. That said, how many weeks does it – during the
quarter was Charter Starter available to customers?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: It did really – it really came at the end of the quarter. So we're in the very early stages in
focusing on marketing that product.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: We didn't do a large [indiscernible] (0:57:17) mail drop really until the end of
October. So I think that we were on trial setting up those credit controls that I was talking about during Q3. Did some
trial at the end of Q3 and then did a larger mail drop mid to – call it the second, third week of October and it's far too
early to determine what the impact to that direct mail is.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Fair enough. And excuse me if I got a little confused. Could you just kind of go over the
difference between the prepaid and the deposit? Are some accounts going to be – prepaid available to them? And are
some accounts going to need to make a deposit? I mean how does that work?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: No. There won't be a formal prepaid setup other than in order to get service activated
for that very high credit class segment today, the customer is required to prepay the first month as well as the install
fee. What that does is determines an inability and a willingness to pay. Getting a deposit set up inside of the billing
system is taking a little bit of more time. It's going to be a few more months until we add that on top.
So at that stage – and that's where I would caveat in terms of what this can do with growth, is that you're now talking
about a segment that is somewhat cash constrained. In order for them to really demonstrate that they're going to be a
enabling willing payer then they need to fund the first month, the install fee and the deposit upfront. Obviously, the first
month and the install – the first month gets returned to them and the deposit would over time, but it would required a
six month payment history before we start moving them up into a different credit class that starts expanding the amount
of product that they can take.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: And really Rich it's all about allowing the consumer to kind of right-size for their capability.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Right.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: The monthly fee and then build a relationship that grows into a creditworthy relationship
over that six month period to move upstream into our product set.
<Q - Rich R. Tullo>: Yeah. Fair enough. I mean it's a good opportunity, I could see, for a lot of people. The search and
discovery, is that called search and discovery first off? Or do you have any other name for it?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. Search and discovery is a pretty common term in the industry. So you're right
on labeling it that way.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Pace with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael V. Pace>: Hi. Thank you. Just two key topics here, the first on the M&A front. Can you just talk about
the opportunities you see there? I'm assuming on the residential side it's really just on the margin. But could you focus
more on the commercial side?
And I guess maybe back to residential, do you think – do you prefer to be a net buyer or a net seller of residential
assets? And on the commercial side what are the benefits of getting bigger through M&A here, greater network
customers, general expertise, et cetera? And then I have a follow-up capital structure question. Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Okay. Mike I'll handle this – I'll answer it a little more broadly and then hand it over to Don
to talk about commercial opportunity and how we view things and what filters we use. You hear this a lot from us at
Charter and you'll continue to hear this, we are always opportunistic relative to being a net buyer or a net seller. So I
think you'll continue to see us operate that way. I think there's a unique opportunity for us, and you've seen this with the
tack-ons that we've done. There's efficiency and scale benefit at the enterprise level, but we've always talked about the
scale benefit that we see on local geographies, so adding tack-ons, whether its 5,000 or 50,000 subscribers, we'll
continue to look at that.
Looking at some of our footprint, we operate in a number of states. If there's an opportunity for us to divest and the
economics are right, we'll continue to look at that and again be very opportunistic.
Don, maybe you can talk a little bit about how we view commercial opportunity.
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Sure. On the commercial side, it's a lot about building capability, creditability and reach.
And we've looked at a number of opportunities. We made one very small tuck-in acquisition down in Birmingham,
which was a fiber network that allowed us to really extend into the downtown area of Birmingham and give us some
great connectivity to business customers where we didn't have connectivity in the past. But I think we strongly believe
that there are some inorganic opportunities out there and we continue to search for those. And to the extent it helps us
even more aggressively grow, we'll put those under the proper lens and execute if they look desirable.
<Q - Michael V. Pace>: Thanks. And then maybe for Chris on the capital structure. I guess when you look at the high
coupon debt that becomes callable in 2012 and given the overall balance sheet you really have the flexibility to really
do what you wish there. I guess if we just started with a blank piece of paper, I guess what would the capital structure
look like going forward in terms of issuers? And I guess I want to focus more on the second lien part of the capital
structures. Is there really a need for that to exist going forward? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, Mike. The – if we were to start with a clean sheet of paper, which wasn't what
we were given, we would probably have two issuers; one more at the junior, one more at the senior level, one being a
high-yield issuer, the other one is being more bank type. I tend to agree with you that, naturally, when you take a look
at it second lien isn't something would be what you would draw on that clean piece of paper.
Having said that, I do think there are different pockets of capital market opportunities that open up over time and we're
always going to be opportunistic with that. So while it may be something that we say on a clean sheet of paper, we

wouldn't look to do today, there may be some interesting ideas that come along the way that enable us to effectively
lower interest costs or achieve more flexibility. And we'll certainly be open minded to that, but I tend to agree with you.
We have two issuers on a clean sheet of paper; we'd have a more simple capital structure. As you mentioned, there's a
fair amount of debt that becomes callable in the coming year and I think we're taking a look at all of that stuff on an
NPV-positive basis. It's not just about simplification. It's really about making sure that we're doing the right thing by
our shareholders in terms of how we'd like to take out that debt over time.

Your final question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Hi. Thanks. You had some rate increases in July and probably you didn't get the full effect of that
in 3Q. Can you sort of talk about how much of this we can see in 4Q on both broadband and on Video ARPU from that,
just sort of trending it into for the full quarter?
And second, given your voice ARPU is substantially higher than your peer group and given some weakness in that
category, can you talk about the elasticity of pricing and your strategy on driving unit growth and compromising on
prices there? Thanks.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, Vijay. I'll take the voice ARPU question and then Chris can then talk about rate
increases and what the impact is going forward. The way we're looking at voice, we have – so there's a couple of things
going on. Because we're a registered [ph] CLAC (1:04:46) we get the benefit of what's called [ph] Ukel (01:04:48), so
there's a regulatory charge that our customers see that some other operators, I think, the vast majority of other
operators, don't have because they're not a [ph] CLAC. (1:05:00) So there is a benefit in our ARPU there that is
somewhat unique and it's roughly – Chris, $5.50?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. That's about right.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: About $5.5. The way we think about voice strategically and more and more – and you'll hear
more about this in the coming quarters, we're looking at the value that, that product adds to the stickiness of a
household and the increase in customer lifetime value. So we'll – in all likelihood, you'll see us getting more aggressive
on pricing to drive deeper penetration on our existing base with our Voice product to increase the lifetime value. It's a
huge churn benefit.
I think if you look at what we've talked about historically, and this continues to trend almost the same from the day that
we launched our Voice product, we see a 40% improvement in churn in a triple play household as opposed to a single
analog video household. So obviously, there's significant customer lifetime benefit associated with putting that product
in the house. We also -facing the winds of cord cutting with mobile phones, we see there's a window of opportunity to
drive landline penetration now and we're hitting the gas on that.
Chris, you want to talk about rates?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. Vijay, on rates you asked about Q4, so in Q3 just to flash back, let me talk
about the incremental for Q4. We had $10 million of rate increase that was going through it during the quarter, that
came about equally split between basic, between tiers and between the cable modem fees so again, equally between
basic, which is basic video; tiers on the digital side and on Internet. There'll be inside of Q4 a few million additional
uplifts to the $10 million that should roll through during the course of Q4. And I think that gives you enough color in
terms of how to think about it.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: So one more thing, Vijay, on the voice because I think it's a good question relative to how
we're viewing that product strategically. While you'll see moderate and declines or likely to see moderate declines in

ARPU over the coming years, those declines will be more than offset by the increase in lifetime value that the churn
benefit brings to us.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Great. Can I just ask another one on the analog video subscriber losses, which were
disproportionately most of your Video losses? Where are those folks going? And really, is the Starter program really
targeting to those folks? I mean would that keep them behind – get them back?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. I think a lot of what you see in the – it's not the vast majority but a significant portion
of analog-only households are in those bottom segments, they're shopping on a regular basis for other providers. I think
the way we look at it is they're shopping and hopping, so to speak. They're moving from one from one provider to the
other because they're shopping for deals. We think Charter Starter will help address some of that, but not all of that.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Great. Thanks so much.
