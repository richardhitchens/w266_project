David A. Viniar
Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our first quarter results and then
take your questions.
I'm pleased to report solid first quarter results for the firm. Net revenues were nearly $10 billion and net earnings were
$2.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $3.92 and our annualized return on common equity was 12.2%.
For Goldman Sachs, our opportunity set begins with our clients. In the wake of the financial crisis our clients faced a
series of challenges that accelerated in 2011. For both corporate and investing clients shifting and often conflicting
economic data created uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy. Evolving clarity was complicated by the
degree of interdependence among different regional economies. As would be expected, these macroeconomic concerns
were reflected in the global capital markets as market participants became increasingly concerned about the economic
environment, particularly related to the potential systemic risk presented in Europe
The situation was exacerbated by growing skepticism regarding the willingness of the global political infrastructure to
address the economic risks confronting the system. These factors resulted in periods of unprecedented volatility in asset
values and bouts of prolonged illiquidity, often sparked by perception or conjecture rather than by fundamental analysis
or actual facts. Ultimately, economic uncertainty, market volatility and systemic risk factors had a materially negative
impact on market psychology in 2011.
While macroeconomic challenges persist, there have been some positive developments over the last few months. At the
end of December, the European Central Bank announced that it would enhance its long-term refinancing operation to
provide term liquidity. By addressing potential funding risks the ECB materially reduced the market's concern that a
systemic event that could emanate from a European financial institution. In addition, the market has seen steady
progress in 2012 on resolving Greece's debt situation providing greater comfort that there will be a difficult but
organized approach to addressing sovereign issues within the euro area.
In response to these critical events, capital markets rallied significantly in the first quarter of 2012. Credit markets
improved materially, experiencing tighter spreads, higher activity levels, increased new issuance and most importantly,
improved market liquidity. Global equity markets also rallied during the first quarter, with the S&P 500 up 12%, the
FTSE up 14.2% and the Hang Seng up 11.5%.
Volatility was materially lower, as demonstrated by the VIX declining by a third. While there were positive
developments, announced M&A volumes remained light, and equity volumes remained muted, reflecting the longer
time required to improve CEO confidence and investor conviction. Ultimately, the more favorable operating
environment combined with the strength of our diverse global client franchise to create an improved opportunity set for
Goldman Sachs in the first quarter of 2012.
I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion, up 35%
from fourth quarter results. First quarter advisory revenues were $489 million, up 4% from the fourth quarter.
Goldman Sachs ranked first in worldwide announced M&A globally for the year to date. We advised on a number of
important transactions that closed in the first quarter, including Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' $4.8 billion sale
to Western Digital Corporation, Temple-Inland's $4.3 billion sale to International Paper, and Transatlantic Holdings'
$3.4 billion sale to Allegheny. We're also advisor on a number of significant announced transactions, including TNT
Express's €5.2 billion sale to United Parcel Service, Tyco International's $4.9 billion merger of its Flow Control
business with Pentair, and Apache's $2.9 billion acquisition of Cordillera Energy Partners.

First quarter underwriting net revenues were $665 million, up 72% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $255
million were up 34% from a weak fourth quarter, reflecting an increase in secondary offerings as IPO activity remained
light. Debt underwriting more than doubled to $410 million, reflecting higher industry-wide debt issuance.
During the first quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Priceline's $1 billion
convertible offering, Seadrill's $1 billion secondary offering and Clear Channel's $2.2 billion high-yield offering. Our
Investment Banking backlog remained unchanged from year-end levels.
Let me now turn to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and Equities Client Execution,
commissions and fees, and security services. Net revenues were $5.7 billion in the first quarter. Our FICC and Equities
Client Execution businesses produced significantly stronger results than during the fourth quarter, driven by an overall
improvement in market sentiment. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $3.5 billion in the first quarter, improving
significantly from the weak fourth quarter.
This quarter's results reflected a broad contribution across our businesses and products. Our Rates, Credit and Mortgage
businesses benefited from higher client activity levels following the LTRO, the improved outlook for the U.S. economy
and the orderly restructuring of Greece's debt. Our Currencies business benefited from stronger performance in our
Emerging Markets businesses. Commodity results reflected lower volatility levels, which drove fewer opportunities
during the quarter.
Turning to equities, which include Equities Client Execution, commissions and fees, and security services, net revenues
for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, up 33% sequentially. Equities Client Execution revenues doubled to $1.1 billion,
largely reflecting higher net revenues within our derivatives businesses. Commissions and fees were $834 million, up
7% from the fourth quarter on higher market values in Europe and Asia and higher volumes in options and futures.
Security services net revenues of $367 million were down 5% sequentially.
Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the first quarter was $95 million, down 30% relative to the fourth quarter.
Lower interest rate risk was driven by lower levels of volatility.
Let me now review Investing & Lending, which produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the first quarter. The firm's
Investing & Lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loans and equity
securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds, as
well as lending activities.
Our investment in ICBC produced $169 million in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of
$891 million, reflecting gains that were relatively balanced between public and private equity investments. Net
revenues from debt securities and loans were $585 million, largely driven by interest income and a more favorable
credit market. Other revenues of $266 million were primarily driven by the firm's investment in consolidated
investment entities.
In investment management we reported first quarter net revenues of $1.2 billion down 7% from the fourth quarter due
to seasonally lower incentive fees. Management and other fees were consistent with the fourth quarter at $1 billion
dollars. During the first quarter, assets under management decreased $4 billion to $824 billion. Outflows in money
markets and to a lesser extent equity and alternative assets were partially offset by $22 billion of market appreciation.
Now let me turn to expenses. In the second quarter of 2011, we announced an initiative to reduce approximately $1.2
billion in run rate compensation and non-compensation expense. We increased the program to $1.4 billion over the
course of the year. We have largely implemented our announced expense reductions and continue to review means to
further improve our operating efficiency. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses,
amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits was accrued at a
compensation to net revenue ratio of 44%, which is consistent with the firms accrual in the first quarter of 2011.
First quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, 8% lower than the fourth quarter, reflecting reduced costs
across a number of expense categories. Total staff at the end of the first quarter was approximately 32,400, down 3%
from the end of 2011 and down 9% from the end of 2010. Our effective tax rate was 33.7% for the first quarter.

During the quarter we repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $362 million. These
repurchases reflected the completion of our 2011 capital plan. Today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly
common stock dividend from $0.35 to $0.46 per share. While we expect share repurchases to continue to be the
predominance of our capital management activity we've received shareholder feedback related to our dividend and
therefore elected a modest increase.
The first quarter brought several favorable developments in the operating environment for our businesses. We believe
the probability of a tail event in the euro area has materially declined in light of the LTRO. In addition, the economy in
the United States is showing signs of recovery. China, while potentially slowing, still remains a strong economic
growth engine. Despite these improvements, client sentiment remains fragile. In addition, market developments in
recent weeks including weaker U.S. economic data and wider spreads in certain peripheral European countries remind
us of the fragility of this recovery.
While debt financing markets are open and equity financing markets improving, M&A activity has not yet gained
momentum. Volumes improved in certain Fixed Income markets but equity volumes remain under pressure and
investor conviction is mixed. We believe an improving macroeconomic picture is the most significant driver of
improved market psychology and a healthy stable capital markets over the medium-term.
In the near-term, the current operating environment warrants a prudent approach to managing capital and liquidity
levels and a continued focus on expense initiatives. The last three years have brought a series of challenges for
Goldman Sachs and the financial services industry as well as market participants more broadly. We're encouraged by
the early signs of improvement in markets and the economy but remain cautious given the complexity of risks and
challenges.
Everyone at Goldman Sachs remains steadfast in their commitment to serving our client franchise. We're keenly aware
that the quality of our advice and execution in today's challenging markets serves as the foundation for maintaining
these long-term client relationships and ultimately meeting the needs of all of our stakeholders.
With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today and now I'm happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Let me just start with the expense initiatives that you alluded to. Obviously in the quarter, as
you also pointed out, what you reported on the non-personnel side was – indicated very strong cost management. You
could look at some of those items and say well, some of this is just discretionary spending being stepped on temporarily
in what's still a weak revenue environment. On the other hand you're telling us that you've fully implemented your
sizable cost cutting plans. So that's a roundabout way of asking for a little bit of guidance as to whether we should be
straight lining these levels of non-personnel costs.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You know, Guy, I'm always hesitant to give guidance on anything because things change, but
I think that you can assume that most of those cost reductions – many of which are related to people, but non-comp
expenses are attached to people, are in and so I think that the numbers that you see are not a bad proxy all other things
being equal and assuming no big changes in the environment for where things are going to run.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's helpful, thanks. I wanted to talk about CCAR a little bit. Obviously your CCAR
results highlighted something we've known for a while which is that your capital position's very strong. The shares

have obviously rallied meaningfully in the first quarter but they're still below tangible book. Maybe you can articulate
your philosophy with respect to share buybacks relative to the share price and the degree of price sensitivity that you
may show?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, I'd always like to buy more when the stock price is lower and less when the stock price
is higher. But I've never found myself to be a great predictor of our stock price. And so I'm not necessarily sure when
the stock price is lower or when it's higher. We'll have a plan. We will moderate that plan based both our results and
how things are going during the quarter as well as on the stock price, and we'll try to buy more at the lower stock price
and less at the higher stock price, but I don't know for sure we'll be successful at that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And can you give us some sense of how to think about what authorization you may have
received from the Fed as to how much you may buy back?
<A - David A. Viniar>: You know we didn't disclose it last year nor this year.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got to ask, though. Can you tell us what your pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common and
risk-weighted assets were?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I can give you the ratio. I actually don't have in front of me both the equity and the
risk-weighted assets, but with all the caveats of the rules not being done, being very rough estimates, all of those
caveats taken as a given, at the end of the quarter, our Basel III ratio would've been roughly 8%, and if you roll forward
to 2013, again, assuming just consensus estimates of earnings and passive roll-offs of positions, so no active mitigation,
it would be around 11%.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, and then final question for me is just about Investing & Lending. The outstanding
levels of your I&L portfolios have been pretty constant, but going forward, of course, there's going to be limitations on
the level of fund commitments and maybe some other limitations under Volcker. How should we think about the
portfolio trajectory there given some of these limitations and the expected runoff of your current portfolio holdings?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, again, hard to answer the question because the rules are far from final. But certainly
some of our investments in hedge funds are going to come out. We've announced that publicly. And our investments in
equity funds are going to be limited to 3%. And so some of those – some of the investments where we have a higher
percentage will roll off, and so in that way you could certainly see some of that portfolio come down. But until the rules
are finalized, we don't know exactly where it's going to go.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just in terms of the potential capital relief as we see some runoff, I think you've spoken
to about $9 billion of capital held against that portfolio currently. Is that still more or less right?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Right, but not to mislead you, that's the total capital held against that portfolio. We don't
expect that whole portfolio to go away, so we don't expect all that capital to be released, and it's going to be dependent
on the fund rule set, how much happens and what the ultimate flows are.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, of course. Okay, thanks very much, David. Appreciate that.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome, Guy.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Morning, Howard.

Curious if you're seeing any improved share trends. And second on the flip side, are you seeing the competitive
landscape heat up in any particular sub-clusters of FICC or equities? Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I would say the competitive landscape remains tough. We have a lot of very, very good
competitors out there. We can go back to 2009 where, as you know, we gained a tremendous amount of share, but we
all talked about – you heard me say very clearly that was not sustainable, and we knew our competitors would be back.
They are.
I think there are some competitors, some of the European institutions, who have exited certain businesses, so that's
helpful. But it's hard to really see that, because there's not yet that – enough improved flow to really see how much
share we can pick up from that. I would say our franchise remains very strong. We continue to get a very, very good
market share across the Trading businesses. But that's not without very strong competition from our major competitors.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great, thanks. And then healthy start to the year, but with the environment still glass
half-full, glass half-empty, how are you thinking of staffing levels and the hiring outlook today?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I think we're relatively well positioned, assuming that the environment stays pretty
much what it is. But you heard me say we're going to look for other means of efficiency, because we're still cautious on
the outlook. But I wouldn't expect anything major to change from where we are.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Perfect, thanks. And then final one from me. Given the Moody's review for you all in the
industry, can you share your latest views on what a downgrade for the firm and the industry means to you? And the
competitive landscape if it falls out that your rating comes – lays out at a premium to that of some of your major
competitors?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, first I would say, and I'm sure this will not surprise you, we very strongly disagree with
some of the things that Moody's has mentioned in some of their reports. We think that if you look at every single credit
metric there is for Goldman Sachs and frankly for many of our competitors, none of the actions they've talked about are
warranted. We are, as you know, we're quite analytical, and when we do all of the analysis, we cannot figure out why
they are where they are, and so I just wanted to tell you that.
Look, what the effect is going to be – I think much of it is in the market, because they have clearly foreshadowed what
they're thinking of doing. I think if they move the whole industry to the left, I think it will not in the end have that big
an effect. There are some who might be more affected than others. At least from what they say, we'll be at the higher
end, but not the highest. And so I don't think it'll have a big effect, and it's hard to say that there will be a real
competitive change from what they do.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks so much for taking my questions, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hello, there.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. One of the impossible questions. So, look, you guys are the only ones that break
out investing and lending separate. There's a component, at least a decent component of it that would be included in
some of the competitors' FICC numbers. But with all that said, can we drill down on FICC specifically? It's an
interesting quarter, because spreads compressed a lot, but you came into the quarter and then – with lower risk rates and
you took VAR down dramatically in rates and currencies. Can we just talk about separating the environment and your
de-risking versus looking forward to how a business is being shaped? And then, very specifically, how you think about

your share within FICC?
<A - David A. Viniar>: In some ways, Glenn, your question included my answer. So look, you're correct about the
segments and so it's hard to compare. It's not necessarily apples and apples. You're correct about our caution. And the
way I would describe the quarter is I would say flow in FICC was good but not great, and our quarter in FICC was
good but not great, reflecting that. There was big asset price improvement but we were – we have been cautious on risk
and we remain cautious on risk given the environment and I think that's also reflective of the fact that our clients have
been cautious on risk and remain cautious on risk.
And that's why flow, I would say, was good but not great and I think all of those things are related. Our franchise still
feels extremely strong, our market share is very high, and the reason that it was a lot better than what you saw towards
the end of last year is because flow and outlook was better but still cautious.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: I appreciate that and I'll note that you didn't say anything about future part of the business and
the regulatory environment. In other words, this is all a product of your client flow and the business environment.
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think that is the great bulk of it. I think some of the flow or not great flow is caused by
concern about what regulation might do. I think that's a very small part of it. I think most of it is macroeconomic
driven.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. I appreciate that. After the quarter there were some new stories on ICBC sale. Just curious
if you – it wasn't all of it. Just wondering how much is it in the funds, how much is it the Goldman piece and what's left
after the latest sale?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Sure. The simple answer is there was nothing different about this than the prior sales. It was
purely a de-risking sale because our position was quite big. We still have a position that at current market prices is a
little bit less than $2 billion. We remain very optimistic about ICBC and about China. We remain very committed to
both strategically, and we would expect to have a reasonable sized position going forward but it was just big and we
de-risked.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay. Last one and I've been through the cycle with you before, but it seems like there's been a
decent number of senior producers leaving Goldman over the past couple of months and wondering if you could just
put some context around that and how much time you spend worrying about it because I know it comes up in a lot of
conversations we have.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Sure. And this is – we talked about this before and I told you that you should expect what you
saw. We have statistically 15% to 20% of our partners leave every two years. You go back in history and you've seen
that. And over the last four years coming into this year, very, very few left. And I think that was a testament to people's
feelings about Goldman Sachs. It was a tough economic environment. It was a tough reputational environment and our
partners are completely loyal and felt that they should stay with Goldman Sachs.
I think as things have improved somewhat, what you're seeing is a little bit of a catch-up. It's natural and it's actually
important and it's warranted because if it doesn't happen then the next level of people don't have – who are fantastic,
don't have the opportunity to move up and then they'll leave and then when the senior people leave you'll be missing
that middle level. And so there is nothing unusual about it. It is exactly in line with what we would've expected. I
would expect that between now and the end of the year you'll see more partners leaving. I couldn't tell you who they're
going to be. It's just the natural progression and our bench is so deep that it's really not an issue at all.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, super. Thanks, David.

<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Hi, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Maybe just to follow on that question. I think you said that head count was down 3%
since the end of 2011. Is that just the holdover of some of the initiatives from last year or is that the sum of the
departures kind of post...?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, I think it's largely the ends of our expense initiatives that we talked about.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Could you also comment on maybe how – what head count level delta is in
the U.S. versus non-U.S. either like over the last year or year-to-date? I'm just curious what the relative growth or
contraction rates are.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yeah. The contractions, I would say, were more in the U.S. and Europe than in Asia but pretty
similar across the U.S. and Asia with – U.S. and Europe with a little bit less in Asia given our concentration on growing
that business.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Would you still anticipate to be growing, say not outside of Europe this year or
particularly emerging markets?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I would anticipate us to be growing in emerging markets but I would anticipate that growth to
be very moderate in this environment.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. On the regulatory front, is there – are there any significant items? There's a lot
of rules that have to be written but obviously a lot of discussions going on around them, are there any other major
issues that you feel at this point have not been acknowledged by relevant either members of Congress or regulators to
work out?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think the regulators and especially the regulators who are writing the rule understand the
issues. I think they're very, very difficult issues. I think they are doing what we completely support which is trying to
write rules that make the financial system safer and sounder while not hurting the free flow of capital and therefore,
economic growth and not hurting the competitiveness of the U.S. financial institutions. That's their goal. It's not easy.
The rules are very, very complicated. We're very supportive of what they are trying to do and I think they are really
trying hard to do this but it's a difficult task and they recognize all of the issues involved.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay and then just in the equities business, I was curious on the equity derivative
comments that you're up year-over-year. From everything I've heard that's been a much tougher business
year-over-year particularly with volatility down. Is there anything unusual or particularly chunky in there?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, we actually saw more activity from our clients in the derivatives space and so that was
very helpful to us.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Last one just on liquidity. $170 billion I think this quarter. Given all of your
comments, things feeling somewhat better but obviously still some points of caution you anticipate to run at these kinds
of levels probably for the rest of the year?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We've been running at an average of the high 160s probably for the last 2-ish years. I would
not expect – assuming the environment does not change dramatically – I would not expect it to change dramatically. It
might go up or down a little bit from here. I wouldn't expect it to change dramatically.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay, all right. Thanks a lot, David.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Thanks, David. You know, first question – when you started out you mentioned solid
results. It's still just 12% ROE. Now granted, tough environment and tough environment for all the peers, so on a
relative basis, still pretty good, but I think when we think about the macro environment improving and what that can do
to returns, we can all try to gauge that and factor that into the pickup in activity. But when you think about the
uncertainty on some of the regulations that are still weighing on the industry, how much does that limit your ability and
the industry's ability to reposition in order to improve returns? Meaning if the regulatory uncertainty keeps getting
kicked down the road, does that significantly limit what you can do to try to improve those returns versus just the
macro environment?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Okay. I think – as you heard me say before, I think the biggest driver is going to be activity
and the biggest driver of activity is going to be the macroeconomic environment. You saw some pickup this quarter and
so you saw a pretty good pickup in ROE although not something that we consider acceptable. I think – let's just be
realistic, there's going to be regulatory uncertainty for a while and I actually think, as I said before, I think the rules are
hard and I think I would trade regulatory uncertainty for better rules and so I think the regulators are taking the
appropriate amount of time to make sure they get it right and in the long-term that's going to be better for us and better
for everybody.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay and then during the quarter – one is on the Asset Management side. So you did
one deal. That business just on the long-term flows continues to see out flows, so just strategically, how are you guys
trying to reposition that? And then you've also been building the reinsurance business so where do you see the
opportunity there and is it some firms pulling out and you see some market share, longer-term what are the returns
there?
<A - David A. Viniar>: So, look, on Asset Management it is still a very, very big focus of the firm. You saw the
acquisitions we made were small as we told you, you might occasionally see them. They're really to put us in parts of
the business that we weren't in before where it was hard to start ourselves. All very small dollars, but hopefully will
give us a platform that we can grow up. One of the things we've seen in Asset Management is our performance in the
last several months has definitely improved and if that continues I think that would be a good precursor to good inflows
of assets. We'll have to see if that continues.
Reinsurance I would say is really just totally opportunistic. We've seen some opportunities where for various reasons of
risk management and capital some people were pulling out of the market. We thought it made sense for us to
opportunistically pick up some pieces but it's a very, very small business within the context of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay, thanks. And then lastly just a number and we might've missed it. But just on the
DVA, did you split that out just in terms of FICC and Equities?
<A - David A. Viniar>: No, It's roughly 50-50 between FICC and equities. Tiny bit more in FICC than equities but
roughly 50-50.
<Q - Michael Roger Carrier>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yes, good morning. I'm looking at the payments page 25 from the Fed's March 13 CCAR
publication which shows all the banks' capital ratios before the proposed capital actions and then after. And for
Goldman Sachs it's a very small difference. It was 5.8% before the capital actions that you requested and 5.7 after. So
which implies that's it's a tenth of a percent of your risk weighted assets like you only asked for an incremental $400
million of additional return to your shareholders and I guess I'm wondering A: is that a correct reading? B: that makes it

sounds like the only thing you asked for was for this dividend and not for any incremental share repurchase
authorization. Am I reading that correctly?
<A - David A. Viniar>: So, I'll tell you two things. One, we did not only ask for dividends, although I'm not going to
disclose how much of a share increase, and the second thing I will give you is a bad answer which is we do not know
how the Fed did the calculations.

Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney with Meredith Whitney Advisors.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Good morning, Meredith.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: I have a question that's sort of related to FICC but broader. I'm just going to go for it, which
is you talk about risk and your risk appetite differentiated you last quarter of the year, the quarter before this quarter
and maybe if you could explain your approach to risk? Or better articulate – better explain with maybe some tangible
examples your approach to risk and particularly political risk? And if you'd comment on the YPF issue with Argentina
yesterday. Just, I mean, give me more would be helpful at least for me.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Meredith, that was a very broad question. I'll try and answer it as best I can. The biggest thing
that drives our risk appetite is our client flow. And what our clients are doing and how much they want to do and
obviously when they do more, we're likely to end up with more risk. They're not necessarily doing that much more
because they're cautious as well.
Second thing that drives our risk really is the traders on the lines view of their ability to analyze the situation. We
talked a lot about this last year, about the fact that really what was driving markets last year was very largely political
as opposed to economic.
And so because we're good analysts and think we can try to evaluate the more likely economic outcomes and we're not
always going to be right and we know that. But at least we can analyze it in a situation where it's really politics and
speeches and what people are saying more than economic outcomes that are driving the markets. It's very hard for us to
analyze risk and makes us extremely cautious about being left with any risk. Frankly, it made our clients more cautious
too and there was less activity so we saw that last year. That's really the philosophy more than anything else.
I think the YPF situation – I don't have much to say. I think it's an isolated incident in a certain location. I certainly
don't think or hope it's indicative of the rest of the world.
<Q - Meredith Whitney>: That's helpful. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Yes. Hi. A few questions. First of all, Basel – the Basel numbers that you indicated under
Basel III. Are they ex-NPR II?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Yes, they are.

Page 11 of 16
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And when do you expect some kind of finalization around NPR II?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Kian, I don't know. I don't – we don't know when the rules are going to be finalized.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And assuming the business NPR II proposals are what will be finalized, how would that
impact, in particular, your Mortgage business? And then also I guess your Securitization business but in particular your
Mortgage business?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I think it would be very difficult for that business. And look, I can't give you an exact answer
but it's hard to see that business for us or really anyone under those rules, that business making sense. And I think you'd
have to see a big pull back and I don't think that would be very good for capital markets or for the economy. And so we
hope that doesn't happen.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. Shifting to FICC, if I look at your numbers over now I would say six quarters, one
could make the argument that you have taken a quite risk aversion view and the revenues as a result maybe against
some of your peers look weakish. How would you or how do you answer that argument? And I'm clearly just looking at
clean revenues ex-DVA, some of them ex-CVA on a like-for-like basis. How would you argue against that?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I think – I think that basically we have been cautious. I think our clients have been
cautious as well, and I think that our franchise remains very strong. We still believe we're getting a very, very high
market share. We're not getting the market share we were in 2009. And remember, I told you in 2009, we weren't going
to keep that market share. I think you always have to be careful where you start. When you go back to the remnants of
2009, have we lost share since then, the answer is yes. But we picked up an enormous share going into that and we
knew we were going to keep it. But leaving that aside, we think our franchise has not lost share all at all as fact it
remains very, very strong.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: And can we talk a little bit about this quarter, a little bit by FICC business? What were the,
kind of, bright spots or the more difficult areas? We know you're a big mortgage player. Was that an area which
performed very good or was more difficult on commodities. Can you talk a little bit by sub segment just what has been
performing very strongly? And what's maybe a bit more difficult?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Well, without disclosing numbers because you know we don't do that, what I'd tell you is what
I would say if the Rates business had a very strong quarter, and all the other businesses had good but not great quarters.
<Q - Kian Abouhossein>: Okay. And lastly in terms of investing, you've indicated a little bit on the emerging markets
side. But can you talk a little bit about the key areas that you see for yourself both in terms of capital as well? In terms
of what are the potential growth engine that you see? You've always been very good at looking forward and seeing
where you see potential investment opportunities and profit opportunities. Can you talk a little bit about what are
actually growth areas as an investment either geographically or business segments?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Kian, I appreciate that compliment. I wouldn't actually think we're always that good at looking
forward. I think we're actually better at adapting to the environment and very good at being nimble and being able to
move to where we the environment is going. But we've told you for a while, two big concentrations are the growth
markets and the whole investment management business. Those continue to be but we're not – we think that over time
we'll grow all of our businesses around the world. You've heard Lloyd use the term that we're going to be Goldman
Sachs in more places. We're going to do that. We're also going to grow all of the businesses around the world as the
environment improves.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I just wanted to follow-up more on the buyback. Is there anything that would keep you from
buying back your stock aggressively below tangible book value?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Within the context of what we can do with the Fed, no. There's nothing to keep us from doing
that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And is there anything that would keep you from frontloading your buybacks even if it wasn't
spread out evenly over quarters?
<A - David A. Viniar>: The only thing would be the inability to fully predict where our stock price is going and
wanting to make sure that we have some powder for later in the year depending on what the environment is like.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Separately, there's been all sorts of regulatory investigations into the industry and there's one
news report saying that one investigation was complete and the article – this relates to the Department of Justice. And I
know it hasn't come up a whole lot but it's still out there in some investors' minds. Would we ever hear if they were
done with their investigation into you or not?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I actually don't know the answer to that question, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And lastly, what this quarter could you say we can extrapolate forward? You don't like
giving guidance on capital markets and so I know you're not going to give any guidance there but I guess your
non-comp expenses we could say are recurring?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I think you can extrapolate somewhat but remember one of the biggest non-comp
expenses which is brokerage clearance and exchange fees is activity related. So that's one that I certainly hope gets
higher. If you saw that go up from a non-comp point of view that would actually be a really good thing not a bad thing.
So there is some activity basing within even the non-comp so all other things being equal I think it's probably a
reasonably good proxy for where we're going to go, but all other things are never equal. And so hard to predict, and as
far as anything else you know I don't think one quarter is at all a predictor of the future.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Well, however you look at it if you strip out activity-based non-comp expenses, how much did
non-comp expenses go down for the quarter?
<A - David A. Viniar>: You see them. I mean, you see what they are, and I think as I said, given similar levels of
activity I think that's a pretty good baseline for around where we'll be.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, and so same with Basel III, though, too, right?
<A - David A. Viniar>: We have a lot more clarity on Basel III, but we'll see. If that rule got passed as is than we
would incorporate it in. We'd tell you what it was.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just on the insurance side of the business that you talked about earlier, could
you just give us a sense of how you're integrating that into not only your equities business but also into just integrating
that into your overall organization?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's run largely separately, although our risk management is very integrated into it, because
there are a lot of market-related risks in that business, and so our risk management infrastructure is very integrated into
that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So it should help with your own VAR, I would think, no?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's very, very minor in that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, and then what about funding? Does it help at all with the funding side?

Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi. I just had two questions. One was on the Basel III look-through. And I think you said
roughly 8%, and I think at Q4 it was roughly 8%. Am I able to impute – I know you also caveated the moving parts, but
obviously your Basel I improved due to retained earnings, and the RWAs going down, so has it improved at all through
earnings? Or is it the Basel III RWAs are going up? I just wondered if you could help on that.
<A - David A. Viniar>: The changes are really immaterial; that's why I gave you roughly the same number. You're
talking about tenths of a percent.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Is that because your Basel I RWAs going down wouldn't have been reflected in the Basel
III?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Again, that is largely correct.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Okay. Thanks. And then just trying to understand the cost number. You gave a total cost
reduction number. And then how do I – I'm assuming we'll see something in salaries potentially at some point, but that
won't be clear until the comp ratio – I mean, because it's not just non-comp, is it?
<A - David A. Viniar>: It's not just non-comp at all, and you saw some of that last year in the comp line. So a lot of
that is already in there, and you saw it last year.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: But if I knew the comp, I mean, so there would – could there even have been lower
salaries, for example, absolute salary cost in Q1 as well?

<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Great. Thanks, David. Just wanted to get a quick characterization of the business condition
changes in both your Asia/Chinese markets and the European markets in Q1 versus Q4, because we've seen a number
of competitors – at least their revenue numbers suggest that those numbers were up fairly dramatically quarter over
quarter. I guess I'm just curious if you can provide some color as to how you're thinking about those markets.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I would actually say the Asian markets – I mean, you saw there was a pretty big
underperformance of the Chinese market in the first quarter, and I think that reflected a little bit some of the activity,
but the business was still pretty good, and European activity was better, as you saw the markets get better.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And as the markets have sort of – the improvement in the markets has stalled a little bit in the
last few weeks. Has that had a chilling effect on activity within the European markets?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, two weeks doesn't really tell you anything. But, yeah, I think that it has had somewhat
of a chilling effect on activity in Europe as markets have stalled, and we'll see how things unfold over the course of the

I think what you're seeing is given how much economic uncertainty there has been for a while, CEOs are very much in
a prove-it mode and they want to see solid growth or at least growth and resolution in Europe and things like that for a
longer period than they saw it in the first quarter. And until they have that confidence come back and it's just going to
take a while longer, it's just not going to result in that many transactions. As I said, there is a lot of dialogue and enough
dialogue that if that CEO confidence comes back you could see a fairly dramatic pick up in that market, but the
confidence has to come back.
<Q - Doug Sipkin>: Would you say that, I mean Europe is the predominant driver of that meaning I say that it just
feels like this thing could go on for a lot longer? Or is it more the United States or sort of non-Europe economies that
are driving some of that?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I would put Europe as the top of the list but not the only thing on the list. So if you saw a
whole slew of continued better economic data in the U.S., I think that could be a driver. Pickup in China, that could be
a driver. But Europe is the number one thing that's out there.

any way you could give us some color or an idea about how much of a headwind the levered loans market being shut
was to your FICC revenues?
<A - David A. Viniar>: I'm sorry. Which market?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Levered loans?
<A - David A. Viniar>: Oh. The levered loan market was not shut in the first quarter. I think it was – they're just –
while there wasn't that much activity because there wasn't that much deal activity, the market was actually pretty
aggressive so I actually think deals that were out there got done and got done pretty well. So I wouldn't call the market
shut at all. I think it's just really lack of activity, which goes back to lack of merger volume and lack of CEO confidence
more than the market not being receptive. The credit markets are actually quite strong.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And on equities, is there any way you could give some color on how derivatives
volumes held up in March and April? So what you've seen so far in April and how things are looking? I know it's early
but...
<A - David A. Viniar>: I actually don't have that. So we can get back to you on that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Okay.

And your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hey, David. I just want to circle back on something that came up a few quarters ago
regarding the potential for share gains, perhaps on share given up by some of the European banks. I seem to remember
that you were a little skeptical of the potential opportunities presented by forced European Bank deleveraging. Now
that some time has passed have any of the investment opportunities materialized as there was a general expectation in
the market we might see from the forced deleveraging of the European banks?
<A - David A. Viniar>: You mean from the ability to buy assets? Is that what you're talking about, Guy?
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Primarily, yeah.
<A - David A. Viniar>: Look, I think there's been some but not a lot. I would say we've seen some opportunities to
buy assets that we think it would be profitable to hold. We've seen some opportunities to buy that we think would be
very good to distribute to our franchise and we participated in some of that but I would call it some, but muted.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, thanks. That's very helpful.
<A - David A. Viniar>: You're welcome.
