Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern Chairman, President and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Leanne, and good afternoon. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2010 earnings
conference call. Today we will provide a comprehensive overview of the quarter and review with you the current
business environment as well as our capital plans.
I'm joined today by several members of our senior management team including: Don Seale, our Chief Marketing
Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; Jim Squires, our Chief Financial Officer; and Deb Butler, Chief
Information Officer; all of whom you'll hear from this afternoon.
Since we have an additional presentation this quarter, I'll keep my remarks brief to allow time for your questions. While
Norfolk Southern's fourth quarter results were not quite as strong as we might have anticipated, driven by factors that
we'll discuss on the call, they nonetheless were very strong on a year-over-year basis and capped a very strong year for
our company. In fact, 2010 was our second best year ever for earnings in post-Conrail operating ratio and it also
marked our highest ever free cash flow.
Even more importantly, the trends that we saw in the quarter in terms of service delivery, other than in the early winter
storms we experienced, along with the trends in terms of demand, give us cause to be optimistic about our prospects for
2011.
Looking at the numbers, bottom line net income of $402 million or $1.09 per share was up 31% compared with last
year. Income from railway operations of $642 million was up 17%, driven by a 14% increase in revenues and a 12%
increase in expenses. Income taxes included a $34 million favorable adjustment, which Jim will describe.
For the full year net income and earnings per share both increased 45% and our operating ratio improved 350 basis
points to 71.9%. As all of you know, lowering the operating ratio has always been and continues to be a primary goal
for us and we remain committed to and confident in further improvement.
Our top line exhibited strong growth with fourth quarter revenues up 14% and full year revenues up 19%. Don will talk
more about our traffic in a moment and provide you with insights into what we anticipate will be a solid 2011.
Before leaving the numbers I do want to say a word about safety, our most important metric. Mark and his team
redoubled their efforts even in the face of weather challenges and delivered the best employee safety ratio in the
company's history. This achievement is a testament to our people who continue to make the extra efforts to improve
safety even as we handled increased volumes and tackled some severe operating conditions.
Those severe operating conditions also had some impact during the quarter in terms of both revenue and expenses. And
as I said earlier, our overall metrics, particularly as they related to some of our bulk business, were not at the levels

where we or our customers expect them to be. Since then, our service levels have improved and we're continuing our
targeted hiring and bringing on new locomotives in anticipation of future growth. Mark will provide you with a report
on the service front.
Looking ahead to 2011, we expect to handle increased business and we plan to deploy over $2 billion into capital
improvements in order to invest in the franchise, to build for growth and to improve operating service and efficiency.
Deb will review with you the details of our capital plans.
In recognition of the 2010 results and their confidence in the strategic direction of our company, the board this morning
increased our quarterly dividend by $0.04 per share or 11%. We are also continuing the share repurchase program into
2011, as Jim will outline for you, another indication of our strong commitment to return value to our owners.
As you will see from the presentations, during 2010 we profitably grew the business, invested in the franchise,
generated significant levels of cash and produced attractive returns for our shareholders. We have every reason to
believe that 2011 will be an even stronger year for us, fueled by growth across our network.
With that, I'll turn it over to Don for a discussion of our revenues.
Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer
Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I'll recap our fourth quarter and year-end
2010 revenues, revenue per unit and volumes, along with the key drivers of these results. I'll then conclude my remarks
with our outlook for 2011.
Starting with our fourth quarter revenue, 9% higher volumes and a 4% increase in revenue per unit combined to
generate revenues of $2.4 billion, up $286 million or 14% over the fourth quarter of 2009. Approximately 65% or $190
million of our revenue gain in the quarter was driven by increased volume while continued growth in revenue per unit
contributed $96 million. During the quarter, harsh winter weather as mentioned by Wick, in the month of December in
particular reduced revenue by an estimated $14 million, mostly in our coal and merchandise traffic.
Turning to Slide 3 you will see the summary of our full-year's revenue which was our second highest year ever with
total revenue of $9.5 billion, up $1.5 billion or 19% over last year. Agricultural and chemicals traffic both achieved
record revenue for the year.
Looking at the components of our revenue growth, volume up 14% for the year, accounted for 70% of the
improvement, contributing $1.1 billion, while increased revenue per unit, up 5%, added $468 million. With respect to
yield, as shown on Slide 4, revenue per unit reached $1,400 for the quarter and $1,407 for the year, increases of 4% and
5% respectively. All business groups achieved year-over-year RPU gains for the quarter, and with the exception of
forest products, all business groups produced positive comparisons for the year. Market based pricing improvement and
increased fuel revenue drove the gains for both the quarter and the year.
As seen in the third quarter, negative mix moderated revenue per unit gains in our agricultural, chemicals, intermodal
and coal business segments. In this regard, agricultural's revenue per unit was impacted by increased shipments of
shorter haul grain and phosphate rock. Chemical revenue per unit growth was moderated by higher volumes of
industrial intermediates and shorter haul petroleum related traffic. Intermodal's RPU growth continued to be impacted
by increased empty revenue movements which were up 36% in the fourth quarter, accounting for 14% of total
Intermodal volume.
And coal RPU was moderated by three primary factors. First, we handled higher volumes of shorter haul utility coal to
our northern utilities in the face of heavier demand. Second, domestic net coal shipments to the river increased
substantially as steel producers ramped up demand for coking coal. And finally, we handled lower volumes of longer
haul, higher RPU export coal to Lambert's Point during the quarter which was down by 28% while shorter haul exports
over Baltimore increased by 10%.

Despite all these moving parts of revenue per unit for the quarter, I will point out that we continue to be very pleased
with core pricing gains that clearly exceeded the cost of rail inflation, both for the quarter and for the year.
Now transitioning to volume on Slide 5. Total shipments were up 9% for the fourth quarter and 14% for the year.
Agricultural related flows produced record volume for both the quarter and the year. In addition to agriculture, coal and
intermodal also achieved 52-week high loadings during the period. Project growth, conversions from the highway and
economic recovery were all primary drivers of this performance.
Now drilling down in more detail for our major business segments. Coal revenue of $685 million was up $105 million
or 18%. Volume of 395,000 units was up 12% due to the rise in demand for domestic and global steel and restocking at
power plants across our network. As depicted on the next slide domestic metallurgical coal volume led coal
comparisons, up 36%, which was triple the estimated 11% increase in domestic steel production as high quality met
coal on our system gained share in the marketplace. New business and stockpile rebuilding also added to this growth.
For the full year this was one of our leading growth markets with volume up 69% over last year. But even with this
strong growth our domestic met coal customers tell us that stockpiles at coking ovens remain at only 30% to 35% of
targeted levels, which bodes well for 2011 volumes ahead.
As shown on the next slide, our utility volume ramped up during the second half of 2010 as we had expected. Fourth
quarter carloads increased 16%, driven by inventory rebuilding after stockpile levels fell in the third quarter due to
strong summer demand and increased economic activity. Additionally, colder winter temperatures during the quarter
and in particular the month of December drove increased residential power demand higher as heating degree days
increased by 16% over December, 2009 and some 19% above the norm. Currently stockpiles from many NS served
power plants, including some of the larger base load units are significantly below the Eastern average level and are
reporting an average of 16 days of burn in inventory two weeks into the new year.
Now concluding my discussion of coal volume on Slide 9 you will see export shipments declined 18% in the quarter in
the face of 10-year high comps from the fourth quarter of 2009. Weaker volume was also driven by lower demand from
China in the quarter and a 5% increase in global steel demand, compared to an 18% increase one year ago. Now with
respect to ongoing flooding in Australian coal mines and related infrastructure it's been reported that the effected mines
produced 80% of Australian met coal exports and some 27% of thermal exports.
Metallurgical coal buyers are now seeking alternative supplies which will most likely result in increased flows over our
Pier 6 terminal at the Port of Norfolk. In this regard, we handled 15.6 million tons at this high capacity pier in 2010.
But we estimate that we could feasibly double that volume, assuming the proper convergence of coal availability and
demand in the marketplace.
Now transitioning to intermodal on Slide 10, intermodal revenue of $471 million was up $64 million or 16% over
fourth quarter 2009, mainly from increased volume and higher fuel revenue. A mid-year general rate increase and
customer specific price increases taken during the third quarter also supplemented the overall gain. Volume of 755,000
units grew 13%, led by a 22% gain in domestic volume. Conversions from the highway and economic recovery drove
the improvement in this segment.
Of our total domestic increase for the quarter, we estimate that 44% came from local business east of the Mississippi,
which was up 23%, with the remaining 56% from traditional interline business such as the transcon market which
increased by 20%. Our international volume was up 4% as import and export volumes continued to improve as
manufacturers worked to replenish inventories. And premium volume was up 14% as tighter truckload capacity
presented highway conversion opportunities. And finally, Triple Crown volume was up 4% based on increased
consumer products business.
I'll wrap up Intermodal with a brief recap of our results and ongoing activity with our corridor strategy. As summarized
in the box on Slide 11, we experienced robust growth along each major corridor for both the quarter and the year. And
we expect to realize increased flows in these lanes along with the Heartland and Mid-America corridors this year or
2011. In short, with new terminals and further speed and capacity enhancements planned along this extensive network,
we see very solid opportunities ahead as truckload capacity continues to tighten.

I'll conclude our business group review with our merchandise sector as depicted on Slide 12. Total merchandise
revenue of $1.2 billion was up $117 million or 10% over fourth quarter last year. Volume for the quarter was 559,000
carloads, up 3%. Metals and construction volume, up 16%, led merchandise growth for the quarter. Increased
shipments of miscellaneous construction materials, aggregates, steel products and scrap metal opportunities accounted
for 92% of this overall gain.
New business opportunities were significant drivers of growth in this group for both the quarter and the year. As shown
on Slide 13, construction material gains were driven by growth in shipments for natural gas drilling in the Marcellus
Shale region of Pennsylvania and New York. Total shipments in the quarter associated with natural gas production in
this region reached 6,700 carloads, up 160% over 2009. We continue to work closely with customers and short line
partners to move products in this region ranging from sand, waste water and tight to heavy duty drilling rigs and
drilling fluids.
With respect to further opportunities to expand our industry-leading position in transporting steel products, our four
first carloads from ThyssenKrupp's new facility at Calvert, Alabama, north of Mobile, were shipped on October 18.
When fully operational this facility, which is our largest industrial development project ever, will produce 4.3 million
metric tons of carbon steel annually. We expect to see significant volumes of new business from this mega facility as it
ramps up production. And further construction is also planned at this site with a second 72-inch cold rolling mill
scheduled to come onstream later this year, presenting further opportunities for business growth.
Turning to agriculture on Slide 15, record volumes and revenue were driven by fertilizer and corn shipments. Fertilizer
volumes were up 42% resulting from increased phosphate traffic. And corn volumes grew 14% driven by movements
to processing facilities and ethanol production sites.
Concluding with our remaining merchandise market segments on Slide 16, our chemicals volume increased by 9% in
the quarter, driven by higher shipments of petroleum, industrial intermediates, and plastics. Basic chemical production
continues to rise with the improving economy. Paper and forest products growth was driven by increased shipments of
pulpboard, newsprint, lumber and clay. These gains were slightly offset by a 25% decline in woodchip carloads due to
year-over-year weather-related factors.
Last of all, automotive's 20% volume decline was the result of the vehicle network modification that we implemented
last January that impacted volume by nearly 19,000 carloads in the fourth quarter. With the close of 2010, we've now
cleared this negative year-over-year comparison which will make for straightforward year-over-year comps in 2011
going forward.
Now looking prospectively, we see new business initiatives, economic recovery, and network improvements across our
system all converging to drive added growth opportunities for 2011. In chemicals we expect to experience solid growth
as the economy recovers and basic chemical production continues to ramp up. This growth however will be somewhat
tempered by difficult comps in the upcoming quarters due to the completion of the Tennessee Valley Authority fly ash
project on December 1, 2010, which generated 7,000 carloads per quarter in 2010.
In agriculture, following a record performance last year, we expect further growth across our network. Higher
shipments will be driven by continued build out of our ethanol network, increased fertilizer shipments and robust grain
movements.
In intermodal, domestic intermodal volume growth continues to be led by the ramp up of our corridor initiatives as I
mentioned earlier, along with highway conversions and new services. With respect to new services, we are pleased to
announce this afternoon that we've been selected as the primary eastern rail carrier for FedEx as it launches its new
intermodal service. FedEx will systematically use rail intermodal service for the first time in its nearly 40-year history
when it rolls out its revamped less-than-truckload operation next Monday. We are very excited about this developing
opportunity and look forward to a long and successful partnership with FedEx.
And looking ahead at the broader truckload market, some industry forecasters estimate truckload capacity will shrink
by 10% in 2011 and truckload pricing will increase by as much as 9%. This obviously bodes well for conversion and

yield improvement opportunities for both intermodal and carload services across our network.
In our remaining markets, international intermodal and export coal will benefit from growth in international trade. As I
mentioned earlier, coal in particular will most likely get a boost from Australian flood related demand for U.S. coals
over the first six months of the year if not beyond. And I will point out that we already had a robust outlook for export
coal in 2011 before this flooding occurred.
Domestic metallurgical coal will benefit from the forecasted 7% increase in domestic steel production and further
inventory restocking that I mentioned earlier. Utility coal volume growth will also be driven by new mines coming
online, lower utility stockpiles that will require increased replenishment rates and the ramp-up of the Tennessee Valley
Authority Kingston, Tennessee plant which was down most of 2010.
In automotive, automotive volume growth will be driven by the forecasted 14% gain in light vehicle production, which
will return automotive production to approximately 14 million vehicles for the year. And finally, paper and forest
products volume will continue to be negatively impacted by uncertainty in the housing sector over the year.
To summarize, we see a very solid set of opportunities ahead. We are well positioned to capitalize on market growth
across our network, and we look forward to working closely with all of our customers to fully realize that potential as
the year progresses. Thank you for your attention, and Mark will now provide an overview of our operations.
Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer
Okay. Thank you, Don, and good afternoon. We ended 2010 with the best safety ratio NS has ever had. That ratio is
estimated to be 0.89. Norfolk Southern's safety results during 2010 showed continuous improvement quarter-to-quarter
as our employees worked together to prevent injuries. Our fourth quarter ratio of 0.68 ended the year in a strong way
and is a great testament to the focus of our people and the safety process, particularly considering the unusual adverse
weather conditions we experienced in December. Much work is underway to support continuous improvement in our
safety process.
Turning to our operating performance we ended the fourth quarter with a composite service performance of 76.4%
versus 78.8% for the same period last year, a 2.4 point reduction. For the full year the composite performance was
76.7% versus 81%, a 4.3 point reduction. Our volumes outpaced our crew base during much of 2010 which impacted
performance. We began getting trained conductors in the fourth quarter and this is having an increasingly positive
effect.
Since the midpoint of the fourth quarter these additional conductors have been placed at key locations which is paving
the way for sustained improvement even in the face of significantly increasing volumes. And while severe weather in
December dampened the statistics, we have seen improved operations in the network through the quarter and into 2011.
Turning the page to train and engine employees. Our train and engine service employees increased 6% in the fourth
quarter from 10,582 to 11,212 as we saw the first of the newly hired conductors get promoted out of training. The next
slide indicates our actual T&E employment count by month from the beginning of 2010 through the end of the year and
then projected through the first six months of 2011. This is a count of productive T&E employees, net trainees and
taking into account projected attrition in the out months.
During 2010 we authorized hiring 1,929 conductors. During the fourth quarter, we put 248 of those people trained and
on the ground working. Keep in mind that these people were hired for locations in the most need and even small
numbers made a significant difference to the operation. The training pipeline is full and we have reached the point in
2011 where we are substantially exceeding attrition at an accelerating rate.
Turning to our productivity scorecard. In the fourth quarter carload volumes were up 9% while crew starts were up a
corresponding 5%. Total railroad employment was up 5%. Our efficiency metrics of gross ton miles per employee and
gross ton miles per train hour were up 4% and 1% respectively. Gross ton miles per gallon of diesel fuel were down
4%, driven by a decline in system average train speed, a December that was substantially colder than last year and the

addition of less fuel efficient leased locomotives. As you may recall, we added 42 new AC locomotives in the fourth
quarter, and with the additional 50 locomotives that we are now receiving we will have brought 92 new fuel-efficient
locomotives to the fleet by the end of April.
We've been aggressive in our hiring through 2010, getting our T&E workforce correctly sized for the volumes we are
forecasting in the coming year. We have the pump primed and the conductor ranks will be growing at a rate that's going
to handle our volume increases even with the ever-present attrition. Our locomotive fleet is correctly sized for the
business at hand as well. Consequently, we are looking forward to a strong performance in 2011.
I thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Jim.
James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial
Officer
Thank you, Mark. I will now review our financial results for the fourth quarter and bottom line results for the full year,
and I'll close with some observations about the year ahead.
Let's start with our operating results. As Don described, railway operating revenues for the quarter were $2.4 billion, up
$286 million or 14% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The next slide displays our total operating expenses
which increased by $193 million or 12% for the quarter. Income generated from railway operations was $642 million,
up 17%, reflecting the sizable increase in revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses. The resulting
operating ratio was 73.2%, a 1% improvement compared to 73.9% in the fourth quarter 2009.
Turning to our expenses, the next slide shows the major components of the $193 million net increase. Similar to third
quarter results, fuel and compensation and benefits expenses accounted for almost 70% of the variance. The next slide
reflects that two thirds of the fuel increase was due to higher prices with the balance due to consumption. As shown on
the next slide, our average diesel fuel price per gallon the last two years has generally trended upwards. The $2.46 price
per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 24% higher than the $1.98 price per gallon in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Next, compensation and benefits increased by $46 million or 8%. Looking at the major components of this increase on
the following slide, first higher employee activity levels due to increased volumes added $28 million, including about
half for train and engine employees. Second, medical benefits increased $19 million largely related to higher agreement
employee health and welfare premiums coupled with increased retiree medical costs. With respect to agreement
employees' health and welfare premium rates, we anticipate about $30 million of additional expense in 2011.
Pension expenses and payroll taxes each increased by $8 million and agreement wage rates were up $7 million. Partly
offsetting these increases, stock-based and incentive compensation decreased a total of $30 million which largely
reflects stronger performance metrics and improvements during fourth quarter 2009.
As highlighted next, materials and other expenses were up $37 million or 25%. The increase reflects volume related
maintenance increases as well as less favorable personal injury reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2010
compared to 2009. In 2011, we expect an annual increase of approximately $55 million for locomotive and freight car
materials. Purchased services and rents increased $29 million or 8% reflecting primarily volume-related operating
activities and equipment rents.
As illustrated in the comparison on the next slide, income before income taxes increased $95 million or 20% due to
higher operating income. Changes in non-operating items were inconsequential. Income taxes, displayed next,
remained flat year-over-year totaling $160 million with an effective tax rate of 28.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010
compared to 34.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The favorable comparison is due to a change in estimate for deferred
tax assets and liabilities resulting in a non-recurring income tax expense reduction of $34 million. For 2011, we expect
substantial cash benefits related to 100% bonus depreciation.
Net income and EPS comparisons are displayed on the next slide. Fourth quarter net income was $402 million; an
increase of $95 million or 31% compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.09, which was $0.27 per

share or 33% higher than last year.
Turning our focus to the full year, net income reached $1.5 billion compared to $1 billion in 2009 and diluted earnings
per share increased from $2.76 to $4 per share. Both results reflect 45% year-over-year increases and are second only
to our record 2008 results.
As shown on Slide 15, strong 2010 net income drove a 46% increase in cash from operations which easily covered $1.5
billion in capital spending and produced a record $1.2 billion in free cash flow. Out of free cash flow, we distributed
over $0.5 billion in dividends with the remainder sufficient to fund the majority of share repurchases totaling $863
million.
We expect 2011 cash from operations to cover $2.2 billion in capital spending, about which Deb Butler will say more
in a minute, dividends at the higher rate declared by our board this morning and significant share repurchases. We have
cash on hand to fund additional shareholder distributions as well and ready access to the debt market for refinancing of
maturing debt and incremental borrowing. Debt repayments in 2011 are $458 million and based on our current maturity
schedule, will decline from there over the next few years.
Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the program over to Deb.
Deb H. Butler, Executive Vice President, Planning and Chief Information
Officer
Thank you, Jim. As Wick mentioned, we are planning for a significant capital program in 2011.
Slide 2 depicts our baseline 2011 capital program which is budgeted to be $1.7 billion. This is 19% more than the total
for 2010 and as Jim noted includes investments so as to maintain the safety and quality of our existing franchise and to
support business growth in 2011 and beyond. Also included in this year's capital spending is $334 million to purchase
freight cars that have historically been leached, as well as $146 million for Positive Train Control, including upgrades
to systems and track structure that will be accelerated to support PTC implementation. I'll talk more about each of these
later but their inclusion will raise total planned 2011 capital expenditures to $2.2 billion.
As in prior years the bulk of our baseline spending is targeted towards strengthening the franchise. At 83% replacement
and core spending as a percent of the total is slightly higher than in prior years, which is largely due to the resumption
of our coal car replacement program. The growth portion of the budget, shown in red and totaling just under $300
million, is for track and terminal expansions and for projects to improve asset utilization, workforce productivity and
fuel efficiency.
As might be expected the largest percentage of our baseline spending is allocated to keeping our right of way in the
condition needed to move our customers' business safely and efficiently. Roadway spending in 2011 is budgeted to be
$763 million or 44% of the baseline budget. Our roadway budget funds the replacement of rail ties in Dallas as well as
the improvement or replacement of bridges and culverts.
On Slide 7 investments in facilities and terminals throughout our network will total $244 million or 14% of our planned
baseline capital expenditures. About half of the spending in this category is associated with investments in intermodal
facilities, including three new Crescent Corridor terminals in Tennessee, Alabama and Pennsylvania, each of which
also has a public funding component. In the industrial products area we are building bulk terminals to support new
business opportunities. And finally we're continuing our ongoing program to update our locomotive facilities.
As shown on Slide 9 locomotive spending will total $212 million or 12% of the baseline budget. This includes the
planned acquisition of 50 new locomotives as well as continued investment in alternative power programs. The
category also includes funds to rebuild existing locomotive and for the installation of emissions kits in order to meet
government requirements.

Baseline freight car acquisitions and improvements will total $155 million or 9% of our capital expenditures this year,
most of which is due to the planned purchase of 1,500 coal cars. Our current expectation is that we will continue the
coal car replacement program at this level or higher over the next several years.
Slide 12 shows that baseline investments in computers and technology are budgeted to be $96 million or 6% of the
capital budget. Our investments in technology enhance safety, improve operational efficiency and equipment utilization
and give us the tools to better plan and manage our network and processes.
These projects include the continued implementation of LEADER, a locomotive optimization system that improves
fuel efficiency and unified train control systems which automate dispatching and, through its RailEdge component,
increases network velocity. Also included in this category is funding to complete the implementation of SAP in our
financial, human resources and material management systems.
Investments in infrastructure are budgeted to be $79 million or 5% of baseline capital expenditures. In addition to
ongoing network improvement projects, as Don already mentioned, we'll continue to invest in our MidAmerica
Corridor initiative with Canadian National. The infrastructure category also includes investments in public private
partnerships such as the Chicago CREATE project and the Crescent Corridor initiative.
Before I turn to the two non-baseline capital investments, let me wrap up the baseline budget. With the addition of $194
million in other capital expense, our baseline capital budget totals $1.74 billion, a 19% increase over our 2010 budget.
This is consistent with the level of capital spending Norfolk Southern has historically maintained and aligns with our
previously announced plans to replace the bulk of our coal car fleet over the next several years.
Starting with Slide 16 I'd like to turn to an item that represents a bit of a shift from how we've financed freight cars in
the past. We plan to spend $334 million to replace leased equipment with owned equipment, reflected here in red.
These investments will serve our long-term base load grain and intermodal businesses. In other words, this is
equipment that supports our core business and that we expect to keep in service under any conceivable future business
models.
The decision to replace leased equipment produces a positive net present value, reflecting both the economic advantage
of purchasing over lease and the 2011 bonus tax depreciation. Because we currently lease this equipment, this portion
of the capital plan is, at its core, a financing decision. The cost of this equipment has been reflected in equipment rent
expense in previous years. Although there will be some offset in depreciation expense going forward, the net will be
modestly accretive to earnings.
I noted before that we will spend $146 million on the federally-mandated, although unfunded, Positive Train Control
project. During 2011 we will install on-board network devices on locomotives, invest in technology and upgrade
communications and signals. We expect the total cost of this initiative will exceed $1 billion before it's finally
implemented at the end of 2015.
To conclude, Norfolk Southern's 2011 capital program is focused on maintaining our core franchise, which includes
improving our right of way, complying with safety and governmental requirements and replacing equipment for our
base load business. We are also committed to the growth and productivity of our franchise and to maximizing
shareholder value by optimizing capital efficiency.
Thank you and I'll now turn the program back over to Wick.
Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Deb. Well, as you can see we continue to make significant core investments in our company commensurate
with our belief in Norfolk Southern's prospects for 2011 and beyond. As you also heard, we are always alert to
opportunities to look at changes in our current practices such as buying versus leasing equipment when such a change
can produce good returns for the long-term. Deb also talked about our PTC commitment for 2011 which leads me again
to reiterate that this is a project which will require enormous capital expenditures on the part of the entire industry for a

project which will produce marginal benefits at best.
Our hope is that we will continue to do what we are doing in 2011, that is make the necessary PTC expenditures
without sacrificing other investments. But that hope is clearly predicated upon our being allowed to earn an adequate
return to do so. While the possibility of adverse legislative changes in this new congress seem to have diminished we
do remain concerned about the regulatory front and we, with the rest of the industry, will be forcefully arguing that any
changes which diminish the possibilities of us continuing to earn an adequate return will have a very negative impact,
not only on our companies and industry, but upon jobs and the economy.
Let me close with the message I started with. As we look at 2011 we see the prospect for strong business growth in
almost every segment of our business and particularly in coal and intermodal. As you've heard from Mark we're now
through the long ramp up period of hiring and training and are quickly adding crew capacity in our most constrained
areas along with new locomotives. The result is both ongoing service improvement and additional capacity and we feel
very confident that we can handle the increased business which is coming our way.
It's also important for me to point out that when I talk about service improvement it's relative to an already very good
service performance that we have continued to provide for many of our customers, as evidenced by the FedEx business
that Don discussed. Don and his team remain focused on generating that business and generating that business at prices
which will reflect the full value of our services and will drive continued margin improvement. The bottom line is that
we expect a good 2011 and we will remain focused as we always have on continuing to drive improved performance
and superior shareholder returns.
Thanks and I'll now turn the program back over to the operator to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with
your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe if I could start on the cost side of the equation.
I think you guys highlighted nicely the potential for growth, particularly in the T&E head count side. I just want to get a
sense of what you think maybe a full-year type of growth run rate might be there? And then also alternately on the cost
per employee, how we can think about that line item as we go forward?
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, Chris, I think we
tried to highlight areas of spending including maintenance and health and welfare benefit premiums where we do
expect to see something greater than an inflationary run rate for the cost. Beyond that and a few other pockets, we're
looking at sort of steady inflation type increases across our cost structure. And that'll add up to something, something
somewhat greater than the overall inflation rate in the costs generally with the couple of super-inflationary and
significant items. But overall, we think most cost buckets will be roughly inflation type growth.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. And then I guess as far as the, when you think about kind of head count on a total
basis, thinking about enterprise-wide, just get a sense of what we can expect kind of net-net for the full year of 2011?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well I think – this is Wick. I think
you'll see head count rise in particular in T&E as Mark mentioned. We'll see a little bit more in I think our mechanical
areas. There are large pieces of railroad where our head count will just remain flat. T&E will rise to some extent
commensurate with volumes. But I would caution you there again, as we talked about many times before, that our
increase in T&E head count will have two components. One is trainees and that's a lot of the increase you have seen
already as we have ramped up our training programs. And the other is active people on the ground, and of course
they're compensated on a trip rate. So the growth in expenditures is not necessarily right in line with the numbers you
see, it'll be based on the productivity that we get out of those folks.

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful, and then I guess, maybe, how should I think about attrition? I think you
guys have highlighted something in the mid-single digit type of run rate. I just want to make sure I understand what
attrition should look like, at least in 2011.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes – I think that's – we've been
saying, 5%, 6%, in that range. I think we still anticipate a number – Mark, does that sound good to you?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yeah, that wouldn't be any
different going forward.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just one final one for Don if I could. On the core price side, I
just want to try to understand where that came out. I apologize if I missed it, if you got a little more specific on that, but
just want to kind of break out or understand that component relative to fuel and mix, I guess there was a couple of
negative mix aspects in the quarter as well.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Yeah, we had negative mix. I did
not break out the price per se, but in terms of our core price realized, the performance metric that we're tracking is
looking at the rate of rail inflation and exceeding that rate. And I stated in the remarks, Chris, that we're confident that
we cleared that hurdle for the quarter and the year.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay, and that's the forward run rate going forward, you would expect to continue to be able
to clear that hurdle?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Fair enough. Well, thanks very much for the time, guys. I'll let somebody else have at
it.

The next question is from Gary Chase with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Good afternoon, everybody.
<A>: Hi, Gary.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Don, wondered if I can bring you back to some of the commentary you made surrounding export
coal. You said you thought you could double the shipments off of Newport subject to coal availability and then there
was another factor. Just wondering if you could sort of speak to how we should think about the likelihood of you being
able to ramp up that additional 15 million tons.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Yes, Gary. As I pointed out, we
handled 15.6 million tons this past year. We are confident that Pier 6 has the capacity to essentially double that volume
should coal supply and coal demand in the marketplace converge where that type of tonnage is available to move. So
Pier 6 without a lot of ramp-up of manpower or resources, and we're confident we can do that, we can take it from 15.6
up to 30.
<Q - Gary Chase>: And do you have any sense, Don, of what the production, the supply side of that might look like?
Do you think it's feasible to get that much incremental tonnage?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: That's a great question and I think
that as world metallurgical coal prices continue to reflect the disruption in Australia, a wonderful thing tends to happen
when coal prices are high and more coal seems to be available. And I don't know if it would be 30 million tons, up
from 15, but we feel that there will be more coal available if the pricing is right.

<Q - Gary Chase>: Okay. And then, Jim, could I just ask you, is there going to be a material amount of – you
referenced cash credits from bonus depreciation? Because I thought I heard you say that cash from ops was going to
cover the 2.2 billion in CapEx, dividends, and some potential share repurchases. Could you just elaborate a little bit on
what those tax credits are?
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, yes, that is what I
said and a full year of 100% bonus depreciation should yield very substantial deferred taxes for the year and a
correspondingly large boost to operating cash flow.
<Q - Gary Chase>: And you think the cash from ops is going to cover all of those items: the CapEx, dividends, and
some potential additional distributions?
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes, that is our
expectation.

The next question is from Matt Troy with Susquehanna International Group. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Thanks. I'm just looking at you comparatively to some of your peers which have reported. It looks
like your incremental margins came in in the low 30% range, pretty close to corporate average versus some of your
peers, closer to 50%. I know you mentioned the weather but if you look at some of the head count you guys have
brought on, it looks like you're making a larger investment earlier. I was wondering if you could just help me
understand the thought process? Are we thinking about it right, that you're ramping up your head count and resources
ahead of a volume pickup expectation, and what your hurdle rates are and why it makes sense to do that now?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think you have identified
something we're thinking a lot about. We do anticipate, as Don has said, that we're going to have some very strong
markets this year. As Don also said, we were really probably a little bit behind the curve on head count with the volume
growth that we saw in 2009. So it's a combination of kind of catching up a little bit to that volume, which we feel we're
pretty close to, and then getting ready for some more volume that we think is coming our way. In terms of kind of the
margin impact on this, we very clearly, as we have said, expect to continue to improve our margins. But I think to
realize the maximum potential of our franchise, we'd rather be a little early occasionally in making sure that we have
enough resources, given what we've seen in the past year, than be a little late. So that's the way we're looking at the
world.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yeah. I understand. It's not a one-quarter gain. Second question would be, one, congrats on the
FedEx win, coupled with J.B. Hunt. Clearly some pretty bright folks are selecting you as an exclusive partner in the
East. I was just wondering if you could maybe flesh out a little bit some of the details of that agreement, what lanes you
might be serving or what kind of freight you'll be moving for them. I'm aware of their restructuring, but maybe just
some more details on how you won the contract, competitive bid process and the nature of the business you'll be
handling. Thanks, Wick.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yes, we handled, along with
others, handled test shipments in 2010 as FedEx started to actually put some freight out into the intermodal network to
see performance. And as I mentioned, we were fortunate enough to be able to win that review. And the business that
will start next Monday will be reflective of their restructuring of their LTL network. And we see that as a first step with
them. And we see it as a great opportunity. With respect to lanes, it will be pretty much through our southeastern and
northeastern network with points like Harrisburg, Pennsylvania being very heavy.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Got it. Thank you very much.

Our next question is from Jon Langenfeld with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jon Langenfeld>: Good afternoon. On the buy/lease side and that decision, how far does this carry forward? Is
this something you see for the next several years, or is it elevated this year simply because of the tax change? I know
you'd given us warning on this, but just kind of curious as you're thinking about it longer term.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think that this is clearly
something that we looked at this year in terms of some of the lease renewals that were coming our way, some very
significant lease renewals in our covered hopper fleet and also some projected growth and replacement issues on the
container side. We'll look at this every year. We'll be opportunistic if the opportunity arises. I certainly, this is not a
continuing program in any sense at all. But any time that we see the stars align, as we have this year, including the
accelerated depreciation, we'll try to take advantage of those where we see returns as we are with this that are in excess
of our cost-to-capital and accretion to our earnings.
<Q - Jon Langenfeld>: Yeah. That seems like a good use of capital. Okay. And then would you care to quantify at all,
I think you gave a revenue impact of the weather, any idea on the cost side with weather and fuel also creeping up in
the quarter?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We've worked through that. We
don't really have a very clear picture. We just know that it had some impact on the quarter in terms of things like
re-crews, in terms of fuel consumption both because our network velocity, as Mark said, slowed so much in December
and because unlike most winter weather we see, this weather as you will all remember really gripped our entire network
and was far more disruptive in the southeast than we ordinarily see during the winter. Other things that are hard to
quantify, we kept a lot more locomotives idling during the cold weather than we normally would at that time of year.
So it's difficult for us to get our hands around all the numbers but we know it had an impact.
<Q - Jon Langenfeld>: Yeah. Thanks for the perspective.
Operator
Our next question is from Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Good evening, gentlemen. Two quick questions, one on intermodal, one on some of your assets on
the Pocahontas Land Corporation. On the intermodal side you mentioned some of the repo costs. I'm assuming you
were just repositioning some of the 53-foot intermodal containers into the more profitable lanes. One, are you guys
caught up in terms of the 53-foot container demand? Do you have enough going forward?
And then two, on the intermodal side, I'm assuming the FedEx business is going to be all substitute line haul. How
should we look at modeling that in terms of the yield and the impact that it's going to have on your arc in intermodal?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Jason, with respect to the empty
revenue movements, those were empty container revenue movements that I spoke to in the quarter which were up 36%
or 14% of the total intermodal volume. That is a reflection of continued tight container demand when you see that level
of repositioning for loads. With respect to container availability I will tell you that it continues to be tight. We're
expecting additional container deliveries from China in 2011 that were delayed in 2010 because of capacity constraints
and other reasons. But we still see a tight domestic container...
<Q - Jason Seidl>: So, at least in the near term, we should expect continued sort of empty movements for your
intermodal business until maybe mid-year or so as you get some of those new containers on board?

<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: For the next two quarters, I would
say that's correct.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Okay. And in terms of the new FedEx business, how that's going to affect your average revenue per
carload?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, I can't speak to the yield
aspect of it, Jason, other than saying that it's good business for us and we're very pleased to partner with FedEx to gain
it.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Well, how about this, is it the average length of the haul that's already existing in the system, is it
shorter length to haul or is it a longer length to haul business? I would imagine it would be shorter.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: It should be average length of haul
because a lot of this business will be traversing lanes like Chicago, as I mentioned, to Harrisburg; lanes like that. So it
will not be shorter haul in nature than the average.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Okay. And just with respect to your Pocahontas Land Corporation, I know you guys don't spend
too much time talking about it. But I mean you own a bunch of assets on the coal side especially on the met coal side.
The met coal prices have been going up. Can you talk a little bit about what's owned at Pocahontas right now? And
also, do you guys have any access to some Marcellus Shale exposure in what Pocahontas owns?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: I'll take the last part of that, Jason,
first. We are not – we're not positioned with Pocahontas Land to have a great involvement with Marcellus Shale. Our
exposure there is as I spoke to in the call is more on the transportation of frac sand and drilling equipment and waste
water transportation and components. We see that ramping up very rapidly and we've got growth plans that are fairly
substantial for 2011 and beyond in that regard.
With respect to Pocahontas Land we have over 800,000 acres of coal properties. We have most of those coal properties
fully deployed with leases to coal operators. And, as you indicate or indicated in the question, we do have a substantial
inventory or book of high-quality metallurgical coal in that property. But we have leases in place with coal operators
for most of that acreage.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Now, are those leases, correct me if I'm wrong, are they on a – based on production on a revenue
split? Do you guys get a percentage of it, correct?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: We derive a royalty which does
have a sensitivity to prices in the marketplace.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: So, as met coal prices go up, we should see that below the line item number move up throughout
the year if they remain high?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: That is a correct assumption.
<Q - Jason Seidl>: Perfect. Gentlemen, I'll let somebody else have at it. I appreciate the time as always.

of capped at this year?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Scott, what I was addressing there
earlier was Pier 6 Lambert's Point in Norfolk, whether we could conceivably see demand and market and supply
converge to take that from say 15.6 million tons that we handled in 2010 up to 30 million which would be what we
could see doing without a substantial investment of additional resources like manpower to take the pier up to that level
of tonnage.
With respect to coal volumes, we don't really have a clear view at this point with respect to how much additional
tonnage could be produced. But I'll go back to the comment that I made earlier, with metallurgical coal prices rising
worldwide as a result of Australia's disruption, we think that more coal will be made available for the export market
and I think also we'll see more coal made available for the utility and domestic met markets as well, as pricing firms.
<Q - Scott Group>: Okay. So you don't see any mine production or mine capacity issues impacting your coal volumes
this year?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Not at this point. I mentioned that
we have some new production coming on line and I'm talking about the Illinois basin in that regard and some Central
App production as well. And then of course Northern App is very well positioned to continue to increase its share over
Baltimore as well as some shipments possibly to the Port of Norfolk as well.
<Q - Scott Group>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just to follow up on the new FedEx business. Don, did you
mention what the revenue number or the revenue amount you expect from that is? Can you give that if possible? And
then are you doing any test runs for FedEx on the ground or parcel side? And then last thing with the FedEx business, is
this all local East, or who's the Western rail partner if it's going transcon?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Scott, with respect to the latter part
of that question, I would defer to FedEx obviously to answer who the Western partner is. With respect to revenues and
volumes, that is also part of our confidential agreement with FedEx which we'll honor obviously.
<Q - Scott Group>: Okay. Thanks. And then just one last quick one if I can just for Wick. We have seen the first two
rate cases before the STB against you guys, in I think something like six or seven years. And one of them, to some
extent, is based on revenue adequacy. Just wondering what impact this is having on your pricing strategy going forward
on the coal side.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I would just say, obviously, we've
got a rate case. In one of those cases, as you know, there's been some additional litigation filed. I think we're better off
right now just not discussing what's going on in terms of how that's being handled. So I'll just pass on that question.
<Q - Scott Group>: Okay. Thanks for the time, guys.

The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good evening, everyone. Just curious, you did have a ramp in your
capital expenditure program, obviously. In looking at what's going on in Washington and some of the move away from
legislation over to regulation, is your capital spending plan reflecting a little bit more comfort on your side with regards
to the regulatory environment? And can you comment a little bit about, obviously there's some hearings coming up?
There's some movement toward fines as a new way by the STB to reign in some of the things that they're focusing on.
What's your overall view outside of just wanting less regulation here? What's your overall view on how that trend is
going right now and how that relates to your CapEx program?

<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, let me say this, if you look
at our CapEx program for 2010, we spent fairly close to $1.5 billion. If you look at our core program this year, it's $1.7
billion and you can really look at two or three things, obviously, some inflationary pressure in some of the materials
that we buy. Clearly last year we didn't buy coal cars. That's a core part of our business. We had been buying coal cars
in prior years. So I think you can look at the 1.7 and equate it to the 1.5 fairly easily.
And then the other items we've mentioned, PTC and these equipment purchases, drive the number higher. I would say
that our capital expenditure program for the past three or four years has been driven by our consistent belief that at the
end of the day there will not be actions which seriously, or really damage in any way our ability to earn an adequate
return. There is certainly a lot of attention, as you say, being focused on the regulatory side, on the STB, there's some
hearings scheduled.
As I said in my remarks, we and the rest of the industry and a lot of friends of the industry will go in and very
vigorously defend the fact that we have reached a point where if we are allowed to earn what I would call adequate,
although certainly in no way excessive returns, it's clear that the industry is determined to keep investing, keep growing
capacity and move forward. And I think we have a great case to make. I think we'll make it successfully. We're going to
continue to invest in the property with that belief. I will say, the minute we think that there is really going to be any
significant impact on our ability to earn an adequate return, we will go back and revisit our capital philosophy, almost
at once.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay, that makes sense. Second question here, just for Mark, just so I understand, you said
there was a catch-up? Is that how I understand your employee hire program, a catch-up in the fourth quarter based on
the ramp in 2010? And any incremental hiring will be in conjunction with the added growth that we're going to see, if
we do see it, in 2011? Do I have that right there?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Well, of course we began the
hiring process way back in the beginning of 2010, but we've got a comprehensive training program so it took a while
for these people to get marked up and out there and on the job. And we started to see the beginning of that in the fourth
quarter, and that is coming along nicely and that'll continue on through the balance of this year. And the rate at which
those people are coming out available, available in the workforce is commensurate with the volumes we've got coming
online and of course we've got attrition that takes place on a monthly basis. So we've pretty well caught up with that
attrition where we've gained ground on it and so we've got a nice run rate going forward, as far as being able to handle
the business going forward.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. I'm just trying to get a sense, when these people come on, is there going to be flex in
the system in 2011 for added growth? Or are these just coming on in 2011 just to sort of keep up with the current trends
that you've got? It sounds like you're matching it to have a little bit of flex.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Oh, there's absolutely flex. They're
coming on at an even flow and they will be throughout the year.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Yep.

The next question is from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Greene>: Hi, good afternoon. There's a lot of puts and takes here in the near term, but it sounds like – on
balance, the outlook for coal's pretty positive. But how do you think about investing and preparing for some of the
longer term regulatory hurdles on the horizon such as with utility coal? Some of the EPA regulations going into effect,
say like in the middle of this decade, how do you prep for that? How do you think about getting ready for that kind of
environment and what it could mean for your volumes?

<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Bill, that is a great question and I
will tell you that I think we all have obviously a very strong belief, based just purely on the facts, that there's going to
be a lot of coal burned to generate electricity for well into the future. I will say that we do have some advantage in our
capital program. If we should see something that quite frankly we don't now anticipate in terms of a change in demand,
particularly a demand rate that drops, we happen to be in the middle of a multi-year process to renew our coal fleet.
And so from a capital standpoint, we can moderate that capital, moderate the size of the fleet and accommodate any
changes that we see based on regulatory action. But I'll go back to reiterate what Don has said many times in the past,
we think we have a great coal franchise. We've got great ability to source coal from all of the major coalfields in this
country and we're very optimistic about coal for the future at Norfolk Southern.
<Q - William Greene>: Okay. And then you've made obviously a significant investment in the intermodal strategy and
you've had some wins here near-term. I realize you don't give specifics on pricing per se in say a segment like
intermodal, but we look that RPU and I realize some mix effect is in there. But how do you ensure, given all the
capacity you're adding that you're getting a decent pricing level with that capacity given the investment that's gone in
there? It's a pretty competitive market nonetheless. It just seems tough to think that the pricing can be sufficiently high
there? How do you make sure that works?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, Bill, we're tracking that very
closely. And in the fourth quarter our revenue per unit even with that 36% spike in the empty revenue moves increased
by 3%. And we took a third quarter general rate increase in that sector and as I mentioned, we see truckload capacity
continuing to tighten. And if the forecasters are right for 2011, with CSA 2011 and hours of service and the restrictions
being placed on truck drivers and fuel expense being higher, we think that there could definitely be a further
contraction in capacity, maybe as high as 10%. And if that 9% increase in truckload pricing is correct, and we think it
might be for 2011, that gives us additional leverage in terms of continuing to improve the yield of that business as we
build more volume which in turn generates a lower unit, per unit cost in the network. So we get leverage on the cost
going down and also leverage on yield going up.
<Q - William Greene>: Okay. Thank you for the time.

The next question is from Scott Flower with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Yes. Good afternoon, all.
<A>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Hi. Just a few things. I know that we've talked a lot export coal but I wanted to get some clarity or
some color from Don. Are you expecting, obviously price rising can obviously incent the mines, but with some of the
regulatory action in Appalachia, are you expecting more that maybe there's going to be more thermal crossover coal or
that you actually will get a supply response on the met side? I'm just trying to get a sense of, is it more that you're
thinking you'll pick up more thermal here as opposed to that much more met on the export markets?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Scott, the answer to that is both
and to your question on crossover, there's no doubt about that coals that are being marketed today is met coals. If you
go back 15 years ago it might have been just thermal coal and now they're competitive in met coal markets. So we are
seeing some of that take place. But when you look at the balanced sourcing equation that we have across our network
with our Northern App position or Central App position as well as Illinois basin, I think that we see an opportunity for
increased metallurgical coal to move to the domestic met market as well as export. We were up 27% for export for the
year and we had a 60% plus increase in domestic met coal, plus we have a 16% increase in utility coal in the fourth
quarter as the demand picked up. So that in itself tells us that we've got coal that can move to all three segments.

<Q - Scott Flower>: Okay. And then just maybe a couple for Jim. You talked about the casualty and the reserve
development and I didn't take from that that perhaps we're sort of running at sort of a run rate that makes sense unless
there are significant improvements on some of the safety ratios.
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, it's difficult to say,
the significant component of this being actuarial adjustments quarter by quarter. But we did have favorability in the PI
reserve adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2010 to the tune of $5 million, but that was significantly below the fourth
quarter of 2009's $29 million. So it was an overall $16 million negative swing in the PI reserve adjustments. And we've
seen a declining rate of favorability in PI reserve adjustments this year but it's difficult to know. There may be a little
bit more room to run on that but we're not expecting adjustments of the magnitude that we have seen.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Okay. And then one, and this is just maybe administrative, what was the amount of fuel surcharge
revenue in the fourth quarter?
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: It was $187 million. And
there was also a $29 million negative lag effect in the quarter.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Okay. And then one last one for, on the op side. I just wanted to get an update on how we are on
the roll out of RailEdge and LEADER and how many divisions we're across and how that's progressing in terms of
results versus what you initially may have thought from the implementation.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: It's coming along well. And we
anticipate we're going to add several more divisions this year to the roll out that's already out there. By the end of the
year we will have, we're forecast to have seven or eight divisions that will be online with that. And it's looked favorable
so far. We're pleased with what we see. We're estimating that we're getting somewhere in the neighborhood of a two to
four mile an hour increase with that, perhaps as much as a 10 to 20% improvement in velocity. And it's still early on.
It's still early on. But the employees that are working with this are dispatching forces, are working well with it and they
are encouraged by it. So stay tuned and we'll let you know how it progresses.
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: Scott, it's Jim. Let me
jump back in for a minute here. I misspoke a minute ago. The PI reserve adjustment 4Q '09 was $21 million, not $29
million. And the 4Q '10 reserve adjustment was five.
<Q - Scott Flower>: Got you. Great. Thanks, all.

The next question is from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Thanks. Good afternoon. Two questions. The first, as it relates to the head count and
hiring ahead of demand, is there some level of volume that you feel that you gave up in 2010 because you didn't have
enough conductors or you didn't have enough rolling stock?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We haven't really tried to quantify
it. I think it is probably safe to say that there was some demand out there that had we, in some markets, where if we had
had the ability to move it, we would have probably handled some more business.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Okay. But you haven't tried to quantify that?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: No.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: And then the second question has to do with the average revenue per car, your revenue per
unit, which if I back out some assumed level for fuel, it looks like a pretty thin increase. And I'm wondering how much
of an effect, I think what you had called project business, which is short haul business that maybe had a low price, is
that diluting the overall price in your network? Or how much of a negative effect is that having on your pricing overall?

<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Well, Chris, in terms of the mix,
we were up 4% in RPU for the quarter, 5% in RPU for the year. And, as I mentioned, we had a lot of changes with
respect to the length of haul across all of the businesses. And I'll give you a couple more examples of that, is in the
fourth quarter alone, we handled an increase of about 5,000 carloads of additional coke and iron ore traffic. It's good
business, and it's very profitable business for us. But it has a much lower RPU than the average coal RPU.
The same thing happens in our domestic intermodal market east of the Mississippi in shorter-haul lanes. We're picking
up business from truck. It's attractive business for us, but it is less RPU than the average RPU for intermodal overall.
So as you go down through the business, and you can see that type of negative mix, that's impacting RPU. With respect
to the price itself, we're measuring that outside of revenue per unit. We're measuring that internally with our own score
card. As I mentioned, we're pleased with the core pricing gains for the fourth quarter and for the year.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Okay. Is some of this short-haul traffic expected to roll off? Or is this going to stay with
you?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: As we continue to look at the truck
conversion opportunities in our eastern market, we foresee additional opportunities out there, not only in the intermodal
sector, but also in our carload sector. We have one movement of phosphate rock, for example, that moves from the
mine to the processing plant that's a grand total of 17 miles in distance. We have a coal move that's 16 miles round trip.
That was up over 2,000 cars in the fourth quarter. Those were profitable moves. They just have a very pronounced
impact on the average RPU. And we'll continue to see some of those opportunities and continue to secure those.
<Q - Christopher Ceraso>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks.

Your next question is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Thank you. If I could just follow up on that last question just for a quick sec on the coal moves.
You mentioned that some of the stuff moving to the river accelerated in the quarter. Is there something that was driving
that shift of business to shorten the hauls?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Ken, that was the domestic
metallurgical coal that I mentioned. And a lot of that flows to the river where it then moves to a Clairton, Pennsylvania
coke oven or the ultimate destination on the river where the coke ovens are operating. We're also blending coal in our
Wheelersburg river terminal, custom blends for metallurgical coal customers. And that increased, that business was up
36% in the fourth quarter. The driver of it is that while steel production was up 11% in the fourth quarter, our business
grew by 36% in the face of continued stockpiles that are not at target at those coke ovens.
And as I mentioned in the remarks we're being told by our coke customers that their stockpiles are somewhere 30% to
35% of target levels. So there's a lot of headroom left in terms of added demand to ramp that up as 2011 progresses.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: So we saw coal yields come down sequentially. Should we expect that to then continue into
2011?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: We will see continued growth in
our domestic metallurgical coal to the river and to those blending stations that involve the river but I will tell you that
we also will see increased activity in our utilities to the south. In the fourth quarter for example, Ken, we had about a
5% increase in our Northern utility business which is shorter haul and about a corresponding 5% decline in our – this is
for the year, excuse me, not for the quarter – 5% decline to the south. We expect that to diminish in 2011. We will see
more long-haul coal to the south as well as to the north but we'll see additional coal going to the export market which
carries a higher RPU. So higher utility RPU to the south and higher export coal expected with a higher RPU.

<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Thanks, Don. And then you mentioned earlier on the auto side the volumes were down. You had
the 19,000 network issue and you said it was all kind of cleaned up, yet I noticed that the volumes are still down to start
off this year. Is that kind of timing? Is that weather related? Should we see the autos pick up? Because it looks like the
production numbers out there are pretty sizeable.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: We've got a good increase in
production scheduled at the plants that we serve. I'll tell you that the first two weeks of January we had a major General
Motors plant, Roanoke, Indiana, down for retooling. That has now come back and we'll see shipments ramp up there.
We've also seen some holds on product by a couple of our manufacturers releasing new product, holding it until they're
ready to release it into the marketplace. So we've got some pent up demand that will help us recover from the first two
weeks of January.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Okay. And then just my last question. It's kind of been one that we've touched on through the day
here on the employee side. Wick, when, in deciding to go ahead and start hiring and making that longer term decision,
is there a tradeoff here of trying to get higher revenue based on keeping the network tight versus scaling the network a
little bit ahead of time here? How do you balance those two goals?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, we're always trying to avoid
being too early adding resources, but with the belief – and we've seen this before, that we're better off from a revenue
and profitability standpoint of being a touch early than a touch late. So as Mark mentioned, we – it's taken us a while to
get our training pipeline full. We're comfortable with that, it seems that it's coming online, a lot of these folks are going
to come online really much as demand continues to increase. So we think our timing is actually going to end up being
pretty good on that. It's something we watch very closely and something obviously that we can modulate in the hiring
process if we need to.
But you'll recall, I guess all of you will recall, that we along with all of the rail carriers, facing the kind of attrition that
we do, for four or five years in a row hired and trained significant numbers of T&E people. And as we see volumes
continue to rebound, we're going to be back in that business. We have to do that in order to keep up with attrition as
well as handle new business.
<Q - Ken Hoexter>: Great, thank you. Appreciate the time.

The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, good evening. The – let's see, you've been asked a bunch about export coal, but I
don't recall you commenting really on your view on what pricing might look like as of April 1. Don, can you give – do
you think it's realistic to think that you could get another $5 a ton or something of that magnitude given your pretty
constructive comments on the tightening export coal market?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Tom, I can't comment on what we
think we might get in April, April 1. We're looking at that, assessing it as we always do and we'll be working very
closely with our customers, both receivers and shippers of metallurgical coal as well as any thermal coal opportunities
in the export market. And we will be taking appropriate action that reflects the market.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Without being specific on whether it's $5, or $10 or $2, whatever it is, is it reasonable to
think that that price is going to go up materially?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Tom, I can't really address that at
this point. But we certainly are studying that intensively, I will tell you that.

<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. Fair enough. I guess a broader question, the results in fourth quarter came in at, were
frankly a bit disappointing in terms of incremental margin or however you want to look at it versus what I had in the
model and I think consensus and so forth. Some of that could be weather impact, some of it fuel and so forth.
And I'm just trying to get a sense of what you think may have been temporal impacts that you would quickly recover
from as you look to 2011. Or were our expectations just a little bit too aggressive? And maybe if you could frame that
in terms of incremental margin or pace of OR improvement or whatever, I'm just trying to, again, figure out what's
temporary and some temporary headwinds and what's really recalibrating the run rate in terms of margin.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I would, Tom, it's a good
question, obviously something we have talked a lot about. As we look at the fourth quarter, and as I mentioned, I think
in the beginning of my remarks, our results for the fourth quarter were not really what we might have anticipated either.
It is somewhat hard, I will tell you, to quantify everything that happened to us. But I will just leave it at this. We had a
December in particular that fell short of where we thought it would be.
That was coupled with some weather events that we know impacted a lot of folks but just seemed to really have a
significant impact on our network in terms of our ability to deliver coal to utilities and to Lambert's Point, and some, as
we talked about earlier, some significant impacts on the expense side, a lot of it in fuel with the network slowing, some
amount of it in labor in terms of re-crews, in terms of a lot of overtime to deal with a lot of locomotive problems that
resulted from the wintry weather.
And I will tell you, I think that what we have tried to tell you is that we are, another issue too, which you may have
picked up in your modeling, I don't know, is we had a fairly significant $29 million or so lag on the fuel surcharge. But
I will tell you that we think barring whatever Mother Nature does to us and we clearly saw another big storm move
through the Southeast the first week of January, we feel good about where our network is. We feel good about our
ability to meet what we think is a substantial amount of demand out there and we're confident, as we've all told you,
that this is going to be a good year for us. So as I say it's a fourth quarter where we quite frankly internally didn't see
what we thought we would see. We saw a lot of network issues which I think are temporal.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: I appreciate that. That's helpful. Do you think the network has bounced back at this point?
Or did the early January storm, is that still kind of holding you back from running the network a bit better?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Mark's going to tell you all about
that.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: No. Actually if you go back to
November, we started to get a nice bump in our velocity and that's been mitigated somewhat by the December weather.
But nevertheless our operation is coming along nicely and even with that Southeast storm that we took we are
completely recovered from that and we are running what I would say is well considering winter weather. We always
deal with winter, it comes every year, and we are running just as well as ever as far as that goes.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. Great. I appreciate the comments. Thank you.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Thanks, Tom.

Next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Anthony Gallo>: Thank you. Easy one first. What should we think of as the tax rate for 2011? And then my
second question is on the FedEx business, is that 100% direct? Or will you use any intermediaries? And is that
containers or trailers or both? Thank you.
<A - James A. Squires, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer>: I'll take the tax rate
question first. For 2011 we're assuming something along the lines of 35% effective rate plus – statutory rate – plus 3%

for state taxes, so call it 38%, something in the high 30s probably is a reasonable estimate.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: And with respect to the FedEx
question, it's a direct relationship with FedEx.
<Q - Anthony Gallo>: Great. Thank you. That's all I had. Thank you.

The next question is from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Thanks for taking my question. I know it's been a long call. I wanted to ask, along the lines
of some of the questions combining coal and the weather explanations that you've given, will there be any catch-up in
terms of the volumes in Q1 as we look at some of the coal volumes that maybe were missed because of weather in the
back half of the fourth quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: I will not quantify it, but the
answer is yes. And we're seeing some of that activity at Lambert's Point currently.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: So to take that, you're running above normal fourth quarter run rate in the beginning of this
year in Lambert's Point right now?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: Yes.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Okay. And you think that that's volume that's catch-up for Q4?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: It is volume that basically was
brought over from December into January to meet the supply chain requirement.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: How long do you think that will last for?
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: We see, as I mentioned, we see a
fairly robust outlook for export coal for all of 2011.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Right.
<A - Donald W. Seale, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer>: And that's Western Europe, Asia,
South America, Brazil in particular. So we have a good solid forecast for export coal in 2011. And we had that good
solid forecast before Australia flooded.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Great. That's helpful. You've talked a lot about labor and attrition, but just piggybacking on
that, when you think about these raised levels of training that you're doing ahead of what you expect to be volume
growth this year, when do you start to anniversary that heightened level of employees in the pipeline?
And then the next piece of that is, is there a volume threshold that you think about this year, I don't know how you want
to put it, either GDP growth or just car load growth, where we would have to ramp up again in terms of the pipeline of
employees that you have in order to feel like you've got a sufficient amount of labor to cover the growth in your
network?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: You're going to continue, I think
in regard to your first question, we have a training pipeline, as I mentioned before, that's full. We're going to, based
upon what we see right now in terms of attrition, as well as some volume growth, right now our plan is to keep it full.
We're estimating, we hired, as I think Mark said, 1,900 some odd conductor trainees in 2010. Right now we're
projecting about 1,500 trainee hires in 2011.

I will say that as Mark has said, part of this process of bringing folks on has really been a little catch-up to handle the
volumes that were out there in 2010 more expeditiously, more efficiently. We'll be at that level fairly soon if we're not
there already. I think that we're going to add some more employees, but we've still got, in terms of the capacity of our
network, once we get our employee base up this year, we're going to have I think, still a lot of incremental capacity
without making substantial increases beyond this year.
We'll be in a position where we can handle a significant amount more traffic, and we want to do that because as I said
earlier, when we look at T&E employment in particular, the most important thing to remember is that those folks are
basically paid based upon the amount of work that they do. A higher head count, we'll pay some benefits for them
obviously, but with a higher head count what you'll see is what actually we saw a couple of years ago, which is we'll
have a number of people out there, all of whom will start making a little less. So the impact on expenses is not
proportional in terms of the T&E head count we add, it'll be much more impacted by the amount of work they do.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Is the read through there though that train length growth is limited in the near term and that
we're going to start to see train starts pick up materially on a relative basis to volumes?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: No, not at all. We've still got – we
have plenty of capacity out there and to the extent we're talking about the general merchandise business, our average
train length is such that we have got, we have got room to grow for the most part on existing trains. And to the extent
that we get additional coal business, that tends to be unit train business and that's great profitable business and we're
glad to crew those up, so...
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Can you quantify percent growth that you think you have in the different types of trains that
you're running?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Only to say that we are still
nowhere near the 2006 levels that we've enjoyed in the past and we've got a lot of room to grow in order to reach those
levels. So there's a significant ways to go.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Great. And one last one, with the FedEx business is there any CapEx associated with that?
And I think Anthony had asked if it was containers or trailers, and I don't know if you guys gave an answer to that.
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: No. There is no direct CapEx. It's
part of our corridor strategy and the investments that we're making so it's leveraging those investments that are already
in place to deliver service that supports the FedEx business. And with respect to the second question, it will be trailers
initially.
<Q - Justin Yagerman>: Great, appreciate the time, guys. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Jeff Kaufmann with Sterne, Agee, Leach. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufmann>: Hey, guys. Thanks. Most everything has been asked but just a quick detail question. Jim or
Deborah, once you make the conversion from lease to own, what changes? Let's say we go beyond '11 and look at
2012. How much would I expect to see equipment rents drop and depreciation increase as a result of the $340 million
that you're spending?
<A - Deb H. Butler, Executive Vice President, Planning and Chief Information Officer>: I don't have the exact
numbers but as I noted earlier we will see a reduction in the equipment rents, offset by a small increase in depreciation
expense. But as we noted earlier it is accretive to earnings so it does produce a positive net present value for us.

<Q - Jeffrey Kaufmann>: Well, right. Depreciation's longer lived so equipment rents for about $81 million. I'm just
trying to get a sense for perspective. I mean could this be a $20 million decline, or -?
<A - Deb H. Butler, Executive Vice President, Planning and Chief Information Officer>: No. No. No. It's smaller
than that because the $81 million in equipment rents includes the car hire portion as well as equipment lease expense
and the equipment lease expenses is less than a third, I think, of the total equipment rents.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufmann>: Okay. And one quick one for Mark and Don if I can. I mean you've been very clear about
the 36% increase in empty intermodals. One of the things I was surprised at is your gross ton miles per employee up
just under 4%, RTMs per employee up 6.5%. How much of that is explained by the intermodal empties or was there
something else going on? I mean you mentioned the hiring so I get that, I get the people coming online. But I'm trying
to just get a sense for what else might be different in your quarter than other people and whether it's short-term or just a
structural issue.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: I think obviously when you see
the gross ton miles not grow in quite the same way as revenue miles that's obviously some mix effect as we talked
about. We saw a lot more continued growth fourth quarter in intermodal where we did not see it in coal. I think that's
the primary driver of that impact. That's a good question because that disparity is a little wider than we usually see it
but I just think we had an unusual quarter in terms of the balance of those two businesses.
<Q - Jeffrey Kaufmann>: Okay. Everybody, thank you.
<A>: Thanks.

Our last question is from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the call. During the period, you moved about 9% greater volume
using just 5% greater crew starts. Given train length constraints, I would expect this gap must eventually close
somewhat. Can you share some insight as to the timing of this sort of convergence?
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I think as Mark said, you
have to think about crew starts in terms of the kind of business you're handling. In our merchandise network, we have a
lot of capacity left in terms of train length. And we feel there's substantial volume in the merchandise loads that we can
add without really much impact at all in terms of crew starts. On the flip side of that, when you look at coal, that comes
to us in bulk. It comes to us primarily in unit trains.
And when we start to add volume in coal we tend to add crews commensurately. So it's hard to say. On the
merchandise side, I would tell you I think we have a lot of room left on the merchandise side in terms of train
productivity and crew productivity.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: You mentioned train length, and of course some longer length of haul railroads really
have said the benefits of building a longer train lengths, particularly through relatively uninhabited terrain. But broadly,
how important is this to Norfolk Southern at this point? And what progress has been made?
<A - Mark D. Manion, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer>: Our average train length right
now, I think, I'm not looking at a figure, but I think we're in the neighborhood of 4,600 feet on the average for general
merchandise trains. So, obviously, there is a lot of room to grow on the average. So we're looking forward to filling
those out as the year goes on.
<A - Charles W. Moorman, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer>: We have seen the average train
length go up this year as we've seen business additions. And that's been a big driver in the productivity stats that we've
shown you all year. But as Mark says, and I'll reiterate again, I think in terms of the merchandise fleet, we look at train
length all the time. It's one of the key metrics we design our operating plan around to make sure we're running adequate
