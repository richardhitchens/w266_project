businesses. We will be using the quarterly earnings review document to discuss our results.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Andy. And good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on what I know is a very busy day for you all.
For the quarter, we generated net income of $505 million and earnings per share of $0.42, which compares to $0.54 in
the fourth quarter of last year. I should note that the fourth quarter of 2011 included a restructuring charge related to our
efficiency initiatives and some other items that Todd will cover in just a minute.
Obviously, it was a tough revenue quarter, as our results reflected the ongoing macro environment challenges. The
general uncertainty in the financial markets resulted in lower-than-normal levels of client activity. Now, a good
indicator of that is the combined share volume on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, which was down 6%
year over year and 18% sequentially. That clearly has an impact on areas like our investment services fee revenues.
Investors have been very risk-averse. We saw a lack of organic growth as our clients reallocated their assets in a more
defensive posture, significantly to cash, in response to uncertainty in the markets.
Money market fund managers, including our own, have been particularly conservative. They've shortened durations
and reduced European exposure, which resulted in lower yields and even higher money market fee fund waivers.
Now, despite those challenges, we were pleased with what we were able to accomplish in terms of winning new
business, strengthening our balance sheet, controlling expenses, and positioning our company for 2012.
We are continuing to win new business. In asset management, we had positive long-term flows in every quarter in
2011. And in the fourth quarter, we had another strong quarter in terms of new assets under custody wins.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen in terms of liquidity, asset quality, and capital. On the liquidity front, deposit
levels grew significantly. For example, non-interest-bearing deposits were up 93% year over year. Asset quality
improved as our sub-investment-grade securities declined 11% due to paydowns and some opportunistic selling.
And on the capital front, we generated almost $570 million of Tier 1 common and are ahead of where we expected to
be in terms of Basel III Tier 1 common ratio. And excluding the restructuring charge, we delivered a very strong 20%
return on that increased level of equity capital.
Now, we did slow down our buyback program a bit in the fourth quarter to make sure we met our capital targets. But
we are looking to resume our program this quarter.
Now, most of our core investment services metrics continued to look good, especially in clearing, but they were
severely impacted by volumes. And in investment management, we're encouraged by our continued strong long-term
investment performance and positive flow.
On the expense front, we made meaningful progress in containing expense growth and bringing down our run rate as
we have begun to realize the benefits of the efficiency initiatives we discussed at our Investor Day. Excluding the
restructuring charge, total expenses were down 3% sequentially and down 2% year over year. And that's ahead of
where we expected to be at this particular point.
Now, those efficiency initiatives are still in their early days, so we have substantial benefits to come, but we're off to a
strong start in terms of adjusting our cost base to manage through the current environment.
Now, I should also note that we closed a deal to sell our Shareowner Services business. We were able to get a good
price for the business, and it takes goodwill intangibles off our balance sheet and positions us to improve our profit
margin going forward.

So lots of meaningful progress during the quarter. And while the revenue environment was tough, we believe the lower
level of client activity to be a short-term issue. Our fee revenue should recover quickly as we return to normal levels of
activity. In the meantime, we're controlling our expense base to offset market weakness. We're investing in areas that
will generate organic revenue growth, we're putting our deposits to work, and we remain very focused on returning
capital to shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd to go through the numbers.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As I take you through the numbers, my comments will follow the
quarterly earnings review beginning on Page 2.
Earnings for the quarter were $0.42. As Gerald noted, that included a restructuring charge of $107 million or
approximately $0.06, and that was related to our efficiency efforts. And there was about $0.02 of charges related to a
higher provision and higher M&I expenses.
Our results included the impact of lower volumes, as Gerald mentioned, generally reflecting the uncertainty in the
financial markets. And we saw that especially late in the quarter. Combined share volume on the exchanges was down
meaningfully; year over year, key international markets were down substantially; and the U.S. indices were flat. And
more specifically to our results, we were impacted by the new seasonality that we experienced in our Depositary
Receipts business. So in this environment, our success is really based on our ability to reduce the growth rate of
operating expenses, and we made some pretty good progress, as Gerald had noted.
Now let's look at the highlights on a year-over-year basis. Total revenue was $3.5 billion; that's down 6%. Investment
services fees were down 8%, and that's primarily due to the lower DR revenue. But it also was impacted by lower
volumes and higher money market fee waivers. As you'll recall, the seasonal spike in corporate actions in our DR
business that normally occur in the fourth quarter now occur in the third quarter. If you adjust for that seasonal impact,
investment services fees decreased 3%.
Investment management and performance fees were down 9%. That, too, was driven by higher money market fee
waivers, lower performance fees, and weaker international equity markets that were partially offset by net new
business. Net interest revenue here was a bright spot. It was up 8%. And that largely reflects the additional client
deposits and the growth in secured lending, as well as our securities portfolio. The provision was $23 million, and it
primarily resulted from the default of a broker-dealer customer. Our noninterest expense increased just 1%, and it was
down 2% if we exclude the restructuring charges and M&I expenses, and 3% on that same basis for the linked quarter.
Turning to Page 4, where we call out some business metrics that'll help explain our underlying performance. You can
see that assets under management was up 8% year over year to $1.26 trillion. We had long-term inflows of $16 billion
in the fourth quarter, and so we've had positive long-term flows in every quarter of 2011. Long-term inflows have
benefited from the strength in the fixed income and equity index products. Short-term inflows for the quarter was about
$7 billion. Assets under custody was flat sequentially, but it's up 3% year over year, to a total of $25.8 trillion. Most of
that was driven by net new business.
Now, most of the metrics that you see here showed solid growth on a year-over-year basis. Loans and deposits continue
to grow. DR programs are up modestly, and clearing and broker-dealer services metrics are up substantially. However,
each of our investment services businesses was impact by the sharp decline in volumes in the quarter, though the
underlying fundamentals of our business remain pretty strong, and that positions us well for any rebound in the capital
markets. Asset servicing fees were down 3% year over year and 4% sequentially. Both decreases reflect lower volumes,
a shift in client asset allocations, and determination of client relationships from recent acquisitions that we made. And
these terminations result from the fact that clients don't meet our risk profile. That was partially offset by the impact of
net new business. We had a very strong new business quarter, with $431 billion in new AUC wins, all of which we
would expect to be converted by the end of the second quarter of this year.

Issuer services fees were down 30% year over year and 35% sequentially. And again, that's due to the seasonally lower
DR revenues. If you adjust for that seasonality, fees were basically flat sequentially. Clearing fees were flat year over
year, as new business was offset by lower volumes and then higher fee waivers. They were down 6% sequentially,
reflecting the lower trading volumes and, again, the higher linked-quarter money market fee waivers. Investment
management and performance fees were down 9% year over year and flat sequentially. Sequentially, investment
management fees were flat as net new business and higher performance fees were offset by lower revenue and equity
investments and higher money market fee waivers.
Now, you've heard me mention the money market fee waivers several times now. Let me now aggregate the impact
across our company. For the quarter, money market fee waivers were a $0.06 drag on our EPS, and that compares to
3% last year and $0.05 in the third quarter. The revenue impact was nearly $65 million for the year-over-year quarter.
In FX and other trading, revenue was down year over year, but it was up sequentially. Looking at the components, FX
revenue totaled $183 million. That's a decrease of 11% year over year and 17% sequentially. Both decreases reflected
lower volumes. The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by higher volatility, while sequentially volatility
actually decreased. Other trading revenue was $45 million. That compares to $52 million last year and a loss of $21
million in the third quarter. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by a lower credit valuation adjustment.
Now, some of you have may seen that yesterday we reached a partial settlement in the FX lawsuit that was brought by
the U.S. Attorney's Office. The settlement resolves disclosure claims that related to FX marketing. We are pleased with
the settlement, but you should be aware that no financial agreement is related to it, and it does not effect any claims for
monetary damages. And importantly, it also does not admit to any wrongdoing on our part. As we've said in the past,
we will continue to be alert to opportunities for pragmatic resolutions. However, we remain convinced that our legal
defenses continue to be rock solid.
Now, turning to investment and other income, it totaled $146 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. That compares with
$80 million in the prior year and $83 million in the third quarter. The increases over both periods primarily resulted
from a pre-tax gain of $98 million on the sale of Shareowner Services, and that was partially offset by a $30 million
write-down of an equity investment. Now, I'd like to point out that the $98 million pre-tax gain on the sale of
Shareowner Services translated into only a $4 million after-tax gain, due to the non-tax-deductible goodwill that was
associated with the business.
Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, NIR was up $60 million versus the year-ago quarter, and it was up 5%
sequentially. Both increases reflect growth in client deposits, which drove the increase in cash at central banks.
Average non-interest-bearing client deposits increased $3 billion or 4% versus the third quarter. The year-over-year
increase also reflects increased investment in high-grade securities and growth in our secured lending program. The net
interest margin was 1.27%. That compares to 1.54% a year ago, and the decrease was driven by just the increased
deposit base.
Turning to Page 9, you can see that year-over-year total non-interest expense, excluding the restructuring charges and
M&I expenses, declined 2%, and that's reflecting lower staff expense, which was partially offset by higher litigation
expense. If you exclude the impact of litigation, expenses actually declined 3%. The sequential decrease primarily
resulted from lower staff expense, reflecting lower incentives, as well as a decline in head count, and lower litigation
expense and lower volume-driven expense. All of that was partially offset by higher professional, legal, and other
purchased services, which was primarily consulting; software and equipment; and business development expenses. The
increase in software and equipment was due to increased license fees and some new software that we brought online.
As you can see, the $107 million in restructuring charges was comprised of $78 million for severance costs, and there
was $29 million of lease write-offs and consulting expenses.
Page 10 details our capital ratios. As Gerald noted, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio was up 60 basis
points to 7.1% at quarter end. That's a little ahead of what our previous guidance was. A little less than half of the
improvement was driven by the reduction in goodwill and intangible assets, as well as the risk-weighted assets related
to our sale of Shareowner Services business. Paydowns in sales of investment securities accounted for most of the
remaining benefit from the reduction in risk-weighted assets, and the other contribution was obviously the retention of

earnings. We continue to expect to generate about 20 to 25 basis points a quarter in Basel III Tier 1 common, and that
includes the impact of buybacks and dividends.
We're fortunate that our business model enables us to rapidly generate capital, and it does not require significant growth
in risk-weighted assets. Both of these attributes position us very well to comply with all the Basel III requirements well
ahead of the phase-in periods. Our Basel Tier 1 common equity ratio was 13.4% at year-end. That's up 90 basis points
from the end of September, driven primarily by earnings retention and the sale of Shareowner Services, as we
generated approximately $570 million of Basel I equity in the fourth quarter. Part of the growth resulted from the
decision to slow our buybacks in the quarter to strengthen our leverage ratio. Now that we have done that, we're well
positioned to continue buying back shares in the fourth quarter – excuse me, in the first quarter – under our existing
program.
On Page 11, you can see that our investment securities portfolio continues to perform well. The watch list actually
declined 15%, and the sub-investment-grade RMBS securities were down about 11%. And those were down, driven by
sales – excuse me, by paydowns – but we did do some opportunistic sales as well. The pre-tax net unrealized gain in
our securities portfolio decreased modestly to $793 million.
Looking at our loan portfolio, you'll see that the provision for credit losses was $23 million. That compares with a
credit of $22 million in the prior and year-ago quarters, and the increase provision was primarily the result of the
bankruptcy of a broker-dealer that I earlier mentioned. NPAs actually declined in the quarter from $344 million to $341
million. The effective tax rate of 30.6%, that was negatively impacted by the non-deductible goodwill associated with
the sale of Shareowner Services, but most of that was offset by a more favorable mix of foreign and domestic income.
Now, looking ahead, NII should be steady. Fee waivers may not get better, but they should have troughed. Of course, I
think I mentioned that on multiple earlier calls, that I thought that they'd troughed. But at this point, there's not much
left to waive. The quarterly provision should be in the range of 0 to $15 million. We're focused on driving down
expenses through our operational excellence initiatives. As we've outlined at our Investor Day, our initiatives are
projected to drive net savings of $240 million to $260 million this year, and we've made some pretty good early
progress. Assuming regulatory approval, we plan on a combined dividend and share buyback ratio of 60% to 65% for
2012. As always, the timing of our share buybacks will be based on prevailing market conditions. The significant
growth in our capital positions us well for the stress test that we, by the way, we just recently submitted to our
regulators. And finally, the tax rate in the first quarter should continue to be approximately 30%.
With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.

Thanks, Todd, and I think we can open it up for questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Glen Schorr with Nomura.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Hi there. How are you?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Good morning. So timing sometimes gets in the way here, but just think it's a little interesting,
assets under management up 5% quarter on quarter, fees are flat. Assets under custody, flat quarter on quarter, fees are
down, whether you want to include the seasonality in DR or not. Is there a little function of timing there? Is – there's a
little money market in there. But is the mix of business changing such that the relationship between the assets and the
fees don't match as much as they did in the past?

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, why don't I start on that and then ask Todd and maybe Curtis or Tim to jump in. I
think we saw, one, client activity on the volumes decline. Two, the shift into risk-off mode, so assets went into cash –
or, frankly, they went into deposits, and so you don't get an asset under custody fee if it's in a bank deposit. The same
would hold true in the asset management side. So I think we just saw, as the year-end approached last year, a complete
risk-off mode, so a decline in volumes, a movement to cash, more risk-averse, which doesn't allow for fee activity
either in investment services or investment management area. We do think that that's short-lived. Investors do have to
invest. They do have to get a return, and I just think we saw a very soft fourth quarter that we don't expect to continue
for the long term. But I don't know if – Curtis, maybe you want to comment on the investment management side.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah, absolutely. From an investment management perspective, the growth in AUM has
absolutely come in fixed income and, as Todd mentioned, equity index products, so lower-fee products generally.
We've actually held our own pretty well in equity flows, where the industry had a pretty tough year generally. So we're
happy about that. I think that what you're seeing in fees is really the impact of two things. And, Glenn, to your point, it
is a bit of a timing dynamic around performance fees. We had a very strong quarter in the fourth quarter of 2010. We
had a pretty good quarter this quarter. Just not as strong. And then fee waivers have definitely had a very significant
impact, as Todd mentioned. So money market fee waivers and lower performance fees are causing an offset to nice
business, new business growth.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, let me add a little bit to that, Glenn, and then maybe Tim wants to add something as
well. One of the things that you don't see is, in the fee side, is as money moves out of money market funds, we are
seeing it come onto our balance sheet. And that's why we've seen some of the growth in net interest revenue. It's not as
meaningful as it would have been in the fee side in this very low-interest-rate environment, but that's masking some of
the moves. So there is some modest offset – not as much as we would like – just in the growth of the balance sheet due
to that risk-off trade. I don't know if, Tim, if you have anything to add.
<A - Timothy Keaney>: No, Todd, the only last point maybe I'd make is, Glenn, that we only converted about $165
billion for the quarter in new business, so on a relative basis, as you look backwards, that was one of our lower
quarters. The good news is of the $1.2 trillion that we won, we still have yet to convert about $530 billion.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Does that $530 billion include what you just announced as new business wins in the fourth
quarter? Is that your won-but-not-yet-converted pipeline?
<A - Timothy Keaney>: Exactly, and I think as Gerald mentioned in his opening comments, we see a lot of that
converting by the second quarter.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: That's perfect. One last one. Just curious on your thoughts – your comments on the partial
settlement. Maybe we could – you mentioned the no money component. What's next? In other words, what does the
settlement represent with the AG? Is the [ph] principle in (24:28) how you conduct business going forward? And then
the – it's up to individual clients to go about suits if that's how they want to proceed?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, just to clarify, Glenn, the settlement was with the U.S. Attorney, not the AG.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Apologize, yep.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And so it was primarily around our marketing materials, and so we were happy to get that
behind us. As far as the AG suits, that continues to progress. There's not much to add on that, other than we think our
legal defenses are very strong.
<Q - Glenn Schorr>: Okay, so that's something that might just have a much longer tail. Okay. I very much appreciate
it. Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Thanks, Glenn.

Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: You're protecting and growing spread income really well. Was just hoping you could provide
a bit more color with the deposit flows during the quarter, given all that's going on in macro environment. We can see a
bunch of the puts and takes with the non-interest-bearing and the interest-bearing deposits, but was just hoping you
could elaborate a bit there.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. A lot of that tends to be – in our client base, there's a core amount, and then there's
some kind of what I would call episodic amounts. And we did see, especially at quarter end, we saw a spike when we
saw it once again. We actually saw negative repo rates at quarter end. So the core custody and trust deposits are seeing
pretty continuous growth. And then from hedge funds and even in some in instances broker-dealers, we're seeing some
spikes. Those spikes have mostly worn off now in the first quarter, and we're continuing at what I would call the – what
has become the new kind of core deposit base, which continues to show some modest growth.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks, Todd. And at the Investor Day, you outlined some actions focused on
stabilizing the NIM. Could you just update us on where we stand on those initiatives, and is it still feasible to kind of
think about stabilization, given the rate environment's deteriorated a bit?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, I think it is, because we are putting – as Gerald mentioned, we're putting more and
more of the cash to work. So if we – say we move $20 billion out of the central banks where we're earning 25 basis
points and we can put them into securities or secured loans at 100 to 150 basis points, that can offset even the
lower-rate environment pretty rapidly. So we feel okay that we can stabilize. It's going to be hard to grow the NIM in
this kind of an environment. Actually, what would grow the NIM the most is if deposits were to come off a little bit and
just normalize.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: That makes sense. Thanks, Todd. And then finally for me, you touched on money market fee
waivers, but was just hoping you could update us on your thoughts on when and what you expect to hear from the SEC
on broader money market reform and how you're scenario planning for all of that. Thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: You want – maybe, Curtis, you want -
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Curtis, why don't you take that one?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Sure. So we're expecting over the next two or three months for the SEC to come out with
some proposals. Again, they've gone in the direction of either moving to a floating NAB or to having some capital
buffers put in place. There are other things that are suggested, redemption fees and some other things, that have been
proposed. We then think it'll take 60 to 90 days of comment period, and then it will go back to the SEC for sort of final
– any final rule changes, sort of toward the second half of the year.
Obviously, we're spending a lot of time thinking about where it might go, impact on clients, where the money might go
if there are significant changes to the industry. We do think that we may capture some of the shift in flows in other
places. And we also think that the impact is going to be felt by clients, so we're having a lot of dialogue with them
about how to manage their flows, as you imagine.
The point that has been made – Todd made a minute ago – though, is I would tell you that the fee waiver dynamic is
quite large already, and so if there were a really negative impact, it has already been felt in lower yields. And so today I
think that our 2a-7 business is only about 4% of total investment management pre-tax. So it has already – the yield
environment has already had a pretty significant impact on us.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Thanks for all the thoughts.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to touch base on the comment, Todd, you made earlier
about termination of certain client agreements and client arrangements, I guess, that are falling below your risk profile.
Could you, I guess, elaborate on that a little bit further and maybe give us a sense as you go through this sort of client
review how many more do you think you could have, and what kind of impact that could have on your revenues?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Sure. I think that we've worked our way through that, is the good news. So I don't
think we'll see any additional impact. And we have some very high standards around documentation and
anti-money-laundering and so forth. And so if our clients aren't going to meet those standards, we won't accept them as
clients. And that's what that was related to, and we did bump out a handful of clients, and we felt it in the – mostly in
the fourth quarter. And now that's built into our run rate, and we're building back off of that.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got you. So this had really nothing to do with the pricing and the margining on those
clients not being in line with what sort of you're targeting for the business?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, that's right.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: No.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: This was not pricing. This was not pricing related. It was risk related.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. And, Alex, they were mostly – small alternative managers or small broker-dealers that
came to us by way of the GIS acquisition.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got you. Okay. And then maybe a minute on capital priorities. So you pointed out that you
guys were thinking you'll be a little bit below 7%, but then you felt like you probably needed to get to 7% by the end of
the year, and the buybacks sort of slowed down here a little bit.
Do you think that either there's a few people out there that, I guess, that want to get to higher capital levels sooner?
How do you think about the pace of your capital build over the course of 2012 versus buybacks?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. We actually – we feel pretty good about it. We were a little – we actually did a little
better in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. A couple of things went on there. We got some meaningful paydowns,
and we were a little more opportunistic against some sales of our sub-investment-grade securities. So that added to the
benefit of Shareowner Services. And then we had – we thought there was going to be a bit of an OCI adjustment that
didn't take place.
Let me make one thing a little bit clearer here, though. We were pretty tight on our leverage ratio with the substantial
increase. And we had a 93% increase, and that was just in the free deposits. But we also had a substantial increase in
the rest of our deposits. We wanted to go ahead and build that ratio up a bit during the quarter as well. So we got the
benefit of having a little pop in our Basel III Tier 1. But that's not what we were actually looking for.
So now that we've shorn that up, we can go back. We're comfortably in the 60% to 65%, what I'll call capital
deployment range, between payouts, between buybacks, and dividend increases. And we're also positioned to restart or
complete the program that we announced last year for 2011. The regulators do give you the – or they don't object to
you as long as we ask for it, and we did – they don't object that we continue to proceed against that program in the first
quarter, and that's what we intend to do.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got you. And then just the last one from me. Just looking at the balance sheet and the shift
in earning assets this quarter, it feels like there's a decent amount that came out of the interest-bearing deposits with
banks, primarily I guess foreign banks. Is that just reflective of the risk appetite that you guys try to manage to, given

what's going on in Europe, or there's something else going on? Because, obviously, there's a big bump at the Fed, and
some of that came out of the, I guess, foreign banks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think we've been defensive on a risk position as well. We don't need to leave as
much short-term cash in the European banks. We're just leaving it in a handful of what we think are the strongest in the
right regions. And that ended up building up a little bit in the central banks, which we intend to put back to work, as we
described earlier.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Mr. Usdin, please check your mute button.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Oh, sorry about that. Good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more
color on the issuer services results and then the outlook, given the closing of the Shareholder Services, just to get us an
understanding of what we should expect going forward. I mean, it seemed like a month ago you were talking about a
decline, certainly, from the pull-forward. So I'm just wondering if you'd kind of – sorry for the long question. Can you
give us kind of the total? What was the real pull-forward in issuer, in DRs? How did corporate trust act? And then
remind us of what goes away with Shareholder so we can understand how – the first quarter starting point, it looks like.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Ken. Let's have Todd take the last part of your question. Then we'll ask Karen to
comment about the core business.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Kind of the way we'd look at it, Ken, the pull-forward from the corporate actions from the
third and fourth quarter, what we did is we just averaged the revenues in the two quarters, and we kind of compared
that to averaging the revenues in the two quarters in 2010. But if you average those in the third and fourth quarter, our
issuer services fees were flat sequentially. That kind of gives you, I think, a good basis, and they are down about 6% on
a year-over-year basis, and I think Karen can give some more color on that.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: For issuer service in the aggregate.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And we're talking specifically about issuer services.
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Right. And, Ken, you know, I'm sure, that global debt issuance was down about 7% year on
year, and so the difference in corporate trust actually was issuance related and deal related, but also money market fees
in that category as well. And then the Shareowner Services business was pretty soft right before we sold it, as would be
understandable. So the DR business continues to be pretty strong, and with that seasonality against the corporate
actions happening now going forward into third quarter versus the fourth quarter. That's a change that you'll see stick
for the future.
But the business itself, pipeline is pretty good. A very large win in Brazil that'll be public soon, and a pretty strong
pipeline otherwise. And we expect both DRs and corporate trust to be kind of in the 3% to 5% range of revenue growth
next year.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: On a year-over-year basis?
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Yes.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And then – so can you just remind us again – so the first quarter versus this fourth quarter
number, just trying to understand the trajectory. So you said the run rate when it was announced, Computershare had
put out that it was about a, what, $280 million, $290 million revenue run rate. But, Karen, to your point that that was
weaker, should we presume that the run rate that comes out was lower than that?
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Yes, yes. The run rate was lower kind of toward the end.

Page 10 of 16
Obviously, we announced the deal in April. And as soon as you announce a deal like that, as you can imagine, new
business pretty much dries up. Existing clients, we did lose a couple of clients before the sale. And I think that's all just
understandable, based on that news coming out in the marketplace.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: So the run rate is somewhere lower than the $70 million. Was it meaningfully different? I'm just
trying to get an – understand the moving parts between the change in the DR seasonality and then the moving parts of
that line going forward.
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: Yeah, it wasn't meaningfully different. And from a pre-tax perspective, that's a very
low-margin business. So it really didn't have any impact on the pre-tax.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, Ken. I don't think you'll see any impact on pre-tax earnings. You will see a bit of a
reduction in the issuer services fee line, obviously, probably in – I'd call it – the run rate in the past couple years has
been somewhere around $200 million.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. My second question, just regarding expenses, which look really good and obviously
started to show the benefits. Can you talk us through just the decline in compensation that happened this quarter? How
much of that is related to the beginning of the saves – the prior expense-save employee reductions that had already been
announced, versus what may have been a – either a compensation true-up or an adjustment to the actual revenues?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Ken. Couple of things. One, we did see, as we expected, a decline in our head count of
about 900 people in the fourth quarter. So that obviously has some impact on the running rate on the compensation
side.
Obviously, our earnings were off, and so that lowers compensations. And so the combination of the two, plus our
initiatives, starts to put in place a lower run rate in both of those categories.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And my last, final thing just on the capital front. Again, you mentioned that you had
slowed the buyback this quarter. In advance of getting the CCAR results, can you use the remainder of the authorized
buyback in 1Q? And do you imagine that you will, or will you just be trying to continue to kind of build, so to speak,
build capital faster until you get those results?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. Ken, we are allowed to continue the program that was approved, or the Fed did not
object to last year. And we plan to resume our buyback in the first quarter this year.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Ken, let me add one thing there. In a payout of 60% to 65%, that puts us in a retention
every quarter, on average, of about 25 basis points increase in our Basel III Tier 1 common. We think that's a pretty
rapid retention rate, and there's no need for us – we are now at 7.1%. So if we do that for the year, we're at 8.1% at the
end of the year. We think that puts us well ahead of where we need to be to meet our ultimate targets.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks for that, Todd.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay, thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Hi. Good morning. It's Rob Rutschow. One question on the commercial loan growth. This
quarter was pretty decent. Are you guys seeing any shift out of capital markets and onto your balance sheet?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. The loan growth for us is principally in secured loans to our financial institution
clients, and it was really putting some of our excess deposits and cash to work for those clients, rather than traditional
loan growth that you would experience at other commercial banks.

<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Okay. And a follow-up on the deposits. You mentioned that some of the excess deposits
have come off so far this year. Can you give us any sort of numbers or give us a sense for how much they're down so
far?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Rob. Probably on average about $10 billion.
<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Okay. Couple housekeeping items. The 900 in head count reduction, how much of that was
related to the Shareholder (sic) [Shareowner] (40:35) Services sale?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: None.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: None.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: None of that.
<A - Karen B. Peetz>: It was December 31.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, that was December 31, so that's not in those numbers.
<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Okay. And then a second question. I think you guys had around $80 million in litigation
costs last quarter. Can you give us a similar number for this quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, for obvious reasons, Rob, we don't disclose actual litigation reserves. There's no
reason to give anybody an advantage there. But they were down somewhat from what we had experienced in the third
quarter, and they were up pretty meaningfully from what we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.
<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good morning. I was curious about the deterioration in the waivers on the money market
accounts. What was the deterioration between third and fourth quarter? Why did it end up hurting another penny?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Was his question why, or – it did hurt by another penny. And the reason was that the
yields in the money market funds continued to decline. I mean, Curtis, you'd probably give some more -
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah. The drop to the third quarter actually was the steepest drop. The first and second were
not terrible. The third was bad, and fourth was just a little bit worse than that. So kind of a full quarterly impact of the
decline.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And the way to think about it is all the money market funds, including our own, went to
more cash reserves, less European exposure. That brings the yield down. Whatever securities were already on, the yield
has come down.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Right.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: So with less yield available to the investor, that's where the higher money market fee waivers
come in.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Exactly.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And as we've said a number of times, we think we've been at the trough, but there sure isn't
much left. And we shouldn't kid ourselves. The money market fee waivers across our firm are quite significant, and we
are looking at other alternatives on how to offset that.

Page 12 of 16
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then on the capital front, you talked about the leverage ratio being the constraint. In
other words, it wasn't the Tier 1 common ratios you were really concerned about or trying to improve. Have you looked
at – is that the ratio we should be looking at more for the trust banks relative to the other ratios?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, I don't think so, Marty. I think this was – it was kind of an unusual circumstance, as
we saw the very sharp spike – not in risk-weighted assets, but just in the balance sheet with the deposit growth in the
third and also in the fourth quarter.
Now that we have built that ratio up during the quarter, and the fact that it will grow on a quarterly basis as we retain
35%, we don't see it any longer as a constraint.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And do you see the impact in Basel I to Basel III in the sense of how your assets can
change even in the leverage ratio, due to some off-balance-sheet consolidation, being trading accounts or positions and
derivatives and things like that. Is that something as well that we should be kind of thinking about? Is that it or a haircut
you would take on that ratio as well?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Right. Actually, the constraint will be the Basel III Tier 1 common. So that's going to be
the ratio, I think, that you're going to really want to focus on.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay. And-
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I guess we don't see leverage as a problem.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Okay, and the last question is the 60% to 65%, have you given any thought in a sense of
distribution between [ph] what you would think (44:08) dividends versus share repurchase, and how do you look at that
going forward?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. I mean, we – with our share price below book value, we certainly like buying our
shares. So we probably will lean to – consistent with what we've said in the past.
Right now, we'd look for a 20% to 25% dividend payout, and we'll make up the difference in share buybacks.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Marty.

Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi, good morning, folks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. A question for Tim Keaney. Tim, could you talk a little bit about your initiative to reprice
the core asset servicing business? Basically how that's going in terms of conversations with clients, whether you're
seeing any attrition yet, and to what extent? I guess if you can talk about it between different types of businesses, the
middle office versus the [ph] core of custody (45:10) business?
<A - Timothy Keaney>: Yeah, Brian. I'd say it's still very early days, and I think as we talked about in the Investor
Day, we're starting with the smaller clients. And we've got about 1,000 clients we're working our way through on the
smaller end. So it's probably still too early to give a full report out to you, but I'm somewhat encouraged by what we've
seen.
Certainly as we reprice current clients, we're doing that with the new economic reality, so we're rebidding our business
with minimum target profit margins and not being overly dependent on capital markets related revenue. So I think that's
probably the best way to answer your question.

And when we win new business, and we have been successful with that $431 billion that we did in the last quarter,
we're doing that with our new pricing disciplines in mind.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Right, right. So the new business is coming on with a more appropriate pricing treatment. Does
part of that new business to be converted include Bridgewater?
<A - Timothy Keaney>: It does, yep. We'll be converting Bridgewater over the next three quarters.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay. And if you had to sort of say when you think you'll start to see sort of a material
recalibration of revenues and expenses in this business, do you think it's more later this year, or more over a couple of
years?
<A - Timothy Keaney>: Yeah. Brian, it's a cycle. Some of our clients are on three-year contracts. A small number of
our clients are on four- and five-year. And I just think it's going to take patience and discipline and work through that
cycle, and that's exactly what we're doing.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Yeah, great. Okay. And a question for Curtis. In the investment management business, on the
performance side, can you talk a little bit about where you think performance fees are levered to in term of the equity
markets and fixed income markets, and sort of how your performance sort of dovetails with that?
And I guess what I'm looking for is, are new mandates coming on that are structured with large performance fee
components within the mix, just so we can sort of get a sense going forward of how we might model that?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah, we have an array of investment products that have performance fees that are linked to
benchmarks, either benchmarks or to absolute return goals. And so it's hard to say if equity markets are up, the
performance fees are going to be up.
And they are correlated, as you would guess. We have some fixed-income products as well that have performance fees.
But, again, they're really geared more to the benchmark, so they aren't the absolute level of markets. Really, it's a wide
array of products that drive performance fees, so it's hard to correlate it to anything specific.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay. And then just to – flipping to foreign exchange trading. Can you talk a little bit about –
obviously, volatility and volumes were a weak factor for everybody this quarter, but can you talk about the mix of
standing instruction within the total core foreign exchange trading?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Brian. Let me pass that to Art Certosimo, who runs all of our global markets activities
now.
<A - Arthur Certosimo>: Yeah, hi Brian. We're starting to see more volume through our negotiated channels as the
FX market becomes more competitive, and we continue to develop products for our clients that should offset that with
our ability to capture more volume.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay. And what is the standing instruction mix overall? Is it still close to 40%, or it is down
significantly?
<A - Arthur Certosimo>: It's about 42%.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay, and then just lastly, what was net interest revenue discount accretion for the quarter, in
terms of a dollar amount?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think it was [ph] $94 million (49:04), Brian. It was down slightly but not much.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay, great. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Stilmar with SunTrust.
<Q - John Wolfe Stilmar>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Wolfe Stilmar>: Good morning. Real quickly, the move from 39% international revenue composition to
34% – clearly de-risking and currency can have a pretty profound impact. But is there anything more that we should be
thinking about, aside from just specific concentrations in Europe more rapidly de-risking than other parts of the world?
Or is there another sort of business trend that might be underneath that move? Or is that just kind of the result of the
couple themes that we've talked about earlier?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. The simple answer is the vast majority of the quarter-to-quarter decline in the
percentage was depositary receipts. Depositary receipts, or non-U.S.-sourced revenues, with the change in the
seasonality, and the significant swing in it. And you saw the decline in non-U.S.-sourced revenues. So we think when
you normalize all that, there might have been a percent or so decline, but not much.
<Q - John Wolfe Stilmar>: Okay, perfect. And then really quickly, just wondering if we can dig in a little bit more in
terms of fee waivers. And one of the discussions that was brought up earlier is it was potential offsets to fee waivers as
you're thinking about product structure in the future. Can you go into a little bit more detail about what some of those
product structures are, and how enthusiastic you are for being able to recapture those fee waivers, absent any macro
movement in the rates?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. Let me start on the servicing side, and then, Curtis, maybe you can think about it a
little bit on the investment management. The servicing side, we provide a lot of administrative services for clients to
sweep their cash through us, either onto our balance sheet, into various liquidity options, or various money market
funds. And so we may have to find a different way to structure those administrative services that we provide that have
traditionally come through distribution fees. So that's one of the things we're working on. Pershing's a great example
where they're trying to take some initiatives on their platforms, but it is a bit of a conundrum because the yields on the
investments are so low. How much can you keep hitting the client for no return? So it is something we're looking at.
We're trying to find structural ways and other ways to deal with it. And on investment management, Curtis?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah, no, I would say – listen, clients – there are an array of clients that use money market
funds for various reason. Generally, they want to have tremendous liquidity and get the best yield that they can. If the
rules actually change on making a floating-rate NAV or with capital buffers make it a difficult product, we think that
clients are going to look for alternatives. And we've had conversations with them about everything from ultra-short
duration fixed-income products that would be the highest-quality assets and try and maintain as much liquidity as
possible. Floating-rate funds obviously are potentially interesting to them, because of the more stable net asset values
that could be had, but not necessarily completely fixed as they are today. And clients, again, depending on how they
use them – how they use money market funds – have different levels of interest in each of them.
But we think that if the changes do occur and everyone has to step back and think about what they're really going to do
in a new environment, that people will have to shift to these products. And of course, Todd talked about our deposits.
Banks are clearly going to see some of the flows go to deposits, and we think we've seen some of that. So it's good to
have the ability to offer both.
<Q - John Wolfe Stilmar>: And in terms of the -
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: John, if I could, maybe Brian Shea could comment a little bit about what Pershing's trying to
do.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: I would just build on Curtis' comments, that the retail investors are starting to shift some
of their cash management sweep to FDIC-insured bank deposit sweeps, and we have a growing array of cash
management sweep vehicles from traditional money market funds to FDIC-insured bank deposit sweeps. And we have

a growing array of cash management sweep options, including FDIC options. So while we had cash management
growth on our platform of about 9% to 10% year over year, we had 34% growth in FDIC-insured sweep, which is
where customers – investors – are seeking slightly higher yields and the protection of FDIC as well. So I think what
we're working on is trying to create more capacity, not only internally but with other banks, and working with
Promontory Financial and others to get that accomplished. Hopefully, we'll see more growth in the future.

Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: I just wanted to ask how client flows and activity have been more recently. I know you gave
the information for the full quarter, but in the middle of December we had [ph] El Tiro (54:00) in Europe, and first
couple of weeks of this year – I know it's only two and a half weeks in. But just wanted to get a sense, too, of how
client activity inflows have been kind of latter half of 4Q and into the beginning of this quarter?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, certainly the last part of the fourth quarter was very slow. It started off the year a bit
slow as well. We're hopeful that once we get through earnings season and investors start realizing they have to put
money to work for yields, we'll see normal client activity. But we did start off the year a bit slow.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And that's consistent across geographies?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our final question today is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: A question, Todd, on the sale of the sub-investment-grade securities. What is the total now of
the old [ph] grand third trusts (55:05) in sub-investment grade, about?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It's a little over $3 billion – it's right about $3 billion, is the book value that we have on
them.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Is there any expectation for sales this year of any of those securities?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We don't feel the urgent need to sell any of them. If we see that there is a decent bid or we
don't like the particular risk profile of any security, we've offered it, and if gets taken, that's fine. If it doesn't, we'll live
with it, is pretty much the position that we've taken. We've actually seen an improved bid in the – so far in the month of
January. But at this point, we really haven't done anything.

<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Okay. You mentioned that one of the real positives to the net interest margin expanding would
be if the deposits started to shrink. Is there any evidence that your customers are taking deposits off the balance sheet,
or just the opposite, are they continuing to put them on?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, there's – I would say that the – what I had mentioned, Gerard, there are some spikes
that we see from some individual clients that might leave a significant amount of cash because of some kind of a
transaction or something that they were doing. So that tends to – that has fallen off. The underlying, what I'd call the
core component of it, has been pretty stable, just showing modest growth over the last three quarters. We saw the big
spike back in June, and then it's been growing modestly thereafter.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: And then when we look at your loans outstanding, you had a nice increase in the margin loans,
I believe, in the quarter. Was that existing customers taking on more loans, or new customers? Where did the good
growth come in that area?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: This is Brian Shea. It's primarily driven by growth in the prime brokerage business,
Pershing's Prime Services group, and also somewhat by our traditional – the growth of our broker-dealer business. But
I would say – I'd give a little more credit to the prime group as we're growing momentum in that business.
<Q - Gerard Cassidy>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Brian.
