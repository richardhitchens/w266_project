Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon everyone. It's my pleasure to welcome all of you to our second quarter 2011
earnings conference call. With me today are several members of our senior management team, including Don Seale,
our Chief Marketing Officer; Mark Manion, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Squires, our Chief Financial Officer,
all of whom you'll hear from this afternoon.
I am very happy to report that building on last quarter's momentum, we produced another record-breaking quarter. All
time highs for any quarter were achieved in net income and earnings per share. The quarter did include the impact of
non-recurring income tax benefits totaling $63 million or $0.18 per share. But even without this benefit, net income and
earnings per share were all time highs. We also achieved record highs for any second quarter in revenues, operating
ratio and income from operations.
These results were driven by significant growth in revenues of 18%. Volumes rose 4% led by double-digit growth in
Intermodal and automotive. Revenue per unit rose 14% led by both pricing and mix in our coal franchise. And Don will
provide you with the revenue and traffic details in a few minutes.
Against the backdrop of these increased volumes, we saw a significant sequential improvement in our service
composite measure, the second quarter composite of 76.5%, representing nearly 450 basis-point improvement from the
first quarter. And we're continuing to build on our operating improvement in the third quarter. Mark will give you all of
the operations details a little later.
The record operating results and resulting strong free cash flow enabled us to continue to invest in the company while
at the same time returning cash to our shareholders. This morning, we announced a $0.03 per share increase in our
quarterly dividend, which when combined with the $0.04 added in January, represents a 2011 dividend per share
increase of 19%.
In addition, during the second quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for a total of $449 million. This brings our
year-to-date shares repurchased to $11.6 million and has reduced our outstanding share count to just under $348
million, and Jim will provide you with more details of our balanced cash deployment in a few minutes as well.
With our year-over-year volume – while our year-over-year volume increase in the second quarter was somewhat lower
than the first, most of the economic forecasters are predicting an improving second half and we are moving forward
with initiatives to drive business growth, as well as increased productivity and efficiency in our operations. We strongly
believe that a robust capital program of reinvestment in the business, coupled with strong returns to our owners, will
continue to drive superior returns in the months and years to come.
I'll now turn the program over to Don and then Mark and then Jim and I'll return and wrap up with some closing
comments before we take your questions. Don?

Thank you, Wick, and good afternoon to everyone. During the second quarter, we saw continued recovery in economic
activity, favorable global trade, and stronger manufacturing output. These favorable trends, coupled with ongoing new
business development, produced our second highest revenue quarter ever.
Revenue reached $2.87 billion, up $436 million or 18% over the second quarter of 2010 with yield improvement across
all business groups, and volume growth in Intermodal, automotive, and coal. Approximately 78% or $341 million of
the revenue gained in the quarter was driven by higher revenue per unit, including increased fuel surcharge revenue and
pricing gains. The remaining $95 million was the result of increased volume, which was up 4% or 67,000 loads.
With respect to yield, we achieved our highest revenue per unit ever reaching $1,604 per unit, up $191 or 14%
compared to second quarter last year. Improved pricing based on market demand and tighter transportation capacity
across all modes combined with higher fuel surcharge revenue drove this record performance.
For the quarter, we set new RPU levels in agriculture, metals and construction, chemicals, paper, automotive and coal.
Coal RPU had the largest gain on a percentage basis of 26% or $452 per unit driven mostly by increased export coal
and longer haul utility business to the Southeast.
In our industrial carload sector, higher pricing in fuel surcharges resulted in higher RPU in each of the business groups
led by chemicals, up 18% or $569 per unit. Automotive RPU was impacted by a 30% increase in lower revenue per
unit bi-level traffic in the quarter as tri-level loads was off 4% due primarily to the disruption in the Japanese supply
chain and associated production declines at both Toyota and Honda.
With respect to pricing, the market environment for continued pricing gains is solid and with improvement in price,
we're in turn making the necessary investments to drive higher capacity and service levels ahead for all of our
customers. We remain committed to this market-based value proposition across all of our business.
Now let's turn to our volume performance. Volume performance in the second quarter is shown on slide four. Total
shipments of 1.79 million were up 67,000 units or 4% over second quarter last year. This was our highest quarterly
volume since the third quarter of 2008, just prior to the recession. These favorable results were driven by economic and
project growth with overall gains in Intermodal, Automotive and Coal which more than offset declines in Industrial
products. And during the quarter, we saw our Intermodal volume reach a 52-week high loading in mid-June as well as a
new 52-week high in the Metals group for the week-ending April 30.
Transitioning to our major business sectors as shown on slide five, Coal revenue of $893 million was up $197 million
or 28% over second quarter 2010 and was our highest revenue quarter ever. Volume of 403,000 loads improved by
over 8,000 units or 2%, driven by increased global demand and changes in coal sourcing, as well as increased
shipments to Southern utilities. These gains more than offset volume weakness to Northern utilities and a 7% decline in
domestic metallurgical coal volume due to reduced coal availability as a result of strong export demand.
We expect domestic met coal to remain in tight supply during the remainder of this year. We also estimate there were
approximately 600,000 tons of coal that we could have handled in the quarter that will likely be made up between now
and the end of the year primarily as a result of flooding in the Midwest and related supply chain disruptions.
Drilling down to coal's primary market segments, export volume reached 76,000 carloads, up 14,000 or 23% over
second quarter 2010. Export was our strongest market segment in the first quarter and sequentially, we saw increased
volumes in the second quarter as well as demand for high-quality U.S. met coals to the European, Asian and South
American markets remain strong.
Tightened met coal supply around the world and a 5% increase in global steel production continues to support strong
demand in this market. At Lambert's Point, volume for the quarter reached 54,000 carloads, up 34%, while shipments
over Baltimore were up 1.4%. Concluding my discussion of coal on slide 7, our utility volume of 257,000 loads was
flat compared to the same period of 2010 despite a 6% decline in coal burn in our service region through May.
Inventory replenishment and new business generated led to a 9% increase in our volume to Southern utilities, which
nearly offset the 8% decline we saw in volume to Northern-based utilities. Competition from natural gas during the
quarter also impacted coal usage across our network. Stockpiles at Norfolk Southern served plants on average are

below targeted levels and as record heat encompasses our region, we expect increased generation requirements in the
third quarter and a healthy shoulder month coal replenishment period this fall.
Now, let's turn to Intermodal on slide 8. Intermodal revenue of $540 million was up $89 million or 20% over second
quarter last year. This gain was based primarily on increased fuel-related revenue and volume growth. Volume reached
802,000 units, up 69,000 units or 9% with strong gains led by our domestic business. Domestic volume growth of 15%
in the quarter was driven primarily by highway conversions with tightening truck capacity in the marketplace.
Of our total domestic increase for the quarter, we estimate that 70% came from local business east of the Mississippi,
which was up 18%, with the remaining 30% from traditional interline business such as the transcon market which
increased by 11%. Premium volume, which was up 10%, benefited from tight truck capacity as well and highway
conversions in the LTL segment in addition to other new business. And finally, International and Triple Crown
volumes were both up 3% in the quarter.
Now turning to Merchandise, it is shown on the next slide. We generated revenue of $1.4 billion, up $150 million or
12% over second quarter 2010 with record revenue in chemicals and agriculture. Volume for the quarter was 582,000
carloads, down 2%, with weaker results in industrial products markets offsetting the growth we saw in our automotive
business.
Drilling down to specific market segments in our Merchandise business, auto volumes grew 17% over second quarter
of 2010 driven by an increase in North American light vehicle production and robust vehicle sales, which were up 7%
in the quarter.
Shipments for the Detroit III along with the majority of our international brand names saw year-over-year
improvement. However, as we expected, the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our volumes
with the large Japanese manufacturers, but production at those plants started to improve late in the quarter.
The new Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee opened during the quarter and we began handling a small
number of shipments in June to various destination ramps. This plant is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles annually
and we expect our volumes of outbound vehicles to ramp up in the third quarter.
In our metals and construction market, volume declined 1% compared to second quarter last year with increases in
shipments of coil steel, and frac sand, offset by declines in scrap metal, aggregates, and cement. Coil steel carloads
were up 6% driven by increased domestic steel production and increased automotive production.
We also benefited from the continued ramp up of the new ThyssenKrupp plant at Calvert, Alabama. Miscellaneous
construction carloads were up 5% primarily driven by growth again in frac sand shipments for natural gas drilling in
the Marcellus Shale region, which was partially offset by lower aggregates and cement volumes as a result of continued
softness in housing starts and commercial construction.
Turning to our other merchandise business groups as shown on Slide 11, agriculture volume declined 2% in the second
quarter with difficult year-over-year comps. Corn volume was down 6% in part due to a reduction in our Midwest
gathering volumes with greater local crop availability this year compared to last. Soybean shipments on the other hand
were strong due to export demand and tighter supplies in the east and wheat demand for feed production was up due to
higher corn prices.
Chemical volume was down due to tougher comparisons to second quarter 2010. That included – It included 8,500
carloads of TVA fly ash business. We will not clear that negative comp until December 1 of this year. And finally, our
Paper and Forest products business was down 8% due to large volumes last year of woodchips, kaolin, clay and
unfinished paper products.
Now as we look ahead, as you will note on Slide 12, we expect further revenue growth across the majority of our
portfolio of business for the second half of this year. The economic outlook is favorable for industrial sectors including
steel and North American light vehicle production, and there's a positive outlook for international trade that bodes well
for our export coal, manufactured products, grain and Intermodal business.

We're pleased with our strong revenue performance in the second quarter and we expect to focus on new business
initiatives, modal conversion opportunities and pricing to market demand to fuel revenue growth in the second half of
2011. In this regard, as we support our customers in their markets, we fully expect our volumes to exceed the growth of
GDP and we will continue to price to market demand.
Thank you for your attention and now Mark will present our service update. Mark?
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don. Starting with safety, we ended the second quarter with a safety ratio of 0.81 compared to 0.89. That's
a 9% improvement over the same period last year. For the first half, our ratio is 0.80, a 19.2% improvement over the
corresponding period last year.
Turning to the service front, our second quarter composite service performance was 76.5 even with last year, but up 6%
over the first quarter of 2011. Good improvements in both train and connection performance have driven a sequential
gain despite another quarter of extreme weather challenges. Not only did we experience the devastating tornado
outbreaks in the south, but also, we were impacted by traffic backups and detours from Western flooding.
While off from the levels of the second quarter last year, train speed has increased sequentially from the first quarter of
2011. Remember train speed is a measure of over-the-road transit, the average speed of a train from the departure at
one yard to the arrival at the next. I don't want to make a lot about the quarterly changes here because as you can see,
while train speed is below the second quarter of last year, it's not that far off. In reality, none of these numbers show a
lot of variation. In fact, the train speed in the second quarter of 2011 was near or equal our train speed in the second
quarter of 2008 prior to the downturn.
Turning the page, terminal dwell, the average time cars dwell at a switching yard stood at levels consistent with last
year, but improved significantly from the first quarter of this year, a nearly 9% improvement. During the height of our
service issues, connection performance and terminal dwell took a lower priority as we emphasized on-time train
performance.
As the network has gotten healthier with a rising crew base, we have rebalanced the priorities between train and
connection performance. The improvements seen here are the result of that rebalancing. This is one of the areas that's
really starting to gain traction and I expect to see continuing improvements, returning us to pre-downturn performance
levels in a relatively short order.
This next slide illustrates our actual and projected T&E employment count by month through the end of 2011. I'm not
going to go through the drivers again since we've talked about them for the last several sessions and they remain the
same. In the first quarter of 2012, our qualified T&E employment ranks will grow to around 12,000, approximately 200
below our 2008 peak. At that point, our qualified T&E count will level off with trainee hiring moderating in order to
maintain a steady state workforce. However, note that our total T&E employment peaks around September of this year.
And finally turning to our productivities scorecard, as previously indicated, volumes up 4%, with crews up and
equivalent rate. Railroad employees are up 7% as we continue to hire trainees in order to return us to employment
levels commensurate with our traffic levels and the 2012 forecast.
I'll remind you that in the second quarter of 2010 we were just starting to react with hiring to the major increase in
traffic we saw in March of 2010, thus making this comparison so significant. Due to our hiring plan, which resulted in
the 7% increase in railroad employees, gross ton miles per-employee is down 3% compared to last year.
The 5% decrease in gross ton miles per gallon of diesel fuel is primarily being driven by two factors. First, in the
quarter there was a shift in traffic mix toward finished automobiles and Intermodal away from the more gross ton mile
per gallon efficient bulk commodity unit trains.
The second reason has to do with our less fuel efficient leased-locomotive fleet. We have 157 more leased-locomotive
on the property than we did last year. However, we began turning leased power back in the second quarter as our

network velocity has improved and will continue to do so, spinning these less desirable assets out of the network.
In addition, in the last half of the year we will take delivery of an additional 25 new locomotives. Gross ton miles per
train hour has improved 1% as our train size grew in an increasingly fluid network.
And now I'll turn it over to Jim.
James A. Squires
Thank you, Mark. I'll now review our financial results for the second quarter. We're pleased to report strong
performance that translated to second quarter records across the board.
Let's start with our operating results. As Don described, our railway operating revenues for the quarter totaled $2.9
billion, up $436 million or 18% compared to the second quarter of last year including a $162 million increase in fuel
surcharge revenues. Total railway operating expenses increased by $294 million or 17% for the quarter. The combined
operating results generated income from railway operations that totaled $875 million, a 19% increase and a 30 basis
point operating ratio improvement to 69.5%.
Taking a closer look at expenses, fuel, which was up 60% from last year, accounted for over half of the overall
increase. Higher diesel fuel prices, up 45% versus last year, drove most of the increase in fuel costs. This quarter's
average diesel fuel price per gallon was $3.26.
Taking a closer look at the per gallon components of our diesel fuel price, the next slide reflects crude oil in grey and
other costs in green separately. These other costs primarily reflect crack spreads, sales tax and transportation costs. As
you can see, most of the increase related to higher WTI prices which grew 32%. Other costs were also up significantly
increasing $0.43 per gallon or 110%.
Next, compensation and benefits increased by $69 million or 10%. Detailed on the following slide, volume-related
labor was up $22 million including $9 million for trainees, medical benefits for our agreement labor and payroll taxes
each increased by $13 million, and pension costs were up $6 million.
As highlighted next, materials and other expenses increased $31 million or 16% reflecting higher usage of locomotive
roadway and freight car materials in addition to increased travel expenses. Less favorable personal injury claims
development also contributed to the increase.
Purchased services and rents increased $31 million or 8%. The increase is primarily due to increased volume-related
activities, such as Intermodal operations, equipment and roadway repairs and maintenance, equipment rents and taxi
services. It also includes increased IT expenses mostly for software.
Turning to our non-operating items, the majority of the net increase is due to higher returns from corporate-owned life
insurance and reduced interest expense on uncertain tax positions, primarily due to some of the non-recurring
income-tax-related benefits I'll cover in a minute. Similar to last quarter, coal royalties were also favorable.
Income taxes displayed next, totaled $239 million and the effective tax rate decreased to 30%. Income taxes last year
were $243 million with an effective rate of 38.3%. The lower second quarter 2011 effective tax rate reflects $40 million
in income tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of an IRS examination of NS's 2008 return and review of
certain claims for refund. We also recorded $19 million of deferred tax benefits due to state law changes.
Second quarter net income was $557 million, an increase of $165 million or 42% compared to last year. Diluted
earnings per share were $1.56 or $0.52 per share greater than 2010. As you know, net income was favorably impacted
by $63 million or $0.18 per share due to the non-recurring income-tax-related benefits mentioned previously. As
displayed on the final slide, our recorded – excuse me, our record first half earnings results contributed to increased
cash from operations, which easily covered our increased capital spending.

Share repurchases for the period totaled $792 million and dividends reflect our increase to $0.40 per share in 1Q 2011.
In addition, we generated almost $400 million in proceeds related to the 100-year notes we issued in May. Cash and
cash equivalents at the end of the quarter equaled $678 million and our combined cash and short-term investments
totaled $906 million.
We have continued confidence in the future of rail transportation, especially with respect to our Norfolk Southern
franchise. Thank you for your attention and I will now turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thanks, Jim. As you've heard, Norfolk Southern had a very strong quarter in almost every respect and we have set a
firm foundation in place from which to drive even stronger performance in the future. Now as all of you know, there
have been some questions recently about the economy going forward and we certainly did see some economic slowing
in some of our business groups in the second quarter. However, we remain optimistic as do most economists about the
second half of the year in terms of the recovery and improved business conditions.
Mark outlined for you our ongoing service improvements and you saw the strengthening performance in our service
delivery. While we're still not where we or our customers ultimately want us to be, the positive improvements in our
velocity are having an impact on productivity as we spin our car and locomotive fleets faster.
One example of this, as Mark mentioned, is how we're now turning in less fuel efficient, less reliable leased
locomotives that we've been utilizing while our system velocity was slower than normal. As we've described before,
we've also been investing in our car and locomotive maintenance programs, both in terms of employees and material
ensuring that we can use the assets that we own more efficiently and more effectively.
These programs, along with our aggressive hiring and training of conductor trainees, have added to our costs in the
short-term but as we approach our target employment numbers in the second half, we expect to see the incremental
expenses start to decline significantly and our service metrics continue to improve.
Over the long-term, we believe that offering a superior level of rail service, driven by superior assets and infrastructure
along with best-in-class operating systems, practices and people, is the way to drive superior returns for our owners.
Within the context of the overall economy, we can and will continue to drive volume growth while pricing our superior
service at levels that fully reflect its value in the marketplace. Norfolk Southern has a long history of doing just that,
and our second quarter results are an indication that we will continue to do it in the future.
Thanks, and I'll now turn the program over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time. If I could look at the export coal market,
very strong growth in the quarter obviously at 34% but if I recall you guys had an exceptional May, it was up I believe,
you said about 54%. So, the growth rate dipped a little bit in June, but looking at the chart you provided here on a
quarterly basis, it looks like your third quarter comparisons at least get a little bit easier on export coals. So, should we
expect that growth to be up in the 30% plus range for 3Q?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Jason, we expect our export coal market to continue to be strong for the balance of
the year. We see demand coming back in Japan which was impacted in the quarter because of the earthquake-related
disruption to industry there. Particularly, over Baltimore and some point over Lambert's Point. So, we expect Japan to

strengthen. China continues to be good. Korea continues to be very good. Brazil continues to be good. So, we look for
more of the same in the second half.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. My next follow up question is going to be in the Intermodal side. Some of your peers
have called for a late but shortened peak season. Could you talk a little bit about any potential issues around equipment
availability for a compressed peak season this year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we've seen the domestic container fleet augmented by additional containers that
have been added. So, we don't see equipment shortages as we saw somewhat last year. So, we think that we're
well-positioned as an industry and we're well-positioned as a company to participate in the retail inventory
replenishment in the fall. With respect to international, we're seeing some activity right now pick up a little bit, but I

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q>: Hey, this is actually John filling in for Bill. First, the head count trend chart that Mark put up for yearend was
great and helpful. But can you help us think about how we should translate that into the comp and benefits expense
trend through yearend? Do you think it's going to fall sequentially from here?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, it's – I'll let Jim comment on the economics. If you look at the chart, as you see, we
reach our total goal at least on the train and engines service side by about September. That includes a lot of trainees and
the balance will shift slowly as the year progresses as more and more people are qualified and marked up. That has
some influence on comp and benefits because we pay more to qualified employees certainly than we do to trainees. But
Jim, I don't know that that in and of itself makes for a significant change.
<A - James A. Squires>: We obviously have hiring going on in other areas as well and other elements of
compensation, benefits expense obviously. Looking into third and fourth quarter, we're seeing total compensation,
benefits expense roughly in line with second quarter, perhaps up some, down obviously from first quarter.
<Q>: Okay, great and congrats on the great operating ratio this quarter. But can you help us think about how
incremental margins should trend from here assuming no big unexpected change in the macro picture? Is it fair to
assume they accelerate in the third and fourth quarters?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, first a comment on incremental margin in the second quarter. We reported 33%
incremental margin. There's going to be some impact there from the trend in the price component of both the FSC
increase and the price component of fuel expense as well. Looking into the second half of the year, I think we would
expect incremental margin, perhaps making the same adjustments depending on the fuel trend to trend basically in the
same general area. So something around the low 40s probably for the balance of the year.
<Q>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.

<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks. This is Allison Landry in for Chris. I was wondering if you could give us a sense
of how much of the 14% RPU growth came from mix? And I know that you talked about there being some positive
impact within the coal segment. But maybe if you could point out if there were any other commodities that saw
something like that.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Allison, on the coal side, obviously export coal and Southern utility coal being up
were the favorable mix components of that. In terms of the mix overall, I will tell you that it was negative. In terms of
Intermodal volumes being up, it's one of the components of that obviously in the total book. So coal had the largest
single positive mix. Everything else was either neutral or negative.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. And then maybe turning to some of the economic expectations for the second half.
What gives you confidence that these forecasts are going to improve in the second half? And maybe if you could talk
about your customers' inventory levels and what they're telling you about their expectations for the next three to six
months.
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, a couple of things. I think that we look at one, is that at least in our book of business, if
you look at some of the slowing or the year-over-year comps that we had, we understand the reasons that they happen.
They were obvious. They were either comp issues where traffic had gone away or where we had shifted traffic in some
way or another. Clearly, we saw a fair sized impact from the tsunami related effects in automotive, but as Don
mentioned actually in coal as well and that is certainly easing. There are some impacts that we've seen from the
flooding in the west. That will ease.
And as we talk to our customers, other than the general uncertainties that I would say that are on everyone's mind these
days about the debate in Washington, we're not hearing a lot of concern, I would say, from our customers in terms of
their order books, in terms of their visibility. We're not hearing anything negative about the second half.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for the time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. I was curious, Don, your comments on
make-up call in the back half of this year as the floods abate, I think you said 600,000 tons. Can you give us a sense of
how you would expect to see that come on?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, it was deferred tonnage, some from PRB coming into the Southeast, some in the Upper
Midwest. So, we will see that coal handled over the course of the second half as we cycle trains, and I'm sure that we'll
recover the cycles. And with operations improving, we'll probably see those cycles improve and the terms improve as
well. So...
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Is it smooth through the second half or would we expect to see most of that in Q3 from a
make-up stand point?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly with the kind of weather we're having with stockpiles being diminished at a
faster pace, I wouldn't be surprised to see utilities attempt to replenish that in the third quarter.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay, that's helpful. And just curious on overall train length where you guys stand right
now? And how you think about capacity, vis-à-vis peak season and where you could go to across merchandise coal and
other trains?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, we're in pretty good shape as far as capacity goes. I mean as far as train length
specifically, our average, if you look at our merchandise business the average is in the 4,600, 4,700 range feet that is
which is certainly a lot of room to grow there so that's good. Intermodal is more like 5,600 but that's an average and

averages are pretty dangerous because we've got some very big Intermodal trains out there as well. But nevertheless,
we've got good capacity and when it comes down to it, you've got to look at where we are now versus where we've
been. We're 6% off of 2008. We're 12% off of 2006. So there's a lot of room out there and we certainly won't have any
trouble with the fall season.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay, well, but if I put those into context I know the averages are dangerous but maybe
you guys sense as you think about across your network how much you could lengthen those trains before you'd have to
start really ramping up train starts in that type of a scenario?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: The – as far as the merchandise trains go, as you know, we like to fill them out to the
extent possible. So, there'll be a mix of filling out existing trains and then where it makes sense, we'll have additional
train starts.
<A - James A. Squires>: I think it's a great question. It's kind of a situation of, tell us where the traffic's coming from
and we'll tell you how we're going to handle it. There are places where we're running a lot of long trains and we'd have
to add starts. But I'd say more often than not, we have capacity without adding trains starts in our network.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: No, that's fair enough and it's obviously hard to predict. So I guess asked a different way,
I mean when you think about incremental margins in the back half of the year, how sustainable do you feel they are?
And if anything, do you think that they can actually be improved from where we've been in the first half of this year as
you think about better volumes, continued strong pricing, and obviously the opportunity to maybe mitigate some starts
with length in trains.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think as Jim commented earlier on incremental margins, but I would tell you
that I think overall we have a network that in which velocity is improving. Increased velocity has a lot of benefit not the
least of which is it creates capacity in the network without adding costs. We do have the ability to add a lot of volume
in a significant portion of our network without adding cost. And our hope is and expectation is, with things like the
leased-locomotive fleet that we're actually going to be seeing costs – some costs drop out even as we handle more
traffic. So, I think we have a – we're going to have a good story on incremental margin.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Great. Thanks so much for the color. I appreciate the time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes. Good afternoon and I got to say congratulations in particular to Don Seale. I guess
good results for everybody but the yields were very, very impressive. And I'm wondering, Don, if you can provide a bit
more perspective on what's behind this. I think kind of reasonable fuel surcharge revenue doesn't account for the
difference in year-over-year yield growth. Obviously, it's part of it. But is the core price quite a bit stronger across the
book in second quarter relative to first? Or what is it that's really behind the broad-based strengthen in yields? And how
would you look at that going forward? Are those factors going to continue in the second half?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Tom, it's an indicator of timing with respect to re-pricing. As you know, we re-priced
our export coal year-to-year effective April 1st and that's a component of this in the second quarter. And it's a continued
impact of re-pricing of some contracts in coal that we re-priced January 1st that will continue on for this year and I
would say the same applies across the book of business. We will continue to see the impact of the re-pricing of that in
terms of the time that we did it. So, we feel good about the demand for pricing, as I mentioned in the comments, and we
see that continuing to be firm.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: So is it – what do you think it is that's allowing you to get significantly stronger core
price? I mean it just – I guess it's notable relative to – I don't know if it was a year ago, you were talking about trying to
explain weaker core price versus the group. And now it looks like your core price is a lot – is probably a bit stronger

than what some others might be seeing even. And so I'm wondering is that all – is it just more contracts that are due this
year? Or are you taking a bit of a different approach to pricing? Or I guess any other thoughts? But obviously it's good
performance.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, we're looking at the market. We're looking at tightening demand in the market capacity,
which we've seen continue to change quarter-to-quarter. And Tom, I would also point out that when we see our utility
coal moving to the South up 9% that is longer haul that impacts RPU, export obviously impacts RPU favorably as well.
So there's some moving parts with respect to length of haul as well. But we see a favorable pricing environment and
we're pricing to the market. We haven't had any change in our philosophy on that and we plan to stay that way.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: How much was length of haul up? I don't know if – maybe I missed that number.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The utility coal to the South was up 9% and was offset by an 8% decline in our Northern
utility coal, which is shorter, shorter haul than the Southern coal.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Right, but how does that translate to length of haul in coal or is that something you don't
want to give?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Southern utility coal is about a third higher RPU than our Northern utility coal.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Length of haul.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thank you for the time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Hi, Walter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: So just on the – I guess you've invested quite a bit in your quarter initiatives. I was
wondering you gave us a great update in the first quarter on the growth in some of your lanes. Can you give us a sort of
an update again, is that volume continuing? Are those expenditures you made continuing to pay off? Are we still seeing
some of those pretty significant volume increases on those routes continuing in the second quarter?
<A - James A. Squires>: Well, we're obviously continuing to invest in those quarters. Some of them were still
midstream or even earlier an investment like the Crescent Corridor although I think Crescent first half of the year was
up 30%-some year-over-year all on an admittedly smaller base. But yes, we continue to see growth with all the corridor
initiatives and we think that they're going to be a very positive thing for our franchise on an ongoing basis. We've got
work underway on four Intermodal terminals right now. We're going to be breaking ground on another one fairly soon
and as those terminals come on line and give us additional capacity, we expect to be able to continue to ramp our
business up.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. A follow-up question here on the flooding impact. You mentioned one of the revenue
sort of a deferred coal, was there any other deferred volumes in the quarter and if you were to quantify those in addition
to some of your rerouting costs or any expenses incurred due to the flooding, if you were to put that together, what
would be the earnings impact if you were to add the two together?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: The other impact that we had in the quarter was the Japanese supply chain that I've
mentioned and we estimate that the reduced business that we handled with Honda, Toyota and others were in the range

of 5,500 to 6,000 cars for the quarter.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. More on the flooding per se in terms of incremental increase in expenses associated
with your having to deal with the flooding in the quarter. Is there any?
<A - James A. Squires>: The flooding obviously has been an issue with some of the traffic with our western
connections. Mark also mentioned that we had a really kind of unusual couple of months in terms of severe weather
patterns moving across our system just on a weekly basis, the worst of which were the terrible tornados that we all saw
come up to Alabama, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Virginia. We have not tried to quantify them just because it
was a long series of effects that had a general impact of slowing the network. But, very difficult to capture in dollars
and cents what that cost us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Yes. Thanks. I wanted to ask about export coal, specifically where you were running in terms of
capacity utilization or throughput availability at Lamberts and Baltimore given some of the issues you had earlier in the
year. And also, you gave us updates or provided a snapshot of some new export facilities coming online, Charleston,
Philadelphia. I was wondering if you've been in talks with anyone about the new opportunities out of the Gulf and if so,
what kind of added capacity, if you could quantify might we see in export coal for the next two to three years.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Matt, we don't see capacity for export coal a problem. As we mentioned at Investor's
Day, Lamberts Point has additional capacity. We would bring up people, additional people there at the pier, should we
see the volume and demand continue to rise. So, we have added capacity at Lamberts Point and we have room to grow.
The same thing at Baltimore, there's an expansion taking place there at CNX to take it up by another 2 million tons plus
we're improving the process there that we think we'll add another 1 million ton capacity on the throughput at that pier.
And then with respect to steam coal opportunities at Fairless near Philadelphia and the Charleston, South Carolina
terminal. As I mentioned in May or June at the Investor's Conference, we're already handling some met coal through
Fairless. That will continue to build and we're targeting steam coal through that facility out of northern App and also
targeting steam coal out of the Illinois Basin to Charleston for export.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Any of the Gulf projects? Have you been approached about those?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yes. We have and we are handling business to the Gulf out of the Illinois Basin.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. And so ample capacity to grow for what should be good market?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Ample capacity and as you know, with the recent announcements on the sale of one
of the terminals and the expansion plans by the buyer, that capacity will actually ramp up.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Okay. The follow-up question I'd have is just an easy one, but you obviously had two very big
Intermodal winds with J.B. Hunt and FedEx, FedEx being more recently. Is that business trending in line with what you
would expect? Are the volumes and your ability to handle them meeting the service requirements for what is arguably
one of the toughest customers in that business?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: We're very pleased with that business and our service is meeting the expectation of
that customer and we look forward to growing with them.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Excellent. Thank you for the time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to pricing for a minute. I
guess the strength in coal was maybe not unexpected. But what did strike me in the quarter was the strength of your
RPU gains in the merchandise segment and it sort of looks like length of haul might have had an impact there. I don't
know whether there was some timing impacts like you mentioned in coal. So I was wondering if you could just address
the market dynamics in merchandise specifically.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The RPU growth in merchandise as with the other businesses reflect the fuel component plus
from the price component, in some cases, length of haul. But as I've mentioned earlier, the overall impact of mix across
the entire book was negative in the quarter, so predominantly price gain and fuel.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay and my second question is more of an operational nature. In Mark's presentation
you mentioned that during the quarter you had rebalanced the priorities between train and connection performance and
that was gaining traction. So I was wondering if you could just elaborate on what you meant by that and indicate how
quickly that should have a noticeable impact on your service performance?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Sure, I'd be glad too. To the extent that we get trains to our terminals within a reasonable
window so that cars can make connection, that all works well. And so what we have found as we ramped our
performance up, we concentrated first on the train performance so that we could get cars to the terminals within that
window. And now that we're in pretty good shape making improvements with that train performance, we have been
concentrating on getting the cars on the right trains, i.e., connection, performance. And so all of that starts to spin out
together as you do that.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, good afternoon guys.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Hi, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So just wanted to ask just another follow-up on the coal pricing. If we look at revenue per car,
it was $1,700 two quarters ago; $2,000 a car last quarter; and now its $2,200. Based on what you're seeing in the
market, is there an opportunity to materially increase those yields further over the next couple quarters? Or just given
the timing of contracts and the export re-pricing, should we expect that to finally level off going forward?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, with respect to export, as you know, our contracts are year-to-year with an anniversary
date of April 1st. So that will be a steady state until April 1st of 2012. I will tell you that we have other activities that
are just based on the rate calendar in terms of when renegotiations will take place. But that's – we see those
quarter-to-quarter and it's nothing unusual coming.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And maybe just one other way to ask that, so if we go from – if we went from $2,000 a
car last quarter to $2,200 this quarter, it kind of suggests that they've been sequentially getting better and better
throughout the quarter. Is there any way to think about where revenue per car and coal finished at the end of the
quarter, kind of entering third quarter? I'm guessing, it's a fair amount higher than $2,200 a car.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: In terms of the quarter, I don't have the numbers in terms of the monthly numbers as it
aggregated for the quarter.

<A - Donald W. Seale>: No.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Sorry, what's that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then just a second question. If I think about historically, chemicals has been a pretty
good leading indicator for Europe volumes overall. Chemical volumes down 10% in the quarter, does that concern you
about the rest of the business going forward or is there something you think unique about the weakness in chemicals
this quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well as I mentioned, we have a large negative comp in the quarter and we'll have that comp
up through December 1st of this year. As you'll recall, we had project cargo hauling fly ash for disposal out of the
Tennessee Valley Authority plant at Kingston, Tennessee. For the quarter, that was 8,500 cars last year that we didn't
handle this year.
So fundamentally, we're seeing chemical traffic continue to improve as far as the overall economic output goes,
reflecting automotive – increased automotive production. So, we're optimistic about chemicals but you have to take the
comp into effect at least up through December 1st of this year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: That's very helpful, Don. I appreciate the time guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Chase with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Hi, good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to just ask a question of Mark and I apologize because
I'm just eyeballing this without the benefit of the exact numbers but your manpower chart that you showed during your
prepared remarks looks a bit different than the one you showed on the last quarter. I would say favorably so just curious
if there's a volume assumption component to the lower head count and you also kind of peak earlier and at a lower level
is the way I would, sort of read the difference between the charts, or if there's some efficiency gain versus your
expectations that explains that?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, this isn't – this is not too much different than what we had originally projected and like
we say we're going to come first quarter next year we think we're going to be leveling at that 12,000 person mark. And
as we have put people into training the trainings coming along as scheduled so we're not far off of what we projected
we would be doing.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Let me say without looking – going back and looking at the numbers, the other thing
to remember is that this is a dynamic model. And so we project out our hiring and training results for the next three
months and what's you're seeing maybe just, it reflects that we did slightly better or slightly worse, I don't know which
of either during the second quarter than the numbers we indicated we expected. So these numbers are always going to
move a little bit as time goes on depending on how well we do compared to our targets.
<Q - Gary Chase>: Okay, but I guess one of the other components would be the level of activity you're planning on
and I guess what you're saying is that component of it hasn't changed, right?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I don't think it's changed in any material way. No.

<Q - Gary Chase>: Okay. And then maybe Jim, if I could – when you were going over some of the expenses, you
mentioned a less favorable PI development. Is that something that you're just talking about a comp issue in the prior
year? Or was there a negative adjustment this year that affects the results?
<A - James A. Squires>: It was a comp issue. Last year's reserve adjustment was $8 million favorable and this year we
had less than $1 million so it's really the comp. But the favorability in the reserve adjustments has been tapering off as
you've seen and that's sort of the trend we expect to see continue.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great. Good afternoon. If I could just follow-up on Gary's question real quick there on the
employees. Why do you have it peaking out in September, Mark? What was the – that you kind of explained why the
tail off there after that?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, in September, that's when our trainee count will – that's about when it peaks. And after
that, the number of people in training begin to level off and more and more, we wind up with trainees going into the
qualified ranks and we get closer and closer to hitting a steady state of trainees that are pretty much matching the
attrition.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: So does this indicate that the long kind of talked about attrition, you could always pull the
attrition trigger when you need it, when we have a soft spot? Does that indicate that that is now deteriorating, that
you've got the revised workforce but that's not such a needed trigger anymore?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No, not, no. Not at all. I'm just saying that as we get into the third quarter, we're no longer
going to have this big bubble of trainees that we have had. The number of trainees will begin to reduce in number and
we'll just have more of a steady state trainee group out there that is matching the attrition plus a little bit for whatever
the growth is that we project coming up. And like always, if we see a downturn in the business, I mean, if that happens
to happen, we can always throttle back and use attrition to our advantage like we always have.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Great. And Don, the new Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, is that kind of a bit more aggressive
than some had anticipated on some of the coal burning. What is your thoughts on the impact to some of the utilities in
your region in terms of coal demand?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, Ken, in the short run, I think we're watching stockpiles go down quicker than we felt
they would this summer with the cooling degree days. So I'm watching that closer than I am the EPA requirement right
now. I think that I don't see any immediate impact in that. Obviously, we've got it on our radar and we're watching it
closely, but in a more immediate sense, we see an opportunity in the second half for higher demand for utility coal.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Just a quick question for Jim. You said that there was a $40 million tax benefit, a $19 million
tax benefit, but then throughout, that he total was $63 million. Can you just throw out what the difference is there?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure. The difference is the after-tax effect of the $6 million in interest reserves release up
above in non-operating items.
<Q - Kenneth Hoexter>: Okay.
<A - James A. Squires>: So it's $40 million plus $19 million plus the $4 million, which is the after tax of the $6
million up there in other income.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.
Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Great, thanks, good afternoon. Maybe quickly on the coal side, when you think about
Don just on your comments, just on the last question when you think about the coal stockpiles now they're coming in,
Southern versus Northern just to give us a little bit of clarity on how the utility stockpiles look between the two of them
going forward?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We see our Southern utilities having lower effective stockpiles than the North. But we also
see – that's not to say that we don't see some of the large utilities in the North being below target.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. And when you think about that 600,000 tons of make-up, where is that going
specifically? Is that going predominantly down south or is it a mix of where it's headed?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It's a mix between the Upper Midwest and the Southeast.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. Okay that's helpful. And if I could switch gears, if I could just to the head count
side or maybe better yet the comp per employee side. As you start to see those trainees come back into the workforce
and you have the attrition kind of get you over that September hump, how do you think about the cost per employee
and is it fair to say that you might see some decline in the absolute cost per employee as you move forward? Does it
skew the normal seasonal pattern that you'd expect as you go through the rest of year here?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I'll have to think through that Chris, but the first reaction I have is whatever the
impact is, it's small. The second is that as we get through this bubble if you will of trainees where we have finally
caught up in some sense with our trainee hiring and we bring more people on as I said earlier, the good news is as those
folks get marked up they're productive, and we're able to run more trains and improve our service, they are paid at a
higher level. So, but net-net, I think one other thing is we're not really – it's not big enough that we're very focused on
the net effect of that.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. So, they're marked up from a pay perspective but still it's a fair assumption to
assume that they're coming in on a lower basis relative to the attrition that you guys are losing?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yes, that's true.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one final one maybe for you, Jim, just on the
repurchase of shares. As you go forward obviously, you did a decent amount in the second quarter. Just trying to get a
sense of kind of how you think about the rest of the year when you're trying to balance that capital allocation to shares
specifically?
<A - James A. Squires>: Sure, well we're going to stay at it on the share repurchase front provided the free cash flow
we expect materializes. And in addition, we have in mind incremental borrowing in the second half to keep our credit
metrics stable, kind of in the zone where they are now. So we would expect significant share repurchases right now,
significant share repurchases in the second half of the year as well.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee MBA>: And just on that point of layering in some incremental debt issuances. When you think
about it, obviously you did the 100-year issuances here, when you think about kind of what the best window is as far as
opportunity and maturities going forward, how do you see those opportunities?

<A - James A. Squires>: Well, we'll just have to test the market when the time comes and so it's tough to call in
advance really. But, we're probably thinking in terms of some shorter duration debt at this point. I mean we'll see what
the market looks like, what the yield curve's like.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: So make the call, but probably shorter than a 100-year.
<A - James A. Squires>: Shorter than 100. Yes.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold CFA, CPA>: Thanks for taking the call. Last quarter I think you said that 68% of the 2011
book of business had been priced. Can you give me an update on what that percentage looks like today?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're at 86% priced for the year.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold CFA, CPA>: Okay. And my only other follow-up question, you had cited several times the
strength in Southern utility coal for the quarter, was there any measurable market share shifts do you believe in that
market for you during the quarter?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The only true shift was business that we mentioned last month at the Investor's Day
conference and also, perhaps previously we have a new piece of business into the Carolinas that was secured effective
January 1st on the utility side.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold CFA, CPA>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Lagenfeld with R.W. Baird. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Actually this is Ben Hartford in for Jon. Just a follow-on on the service side. When
we look at dwell, dwell hours have hung around 2010 levels and still elevated relative to five-year averages, so when
you think about absorbing some of the new head count and getting beyond some of the flood and other related
disruptions in the first half of the year and in some of the incremental productivity initiatives that you have in place to
help drive asset turns, how should we think about that dwell as a measure of service? Where should that track over the
course of the next six months and over the course of the next two to three years? Is the five-year average in the mid to
late 2000s a realistic level?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, our – we've not been satisfied with our dwell. It's been hanging up there in the 24 to
even upwards 25 and more but more recently is coming down quite nicely. It was coming down in the latter part of the
second quarter and then now, more noticeably in the third quarter. So as velocity goes up, I'm confident we'll continue
to see dwell move in the right direction, and we're even now approaching the 22-hour range. So it's dropping nicely and
I think we'll continue to see that.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Yes. Mark, what do you think the driver of that in recent weeks has been and what
do you think the key is over the next call it quarter or two to driving that lower?

<A - Mark D. Manion>: It's been a combination of a couple things. One is the crew base, we're not all the way there
yet but the crew base has come on pretty nicely over the last several months. And we've reached a point where it's more
spotty here and there around the system where additional crews are going to make really a significant difference. So
we've just come a long way with the crews.
And if you combine that with some of the lighter seasonality, July is historically a bit lighter month and that helps us
get more traction and spin that velocity up even better. And then typically, as we go into August, we're able to sustain
that momentum and these crews are coming on at the rate of and they have been for months now coming on at the rate
of $150 a month, so. You add all that up and if you able to continue, I think that will continue to help us with the
velocity.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: And just to finalize it, what you were averaging from call it 2004 to 2008, is that a
realistic level to be targeting this upcoming cycles? Is there something different about it that would allow you or not
allow you to get back to those levels?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well there's – if you look at the period between 2004 and 2008, there has been a lot of
variability in performance during that timeframe. 2008 was a pretty good performance and we are actually reaching
those kind of levels now. So, I'm hopeful that we'll be able to either maintain 2008 or more likely even exceed it from a
performance standpoint.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Vernon with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Stephen Walker>: Hi, good afternoon guys. This is Stephen Walker in place for Dave this afternoon. I got some
questions for Don. I'm curious if you can give us a little bit of detail on the long-term nature of the export coal business
particularly as the Australian coal mines recover from flooding that happened earlier this year. Are you hearing
anything from your customers? Do you have volume commitments through April? How do you think about that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: They're hearing definitively from customers that they're looking to the stability of U.S. met
coal as a part of the mix going forward as opposed to a swing supply, more of a base load supply based on
dependability. So, our customers are telling us to plan on continued movement of U.S. coals into the world market. And
frankly, with consumption being what it is and the quality of the coal that we're shipping into the world market, we feel
pretty good based on those discussions with the customers that we'll see longer term sustained demand.
<Q - Stephen Walker>: I appreciate it. That's all for me. Great job, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you. I'll try to keep it brief. Just along those lines, the end market mix right now you
mentioned China, Brazil, Korea; roughly what is that and how has that changed over the last couple of years?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well certainly China has ramped up significantly. Korea has ramped up as well and the
Japanese have come back into the U.S. market as well. And they had moved away from the U.S. predominantly to
Australia and in other closer proximity world coals. So, I think if you look at those three, there have been some fairly

pronounced changes. Of course, Western Europe has been an ongoing taker of coal from the U.S., but the more
pronounced change that we've seen is the Asian market.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Are they roughly equal right now or how should we think about that?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I will tell you I don't want to get in to the relative sizes of it, but we've seen China, Korea,
Japan and I don't want to leave out South America. Brazil is substantial as well.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay. And then just back to the velocity question if I can, we've talked in the past about the
rollout of certain technologies that it should improve velocity and that velocity in turn should create both cost savings
and incremental capacity. You're not anywhere near where you used to be on velocity, and yet we still have excess
capacity and we have cost savings, so I guess my question is, how much better can it get as these technologies are
rolled out? Is there a number that we could think about in terms of velocity improvement and I think you used the tag
dollar cost savings too in one mouth, improvement in velocity? So if you could just refresh us on that.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Right, yes. And keep in mind we're getting back close to 2008 levels from a – the
standpoint of our train speed and you heard me say that dwell is coming down nicely as well. So we're not that far off
the mark from a velocity standpoint. We just see that there is continued upside. So better things to come, standby on
that and the other thing that will help feed that is just what you say the technologies that are coming out will continue to
advance it and it's going to happen over a period of years. GE's rail edge what we call movement planner that will be
one of the principal drivers of that and it's going to take – will be another year-and-a-half getting that rolled out.
And it appears to us even though it's early, it appears to us that it bumps us anywhere from two to four miles an hour
that's 10% to 20% improvement in velocity and that's a pretty good bump and we'll – it's early in the game, we'll wait to
see what actually happens. But that's what the early indications are.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Hi, good afternoon. I'd like to learn a little bit more about your domestic Intermodal
market gains. I'm wondering what portion of this growth, this truck conversion versus more organic growth existing
Intermodal shippers? And does length of haul declining as you grow the truck conversions?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, as I mentioned, our domestic business was the stronger component of the growth of
Intermodal in the quarter was up 15%. That business was up 18% east of the Mississippi. Our local east of the
Mississippi business was up 18%. It was 70% of the overall 15% gain in domestic. Some of that traffic is shorter haul.
Some of it is longer haul depending upon the OD point fare that we're securing it in. But we're seeing continued good
traction with the Corridor projects, as Wick mentioned. And certainly, the Corridor year-over-year improvement is
contained in that 15% increase in domestic business.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yes. On that same slide, I think its slide eight; you identified truck capacity constraints as
one driver of truckload conversion in Intermodal. You perceived that LTL rate increases are driving clients to more
attractive Intermodal rates or do you credit high diesel prices, material factors? And I realize this varies by lane but on
average, what's the order of magnitude of the gradient between truck and Intermodal costs for Eastern market
shipments? Is it 15% or 20%?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly, on the first question first, certainly we're seeing diesel fuel prices, tighter
truck capacity, lower class A tractor sales, and equipment availability, driver impacts, the coming hours of service and
some of the customers positioning out too get an Intermodal position in advance of that. All of those things are coming
together to help drive conversion.

In terms of the relative differential of truck pricing versus Intermodal pricing, it all depends upon the Corridor, the lane,
the market. But I would say a good rule of thumb is somewhere between 10% to 12% right now in terms of the delta
between truckload pricing and Intermodal.
