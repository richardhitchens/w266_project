MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Microsoft Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is
being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to
Bill Koefoed, General Manager of Investor Relations. Bill, you may begin.
Bill Koefoed

Okay. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share with you our financial results for the
fourth quarter which rounded out a solid fiscal year. We closed the year with terrific sales execution as enterprises
furthered their commitment to our Windows, Office and Server products. Customers continued to invest in our business
desktop offerings, including Windows 7, where enterprise deployments have increased almost 50% since March. Our
overall multi-year licensing business was especially strong, driven by attach of additional seats and additional products.
As a result, fourth quarter bookings were up 17%.
As I look back on fiscal year '11, we delivered strong financial results and products, while making strategic investments
and alliances that will allow us to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. We grew fiscal year '11 revenue double
digits and we delivered another year of operating margin expansion. We also grew earnings per share by more than
20% for the second year in a row.
Our financial results reflect Office 2010's outstanding market reception. Deployment remains five times faster than the
previous version. Customers are also adding our business productivity applications, including Exchange, SharePoint,
Lync and Dynamics to their multi-year agreements. These four products collectively drove approximately 30% of the
Business Division's growth this year.
We made great progress on our Cloud initiatives this year. We continue to lead the industry through this transformation
by enabling our customers to transition to the cloud in a flexible, customized way.
Last month, we launched Office 365, the latest generation of our cloud productivity service. With Office 365, we've
created new profit growth opportunities for us and our partners, while enabling scenarios that weren't viable in the past.
In the enterprise, Office 365 enables us to increase revenue and profit per seat, while strengthening customer
commitment through increased product satisfaction and high return on investment. It gives us new opportunities to
address the workforce that doesn't regularly use a PC in the workplace. For small and mid-size businesses, we now
offer a productivity solution with simple deployment and low up-front costs and with 80% of small businesses having
never purchased a business productivity application aside from Office, the opportunity for Microsoft and our partners is
significant.
During the year, we made important platform enhancements to Windows Azure, driving increased developer interest
and momentum and enabling new scenarios. Companies such as Pixar, Toyota and Boeing have leveraged Azure to
develop innovative solutions and enhanced experiences for their customers. At the same time, building private cloud
infrastructure remains a top priority for many of our customers and Windows Server, System Center and SQL Server
are scaling with the increased workloads in data centers.
In Search, Bing continues to gain market share and this quarter, we further differentiated our platform by deepening our
relationship with Facebook. During the quarter, we partnered closely with Yahoo! to uncover and address several
platform gaps and inefficiencies. We still face monetization challenges and will continue to work closely with Yahoo!.
We remain confident in the long-term potential of the combined search marketplace.
During the year, we reinvigorated our Xbox franchise with a refreshed console and with Kinect, which revolutionized
home entertainment and natural user interface technology. We also had great momentum with Xbox Live which now
has approximately 35 million members. Together, these products and services drove record fiscal year revenue and
operating income in the Entertainment and Devices Division.
In May, we announced our agreement to acquire Skype which will extend Skype's word class brand and global reach of
its network platform while at the same time, enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of products and services. With
Skype, we will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications to both consumers and

enterprises thereby generating new business and revenue opportunities for Microsoft.
In summary, we are pleased with the terrific market response to our products and our great sales execution, both of
which helped drive our solid financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year. We also continue to be excited by our
strategic investments and alliances which will allow us to capitalize on long term growth opportunities.
With that, I'm going to hand it back to Bill to provide more details on our results and then I'll come back to provide
some thoughts on our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal year 2012.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. First, I'm going to review our overall results and then move on to the details by business segment.
Revenue for the quarter was $17.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year, while bookings were up 17%. For the year, revenue
was $69.9 billion, growth of 12%. Operating income was $6.2 billion for the quarter and for the year, a record $27.2
billion, up over $3 billion from the prior year.
For the quarter, earnings per share was $0.69. For the year, earnings per share was $2.69, up 28%, the second
consecutive year of EPS growth over 20%.
This quarter, enterprise demand for our products remained strong and multiyear commitments drove our unearned
revenue balance to $17.1 billion. Our contracted not billed balance is now over $18.5 billion.
The PC market dynamics were similar to the third quarter. First, the business PC refresh cycle continued and drove
estimated business PC growth of 8%. Second, PC sales to emerging markets continued to grow at a rapid pace as a
record number of people around the world are using Windows PCs. We estimate that this quarter over 40 million PCs,
representing half of all global PC shipments, were shipped to emerging markets.
We estimate the worldwide consumer PC market declined 2%, primarily driven by weakness in developed markets. In
total, we estimate the PC market increased 1% to 3% in the fourth quarter.
Now, I'll move on to the results for the Windows and Windows Live division where revenue was down 1%, reflecting
the PC market dynamics I just described. As usual, you'll find the OEM revenue bridge in our earnings slide deck.
Last week, at our Worldwide Partner Conference, we announced that we have sold over 400 million units of Windows
7. 25% of enterprise desktops have already deployed Windows 7 and as we have stated before, over 90% of enterprises
have committed to a deployment plan.
During the quarter, we also provided an update of Windows 8. We demonstrated how we have re-imagined Windows
for a new generation of touch-centered hardware. You'll hear more at our BUILD Developer Conference this
September.
Now I'll move on to the Microsoft Business Division which grew 7%. Consumer revenue declined 8%. The weak
consumer PC dynamics in developed markets were partially offset by strong attach rates. The business transactional
portion grew 27%, driven primarily by business PC growth and continued launch cycle momentum. The multi-year
licensing portion of the business grew 6%.
We launched Office 2010 one year ago and for the year, the Business Division's revenue increased to over $22 billion,
an increase of 16%. Lync, SharePoint and Dynamics all continued to grow double digits this quarter. Within our
Dynamics business, which grew 19%, we saw strong growth and share gains across products. We added 300,000 new
seats on Dynamics CRM and now 2 million users leverage Dynamics CRM every day.
Now let's move on to the Server and Tools business which posted 12% revenue growth. Transactional revenue grew
faster than the underlying server hardware market which we estimate grew mid-single digits. Multi-year license
revenue grew 12% and enterprise services revenue grew 14%. Our premium Windows Server and System Center
revenues were both up over 20%. Customers are using Microsoft technology to virtualize their data center and build out

private cloud environments. System Center revenue has also grown double digits 10 consecutive quarters.
We are seeing customers continue to adopt SQL Server as they deploy mission-critical applications and implement
cost-effective business intelligence capabilities. As a result, SQL Server premium revenue grew almost 20%.
Last week, we previewed Windows Server 8 and the next version of System Center. These products will further
enhance customers' private cloud deployments while bridging their investments to the public cloud. We'll also share
more details on these at BUILD in September.
Our cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, continues to have strong customer momentum while revenue growth
accelerates. During the quarter, we showcased innovative Azure implementations with Boeing and General Mills,
demonstrating the power and flexibility of the platform.
Next I'll move to the Online Services Division where revenue grew 17%. Online advertising revenue grew 20%, driven
primarily by search. Bing's U.S. organic market share ended the quarter at 14.4%, up 340 basis points from last year.
During the quarter, we launched new features based on Facebook's social graph to help people make better, smarter
decisions. As Peter mentioned, we continue to experience challenges with RPS and we are partnering closely with
Yahoo! to resolve these as quickly as possible.
Now let me move to the Entertainment and Devices Division where revenue grew 30%. During the quarter we sold
over 1.7 million consoles, an increase of 18%. Xbox 360 was the number one selling console in the U.S. for the year.
At E3 in June, we announced the upcoming releases of Gears of War 3, Forza 4, Kinect: Star Wars, Kinect: Disneyland
Adventures, Dance Central 2, Kinect Sports Season 2 and many more games.
Xbox Live also continues to grow rapidly and consumer online engagement with the service remains a core part of our
Xbox value proposition. Xbox Live has entertainment content from partners such as ESPN, Hulu, Netflix and BSkyB,
and this fall we will make it even easier to find and access content via integration between Kinect and Bing. We believe
the combination of these core features will help drive even broader engagement within the Xbox Live ecosystem.
In May, we previewed Mango, which is our fall release of Windows Phone. Mango will deliver deeper social
experiences, multitasking, Office 365 integration, and will feature Internet Explorer 9 to optimize the browsing
experience. During the quarter, we also signed the Nokia alliance, added several new OEM partners, launched on
Verizon and Sprint, and saw the number of applications in the marketplace increase 60% sequentially.
Now let me cover the remainder of the income statement. In the quarter, cost of goods sold increased 17% and had
similar drivers as last quarter. Hardware costs are up due to the success of Xbox 360 consoles and Kinect Sensors.
Third-party content royalties are also up, reflecting strong sales on Xbox Live.
Enterprise services in our Server and Tools business continues to grow rapidly. And online services costs are also up,
reflecting increased traffic acquisition costs, including costs related to the Yahoo! alliance. Operating expenses were
$7.5 billion, an increase of 8%, primarily due to recently legislated Puerto Rican excise taxes and an increase in
selling-related costs.
During the quarter, we made the following adjustments to our full year tax rate which impacted our effective tax rate
for the fourth quarter. First, we made adjustments to reflect our actual mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income for the
year; and second, we completed our tax filings which resulted in adjustments reducing our tax provision. To think
about the full year tax rate, our effective rate was 19.2% after adjusting for the one-time benefit in the third quarter
related to the IRS settlement.
Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5.9 billion, growth of 6%, while operating cash flow for the full year
was a record $27 billion, an increase of 12%. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1.6 billion of stock and declared
$1.3 billion of dividends. For the full year, we returned $16.9 billion of cash, an increase of 10% year-over-year,
continuing our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. In the past five years, we have returned over $90
billion and reduced our outstanding share count by 1.7 billion shares or 17%.

In summary, we had a very solid quarter and year both from a product perspective and also with regard to delivering
strong financial results and returning cash to shareholders.
And with that, I'll hand it back to Peter who's going to discuss our business outlook.
Peter S. Klein
Thanks, Bill. For the remainder of the call, I'll discuss our expectations for the upcoming quarter and full year.
As we enter fiscal year 2012, we are excited by the advancing trends in technology and the resulting opportunities for
us to evolve our businesses. We expect increased diversity of hardware and services designed to satisfy users' growing
demand for a unified, consistent experience across multiple devices. We also expect businesses and developers to
continue their transition to the cloud given the compelling economics and flexibility. We believe that with our current
portfolio and investments we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends.
Now turning to our outlook by business, for the Windows and Windows Live Division we expect revenue to continue
to be impacted by market dynamics similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter with emerging market growth
significantly outpacing developed market growth. While emerging markets are an important opportunity for us to
increase Windows penetration, they impact revenue growth percentages as they generate lower average selling prices
and have higher piracy rates. We also expect business PC growth to outpace consumer PC growth with the business PC
refresh cycle continuing throughout the fiscal year.
Turning to the Microsoft Business Division, transactional revenue, approximately 40% of the division's total, will
likely lag the overall PC market for both the first quarter and full fiscal year reflecting a higher mix of PC shipments to
emerging markets and the launch of Office 2010 a year ago. Multi-year licensing revenue, approximately 60% of the
division's total, should grow mid to high single digits for the first quarter and low double digits for the full fiscal year.
Moving to Server and Tools, approximately 30% of the division's revenue comes from transactional licensing, 50%
from multi-year licensing and 20% from enterprise services. We expect transactional revenue to generally track with
the hardware market for the first quarter and full fiscal year. We expect multi-year licensing revenue and enterprise
services revenue to grow low double digits for the first quarter and full fiscal year.
Turning to the Online Services Division, we expect online advertising revenue to perform roughly in line with the
overall online advertising market for the first quarter and full fiscal year.
Within the Entertainment and Devices Division we expect revenue to grow high single digits for the first quarter and
mid-teens for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind that first quarter revenue will include a higher mix of hardware
reflecting last September's Halo: Reach launch and will result in gross margins similar to full fiscal year '11 margin.
Switching to overall cost of goods sold for the company, the biggest factor impacting COGS going forward will be the
shift of revenue mix across hardware, software, enterprise services and online services. In fiscal year '12 we will
continue to prioritize our spending and manage our costs. We are reconfirming our guidance of 3% to 5% growth and
expect operating expenses to be $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion for the full fiscal year.
We expect our effective tax rate to be 19% to 21% for the first quarter and full fiscal year, and we still expect capital
expenditures for the full fiscal year to be about $2.5 billion.
Moving to unearned revenue, given our strong sales execution and our record unearned balance at the end of the fiscal
year, unearned revenue in the first quarter will likely lag historical sequential growth patterns by a few points. We
expect unearned revenue at the end of fiscal year '12 to grow low double digits over this fiscal year.
In summary, we delivered solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. As we look towards fiscal
year '12 we have good product momentum in the market and are excited by the opportunity to help our customers take
advantage of the advancing trends in technology.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill, and we'll take some questions.
Bill Koefoed
Thanks, Peter. We want to get to questions from as many of you as possible so please stick to just one question and
avoid long or multi-part questions. Carol, can you please go ahead and repeat your instructions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be from Walter Pritchard, Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Thanks. You mentioned in the slide deck there that 20% of the Fortune 500 has
started to adopt the Office 365 online services and I'm assuming it's pretty early there, but I'm wondering if you can
help us understand how quickly you expect that to progress throughout fiscal '12 and sort what impact we should see on
the financial statements as that starts to happen in fiscal '12 or maybe beyond.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, you see it hit the financial statement in two ways actually, Walter. One will be in the
actual Office 365 revenue, but also as we continue to have the conversations about the migration to the cloud you see
that show up in our multi-year licensing revenue. And you saw some of that this quarter with our really strong
multi-year licensing revenue across the board. The market response so far has been great. We're really excited about it.
We expect that to accelerate over time, but again I think you'll see it in both ways. You'll see it in our multi-year
licensing revenue and in our Office 365 revenue.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Okay. Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question will be from Adam Holt, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Adam Holt>: Hi. Thank you, and congrats on the good finish to the year.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks, Adam.
<Q - Adam Holt>: My question is about the E&D commentary for next year which was – I think a surprise relative to
certainly consensus expectations and then it's a lot higher than where the consensus was for next year. Can you talk a
little bit about some of the detail behind the assumptions there? Specifically what are you expecting or what is
embedded around the Nokia relationship? And what are you expecting and what's in the numbers around any kind of
share gains following Mango? Thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Well, the single biggest driver in the E&D division is going to be Xbox. So we've got great
momentum in the marketplace with the console which we've refreshed a year ago, with Kinect which just came to
market last holiday, with a bunch of new content and titles that Bill talked about in terms of games as well as broader
entertainment content. So as we look to continue the momentum that we have with our share position in the
marketplace, you see the strategy really coming together in that business. Selling the install base of the console and
then having the social connectivity with Xbox Live and the broader entertainment portfolio. And so a lot of that
strength relates to the Xbox business.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Additionally, I mean I think it's fair to say that our division thinks that we've just scratched the
surface of the possibilities with both the Xbox console and Kinect, and obviously as I talked about with the games that
we have coming out at Christmas people are super excited about the possibilities there.

Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Hi. Thank you, Bill and Peter. I just had a quick question. There's a been a lot of talk about
patents and money that you guys could be receiving for patent violations. How do we think about modeling those, if
there's any tips you could give us and how do we think about those, where they would show up and what segment they
get embedded in? Thank you.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks, Heather. I think the most important thing to think about stepping back is our overall
approach, right? We have a firm culture and belief in innovation, and intellectual property and protecting our rights,
intellectual property and we've done that consistently with a industry wide licensing program related to Android
specifically, broadly too, but Android which infringes on some of our patents. I think – we haven't talked a lot about
what to expect from a modeling perspective on that so you should just look to what we do on our licensing program
going forward.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi, guys, great quarter. Just going back to deferred revenue, obviously that was well ahead
of consensus and I think it's the strongest year-over-year growth you've had in MBD since '06 and Server & Tools since
'08. What really changed this quarter, the second half of the fiscal year that drove that up so much from what we've
been seeing over the past couple of years? And just anything specific to those two divisions as well. Thanks.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yes, thanks. No, there's several things. One, the business refresh has continued as companies
have come out of the economic downturn of a few years ago. They are really investing in technology, they're seeing the
opportunities for technology to really enhance their value proposition and they are seeing the benefit of our technology.
They're really making a long-term commitment to our product set.
In MBD, it's really about the intentional strategy we've had really over the last three to five years to sort of broaden the
view of what productivity means and how we integrate not only the great new Office applications but also with e-mail
with Exchange, collaboration, with SharePoint and more recently, communications with Lync. And customers are
really seeing the benefit of that. We're really just starting to scratch the surface on that. As I said on the call, a lot of our
revenue was driven by growth in those businesses and if you add to that what we're doing with Dynamics and taking
share in both ERP and CRM, it really is driving a lot of growth, and that really is sustainable.
At the same time, in Server and Tools we've really scaled our products across the board, whether that's with the
premium versions of Windows Server and System Center and also SQL Server. And so as we've done that and
customers are investing in their data centers and the private cloud limitations on the way to the public cloud, we're
taking advantage of that and getting good double digit growth there. So really the combination of really a strong
environment for businesses investing in the value of IT and our product set sort of across the board from infrastructure
to applications has been great.

<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Peter, just on the enterprise demand, is there any change in terms of what you're seeing in
the U.S. versus European demand profile?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: This quarter we actually saw broad-based demand across all the geographies. Obviously
emerging markets remained very strong. But this quarter we saw demand and great sales execution really across Europe
and the U.S.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Thanks, Brent. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question will be from John DiFucci, JPMC. Your line is open.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. Bill, when you said that 25% of enterprise desk tops are already deployed with
Windows 7 and 90% of enterprises have committed to a deployment plan, I'm just curious, is it fair to say that about
that 25%, should we be thinking of those as largely on the lower end in the SMB that act more like consumers, and
does the committed – your word there – committed, does that mean that they've already contracted for or they've started
to contract at a lower level and you expect that to continue going forward?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yes, that's a great question. On the enterprise side, clearly companies like JPMorgan have
started looking at Windows 7 or working on the deployment plan. When we think about the term "committed," it means
that either a Microsoft sales rep or a partner actually have plans in place where they're looking at a rollout schedule so
it's a very deliberate plan, they're engaged in testing, in many cases – I think we talked about that last quarter but not so
much this quarter – they're also rolling out Office 2010 at the same time that they're rolling out the Windows 7 desktop.
So we're excited obviously about the speed of the deployment process that's been underway, but we also think there's a
lot of opportunity for the future. And I think to your point, probably enterprises are a little bit further along, just due to
the probably – the macroeconomic environment. We've seen more deliberate execution there than maybe in some of the
other areas. That's a great question.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Robert Breza, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Breza>: Hi, Peter. I was wondering if you could talk to, I think your comment you said that you believed
unearned revenue could grow low double-digits. I'm assuming most of that's going to be coming on the enterprise side.
And you specifically called out in your commentary some of the drivers to the growth. Could you maybe just help us
clarify that in terms of the unearned revenue? Thanks.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yes, you're correct that most of that growth will come from the enterprise, and it goes back to
that strength we're seeing in selling multi-year licensing agreements and the demand we're seeing for the product set
across the portfolio of the Business Division and the Server & Tools business. So the dynamics that we saw this past
quarter, we see playing out again next year, and that will drive the unearned growth for the full year.
I would add, and I talked about this a little earlier, but I'll go back to it again. The conversations increasingly that we're
having with the cloud, whether that's Office 365 or Windows Azure or Windows Intune or Dynamics CRM Online,
really play into that as well because we find increasingly customers wanting to make long-term commitments when
they see that migration path to the cloud as well and that, you'll see that come into I think even more play this year.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Yeah, I think communicating our road map to our customers has been a big advantage and they
like our road map, they're committed to our road map and that's been a really good thing.

Thank you. Brad Reback, Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
<Q - Brad Robert Reback>: All right. Great, guys. Thanks a lot. Peter, on the revenue per search aspect with Yahoo!,
can you give us any sense how far along the road you are there? Do you think you're 50% of the way to getting the
problem solved?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Thanks, Brad. Good question. What we think and what we say and what we believe is we're on a
path and we're totally aligned with Yahoo! on this, and the collaboration has been fantastic and the right people are
focused on it. We'll have this turned around by the end of this calendar year and move forward from there and we're
still on a path to do that, and I think both sides are signed up for that plan.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Operator, next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Colin Gillis, from BGC. Your line is open.
<Q - Colin W. Gillis>: Hey, Peter, just on that same theme in online services, can you give us a sense what percent of
the expense is ongoing costs? And what percent might be transition costs that could possibly roll off?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: The bulk of it is ongoing costs. There's a little bit of transition costs, but you should think of the
bulk of it as ongoing costs. And really the dynamics of that business, as you know, are it's a high fixed cost business.
It's a scaled business, and as we grow our revenue per search, that's a highly leveraged revenue dollar that we get that
goes against that fixed cost base.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: So clearly improving our RPS is our goal that we're laser focused on, as we've talked about.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Completely.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. Brendan Barnicle, Pacific Crest Securities, your line is open.
<Q - Brendan Barnicle>: Thanks so much. Peter, how should we think about repatriation of cash as you guys generate
so much in some of these foreign jurisdictions?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Well, the broader issue of just income tax policy we'll leave to the experts. Obviously we're
supportive of long-term enhancements to our income tax policy. In terms of repatriation specifically, I don't think it's a
big issue one way or the other for either our operations or our strategies or what we're able to do. We've obviously had
a very good year, both in terms of our financial results and our ability to deliver cash back to shareholders.

<Q - Ed Maguire>: Yes, good afternoon. Could you discuss the monetization trends you may be seeing from Xbox
Live? It seems like you've got some decent subscriber growth.
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, no, it's really been fantastic. As we've grown the subscriber base, there's actually a couple
of revenue streams. There's the subscription revenue stream and then there's the transactional revenue stream for people
who actively engage with the service and that can buy purchases while they're engaged in that, and that really helps to
accelerate the monetization of that business and that's a really, really amazing long-term opportunity for us particularly
as we continue take share of just whole the console platform.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Thanks, Ed, and we'll do a call out for Ed who is calling us from Tokyo where it must be 4:00 in
the morning right now, so thanks for calling in, Ed. Operator, next question.
Operator
Thank you. The next question will be from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
<Q - Gregg Steven Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you and very nice quarter. Peter, I just had a question on guidance. In
the past you've talked about Windows revenue growth roughly tracking PC unit growth. We all know about the mix
shift to emerging markets, but is there anything you can say to help frame how we should think about the gap between
Windows revenue growth and overall PC growth in fiscal '12?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Yeah, you know, I think I would stick with the framework that we gave, and there's hopefully a
lot of texture to that. And depending on one – what assumption one makes about the growth in emerging markets
versus developed markets and businesses versus consumers, really impacts what that growth will be. Obviously the
more faster growth there is in emerging markets relative to developed is more headwind for the Windows growth
relative to the overall PC market. But I think, understanding what your belief is about those dynamics should help a lot
with that.
<A - Bill Koefoed>: Okay. Operator, let's take one more question, please.
Operator
Thank you. The final question will be from Tim Klasell, Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Tim Klasell>: Yes, good afternoon and congrats on the quarter as well. Office 365 has now been out in the
market for a little while, but you have multiple bundles at very wide price points. Can you sort of point to the – a
bundle or the bundles that appear to be the most popular right now?
<A - Peter S. Klein>: Well, it's been out for about a month, so it's really too early to tell. But I would say that the
philosophy behind the pricing is to provide the right set of choices for every customer and every segment depending on
what their needs are. And so ultimately I think we'll see a broad cross-section of customers choosing different pricing
plans, whether you're a small and medium business who's never had Exchange or SharePoint or Lync before, there's a
really affordable option for you to jump in. For enterprises who need much more scalability, who need premium
versions, they can pay a little bit more. And so, as always, we really believe in understanding what the different needs
are, different customer segments, and structuring our SKUs and our pricing to reflect the best options for every
customer segment depending on their needs.
