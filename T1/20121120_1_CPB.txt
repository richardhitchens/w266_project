MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Campbell Soup First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host,
Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Jennifer K. Driscoll
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call and webcast for Campbell Soup
Company. With me here in New Jersey today are Denise Morrison, President and CEO; Craig Owens, Senior Vice
President, CFO and Chief Administrative Officer; and Anthony DiSilvestro, Senior Vice President of Finance; as well
as Stephanie Varnum, Senior Manager Investor Relations. Denise will kick us off today with a strategic update, a few
thoughts on Hurricane Sandy, the highlights of our results for the first quarter and a few comments on the year. Then
Craig will offer his take on the quarter, including our segment results and then our guidance. After we take your

questions, Denise will make a few closing remarks.
As usual, we've created slides to accompany our earnings presentation. You'll find the slides posted on our website this
morning at investor.campbellsoupcompany.com. Please keep in mind that this call is open to members of the media
who are participating in listen-only mode.
As a reminder, our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, which reflect the company's current
expectations about future plans and performance. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions
and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to inherent risks. Please refer to slide three in the presentation
or to the company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a list of the factors that could cause our
actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements that we might make.
As you know, Campbell completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms on August 6, one week into the quarter. The
acquisition is now included in our results and it drove most of the year-over-year changes in the first quarter. The
quarter also includes $10 million in transaction costs related to the acquisition, which are included in our reported
results. On September 27, we announced a $115 million restructuring program designed to improve our U.S. supply
chain cost structure. Our first quarter reported results reflect $43 million of costs associated with that restructuring
program.
Our remarks today for the balance of our presentation will be on an adjusted basis, including Bolthouse Farms'
operating results for 12 of the 13 weeks of the quarter, but excluding the transaction costs and the restructuring charges.
Since our presentation includes non-GAAP measures as defined by SEC rules, we provided a reconciliation of the
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures as an appendix to the slides accompanying our presentation.
These slides along with our earnings release and selected quarterly financials also can be found on our website and one
other place.
One last item, to make it easier for our iPad and iPhone users to follow Campbell, we've made available to you in the
Apple App Store and Google Play Market a new app for viewing Campbell news releases, SEC filings and more on
smaller screens. You need to have iTunes installed, but the cost is reasonable, zero. Just search for Campbell IR. We'd
love to hear your input on your experience with it as we continue to be interested in improving the way we
communicate with you.
And with that, now let me turn the call over to Denise.
Denise M. Morrison
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for Campbell's first quarter earnings call. A few months ago, I
marked a year as the CEO of this great company. We have committed ourselves to focus forward relentlessly on a new
strategic vision that is centered on driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth.
Our three growth strategies are focused on accelerating the momentum of our existing businesses and extending our
platforms into new, higher growth segments and geographies. We are working diligently to be a more agile and
innovative company that is resolutely focused on the consumer. A company that better satisfies the needs of our core
baby boomer consumers and is also responsive to new consumer needs, to demographic and generational change, to the
increased demand for fresh foods, to the explosion of digital and social media, and to the evolving global culture of
food.
We know we are witnessing major shifts in the drivers of consumer choice, and at Campbell our rallying cry is
consumer first. We recently added some wonderful new talent to our senior leadership team. Mike Senackerib was
appointed Campbell's first Chief Marketing Officer. Mike will work to build our brand and product equities globally
and enhance our marketing capabilities particularly in the digital space.
We also announced that Luca Mignini will be our new President of International. Luca has deep experience in Asia,
Latin America and Europe and will lead the expansion of our international footprint in faster growing categories and in

faster growing geographies.
We are not yet a different company, but we are thinking very differently about Campbell's future than we did a year
ago. In fiscal 2013, we told you that we expect to return to growth in our base business. The addition of Bolthouse
Farms will contribute to both our top-line and our bottom-line growth. And we are acutely aware of the work we must
do now to deliver our long-term sales and earnings targets on a sustainable basis.
Before I talk about our results for the first quarter, I would like to make a few comments about Hurricane Sandy. First,
to everyone on this call who was affected by the storm, or whose family was affected, please know that our thoughts
are with you and with all that are working to restore ravaged communities. Our world headquarters in New Jersey and
Pepperidge Farm in Connecticut were closed for two days. Many of our employees suffered property damage and were
displaced due to loss of power. Scores of residents in our local communities still have needs for food, clothing and
shelter.
I am very proud of the many Campbell employees who stepped-up to volunteer, in addition to making financial
contributions to the Red Cross, the New Jersey Governor's Relief Fund and the Special United Way Hurricane Fund,
we have shipped products to numerous food banks and relief organizations. During the storm, we supported our
customers with extra merchandise and hurricane pallets. Our Pepperidge Farm distributors were in stores 24/7
replenishing bread and snacks. And we did see a very small benefit in soup during the last few days of October but it
was not material to the quarter.
This is not about business. It's about people. And in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, I saw what I have seen many
times before that the special quality of the Campbell Soup Company is its heart.
Turning now to business, this morning I'll offer my perspective on our progress as we execute our three growth
strategies, to stabilize and profitably grow North America Soup and Simple Meals, expand our international presence
and grow faster and healthy beverages and baked snacks.
Our new fiscal year is off to a solid start and we're encouraged by the progress we've made on advancing our growth
strategies. Our U.S. Soup and Simple Meals business delivered solid results with sales up 3% and operating earnings up
5% as we continue to optimize execution across all of the drivers of consumer demand.
In the quarter, we reduced advertising spending according to the plans we outlined at our analyst meeting in July. Our
advertising spending remained at competitive levels as we continued to run our effective It's Amazing What Soup Can
Do campaign for condensed soup and introduced new advertising for Campbell Chunky RTS soup. That campaign
returns Chunky to its NFL roots with Victor Cruz of the New York Giants demonstrating that Chunky fills you up
right. Ready-to-serve soups, condensed cooking soups and broths all performed well in the quarter. We also
successfully executed our previously announced price increase on condensed soup.
It's too early to judge our breakthrough innovation, particularly our Campbell's Go Soups and Campbell's Skillet
Sauces, but these launches are showing good retail acceptance. This is the start of strategic innovation platforms for
Campbell that we will build over time. These products are outcomes of a re-engineered innovation process to accelerate
our speed to market. They feature contemporary packaging and offer new global taste aimed at attracting new
consumers or serving new occasions. As I stated before, customers have been very supportive of these new products
and the many innovations in our base business. We introduced more than 50 new products this year in U.S. Soup and
Simple Meals, up from 3 just three years ago. While we continue to make important strides in U.S. Soup and Simple
Meals, we are not breaking out the champagne yet. We are encouraged, but we have more work to do on this large and
important business.
Bolthouse Farms had a very good quarter with growth in all three of its categories, beverages, salad dressings and
carrots. The new beverage products introduced last spring including Coffee Protein Plus, Orange and Carrot, and Fresh
Nog, yes, without the egg are all achieving distribution targets. As we stated, we are operating Bolthouse Farms as a
separate business unit and our integration of corporate services such as finance and legal, is on track.

Pepperidge Farm had positive sales in the crackers business driven by Goldfish and new Jingos partly offset by declines
in cookies and bakery. We did have a strong October with solid plans going forward for the holidays. Be on the lookout
for Goldfish, Finn and Friends in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
Our business in Asia-Pacific returned to growth this quarter with Australia stabilizing and Indonesia posting
double-digit sales gains. In Australia, a re-focus on core brands and better joint business plans with our customers have
helped results, despite a challenging retail and consumer environment.
In international, we continue to enjoy momentum in emerging markets with sales gains in Malaysia and Mexico. Parts
of our business continued to present challenges in quarter one. U.S. beverage sales declined 5%. Despite easing
inflation, we did not return to EBIT growth. We are re-balancing our consumer marketing towards the base V8 Red and
V8 V-Fusion business, introducing new advertising and prioritizing our innovation on the highest potential product
platforms, energy and kids' juice boxes. We do have positive momentum on V8 Splash. In North America Foodservice,
our retail fresh soups grew, while our traditional Foodservice business did not. In addition, Europe had subpar
performance, albeit in a difficult environment.
Notwithstanding some challenges, overall, our quarter one results have enabled us to reaffirm our annual guidance of
net sales growth plus 10% to 12%, adjusted EBIT growth plus 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth plus 3% to 5%. As
we've stated before, we anticipate returning to positive organic growth on the base business, but expect to be below our
long-term targets this year.
Now, I'll turn it over to Craig for a discussion of our segment results.
B. Craig Owens
Thanks, Denise. Good morning, everybody. I'll spend a few minutes discussing our first quarter results and segment
highlights followed by comments on our full-year sales and earnings guidance. As Jennifer referenced, my discussion
results will exclude the impact of the restructuring charge, as well as transaction costs associated with the Bolthouse
Farms acquisition.
So for the quarter, we reported net sales of $2.3 billion, an 8% increase from the first quarter of 2012. Excluding the
impact of currency and the Bolthouse Farms acquisition, organic net sales increased by 1% in the quarter. Excluding
restructuring costs and acquisition transaction costs, adjusted EBIT increased 5% to $438 million. Of the adjusted EBIT
increase, three points came from adding Bolthouse and two points came from growth in the base business primarily
driven by U.S. Simple Meals. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 this quarter, a 7% increase from the first quarter
of 2012.
On slide 22, you see that Bolthouse Farms contributed eight points to sales growth, while currency subtracted one point
due to the euro weakening against the U.S. dollar. Organic sales increased 1% as pricing contributed two points and
promotional spending subtracted one point. The pricing gains reflected increases on condensed soup in the U.S. and
across our Baking and Snacking segment. The promotional spending variance was primarily related to Global Baking
and Snacking. We continue to invest to remain competitive in our Arnott's and Pepperidge Farm businesses.
Our adjusted gross margin percentage declined by 160 basis points to 37.9% from 39.5%. The decline was primarily
attributable to the impact of the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which operates at a lower gross margin structure. The
inflation rate in cost of goods sold was approximately 4%, which is in line with our expectation for the full year.
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 3% to $254 million. Advertising and consumer promotion expense declined
by 15%. The primary cause of the declines was our planned reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expenses
in the U.S. Soup business partly offset by the impact of adding Bolthouse Farms. Although U.S. Soup advertising and
consumer promotion expenses declined compared with the prior year, we are maintaining competitive levels of support
on the base business, while investing behind our new launches.

Administrative expenses for the quarter increased by $17 million due to adding Bolthouse and incurring higher
compensation and benefit costs, including the expected increases in pension expense.
Below the operating earning lines, net interest expense increased 18% or $5 million. The increase was due to a higher
level of debt to fund the acquisition of Bolthouse, partly offset by lower rates on the debt portfolio. The adjusted tax
rate declined by 60 basis points to 31.6% from 32.2% in the prior year, due to the favorable settlement of a U.S. state
tax matter. With the lower tax rate offsetting increased interest expense, adjusted net earnings increased 5% this
quarter. Adjusted earnings per share benefited from fewer shares outstanding and grew by 7%.
First quarter segment sales and the corresponding organic growth rates are shown on the next slide. Sales of U.S.
Simple Meals increased by 3% with gains in both U.S. Soup and U.S. Sauces. U.S. Soup sales rose 2% driven by gains
in broth and ready-to-serve soup, partially offset by a decline in condensed soup. U.S. Sauce sales grew 4%, primarily
driven by strong gains in Prego pasta sauce, the launch of Campbell's Skillet Sauces and the growth of Pace Mexican
sauce. These gains were partly offset by lower sales of gravy.
Global Baking and Snacking sales increased by 1% fueled by gains in Pepperidge Farm and Arnott's. Pepperidge Farm
sales increased on the strength of another solid quarter of growth in Goldfish snack crackers and by the launch of
Jingos. Pepperidge had sales declines in cookies and bakery. Sales in Arnott's increased primarily due to double-digit
gains in Indonesia. Biscuit sales in Australia were comparable to the prior year.
Organic sales for International Simple Meals and Beverages increased by 2%. Higher sales in the Asia-Pacific region,
Latin America and Canada were partially offset by declines in Europe. In Canada, higher selling prices contributed to
sales growth, and in Europe lower sales in Germany were partially offset by higher sales in France. In Asia-Pacific,
sales increased due to the strong growth in Japan and Malaysia.
Our Bolthouse Farms and Foodservice reporting segment now includes the recently acquired Bolthouse business along
with North American Foodservice, which had been reported separately. Of the segment's $323 million in sales for the
quarter, Bolthouse contributed $171 million. Organic sales, excluding the acquisition and currency impact, declined by
6%. This decrease in North American Foodservice sales was primarily due to declines in frozen and canned soup sales,
partially offset by volume-driven gains and fresh chilled soup sold at retail.
U.S. Beverages sales decreased by 5% in the quarter, the decrease was due to declines in V8 vegetable juice and V8
V-Fusion beverages, partially offset by an increase in V8 Splash. The decrease in V8 V-Fusion was primarily due to
declines in the existing base business, partially offset by growth in new products, including energy drinks and juice
boxes.
Operating earnings for Simple Meals rose by 5% to $274 million this quarter. The increase reflects earnings gains in
U.S. Soup, partly offset by a decline in U.S. Sauce. Within the segment, the benefits from productivity improvements,
higher selling prices net of related volume impacts and lower marketing expense were partly offset by cost inflation.
Earnings of Global Baking and Snacking declined by 3%, reflecting lower earnings in both Arnott's and Pepperidge
Farm. Both businesses were negatively impacted by increased promotional spending as we continue to invest in highly
competitive markets. Within International, Simple Meals and Beverages, earnings increased by 9% largely driven by
growth in Asia-Pacific and Canada. Earnings in Europe declined. For the segment, the increase in operating earnings
was primarily driven by organic sales gains and an increase in gross margin percentage.
Operating earnings within the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment increased by 26% or $7 million. The increase
included $14 million from the addition of Bolthouse Farms and a decrease in earnings from North American
Foodservice. Operating earnings for U.S. Beverages were comparable to the prior year, as the impact of lower volume
was offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense.
U.S. Soup sales for the quarter increased by 2%, consumer takeaway in the quarter was down about 1%.
Ready-to-serve soups and broth sales benefited from movements in customer inventory levels, reflecting accelerated
merchandising activity for the quarter. Sales of condensed soup declined by 1% as declines in eating varieties were
only partly offset by gains in cooking varieties. Our pricing in response to inflation in condensed soup has not resulted

in any unexpected volume pressure. RTS soup sales increased by 4%. Volume-driven gains and Campbell's Chunky
canned soups were partially offset by declines in microwavable soups. Campbell's Go Soups, launched this quarter,
added to the sales growth. Broth sales grew 9%, primarily due to volume-driven gains in both aseptically packaged and
canned broths.
Slide 29 is a look at U.S. retail sales of wet soup for the last 52 weeks based on Symphony IRI multi-outlet data. The
U.S. wet soup category rose by 0.5% in the last 52 weeks. Campbell Soup sales for the same period declined 2.7%.
This performance compares with a gain of 8.4% for other branded players and flat results for private label. Campbell
maintained a strong leadership position with a market share of 58.7% for the year. Private label players held their share
while other branded players gained share.
Cash flow from operations was $81 million compared with $73 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures of
$41 million were up from $35 million a year ago. For the year, we continue to forecast capital spending of
approximately $333 million, including spending at Bolthouse Farms. As we previously announced, we suspended the
strategic share repurchase program so that we can use our cash flow to reduce the debt we incurred to finance the
Bolthouse acquisition. However, we continue to repurchase sufficient shares to offset dilution from equity
compensation programs. Net debt rose to $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion due to the acquisition.
This morning, we confirmed our fiscal 2013 guidance. I'd like to point out that as we look at the progression of the
year, we believe that the second quarter profitability could be negatively impacted by the fact that we are exiting the
first quarter with high soup inventories due to strong holiday sell-in and by a planned increase in marketing support for
new products, notably Campbell's Go Soup and Campbell's Skillet Sauces.
As a result, EPS for the second quarter is likely to lag our full year guidance growth rate. We continue to expect to
grow sales for the year between 10% and 12%, with adjusted EBIT growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of
3% to 5%. Within these ranges, currency is expected to be neutral to slightly negative. We expect interest expense to
increase approximately $30 million, primarily due to the acquisition financing, and the tax rate to be between 31% and
32%.
As we mentioned, we completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms this quarter and financed the purchase with debt.
Our guidance includes the estimated impact of the Bolthouse business and excludes the impact of one-time acquisition
transaction cost and also cost associate with recently announced restructuring program. We expect the acquisition to
contribute approximately $750 million to sales and to add $0.05 to $0.07 to our adjusted EPS, including the impact of
suspending our strategic share repurchases.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn them back to Jennifer now.
Jennifer K. Driscoll
Thank you, Craig. At this time, we will conduct the Q&A session. We'd like to request that callers limit themselves to

<Q - Andrew Lazar>: I just wanted to drill down a little bit on some of the commentary, Craig, around the inventory
or the accelerated inventory levels. Just want to be clear, was that I guess part of the plan in your first quarter obviously
to ship in a little more aggressively maybe than last year such that you're ready to go for your merchandising plans?
And I guess if we were to think about the fiscal first half as opposed to just the first quarter versus the second, how
should we think about your expectation for soup sales maybe on that kind of a basis?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, I think you're hitting it right, Andrew, by focusing on the first half. The acceleration
in inventory coming out of the quarter was due to our holiday sell-in for November and December. Some retailers are
shipped earlier this year than last year. We're encouraged though by the strong merchandising plans that we have. And
it's also been rotated amongst different brands. So, coming into the quarter, we had a higher level of inventory. We
maintained that and so coming out of the quarter, we're still at those levels. So, we just wanted to manage people's
expectations for the half.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Is your, sorry, sorry...
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Part of it, Andrew, is just the calendar, right? We have an earlier Thanksgiving this year and
so I think retailers have just been a little bit ahead of the curve and maybe a little bit of the storm impact too, which fell
right at the end of the quarter.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Is your hope that through the first half that we'd see soup sales in positive territory or is
it just still – I mean the second quarter obviously huge from that perspective from a takeaway standpoint?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Right. We don't forecast as you know soup sales separately, but we're happy with the start that
we're off to.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks very much.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Next question, please.

Our next question comes from Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: Thanks. Hi, everybody.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Ed.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward Aaron>: So, I want to ask about the A&C spending in the quarter. I guess I didn't fully appreciate how
much it might be down in Q1. Can you tell us if that was fully planned? And then as kind of a broader follow-up
question to that, some food companies are starting to talk about shifting A&C spending back above the line just to kind
of manage price points lower, just given the consumer environment. And I'm wondering if that's a dynamic that you're
expecting on some level to happen with your business as well over the next few quarters? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It's true our quarter one A&C expense declined by 15%, primarily due to reduced
spending on U.S. Soup and partially offset by an increase of support for new innovation. It is in the range of the plans
for the full year. And we did move some money into increased promotion, particularly in the Bakery and the Baked
Snacks business.

<Q - Jason English>: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for the question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason English>: So lots of potential questions here. Let me focus on the fresh baking business which I think you
said was still challenged this quarter. The industry here in the U.S. is in a state of flux with one of your competitors
having now suspended production distribution. How do you think about that scenario and what the implications maybe
for your business going forward?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right now, we are seeing in the latest two months, some pressure and we're getting
industry reports on that. The parts of the business that are more robust are the casual dining, healthcare and education.
But overall, we're not pleased with the performance of our Foodservice business this quarter. Oh, I'm sorry. I heard you
– Jason, did you say Foodservice or...?
<Q - Jason English>: Specifically I'm asking fresh bakery implications of hostess?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Oh, the hostess, the Bakery business? I'm sorry.
<Q - Jason English>: Yeah, no worries.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay. Well, I answered another question that you might have had.
<Q - Jason English>: I appreciate that. It's like a two-for-one special.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay, there you go. We're monitoring the hostess situation. We – and of course our
manufacturing supply chain and distributors are standing ready to ensure that customers aren't at risk for any supply
interruptions caused by this. This is a business that is continuously changing through consolidation and price
discounting and we just feel that we're well positioned to play in this – in the part of the business that we occupy right
now, which is more the upper end.
<Q - Jason English>: Okay and one more, if I could sneak it in. Bolthouse, I know it's still young as part of your
portfolio, but it's got a unique distribution platform. Denise, can you talk to us, whether it be broad strokes or hopefully
as much specificity as possible in terms of your innovation plans and how you intend to leverage that?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right now, it's early days, but we're very pleased with the performance in all three
categories of Bolthouse and some of that growth has been driven by new innovation, particularly in the Beverage
business, but also increased in distribution in the salad dressing business.

<Q - David C. Driscoll>: Hi. So wanted to ask a little bit more about condensed soup and I wasn't sure if you're
inventory comments were more focused on one side or the other, but on condensed soup, you had in the fourth quarter,
I think it was – the fourth quarter – it's always hard to interpret some of these quarters because they're not the same in
terms of total volumes, but it was like a 10% or double-digit growth in volumes last quarter, and now this quarter's

sales are down 1%. I don't know the volumes, but is this what you're trying to lead us to where the inventories are just
coming in a little bit full right now going into Q2?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yeah, so, David, we've actually seen a little bit of a rotation. You're exactly right; as we came
out of the fourth quarter our condensed inventories were a little bit higher than normal. The good news there is that we
saw good sell-through on the back-to-school and other promotional activity that had created those higher inventories.
And now as we've come more into the – run up to the holiday season coming out of the first quarter, the higher
inventory levels are really driven more by RTS. So you've had the rotation of inventory – it's not the same inventory,
it's not even around the same product line and you've got – consequently you've got a little bit of a mix-shift issue as we
rotated out of condensed and into RTS, but it's – I think overall you can think about soup inventories continuing to be a
little bit higher than normal as we come out of the quarter, but it's more RTS and broth than it is condensed.
<Q - David C. Driscoll>: And one quick follow-up on some your Bolthouse comments. Was the profit contribution in
the quarter kind of below normal, i.e., was purchase accounting a factor here on the inventories, I've a few questions
from people on that this morning.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So, yes, purchase accounting is going to be an issue and you're right to point the inventories on
the first year will run off the write-up of the purchase accounting impact on inventory. Also remember that we had one
less week of Bolthouse in this first quarter than we did for the total company.

Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Hi, Alexia.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi. Can I just ask you to maybe elaborate a little bit on the weakness in the Beverage
segment? You mentioned slackening consumer demand. I was a little surprised that, that might be kicking in now rather
than maybe earlier in the economic downturn. Is it something to do with pricing versus other juices or can you tell us a
little bit more about what's going on there?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, the beverage category, particularly the shelf-stable juice category has been under
pressure for quite some time now and we continue to observe behavior that consumers are trading down, particularly
from the 100% juice businesses that we're in, there has been some competition that's been very price aggressive that has
negatively affected our V8 vegetable juice and V8 V-Fusion. However, our V8 Splash continues to perform very well.
And our new item innovations are continuing to contribute to sales growth, but they haven't been sufficient enough to
overcome the category weaknesses or the aggressive price pressures. So what we're going to do about it is we're
shoring up the core business with line extensions on V8 and improved taste. We're also playing in value by pushing V8
Splash, and then we're innovating in high-growth segments such as energy and kids. And we think that a combination
of easing inflation and productivity improvements will help us with improved EBIT for the year. So that's how we're
looking at it at this point.

Our next question comes from Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Matt.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Denise, I just wanted to try and get some insight into how you are thinking about the
promotional support you are putting behind soup during the soup season. And if we look at the measured channel data
for ready-to-serve it looks like pricing is down year on year in ready-to-serve in recent periods and that we – that's
driven a fairly pronounced increase in volumes more recently. Is that consistent with what you're seeing in your
business? And is this any indication of a change in the way you're thinking about the optimal balance between
innovation driven growth and promotion over the next few months?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Again, we're optimizing all of the drivers of demand, and in addition to product and
packaging there is a merchandising factor, and we're looking at each brand given its competitive set. So in the first
quarter, we were very aggressive in promoting particularly our Chunky brand as we repositioned it. We improved the
label on the brand to emphasize the delicious food and the soup that eats like a meal. We went to the NFL with Victor
Cruz, and so we did put some support behind that brand to get some momentum.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And would you say that was more an issue of sort of the timing of your
merchandising plans? Or is that a strategy that might persist through the second quarter?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, I think you can plan on seeing aggressive merchandising plans.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you, Denise.

Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Hi. Just building on that last question, in ready-to-serve, it looked like you had a good last
month, the promotions were up. Select Harvest repositioned 100% Natural, how is that working specifically? And then
is it too early to tell how the new messaging around the low-fat high-protein messaging in the NFL – is that gaining
traction on the Chunky portfolio, any sense there? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: The performance of RTS this quarter really was because of brand Chunky, and the 100%
Natural soup is flowing through to the shelf and has been down versus year ago, and we'll continue to put the adequate
support on that business as well because it is an important business to us. It's too soon to tell on some of the new
products, but some of the new products that we introduced last year, like Slow Kettle, Slow Kettle's consumption and
share are both up in the quarter, and our new flavor boost product was down in the quarter. However, we are flowing
through a new pack which – we shifted from an eight-pack to a four-pack and reduced the price to $2 to increase the
trial because our repeat is very good on this product. So we did learn a lot last year from the introduction of that
product.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Is the light soup area – is that something that you think will stabilize as the fiscal year
progresses? I mean, clearly, where I'm getting at is that portfolio has been repositioned a couple of times and I'm
wondering if you are a little bit more optimistic about this go around.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, it's still, I mean it's still a smaller part of our portfolio and we did – we are now
emphasizing the 100% Natural and it really will be up to the consumer to decide.

Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: I just had two quick questions for you. The first one I guess for you, Denise, will be
just in relation to Global Baking and Snacking, to understand the growth of the U.S. business versus the international
business I guess to understand how Arnott's in Australia is performing versus say Pepperidge in the U.S.?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, Pepperidge in the U.S. grew but it was growing because of the cracker business.
Goldfish and Jingos were up high single digits. And it offset some declines in our cookie business and in our bakery
business but we have seen better momentum in October and going into the holidays. In Arnott's, the situation is – they
are still competing in a difficult market. We've seen improvements in the business. We are continuing to gain share
there. So, we are feeling better about Australia this year in the biscuit business.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Craig in relation to Bolthouse. Is there –
I'm trying to think about the seasonality of the business. Are there – and to make sure I have this modeled properly
going forward, there was a little bit more profit this quarter than I thought is what it comes down to. Is that a function
of this quarter? Is there a seasonality factor to consider, is the question?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: There's a little bit of seasonality. You didn't see it so much in this quarter because again we
had one less week in the quarter than we do in the full year. The seasonality comes from the carrot business being a
little heavier in the second quarter. That's partially offset by the fact that beverages are a little bit stronger in the
summer. So, the business overall is less seasonal than Campbell's business so it won't have a material impact on the
total company seasonality.

<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I guess two questions. One is I was kind of surprised and I guess we touched on it a little bit,
but I was kind of surprised that the margins in U.S. Simple Meals were slightly over 30%. I don't remember the last
time the margins were that high in the segment, although I guess it's changed a little bit over time. But is – obviously
the lower advertising versus the higher inventory I guess is partly explaining it, but I'm kind of wondering if you could
go into a little bit more detail. Is there the timing of inflation versus the restructuring action you took? I just – I'm trying
to get a better sense as to what's making those margins so high this quarter.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: So the restructuring action wouldn't have any impact in the quarter. I think the primary thing
that you're probably seeing versus prior quarter is the reduced advertising and consumer promotional expense, Eric.

<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yeah, I would just add there is a pretty significant seasonality to the profitability of the
Simple Meals segment. It ranges from 30% to as low as 20% in the other quarters.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Right.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: [indiscernible] (42:16).
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Even year-over-year, I mean, it's been a while since we've hit over 30% in that segment.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: It looks like it's only up about a point from the prior year.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Yeah. Okay and then I guess on the Go soup product, Denise, are you sensing any pushback
on the price point? Because I guess we've seen some commentary that that might be a price point that's a little difficult
for Millennials at the moment. Is there any initial sense of that at the trade level?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No. We have not gotten any feedback on that and we recognize that the price is more
premium than some of our other offerings but so far – and again it's early days, the repeat on this item is pretty robust
so it's all about getting consumer trial over the next several quarters. But we haven't heard any pushback on pricing.
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Most of the [ph] ATV (43:21) is now at $2.99, which we feel is a pretty good price point for
that product.

<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Good morning. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Hello. So, I guess I wanted to just think about – I mean, on the advertising, the total A&C
spending particularly behind Soup, I guess – can you give us sort of a long-term target where you think that ought to
work out for a business of this margin structure?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We – our long-term target and our short-term target right now is to be fully competitive
and we're basing that on a variety of benchmarks, such as percent of sales and share of voice, to name two. We think
that it's really important for these brands to think about all of the drivers of demand and make sure that we are putting
our spending where we're going to get the maximum impact, and that could vary by brand and even by segment. So I
cited the Chunky example earlier, and that seems to be working.
<Q - Jonathan P. Feeney>: Okay, if I could just follow up, Denise, then. I guess competitive is – when you say
competitive, I guess, are you thinking inside the soup category? Because I mean – I guess one of the – how are you
framing that? Because when I look at – it seems to me a lot of the potential – the slowdown – a potential explanation
for the slowdown in the soup category period is that its leader hasn't spent enough on advertising the past three or four
years. And so, you might be keeping up with the competition, but the category as a whole maybe has suffered. And I
think the innovation helps, but are you – when you say competitive, are you talking about competitive within soup or
competitive broadly with spending rates in other categories as you see them?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, in the case of soup, we look at both within soup and also within the broader context
of the 30-plus categories that we track in Simple Meals. And quite frankly, in the U.S. Soup business, we did lower our
advertising, but in our other businesses, our advertising either stayed the same or increased.

question.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Spillane>: Denise, we just, now that you're five quarters into this and with all of the effort that's been put
into Simple Meals and Soup, in particular, do you have a sense at this point whether you've changed – there has been
any change or been able to kind of move the change in consumer habits at home? I think as we kind of went into this
over year ago, it's one thing to be able to sort of merchandise and get people to pull it off the shelf, but the more
important thing is to really get people to actually consume the products at home. And I understand it is a little bit early,
especially with all of the new products that have come out. But how do you feel about movement that you have made
or progress that you have made in that regard in terms of just getting people to actually go home and use the products?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Well, I think it's early days on the new products to declare victory there. I do think that
the new products are helping to create somewhat of a buzz about soup in general, which is important, because people
don't think about it as often as they should and so that reminding them is important. But I think we've done a good job
in terms of executing at Campbell's to put some new experiences out to the market for the consumer to enjoy and
particularly younger consumers to attract them into the category. We're going to continue to build on those platforms.
This is not going to be a one-year wonder. So I think these are still early days, but I really do believe we're on the right
course here.

Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Good morning, Ken.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Can you talk a little bit about the signal that you're sending perhaps to retailers by perhaps
cutting marketing spending on your core soups a little bit? And the reason I'm asking is there has been some
conversation lately about perhaps some of your larger retailers reconsidering whether it's a great use of space to use
gravity-feed shelves or not. And I'm just wondering when I talk to retailers and they think about soup whether the
manufacturers are really committed to the can whether that's something that they should be committed to as well. So
can you just talk a little bit about the balance between how you think about that and maybe spending more on
marketing to allay their fears or continue to drive down the spending to help your margins a bit?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, I can. First of all, in terms of the shelving, we actually have [ph] IT (49:18)
maximizers in greater than 25,000 stores and that seems to be servicing the consumer very well in terms of making it
easier to shop, and from an operations standpoint, it's holding up to the retailers' standards. So, I'm not sure what the

link is for shelf space that you're talking about, but we have not seen an impact on shelf space at this point. In fact, with
the new products that we're introducing, we're having conversations to make sure that we are accommodating all of our
products on the shelf and continuing to bring the retailers new and exciting things to increase their center store sales.
The second part of your question on cutting marketing. We had increases in advertising and consumer in all of our
categories with the exception of soup and we have not cut our total marketing. We had expenses in advertising and
consumer decline, but we are spending against these products in a very competitive way, and we're explaining that to
retailers and we're getting support.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: And then one quick follow-up on David Driscoll's question about Bolthouse and foodservice
margins. Should we expect a similar decline year on year in that segment's margin going forward then?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Yes. So Bolthouse operates structurally at a significantly lower margin rate than the rest of the
company. I think the first quarter margin structure is probably pretty reflective of the full year for that segment now.
Right?
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: So somewhere around 10.5% is not unreasonable?

Our next question comes from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Thilo.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: When I look at the breakdown of the soup sales with condensed down but ready-to-serve being up
4% and I compare that with scanner data, scanner data looks much different I think, at least in ready-to-serve. Why
would I not think that the difference between scanner data and the data that you show today is just driven by the
channel fill and the sell-through of the – channel fill with the new products and the sell-through just isn't there yet?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, so, Thilo, I think we did say that we're exiting the quarter with higher inventories and
that there has been some rotation in those inventories toward ready-to-serve. So, I mean, I think you're right. We saw
heavier sales of both broth and ready-to-serve in the quarter than we saw consumption, and it's largely associated with
selling in ahead of the holiday and merchandising activity that's scheduled out over the first few weeks of November
here. So I think your reading is approximately right.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: But is it sell-in across the entire portfolio in ready-to-serve or is it focused on the new product?
<A - B. Craig Owens>: Well, clearly you've got some pipeline fill on the new product, but it's not just new product. In
fact it's probably heaviest in broth which as you can imagine is a big holiday item. So it's broth, it's ready-to-serve and
it's the new products.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Right. And we've also had new innovations on our base business too.

<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thanks for the question.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Rob.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. I just was looking at the U.S. Beverages segment and it looks like sales will end up being
flat pretty much to where they were in 2010. So there really hasn't been any growth in the segment and profits are way
down. Can you give us a sense within that mix – I understand the strategy is to extend into more single serve items and
maybe away from core V8 Red. Can you give us a sense of what's happened to like the core V8 Red during this time,
whether new products are now a bigger part of the pie? And then secondly, I thought heard there might have to be a
wait out on V8 Red during the course of this year to compensate for higher commodity costs. And are you concerned
that this would hurt volume further on the core business? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, I am not – I don't know where you heard that there would be a wait out on V8 Red.
Right now, our plan on V8 Red – and we do believe that we need to call more attention to it – is to improve the taste on
the original V8 Red, to celebrate the taste in our advertising and we have hint of lime and black pepper flavor
extensions to create some news for that 100% juice offering. And we are refocusing on our base 100% juice, while we
also push V8 Splash, which has done very well. But the entire category has been pretty soft for a number of quarters
now.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Denise, do you mean the entire vegetable juice-based category?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: No, no, no, no. The entire shelf stable juice category, particularly in the 100% Juice
segment.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Okay. What about non-carbonated beverages in general. Like I always thought that that was a
faster growing segment of overall beverages. Do you look at yourself in that context also?

<Q - Diane Geissler>: Was it an extra week of inventory, two weeks of inventory; was it all across your entire product
line?

Diane? So consumption was down one, sales were up. That – without forecasting the soup sales or – and particularly
without forecasting them by quarter, I think that's the best way to sort of keep tabs on where we are and sell-in versus
consumption.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: And the sell-in against the holiday season, of course the consumption happens in another
quarter. So the good news is that we're getting good merchandising support. But I do think you have to look at it on a
season basis.
<Q - Diane Geissler>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Good morning, Akshay.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Akshay.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Hi. My first question is just regarding the U.S. consumer overall. You have a pretty big
footprint in the center of the store and some other companies recently have said they have seen the consumer shift back
to the center of the store a little bit more, recently. Have you seen that? I mean, are you seeing consumption sort of
increase for food categories in the center of the store?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We track the Simple Meals category, and over 52 weeks, the consumption's been up over
2%, and in the last 14 weeks, it's been a little bit over 1%, so it's still trailing 52 weeks.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on marketing, you made – you hired somebody to lead
your marketing division. I was just wanting to get your perspective on what this particular person adds that you didn't
have, per se, before in your organization and how it sort of links to the future sort of demand trends that you see
longer-term?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We have a center of excellence that works on our advertising and design. Our marketing
excellence, which is training for our people to make sure we're building skills. Obviously, with the transition of
connecting with consumers through the digital space, that's going to require some real focus and at expertise. And then
being the support system for the brand management in the business units so that there is a – continuing to build on the
standards of excellence for driving a growth agenda. So we believe he'll be a really good addition in terms of focusing
us there.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Okay. So I guess we're coming up on the hour. I apologize to any of you that we didn't get
to, but we're going to move to our wrap up.

So in conclusion, we'd like to leave you with some key points from today's call. Our new fiscal year is off to a solid
start and Campbell is becoming more agile, more innovative and more focused on the consumer. We recruited some
wonderful new talent in marketing and in international. We've posted encouraging gains in U.S. Soup and Simple
Meals as we continue to optimize all the drivers of consumer demands across our key brands.
And while it's too early to judge our breakthrough innovations, we firmly believe that our reengineered innovation
process enhances our ability to attract new consumers and serve new occasions. Our first quarter with Bolthouse Farms
was strong and the integration is on track. Challenges do remain in our U.S. Beverage business, but we are course
correcting and expect more of a recovery in the coming quarters.
Overall, we're able to reiterate our annual guidance for the year of sales growth of 10% to 12%, adjusted EBIT growth
of 4% to 6%, and adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 5%. But I want to make sure that my message to you is clear: we are
encouraged but not satisfied. We know what we have to do and what our opportunities are, and we're clearly making
progress, but we're not there yet.
Hurricane Sandy reminded us that we have a lot to be thankful for here at Campbell. Among many other things, we're
thankful to have leading brands to compete with, strong margins, amazing cash flow and above all, talented and
dedicated employees with a lot of heart. So we wish you and yours a very happy Thanksgiving. And with that, Jennifer,
please provide the closing reminders.
