It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen.
Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone.
DuPont delivered a strong finish to a great year, and during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we've been
steadfastly focused on our 2010 directives with disciplined execution across the board. Our consistent focus on
market-driven innovation, cost and capital productivity, and differential allocation of resources delivered very strong
results for the year. We will look back on 2010 as the year we benefited from recovery, created our own momentum,
and emerged as a stronger, well-positioned company.
We did it by building on the aggressive actions we took in response to the global financial crisis, and I'm not just
talking about restructuring and cost-cutting. I'm referring to the thoughtful strategic choices that we made specifically
to prepare for global economic recovery and truly emerge a more agile and disciplined company.
To cite just a few examples, we accelerated the implementation of DuPont Production Systems at our plant sites. We
redeployed employees on mega projects to structurally reduce working capital. And we made tough choices on
under-performing assets, and we had the fortitude not to cut our R&D spend.
Our 2010 results are summarized on slide 2, and we've outlined it in a way that's consistent with our internal set of
directives. We delivered sales growth of 21% with a wide variance by business, reflecting how different markets were
affected by the global financial crisis and how our businesses responded.
We delivered strong top line growth in areas that were minimally affected by the global crisis such as production,
agriculture, and photovoltaics. These businesses executed well with new product launches, share gains, improved
margins, and strong momentum as we head into 2011. We also delivered outstanding growth as certain businesses
benefited from early recovery and restocking, such as Ti02, electronics, parts of our chemical businesses, and
polymers.
As an example, we were prepared when auto builds recovered more than twice as fast as expected last year.
Certainly industrial markets were slower to recover as expected. Mid-cycle businesses such as Nomex and Kevlar
started to rebound mid-year, and while their recovery has been a bit more muted, we expect more to come in 2011. In
the meantime, we continue to develop new applications for fine denier Kevlar in anticipation of the Cooper River plant
startup, which will occur later this year. Finally, construction markets remained weak throughout the year.
While total company sales were up 21% for the year, sales in developing markets grew 27%. We delivered
exceptionally strong performance in China and India.
Sales in greater China including Taiwan were over $3.3 billion, increasing more than 50%. All of our segments
contributed to this growth, with especially strong results in electronics and communications, and performance
materials. Sales in India were up over 40%, to $678 million, with the biggest gains coming from our Performance
Chemicals and Ag & Nutrition segments.
The backbone of our top line growth this year remains market-driven innovation. Our steadfast investment in R&D
through the recession allowed us to intensify our efforts in new product introductions. And we did it by staying close to
our customers, and I mean that literally as well as figuratively. We partnered with customers to run product tests and
commercial prove-outs in their facilities. New product introductions were up 23% in 2010, on the heels of a 60%
increase in 2009.
Moving on to costs, we delivered more than $650 million in fixed cost productivity and benefits from restructuring. We
exceeded our original goal of $600 million. We're poised to deliver an additional $300 million of fixed cost
productivity in 2011.

Raw materials were up 6% last year, and our price increase more than covered higher costs, with an impressive
full-year spread of $0.44, something we could only deliver because our customers recognize the value and competitive
advantage that our products provide.
Finally, we ended the year with free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This was buoyed by working capital productivity
improvements of over $700 million, well ahead of our $400 million goal.
If 2010 was the year of emerging stronger, then 2011 will be the year of building on our momentum, and I'll come back
with more thoughts on 2011 at the end of the call.
First, Nick will review our financial performance in more detail. Nick?
Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Ellen.
Good morning, everybody. If this was a video conference, you'd see me sitting here with all smiles, and I'm sitting here
that way because DuPont had a great quarter and a solid finish to the year. As the global economy recovers, we drove
volume and price up in all major regions of the world. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong
foundation that we've laid over the past two years.
2010 was a transformational year for the company as we began to replace pharmaceutical royalties with profitable
growth from all other business units. Let's just take a minute to review some of the great accomplishments that we've
had versus our goals. Let's start with slide 3, which is a summary of the earnings per share and sales results.
Fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $0.40, which includes a $0.10 charge for one-time items. These items
include a $0.13 per share charge relating to early extinguishment of debt, and a charge of $0.03 per share for upfront
license payment. These charges were offset by a couple of benefits. We had $0.04 benefit relating to the reversal of a
tax valuation allowance, and a $0.02 per share for the partial reversal of prior year's restructuring charges.
Earnings per share on an underlying basis were $0.50, compared to $0.44 in the prior year. When you look at
consolidated net sales, you see $7.4 billion, which was up 15% versus the prior year, comprised of 12% volume gains,
6% positive local price, and 2% negative currency impact, along with a 1% reduction from some portfolio changes.
Volume was up in all segments and in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions,
and this reflects our continued strong pricing discipline that we execute across all our businesses.
Let's turn now to the segment reviews, and let's begin with Ag & Nutrition on slide 4. Fourth quarter sales increase
13%, to $1.5 billion, with $117 million pre-tax seasonal losses. Sales were up in all businesses, with robust volume
growth in both seed and crop protection. For the full year, our teams delivered 10% sales growth, 15 % earnings
growth, and a 70 basis point PTOI margin expansion. These results were delivered despite competitive pressures across
all markets, as our disciplined business models and our intense focus on the growers prevailed. And I have to tell you,
this momentum will continue into 2011.
Taking a closer look within the segment, crop protection product sales for the quarter, excluding divested businesses
impact, increased significantly on global demand for Rynaxypyr insect protection products and picoxystrobin fungicide
products. Regionally, volume increases were broad-based, with particular strength in Latin America offsetting weaker
prices across most regions. For the full year 2010, crop protection product sales, excluding divested businesses
impacted, were up moderately. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr, which approached an impressive $400
million in global sales after just three years in the market.
U.S. dollar pricing remained relatively flat versus prior year. We outperformed the market based on the strength of our
new products. The team executed their strategy, delivering increased sales, earnings, and margins while making key
pipeline advancements that provided for continued growth and profits for the future.

Moving on to seeds. Fourth quarter sales of $582 million increased 25%, reflecting 12% volume growth across all
regions, 10% increase in U.S. dollar prices, and 3% favorable portfolio change. Volume growth reflects a strong start to
the North American season for both corn and soybeans. In addition, Latin America corn and soybeans were up. Brazil
soybean volume increases were due to the late start to their season as a result of some weather. Both regional increases
were partly offset by sales pattern shift to the first quarter in Europe. Price was flat to up in each region, attributable to
grower validation of Pioneer products and services. The earnings impact of higher sales and stronger equity
contribution from China performance on seed earnings were offset primarily by post-season activities as well as growth
investments.
For the full year 2010, the Pioneer team delivered another year of mid teen sales growth and high teens earnings
growth. Success was underpinned by increased acreage, share gains in North America, technology penetration in
Brazil, and success growing in China. Specifically, 2010 seed sales were up 14%, to $5.3 billion, reflecting both
volume and U.S. dollar price contributions.
For nutrition and health, sales for the quarter and full year were slightly up on increased specialty protein offerings
offset by commodity crush business. We continue to drive step-change performance through productivity, along with
application development and differentiated offerings targeted at improved health, wellness, and safety.
Looking ahead, for the first half of 2011 for the Ag & Nutrition segment, we expect to increase sales and earnings
moderately. Key value drivers include seed and crop protection products, volume growth, and net price improvements
in seed business, offset by slight currency headwinds and growth investments weighted more heavily to the first half.
The split of the quarters one and two will play out over the next few months, but our current assumptions are for
growth to be split evenly between the quarters.
Now let's turn to slide 5, Electronics & Communication segment. Sales of $773 million improved 33% compared to the
same period last year, with 24% from volume improvement and 9% higher prices. Pricing was primarily metal
passthrough. Pre-tax earnings of $98 million are $37 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance
was led by Asia Pacific with 50% revenue growth, followed by U.S. and Europe at 14% each. Photovoltaic sales in
total, including sales in our other segments, were over $1.1 billion in 2010, which was more than double the 2009
results. For the full year, the Electronics & Communications segment grew sales 44% and delivered PTOI margins of
16%, a significantly improvement from 2009 margins.
For the first quarter, instead of the normal seasonal decline, we expect sales into consumer electronics markets to be
flat to slightly up. We continue to anticipate PV market growth around 20% for this year, and electronics
communication sales are expected to be substantially above prior year including the impact of higher metal prices.
Now on slide 6, you see Performance Chemical segment. Sales of $1.7 billion increased 26%, primarily due to 14%
higher price and 13% higher volume. Both DTT and DC&F had greater than 20% sales growth this quarter. The sales
growth was broad-based across all regions, with Asia Pacific and North America serving as the largest contributors.
The markets for titanium dioxide and industrial chemicals grew with the global recovery and resulted in a PTOI of
$315 million, which is a 51% increase year-over-year. The impact to the bottom line was further enhanced through the
ongoing productivity initiatives such as DuPont Production Systems and DuPont Integrated Business Management.
For the full year, Performance Chemical sales were up 27%, principally on 18% volume and 10% price, and crossing
the $1 billion PTOI mark for the first time.
As we move into 2011, we see continued growth in the various markets where we participate. For the first quarter, sales
will be up significantly. Sales to capacity continues to be tight for most of Performance Chemicals' markets, and as a
result, we will continue to focus on de-bottlenecking incremental capacity expansion to drive both earnings and
productivity.
Now let's turn to slide 7, Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1 billion increased by 3% on stronger volume, with
local pricing gains offset by currency. Demand was driven by continued strengthening in heavy duty truck markets in
North America and Europe, and growth in the global automotive market. PTOI was $71 million, essentially flat versus
prior year.

For the full year, coatings were up – coating sales were up 11% on 9% volume, supported in part with global auto
builds, up 22%. Earnings were up 3X on sales and strong productivity results.
As we move into 2011, we expect global auto builds to be up about 5%, with a 4% increase in the first quarter. For the
first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly year-over-year with essentially flat margins.
Turning now to Performance Materials on slide 8. Sales were up 11%, with 9% volume and 5% selling price increases,
partially offset by some minor portfolio changes. Continued strength in the automotive, electronics, and packaging
markets helped drive the growth despite some supply chains' de-stocking by our customers in order to manage their
year-end inventory positions.
For the full year, Performance Materials had sales of $6.3 billion, a 32% increase over prior year's, and earned $978
million, which is more than triple its earnings from a year ago.
For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly. Packaging products demand remains stable, and as you heard
with Performance Coatings, global auto builds continue to rise, albeit at a much more modest pace. We also expect to
benefit from some anticipated restocking in the supply chains.
On slide 9, you see the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 13% on improved volume, with the standouts being
Europe growing sales by 17%, and Asia Pacific at a 19% rate. Strong demand from industrial markets was responsible
for the growth and led to increased sales of Nomex and Tyvek. PTOI was $92 million, a decrease due to higher raw
materials, higher spending for Aramid's growth initiatives, and an asset impairment that was partially offset by a
separate gain on a asset sale.
Additionally, this quarter we closed our acquisition of MECS, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont Sustainable
Solutions. As you recall, MECS is the leading global provider of sulfuric acid process technology, increasing our
addressable market in clean air and clean fuel offerings. DuPont Sustainable Solutions is now fully engaged in
integrating and leveraging MECS's capabilities in the clean tech space.
For the full year 2010, Safety & Protection had sales of $3.4 billion, which is a 20% increase over prior year. Market
dynamics improved as we moved through the year for this mid-cycle business, with notable strength in industrial and
automotive markets. For the year, Safety & Protection earned $449 million.
Looking at the first quarter of 2011, the market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in industrial and in
automotive. Sales are expected to be significantly higher, with improved PTOI margins.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the fourth quarter, looking at the earnings per share variance analysis on slide
10. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.06 per share. This reflects the difference
between price and variable cost excluding the impact of both currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and
pricing discipline, we've been very proactive over the past year implementing price increases in the face of anticipated
increases in variable cost.
On a full-year basis, this spread is a positive $0.44 per share. Excluding volume, currency, and portfolio impacts, fourth
quarter raw material, energy, and freight costs were up versus last year fourth quarter when many of our raw materials
had reached a low point. For the full year, we saw an increase in our raws of 6% over 2009. As we look forward to
2011, we expect to see continued pressure on raw materials, energy, and freight cost, and we're now forecasting an
increase of about 4% to 5%.
Volume improvement resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.21 per share compared to the same period
previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions, with
double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America. There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region shown
on slide 11.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume, and portfolio impacts,
fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. This includes an $0.08 incremental non-cash pension

charge, along with actions in the fourth quarter to support growth, such as increased investments in seed R&D and
some specific marketing initiatives.
On a full-year basis, our fixed costs are 42% of sales, versus 46% last year. So you can see, we're well on our way to
meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012.
Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, DuPont delivered more than $650 million of fixed cost savings ahead
of our commitment to deliver $400 million in fixed cost productivity and $200 million in incremental restructuring
benefits for the full year. And as we told you during our Investor Day last month, we will deliver yet another $300
million of fixed cost productivity in 2011.
In addition to the productivity and growth, we expect our full-year 2011 incremental non-cash pension expense to be
$60 million pre-tax, which is about $140 million lower than we had previously communicated, reflecting favorable
movements in both the discount rates and the asset returns.
For the fourth quarter, currency was a headwind of $0.03, and for the first quarter, we expect a similar year-over-year
headwind.
The Other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.08 variance. Reduced pharmaceutical earnings were a $0.14
negative impact. Fourth quarter Pharma earnings were $87 million, about in line with our expectations and $160
million below prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for Pharma pre-tax earnings is about $200 million, or
approximately $290 million less than what we realized in 2010.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall chart is the fourth quarter 2010 tax base rate which was an $0.11
benefit versus prior year. The base tax rate this quarter was a negative 14.9%, versus a positive 16.3% in the fourth
quarter of 2009. There are two primary drivers for the negative tax rate in the quarter. The first is a lower-than-expected
full-year tax rate reflecting a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in low-tax jurisdictions outside the U.S., the
full benefit of which was realized in the quarter. The change in our total year expected tax rate must be adjusted in the
fourth quarter, hence the incremental lower rate is applied to full year's earnings.
Secondly, the U.S. tax law changes, including the R&D tax credit, were all recorded during this quarter. For those of
you who used our prior guidance of 23% full-year tax rate for 2010, we estimate the difference between that tax rate
and our actual full-year base tax rate of 18.8% results in about the $0.18 per share benefit range.
In light of the favorable geographic mix of earnings and U.S. R&D tax credit, we are lowering our guidance for our
2011 base tax rate from 22% to 23%, to a new range of 20% to 21%.
Let's turn now to the balance sheet and cash that's shown on slide 12. We ended the year with $3.1 billion of free cash
flow, versus our goal of $1.7 billion – greater than $1.7 billion. This outstanding performance is a result of strong sales
and earnings throughout the year, and equally strong commitment to productivity. Keep in mind, this includes a
previously unforecasted $500 million voluntary contribution to our principal U.S. pension plan that was made in
September.
During 2010, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends, and ended the year with a net debt of $3.5 billion, 1.4 less than our
position in December of 2009.
As you recall, we committed to $1 billion of working capital productivity over a three-year period beginning in 2010.
Based on net working capital levels, we delivered more than $700 million of that in the 2010 year. Here again, we have
a process around working capital productivity to ensure that we continue to deliver on these commitments, and I'll
reaffirm for you our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2011.
Regarding dividends, yesterday our board of directors approved our 426th consecutive quarterly dividend. Our
long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the
opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.

In summary, for the fourth quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started out in the fourth quarter of 2009
continued and expanded throughout 2010. This, along with our pricing discipline and productivity focus, delivered
strong quarterly results in the full year – as well as for the full year.
Turning to the first quarter of 2011, we expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but at a more
moderate pace than we have experienced to date. As you heard described earlier, we continue to see strong demand
globally across many of our businesses. In addition, we expect continued growth in our Ag & Nutrition segment.
For our full year 2011 outlook, DuPont leadership team remains steadfast and confident in our business plans and our
ability to execute against those plans. We are raising our guidance from a range of $3.30 to $3.60 per share, to a new
range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share. This of course excludes the impact of the planned Danisco acquisition which could
reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis.
The driver for the increase in our guidance is our lower tax rate driven by increased earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions
outside the U.S. and reduced non-cash pension expense. These benefits are partially offset by an increased share count.
We ended 2010 with 932 million shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, versus our original estimate during the
Investor Day of 915 million shares, or about 2% additional shares, representing a $0.06 per share headwind in 2011.
This increase in guidance is based on our confidence and our continued ability to deliver results.
On slide 13, looking strictly at segment pre-tax operating income, excluding significant items, we saw 39% growth in
2010, and if you exclude Pharma, our growth was nearly 80%.
As I said in the start, we have a plan for 2010, and we executed against that plan. First we put our innovation to work
and grew our businesses across the globe. Second, we drove productivity to expand our margins. And third, we
delivered strong cash performance and reduced net debt by $1.4 billion. We executed extremely well this year, and we
expect continued positive results in 2011.
Now I'll turn it back over to Ellen.
Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer
Great, thank you, Nick.
Last month at our Investor Day, we shared our plans for continued strong growth, we raised the performance targets on
our businesses, and we detailed our financial assumptions and growth targets for 2011. And two weeks ago, DuPont
cemented its position as a leader in industrial biotechnology with our announcement to acquire Danisco. Both
companies are working hard to drive through the legal and regulatory milestones to close the transaction. Today, we are
right where we expected to be in this process, having received approval from the Danish Financial Authority and
launched the tender offer for Danisco shares last week. We continue to expect to close the transaction early in the
second quarter, subject, of course, to the regulatory reviews.
I'd like to update you on our integration efforts. I've selected Jim Collins as the integration leader for our planned
acquisition. You know Jim from his stellar leadership of the crop protection business, and what you may not know is
that Jim has been part of several previous integration teams including Pioneer, Griffin LLC, and Protein Technologies
International, now known as Soleil. And Jim brings an excellent track record of delivering results, and his passion and
knowledge on the food and biotech areas makes him the right person for the job. Now as we committed you during our
Danisco announcement, we will keep you updated on our progress in this tender and during the integration, and Jim
will be a key part of this growth journey.
As we move through the process in Denmark, we will keep you posted, and I do want to underscore one important
point. We won a competitive process with a full and fair price, giving Danisco shareholders an attractive premium for
their investment that also reflects the future value we believe this combined company can deliver for our own investors.
My commitment to you is that we will stay disciplined throughout the tender offer process and the integration, and keep
you apprised when we achieve key milestones.

Of course, we've known Danisco and Genencor as partners for the past decade and one key personality trait our
companies share is our commitment to science and innovation. For DuPont, science and innovation are the engines that
drive our growth and what sets us apart from our peers, and whether it's product introduction that drivers higher value
and higher margins, or whether it's manufacturing excellence or proprietary technology that contributes to our low-cost
position, science and innovation remain critical to our success at DuPont.
When I talk about science and innovation at DuPont, I like to give examples of how they translate into commercial
success, and the examples I'll share with you have the distinction of having just won a DuPont Excellence Award, as a
very prestigious recognition within the company.
One of our Excellence Awards was earned by a team from Crop Protection which launched a program in 2009 called
PrecisionPac. Now, PrecisionPac is a dispensing system designed by DuPont and provided to retailers so they can
customize both the formulation and the very precise amounts of sulfonylurea herbicides to meet individual grower
needs. The system design had to meet some formidable challenges, both in its precision and its safe handling of the
components. Retailers had to be trained and serviced in a different way, and in the end, this was a very successful
program. It was well designed and well executed. Retailers were delighted to offer custom solution to their growers,
and we saw sales growth against generic competition who could not follow with solutions tailored to the individual
grower needs.
Another Excellence Award comes from our Electronics & Communications business, and it was approached back in
2008 to develop a new black polyimide film for use in coverlays for printed flexible circuits to be used by an auto OEM
who was interested in a all-black film to complement their sleek designs. The conventional film is amber in color. So a
multifunctional team came together and developed the product and delighted this OEM customer, but it didn't stop
there. They leveraged this new material into applications for smartphones, notebooks, and tablet PCs. And these are
just two of our excellent award winners, and there are many, many other outstanding examples of excellence in science
and innovation. We had an award ceremony here in Wilmington last week where we honored all the winners.
I want to close by reiterating that I expect 2011 to be a year for DuPont to build on our hard-earned momentum. When
we designed the accountability structure that we put in place starting in 2009, one of my priorities was to have the
flexibility to accommodate potential acquisitions. Meaning that our organizational and reporting structure needed to
enable our businesses to stay focused on delivering results while an integration team went about its work. And now our
people have more than a full year under their belts, and this accountability structure and the structure has worked the
way we planned. And we welcome the integration task that we have ahead of us, and we will stay focused on fulfilling
our directives for 2011 day by day and quarter by quarter.
We have another exciting year ahead of us, and we have the resources, the growth plans, the disciplined processes, and
market momentum. In summary, the focus is on execution, and I expect the same executional excellence from my
leadership team this year as they demonstrated in 2010.
And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

<A - Karen A. Fletcher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Good morning, Frank.
<Q - Frank Mitsch>: Yeah, I noticed on the cash flow statement, there was a $637 million cash outlay for businesses
net of cash. I believe that was all in the fourth quarter. Was that all ag-related? And can you talk about what sort of
performance metrics we could expect out of that investment, i.e., in terms of addition to top line and bottom line?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Yes.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yes. Frank, first of all, my
condolences to you.
<Q - Frank Mitsch>: Oh, please don't go there, Nick. I'm still distraught.
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: So bad. And we have really worked with him on this
one, Frank. It's just not sticking today.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: No, Frank, the – that's for
the acquisitions. And if you look at the components of that, there's two pieces. It's MECS, the acquisition for MECS,
and the acquisitions we had in PROaccess.
<Q - Frank Mitsch>: All right. So that's – so we should expect some benefits in Safety & Protection on the ag side? In
terms of top and bottom line for 2011?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Correct.
<Q - Frank Mitsch>: And you had a – sales in greater China up 50% for the whole year, which is obviously
eye-popping results because you've been involved in that region for a long, long time. What are the key businesses
there, and how sustainable is that level of growth? What's – what should we be expecting in 2011 out of that area?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah, so, I mean, we had a great year in greater China
as we really focused on electronics and things like phones, and photovoltaics showed great growth. Automotive sales in
2010, or builds in 2010 in China were a very – contributed greatly to our results. And Ti02 markets were strong, and hit
record highs in sales.
Now, a lot of that underpinning is their domestic consumption which is on the rise in China. And although as a country,
their GDP was probably 10ish percent last year. It's going to moderate, but only to 9% this year, so a very modest
moderation. As we continue to focus. For instance, auto builds China were up 10%. They're predicted to be the same.
So we do think we have momentum in China. We have positioned ourselves very well in some key segments, and I
think you'll continue to see us making progress in that area.

And we have a question from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Lucy Watson>: Good morning. This is Lucy Watson on for Laurence today. It sounds like you're expecting
pricing to at least keep pace with raw materials in Performance Chemicals and Performance Materials, but it could
potentially fall short in Performance Coatings and Safety & Protection again in Q1. And just wondering I guess in
general, which raw materials will represent the largest challenge this year?
And then more broadly, what's imbedded in your 2011 outlook for pricing versus the raw materials and freight up 4%
to 5%?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So the raw material situation
is somewhat dynamic. Right now, we're saying that's going to be 4% to 5% increase.

When you look at the major components of that, metals is certainly going to continue to be a major component of the
raw material increase. And as I mentioned in the dialogue there, that's really a passthrough for us in our Electronics
segment.
Some other raw materials that are going to be seeing some increases that we're forecasting is things like ethane, HMD,
adipic acid, chlorine, some of our solvents, or some of our pigments. So those are the areas where we see raw materials
continuing to rise throughout the year.
When you look at our ability to price that in the marketplace, obviously that's going to vary from business to business.
But if you look at, for instance, some of those things I mentioned relating to our Ti02 business, the market remains
extremely tight in that area. And the other thing I'll mention, Lucy, is the work we've done around pricing to value
throughout the corporation over the last several years really serves us well in environments such as that.
<Q - Lucy Watson>: Okay, and just a quick follow-up, if I may. Will MECS and PROaccess both – will those
acquisitions be accretive in 2011?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Well, both of those
acquisitions are already in the numbers that we have given you, so that's the first point I want to make. And those
acquisitions will be accretive in 2011.

Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Prashant Juvekar>: Yeah, just couple of questions on Ag. You mentioned the strong start to the North American
season. How much did you see prepayments go up this year so far?
And then with corn and bean prices up, but at the same time, your competitor is lowering prices on certain seeds, in
light of all that, how do you see pricing shaking out this season?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: So we're really pleased with our progress so far on our
North American order book. The volume's up, and it's in line with our goals, and AcreMax 1 is outpacing our goals.
And I think that we're very, very focused on that.
People ended the year in the farming community with commodity prices, with some cash. We had a great end of year
with collections. And that's on a positive trend, so we think that's – that bodes well for the season. People are going to
want to protect their yield, because that yield's going to be very – it will have a great return for them.
So our growth strategies are in place with Right Product, Right Acre, our PROaccess. Really right in the midst of it
right now, but we're very focused on it, and very positive on – and pleased with how we've started the season.
<Q - Prashant Juvekar>: And with the Latin American season behind us, do you think you gained share there? Thank
you.
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. I think Latin America has turned out to be a
pretty good season for us. We're really pleased with where that ended up.

Our next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Connelly>: Thank you. Two things. First, when we look at the half billion voluntary contribution, can you
give us a sense, Nick, of how that's going to affect your fixed cost progression? Is that going to be a significant part of
improvement?

And then just a follow-up question is, on OLEDs, we haven't heard you talk a lot about that lately. We hear a lot from
Dai Nippon about the nozzle print technology. I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of how much that can
contribute in E&C?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So let me take the pension
question that you had. So we made that voluntary contribution of $500 million dollars this year. And obviously, that
contribution, with the return that we had this year on our assets, played into the reduction that I already communicated
to you now, of – from our original estimate of a $200 million year-over-year increase in non-cash pension expense,
down to the number of – the $60 million that we're now saying for 2011. So that contribution, and the return on that
contribution, plays into those numbers.
And OLEDs?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: So as far as OLEDs go, we are continuing to be very
bullish on the technology. We've met significant milestones. We're working with partners around the world to not only
demonstrate the technology, but to continue to make progress there. And you'll be hearing more about that as we
progress in those discussions.
Operator
Our next question is from Paul Mann from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul Mann>: Thanks. In your Ag & Nutrition slide, you talk about continued pricing pressure in crop protection
sales. Can you just talk about how much pricing pressure you kind of expect, and what products and what markets and
what regions you expect that pricing pressure to be in, please?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, as always, with the diverse nature of the crop
protection chemical business, it really depends on what you're talking about. All regions saw price pressure. It's a very
competitive market.
We've been very fortunate with our new product introductions, things like picoxystrobin and Rynaxypyr have done
very well in the market, as there's a real movement towards products that are more efficacious, have less impact on the
environment.
So in 2011, commodity pricing in the crop protection market may be increasing, but we see it as a market that's going
to be enhanced by the fact that the farmer wants to protect yield and is going to be using everything he can to get the
most out of his acres this year.
Operator
Next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, on Ti02, can you comment on the current price increase. How it's going.
And your expectation for full-year pricing in Ti02?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, I mean, so Ti02 had a great year last year, as did
the entire Performance Chemical segment, with their revenues up – the segment revenues were up 26%, and both sides
of it had strong revenue growth.
We see that is a market that continues to be tight with capacity utilizations above 90%, and with no real major
expansions on the horizon. So it's a classic commodity chemical market. When capacity utilization is high, prices tend
to rise.

We don't tend to comment on any individual price increase. That tends to be something that we get into with our
customers very dearly because of the relationships and the long term we have there.
So the market dynamics are right where they were as we discussed this in December, and we continue to play that out.
Operator
Our next question is from Mark Gulley from Soleil Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark Gulley>: Hey, good morning. Two questions, if I can.
One, can you comment on share – market share movements in seed soy and seed corn, both for '10 and what you
anticipate for '11?
And then finally, with respect to the non-recurring charges for Danisco, Nick, can you kind of separate out the
non-recurring charges from the more ongoing charges for Danisco for '11? Thanks very much.
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Yeah. So I mean in 2010, North America, the soy share
increase was 5 points. Corn was 3 points. Of course, that includes PROaccess.
This year, it really is going to depend on what the acres turn out to be. I mean, all the crops now are fighting for acres,
and the USDA has brought out some indications on where they think corn's going to be, but the final answer is unclear.
But we're very happy with our progression in the marketplace and our position in the marketplace with our current
products, and we'll see how that plays out over the season.
Nick, you want to talk about the -
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Sure.
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: – his second question?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So Mark, when you look at
the $0.30 to $0.45 per share, let's just try to break it out into the components.
There's obviously a component there relating to the $3 billion of debt, so the interest expense associated with that.
That's obviously going to be an ongoing sort of charge, and you can calculate that as easy as I can, on $3 billion, what
an average interest rate would be right now.
When you look at purchase accounting rules that are going to influence this, obviously that's where the range starts to
come into play, because that's where the uncertainty is. And so – but for talking purposes, for thinking, I think you can
think about the write-up of PP&E, that type of thing, as ongoing.
And then the one-time sort of charges relating to that $0.30 to $0.45, well, that would be the cost associated with
executing our synergies. And we said our synergies is $130 million. So think about cost associated with that, almost
like a 1X sort of number.
And then the other one, which is going to represent a lion's portion of that, is the inventory piece. And you've got to
write up that inventory. And that's going to be a one-time effect as well, because you're going to be able to cost that out
over the current year, and then after that, you'll get into a normal cost of goods sold sort of reporting situation.
And that's where the variance, Mark, is going to be really unknown. I got to wait and see when we close what that
inventory level is, and how much we have to write up. But that also would be sort of a one-time event.

<Q - Don Carson>: Yes, thank you. Ellen, a portfolio question. At Danisco, you're adding a high growth, high margin
business comparable to what you have now.
But looking at Performance Coatings, you were flat year-over-year in the quarter. Even at the Investor Day, you're still
only targeting 10% to 12% margins by 2015. So certainly that's the lowest growth, lowest margin business you have.
What's the future of that business in DuPont? Because it does seem to drag down the overall sales growth and margins
for the company.
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Well, Don, as you know, we put a new leader in
Performance Coatings in the fourth quarter this year, John McCool, and a team that is continued to be focused on
strong operational leverage, and continued focus on productivity. And we take a look at each one of the segments there
individually and assess our strength versus others, and continue to drive towards the numbers that we presented in
December.
We believe this is a segment that can be a strong cash contributor to the company. And at the end of the day, they have
their mission, they have their goals, and we're driving them to contribute there. Got great market position in refinish
and in some of the industrial segments.
So I think this is an area, with the investment we've made in the reconstructing and a new leadership team, let's see
where they get.
Operator
Next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kevin McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. So for 2010, your volumes came in at 17%, running more than triple
where global GDP is likely to come in. In that context, could you comment on your global growth assumptions
embedded in your outlook of $3.45 to $3.75 in EPS, at a macro level?
And then more importantly, what kind of multiplier or premium would you anticipate for DuPont specifically next
year?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So let me talk about the
assumptions that are in our current thinking around 2011.
We had talked to you about sales for 2011 being about $33 to $34 billion. That thinking has not changed. So the change
that I've given you in the range of EPS, sales are still around that $33 to $34 billion.
We talked about raw material price increases going up about 4% to 5%. And as I mentioned, that's a pretty dynamic
thing, but right now that's our best thinking. And that's net of our productivity gains that we would have in that area.
We continue to drive productivity, both fixed and working capital productivity. And our thinking right now in our
model has us at $300 million of fixed cost productivity, and about $300 million of working capital productivity.
So when you talk about some of the changes that have occurred now and the new guidance, one is around the tax rate
changes. And that's going from the 22% to 23%, down to the 20% to 21%. And I would think about that as the
underlying performance of the business. So when you look at our geographic sales base and where we're operating,
what we're saying is, on an ongoing basis, the 20% to 21% rate is more reflective of our underlying businesses and
where they are participating around the world.
The pension adjustment, as I mentioned, went from a $200 million, down to a $60 million increase year-over-year.
Take all that together and you add on top of that the share – outstanding shares that I mentioned going up, it puts you at
the range we're now forecasting, at the $3.45 to $3.75 range.

<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Kevin, let me take you on a walk around the world
around the top line and just give you some perspective on that, because I think you were interested in that as well.
So in the U.S., GDP is going to be about the same in '11 as it was in '10. The biggest change in the U.S. from our
perspective's going to be the automotive industry, where as in 2010, I think the U.S. and Canada were up over 30%
over '09, and in '11, it's only be up around 11%. So we're going to see a moderating growth in the automotive builds.
And so our growth rate that we saw in the U.S. for the year, which was well into the double digits, it's going to be
probably more in the high single digit numbers and the like of that. So the U.S. I think is going to be – continue to have
some strength because of a 10% automotive growth as well as good ag season in that.
Europe is going to have mixed recovery picture. So we think there's going to be continued, a little bit stronger, maybe
to 2.5 GDP in Germany, and there, it's a strong export market. We're not expecting much out of automotive there.
Eastern Europe's going to come back more strongly, probably – well actually moderating there. And so I think Europe's
going to be a mixed picture.
As we go forward, Asia Pacific is going to be an area of strength for us, between where automotive is, between where
photovoltaics are and electronics are, and things like Ti02 and an increasing ag position there, that you're – we're going
to see the kinds of growth rates, might not reflective of last year like 50% China, but they're going to be very, very
strong.
And Latin America. I think you're going to see there that, although automotive is not going to drive ag – drive their –
our business there, Ag & Nutrition will. And so I think you're going to see some well above GDP growth in Latin
America. GDP in Latin America is about 4% in 2011, is what our estimates are.
So I think that with our position in Ag, our position in Ti02 photovoltaics, and a recovery in Safety & Protection, are
going to bode well for our volume in 2011.
<A - Karen A. Fletcher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: John, we're almost out of time. How about if we take
one more question and then we'll turn it back to Ellen?
Operator
And last question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Thanks. Your free cash flow is $3.1 billion, but on a sequential basis, your accrued
liabilities and payables went up by $2 billion. So what's the free cash flow estimate that you have for 2011?
And your shares creeped up from 909 to 929 year-over-year. Are you going to let it continue to creep up, or will you do
something about it?
<A - Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer>: Nick, what do you think?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: So I haven't provided a free
cash flow number for 2011, but let's just talk directionally about what we're seeing right now, Jeff. What you saw in
2010 was tremendous productivity gains coupled with the earnings increase that we showed, and you saw that reflected
in the free cash flow results. Keep in mind that those free cash flow results were inclusive of a $500 million pension
contribution that was not in the original target number I provided to you. So the performance in the area of working
capital productivity I believe was just tremendous this year. When you look at working capital turns within the
company, and you see the improvement we had in that at the current sales rate, it's like a 13% improvement there,
which equates to over $700 million of working capital productivity gains. So tremendous improvement in those areas.
Second part of your question, Jeff, was – refresh me again more?
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Share creep.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Oh, the share creep.

<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Will you do anything about that, or will you just let it creep up?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer>: Yeah. At this point in time, I
don't have any plans to do any kind of share buyback. When you look at the reason for the increase here, it is obviously
around the executive compensation piece. And when you look at that over the past 10 year period, we actually – they're
about 13% ahead in the way of buybacks versus shares that were issued in relation to that. So we're – which equates to
10 million shares. We're ahead of the game on a share-for-share basis there. So at this point in time, I don't have any
plans to have any share buyback. It's not a -not done on a one-for-one basis.
<A - Karen A. Fletcher, Vice President, Investor Relations>: Okay. That's the last question we have time for. I just
want to give Ellen a chance for closing.
Ellen J. Kullman, Chair and Chief Executive Officer

Now, there have been a number of questions on 2011 and on our outlook. And we see tremendous opportunity going

You have 2010 was all about execution and delivering on our commitments, and we provided updates throughout the

productivity as a way of life with a disciplined managing process in place. And third, differential portfolio
management, with resources going to the highest growth opportunity and accountability for results.
So my point is, we executed well in 2010, and you should expect the same from us in 2011, and we look forward to
updating you as the year unfolds. Thank you for joining us today.
