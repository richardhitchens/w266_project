Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everybody. Just a few quick comments on the quarter. The first quarter is broadly on
track. Our constant dollar revenues as you saw were up 4% in the quarter driven by Latin America, and WEMEA M&A
contributed 2% to this quarter. Our Beauty sales were up 4% in constant dollars. The two categories that really drove
that were Fragrance and Personal Care.
Active Representatives continued to be soft. They were down 1%, impacted primarily by China and North America.
Our adjusted gross margin expanded 80 basis points, as effective price management and favorable foreign exchange
counteracted mix and commodity cost pressures. Adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points, as gross margin
expansion and tight cost control offset higher distribution costs.
So our adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was up 12% in the quarter. Cash flow was down $41
million, impacted by a $75 million pension contribution in the quarter and higher inventories.
If I just go back to February and what we outlined at CAGNY in terms of 2011 sales and operating margin goals by
half, just on the top line, what we said was that we were looking for core revenue to grow in the low single-digits in
constant dollars in the first half and then accelerate to the mid single-digits in the second half for a full year of mid
single-digit growth.
In terms of adjusted operating margin, we said back then that we felt the first half would have adjusted operating
margin below prior year and then be up significantly in the second half for a full year outlook of 50 to 70 basis points
improvement. And we still feel good about the full year outlook although as you'll see later, the adjusted operating
margin will be better than what we said in the first half.
So since CAGNY at the end of the February, the whole company's focus has been against the key 2011 operating
priorities that we laid out, and again those were to just restore growth in Brazil and Russia throughout the year, to
stabilize North America, to reignite our Skincare category, and to deliver meaningful operating margin expansion.
So if I just turn to Brazil to start, we've seen some progress on service in the quarter. It's not yet reflected in our top line
results. On the left, we are just tracking our percent of deliveries delayed in the quarter, and you can see some of the
peaks were as we came out of the back half of last year, some tough percent of representatives' orders having long
delivery delays. That has pretty much restored itself to the historical norm, as you can see that we had as we were
exiting the first half of last year.
In terms of the order fill rates, the dotted line is the historical norm for the market, which we have been at for many
years. But we had the disruption in the middle of the year, so you saw particularly as we got down to probably the
trough was in that November/December period, and steadily the order fill rate has been improving. There's been
gradual improvement, it's not yet back to historical norms yet. But we feel good about the steady progress we're making
on that front.
But restoring representative confidence obviously is key to improving the top line growth once the historical service
levels are achieved. Annoyance always does lag service recovery. That's what we've found in the history of Avon.
Generally, it takes a couple of quarters for revenues to improve. Brazil could take a little bit longer just due to the high
number of reps also carrying competitor brochures. It's our largest dual rep market, but again it takes a couple of
quarters for revenue to improve after service recovers.
So the highest priority for us now going forward is restoring representative confidence in their activity. Additional
bonuses for zone managers and sales leaders are being put in place from second quarter on to really return
representative activity to historical levels. Personal contact has always been a best practice in this market. It's always
been important, but never more important than now, so all of our zone managers and sales leaders are focused on really
enhancing their contact with top sellers to encourage the activity.
We've got energy building representative events across the balance of the year, and then importantly, we were offering
higher value, higher energy incentives to our representatives to spur their activity from computers, smartphone, iPads,
so high-energy incentives. And as we said in late February, we continue to expect gradual revenue improvement in
Brazil throughout the year.

In terms of restoring growth in Russia, we've seen a lot of heavy lifting since the beginning of the year, and it's
underway to support the second half acceleration in this market. The categories of color and skin care will benefit from
revamped merchandising and product innovation in the second half. We completed the national rollout of the new sales
leadership compensation plan at the end of January, and we're pleased that some of these field programs are showing
early signs of progress as we exit the first quarter. Our unit leader count is up, we're seeing growth in appointments,
and activity is also trending up. So early green shoots of the plans we put in place for sales leadership are working.
In terms of stabilizing North America, we have strong 2011 field and average order initiatives underway. Our plans are
in place to stabilize the average order by year-end in this market. We've stepped up our Fragrance and Skincare
pipeline significantly along with strong promotions. We have revitalized holiday giftable offers in the Beauty
categories as well as non-Beauty for the fourth quarter. And we'll be expanding the Mom & Baby launch, which was
piloted in one region in the second quarter.
In terms of the field, the Believe in Your Success incentive program is starting to gain some early momentum as we
come out of the first quarter. We're starting to see the participation in this incentive rate really rising and the upline
leader count is beginning to stabilize.
In addition, as we go through the rest of the year, we're evaluating plans to strengthen the leadership structure for the
medium and long-term.
From a Skincare category point of view, some early progress. A lot of work still to do, but as you can see the fourth
quarter of last year we had a 10% decline in this category. In the first quarter of this year, a 4% increase. That 14-point
delta, a lot of it comes from a very successful $40 million Avon Care launch. That was the launch planned for this
quarter of Value, a global value skin care line that launched successfully in Latin America.
We are continuing to see Solutions weak, but that's ahead of a major second quarter re-launch that should spur that
mid-tier brand. And ANEW declines are lessening in the quarter. We've got a lot of stepped up innovation pipeline
starting in third quarter with Sun Care and then in fourth quarter with a very, very big anti-aging product launch. So
early progress.
And then in terms of expanding our operating margin, we are on track. Our gross margin and cost control continue to
underpin our 2011 outlook. Again, our adjusted operating margin growth, if you look at it in the fourth quarter, it was
down 100 basis points and in the first quarter, it is up 30 basis points. And this adjusted gross margin, which expanded
80 basis points, is effective price management and benefits from exchange more than offset mix and commodity cost
pressures.
Advertising and RVP investments were re-balanced, as we have talked about and as we planned. When you combine
the two, the spend was slightly ahead of sales growth, and we look at the full year as these two combined being in line
with sales growth. And, lastly, a tight overhead control partially offset what we had planned for distribution cost
increases of 100 basis points.
When we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect constant dollar sales growth in line with or slightly better than
the first quarter. We expect adjusted gross margin to be flat to up slightly, as effective price management and foreign
exchange gains continue to offset commodity cost pressures. And so we look at adjusted operating margin to be about
flat versus 2010 next quarter. For the full year, our outlook remains unchanged, but as you can see for the first half,
then the adjusted operating margin will be about flat versus down, as we had looked at it earlier in the year.
Outlook for the second half in terms of mid single-digit constant dollar revenue growth is going to be driven primarily
by a very aggressive 125th anniversary representative activation program. This is a major global incentive to drive
representative and unit growth in the second half. We also have a very robust product pipeline and strong
merchandising promotions, as we planned to recover as we came out for all of the catalogs in the third and the fourth
quarter.
Our adjusted growth margin expansion in the second half will be driven by effective price management and benefits
from foreign exchange to offset further commodity pressure. We see the commodity pressure obviously getting tougher

as we close out the year. But we still feel good about delivering 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin
expansion for the full year.
Then importantly before I turn it over to Chuck to give you more details, I just want to say that the whole organization
remains squarely focused on driving operational rigor. There's a great sense of urgency throughout the organization.
Some early green shoots, but we are clearly aware we've got a lot of heavy lifting to do. Our new Commercial Business
unit leaders are hitting the ground running. We have the two external searches for a new Latin American CBU leader
and CFO. Those are both well underway with highly qualified candidates for both.
And also we've launched an enhanced process excellence program throughout the company to drive improved
operational execution. In March, we established a new very enhanced program office and a greater number of dedicated
organization resources that are focused on sales and operation planning improvements, particularly demand forecasting.
It's applied planning, which will improve inventories going forward. Gross margin optimization obviously a big focus
for us in terms of making sure that we can focus on sustainable execution in gross margin, and then lastly global sales
incentive management, really taking a look to make sure that we really evaluate and have consistency in our power of
our effectiveness of our RVP spend and our global sales incentives.
So we're going to continue to drive for clear accountability and added operational rigor with roles across the enterprise,
so a lot of work has been done on that. So I think we're making some early progress, but we remain focused on a lot of
heavy lifting that's required across the balance of the year to continue to return this business to sustainable profitable
growth.
Okay. At this point, let me turn it over to Chuck for a little bit more on the regional results and the balance sheet.
Charles W. Cramb
Thank you, Andrea. Now I'm going to follow the format that we adopted about a year ago in terms of reviewing the
regional performance.
Starting with Latin America, across the region, we have strong, balanced growth, which offset the expected soft
performance in Brazil. This resulted in an overall double-digit or 11% constant dollar growth for all of Latin America.
At the gross margin level, we have strong gains due to pricing, favorable mix and cost benefits, including transaction
exchange. However, our operating margin did contract 120 basis points.
Offsets to the gross margin gains included: one, higher distribution costs of 120 basis points due to the duplicated
operating costs in Brazil and Colombia as we transfer it to the new facilities. Two, higher bad debts, particularly in
Brazil, as a consequence of our earlier service disruptions; and three, increased investments in RVP.
Moving to North America, in North America, our overall revenues are down 2%. However if you exclude the impact of
Silpada, the decline is roughly 10%. The bulk of the sales reduction in the core business resulted from active reps being
down. The operating margin is 150 basis points less than it was last year. We were unable to reduce overhead expenses
in the core business at the same rate as the sales reduction. This more than offset continued bad debt improvements in
the U.S. Silpada, which is a relatively small business versus the rest of North America, in Q1 improved the overall
margin by roughly 20 basis points.
In Central and Eastern Europe, the revenues were down slightly. Negative macroeconomic pressures and a reduction in
active reps contributed to the sales performance. Russia was slightly positive during the quarter. The operating margin
improved 90 basis points due to higher pricing and some favorable benefit from transaction exchange.
In WEMEA, we continued to generate strong revenue growth. Sales have increased 15% in constant dollars, including
about four percentage points from Liz Earle. South Africa and Turkey led the revenue growth with strong double-digit
increases. They are also the countries with the strongest active rep growth. The operating margin improvement of 260
basis points reflects the strong revenue growth, with a much slower growth in expenses. Also contributing is a higher
gross margin, which benefits from pricing and some transaction and some transaction exchange.

Asia-Pacific, and here I just want to remind you that Asia-Pacific now includes China as a result of our recent
reorganization announcements. Overall revenues have declined 12%. This is due to lower sales in China as we continue
to transition away from our hybrid model. Despite the lower sales our operating margin improved. In China, we have
withheld advertising and are paying lower sales incentives. Investments in China will resume once the new sales model
starts to take hold.
Now let's take a look at the overall company performance. First revenue, the constant dollar increase of 4% is balanced
between growth in the core business and sales from our acquisitions. Currency then added roughly 3% to revenue in the
quarter. Gross margin increased some 80 basis points year on year.
We are experiencing commodity cost pressures, which contributed significantly to the 50 basis point increase in
product cost. We also have higher labor costs from developing countries where we are manufacturers. Our price mix is
a net favorable of about 60 basis. Of this, price is roughly 150 basis points, while product mix is unfavorable about 90
basis points. Currency benefited us by about 70 basis points, due primarily to favorable transaction gains.
Moving to RVP advertising and overall cost, the first quarter is indicative of the rebalancing we expect during 2011, as
we shift funds away from advertising and into RVP. Together, advertising and RVP did grow slightly faster than
revenue. The advertising reduction was primarily in China. Investments in sales leadership, higher sales incentives and
the service model transformation initiative accounted for the increase in RVP.
Our overhead was up about $30 million. The bulk of the increase was due to higher labor cost. Translation exchange
was also material in the dollar comparisons. Partially offsetting these increases were significant reductions in
conference and travel costs through greater use of technology, such as tele-presence. We are, also have an ongoing
head count freeze. Our FCPA costs were similar to those in last year's first quarter.
Moving to operating margin, our 30 basis points gain in operating margin came despite the significant increase in
distribution costs. The higher distribution costs reflected duplicated facility cost, which I mentioned earlier, and
significant pressure on delivery costs due to higher gas or fuel prices. Overall, our margin performance was somewhat
better than expected. We realize better benefits from cost control, higher effective price realization and a slightly more
favorable impact from currency.
Our adjusted EPS of $0.37 was up $0.04, or 12%, from last year. This chart bridges the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
The big difference is in the Venezuela special charges of $0.23 in 2010. These charges were a result of Venezuela
being treated as hyper inflationary along with its massive devaluation.
Now to the balance sheet and cash flow. First the balance sheet. Looking at these key items, inventories continue to be
an issue. They're up 16 days from one year ago. Most of this increase is due to carryover of the high balances at the end
of last year. It does take some time to incorporate programs to reduce these inventories in our campaign planning and
brochure printing processes. We do, however, expect to start to flow these products in our Q2 catalogs. We do expect
year-end inventories to be down in terms of days coverage versus 2010.
Our accounts payable have increased 11 days from a year ago. We have improved our supplier payment terms as a
result of benchmarking, a critical element of our strategic sourcing processes. However, you have to expect some
variability in this index quarter-to-quarter based on timing of shipments to us.
In terms of the cash flow, when you look at this, I think what's important is that you look at the schedule starting with
the cash-related income. This will avoid the distortions that are created by the non-cash charges from Venezuela in
2010. There are three significant areas I'll reference in the quarterly cash flow comparison.
Inventories. Inventories are a significantly higher use of cash this year than last year. Last year, it did benefit from a
stronger sales performance in the first quarter, which helped dampen the impact of the normal seasonal growth in Q1.
Pension. We made a significant one-time pension contribution of $75 million in the U.S., improving our overall
funding to just under 85% on our qualified plans. And in taxes, we continue to benefit from the recovery of VAT
deposits in Brazil. Overall, had we not made the one-time pension contribution, our cash from operations growth would
have roughly equaled the cash-related income growth, despite the higher inventory build.

So that's a quick review of the quarter. Going back to our outlook, which is unchanged for the year, we expect first half
core revenue growth to be low single digit. Growth will then increase in the second half. This should result in total year
revenue growth in the mid single digit range.
In terms of margin, we expect the first half to be roughly flat. This is somewhat improved versus previous outlooks
shared with you. However, this gain will be offset in the second half due to further commodity cost pressures. So for
the full year, we still expect an improvement of 50 to 70 basis points.
So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to start our question and answer period.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Good morning. It's Bank of America. So guys, I guess on Brazil, why isn't the order fill
rate back to historical norms? Is this going to necessitate Cabreúva being fully online before you can get there or will
you be back online or back fully online faster than that?
<A - Andrea Jung>: I think if you look at our progress in terms of the absolute order fill rate since the bottom back in
November, I feel good about the gradual progress. While it's not all the way back up to the level, it is approaching that
level. So I think it's going to take a little bit more time but not until Cabreúva is fully up and running. So hopefully in
the second quarter, it will be back to broadly historical order fill rates.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: And I guess just as a follow up, can you talk at all about the progression of Brazil? Right,
I'm not looking for real specifics, just understanding from a revenue perspective and from an order fill rate perspective
is March better than February, is February better than January? Is that the trend we're seeing on sales and on order fill
rate?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, if you look, you've got the kind of a timing of Carnival. But if I look at February and
March combined, it was better than January in terms of revenues. And if you look at the chart that I showed it's broadly
getting better by month in terms of the absolute OFR. So if you kind of go forward on that thought, with the complete
focus on getting that order fill rate back to historic norms in the second quarter, we feel very committed to doing that.
The sales, as I said, do take a little bit of time because you've got that rep annoyance, getting rep confidence back. We
really wanted to wait until we had closer to historic levels before we started incenting representatives to increase their
activity but that becomes a focus now from 2Q on.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Thank you, guys.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: It's Stifel Nicolaus. Good morning, everybody. I guess similar line of questioning from
Russia, since you implemented a new distributor compensation plan the end of January, if you could give us a bit of an
update there on how things have been received so far and how things are trending going forward, that would be
helpful? And then just sort of a related follow-up on Brazil, given some competitor comments about the beauty
category potentially being a little bit slower growing this year versus last year, albeit still at better than average levels
worldwide, just wondering if you could give us some comments there just on overall category growth in terms of the

outlook for the industry?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay. Let me just take Russia first. We implemented fully the compensation changes at the end
of January, and as I said I feel good about the early signs of progress. The number of unit leaders is ahead of our
expectations now, and that was where we were pressured, as you know from some of the social pact changes in the
back half of last year. But the compensation, which was targeted to improve their earnings, is certainly looking like it is
having a good impact. Appointment growth is positive and activity is trending up. So I would say that we feel that
those compensation changes have a positive impact. So the field foundation is better going into second quarter than it
was as we came out of the back half of the year.
In terms of Brazil, I guess the last thing I'm seeing is, and again it's a moving target but I would say high single digits as
a category growth rate, maybe down slightly from low double digits. But having said that, as we look at our business
opportunities, certainly we are focused squarely on just recovering the service levels and getting our representatives
active again. Then we still feel good about the market opportunity in Brazil. The overall category opportunity is still
very good.

Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Deutsche Bank. Hey guys, good morning.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Hi.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Hey, so I know you like to benchmark everything. Can you talk about the SVPA benchmarking?
And I don't want specifics at Avon, but as you look at some of the other investigations, how long are they taking? And
is there any reason we should believe that it'll take you guys longer than that?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, I can't really talk about our investigation, Bill, and just in terms of benchmarking, I'm
reading the same things that you're reading in terms and I think every case is different.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Yeah, because the stuff that I stumbled upon was like three years is almost like the longest
I've seen from one of these investigations. And I think the three-year anniversary is in July. Is that factually correct?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Factually correct.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Great. And then just in terms of cash conversion cycle, once everything kind of settles out
and the noise and the pension and stuff kind of goes away, what do you think is sort of the right cash conversion cycle
for a company like Avon?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Well, what I've been looking at in terms of our longer-term plan is something that'll be a
little less that 100%, probably in the 85% to 90% ratio. And, remember, one of the things that we are going to struggle
with for a reasonably long period of time is the cash-up investments that we're making on capital equipment. So as you
think forward, think about us – cash conversion rates 85% to 90% is probably about the place that we would operate.
I'd love to see it higher than that, but I don't think that'd be realistic.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: And that's for 2013 and beyond? Is that fair?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Yes.
<Q - Bill Schmitz>: Okay. Great. Okay, can I have just more quick one? Just on currency, I think it was about a point
of margin. Is it going to be linear based on the translation with the transaction? I know there's a little bit of a lag, but is
it catching up now?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Linear? No, I don't think you'd say it's going to be linear, because you have – it's a
year-on-year comparison in terms of the relative currency rates where translation is not necessarily directly parallel

with the transaction elements, e.g. how we source product. So there can be some variability quarter-to-quarter on that
one, Bill.
Operator
Your next question comes from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. From Citigroup. Two questions. First of all, in terms of the inventory correction that
you expect to see, can you talk about how that's going to occur and why that isn't going to have a big negative impact
on your gross margin? In other words, are you just going to idle the plants to work through that? Or are you just going
to have a tremendous amount of discounting to flush what's in the system out of the system?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I don't think there'll be a significant amount of discounting that's going to flush it through. I
think the good news is that a lot of the inventory build that we experienced towards the end of last year is all product
that has the opportunity to be flowed normally through catalogs. We just need a program at the end.
I think to me what's more important than any kind of a short-term attack on this is the longer term attack and when I
look at inventory spending, I think you know this has been the one area that I continue to be disappointed by in terms of
our progress.
So actually as part of the process excellence program that Andrea has outlined to you folks a little bit, this is going to
be one of the key focal points. And when I think about it and what we're going to do starting yesterday, is really
redefine the accountability for inventories and it's clearly in the hands now of our Commercial Business unit leaders.
They are the ones that are going to be responsible. We've established a new operational role within each of the CBUs,
which is focused very strongly on inventory management. And then within each of those CBUs the general managers,
each of those general managers has an increased level of accountability in terms of objectives, in terms of operating
processes that ties in with our sales and operational planning process.
Then the other big change that we've made, which I think is also going to be important in terms of getting the inventory
reductions that I think we deserve, is we changed who's responsible for demand forecasting and forecasting has always
been a problem in this area. But we've moved demand forecasting out of the marketing organizations and directly into
the commercial general manager. Again, that same general manager has the accountability through S&LP. So I think
the real answer to the question is it's going to be process change. It isn't going to be a lot of short-term tactics. It really
is process change so we don't build inventory in excess. That we really control on a much more disciplined basis than
we have demand versus supply planning.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: And is the inventory – whatever, the inflated inventory, is it a particular problem by
region? And specifically I'm wondering even though you've had a management change in the U.S. business, does the
shift to less non-Beauty and more Beauty, number one, do those plans still hold even though Geralyn's no longer there?
And is the inventory a particular issue in the U.S. specifically?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Let me address that from the inventory side and say that the inventory pressures that we
had and the problems we had coming out of the end of last year are fairly widespread and you just contract those
primarily to the sales shortfalls that we had or the soft sales that we had third and fourth quarters. I wouldn't want to
point to any one activity that is driving either the region or product line basis.

update there?
And then with all of the issues you have to deal with here in the short-term, it seems that there are some other
high-growth markets in the world, for example, India, that you're just not able to address because of all the near-term
issues. Can you talk about what point in time you might be willing or ready to look at other high-growth markets that
you're not in now to go into those new markets?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah. Let me just, actually I'm going to answer your last question first. I mean we're really not
talking about it, but I can just give you an example. I think our India growth was 60%-plus in the quarter and it was
very, very strong as we came out of 2010. It is an important medium to long-term growth market. But we just have so
many other things to communicate to you. But inside the company we have certainly identified India as one of the
rocket markets, emerging market opportunities in Asia. So we're very pleased with, still small, but growing really,
really fast.
In terms of China, the rollout of this new sales model was completed as we closed out the quarter at the end of March.
I'm actually pleased. I think we've got – we're on track, I think to – we said we would break even in 2011, and then look
for growth and profitability in China in 2012. And I think we're pretty much on track with that. We actually have
several thousand more service centers than we expected. The productivity early on is a little bit lower than we thought,
so we're focused on productivity. But when you net it together, they're pretty much on track with where we thought we
would be when we finished this roll-out.
So this is a transition year, and I don't see anything at this point that changes what we said in terms of where China will
be. And we obviously made the decision because of management changes, and who was running the region, et cetera,
by folding China in. But we are still obviously going to give you visibility and discussion about how we're tracking on
this very important long-term, strategic growth market for us.

Your next question comes from Nik Modi. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Nik Modi>: Yeah. UBS. Andrea, if you could just give us some context on the Service Model Transformation,
what that entails and the implications that'll have once it's fully put into the business?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah. The Service Model Transformation is a multiple-year initiative. It is squarely focused at
making service easier for our Avon representatives and it affects everything that touches her, from invoicing, from how
easy it is to return, from giving her visibility to product availability from a technology point of view for her to be able
to order any time. She's constrained today in many markets on a single opportunity in a campaign to submit her order,
and as we go forward, obviously that constraint what it means to lift it and allow her to order 24/7 anytime she wants,
to decide does she want to have segmentation by customer in her order, things like that. So we have been really focused
on driving a global set of requirements for this.
So this is going to be a global initiative with a global system order management change which we think is very
exciting, but it took about a year from last March to get all the requirements and specifications in with some of our top
leaders, who understand the field of representatives and every aspect of how she does business. And as we go forward,
we continue to work on that. Now moving to designing code in 2011 and looking for a pilot and roll out in the next
couple years. So it's a big undertaking, but a very important one in terms of just sort of very, very competitive service
model to sort of that last mile.
<Q - Nik Modi>: And then just a quick question on the U.S., does the U.S. business have too many reps? It just seems
like there could be a saturation issue in that every incremental rep will start cannibalizing another one. I just wonder if
there's just a structural issue here in the U.S. market. Any thoughts on that?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I don't think that is an issue at all. I think in fact, as we look longer term, rep building is
going to be critical component under the leadership model in North America. So I would leave it just the other way,

Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hi. Morgan Stanley. So, Andrea, I just want to return to Brazil for a minute. You seem
fairly cautious on the top line recovery there in the balance of the year. I think you indicated it would be gradual, but
your comps do get much easier in the back half of the year. So I'm just wondering if there's been a significant negative
impact on rep morale as a result of the hiccups and that's what's driving some of the caution there?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, there is a negative impact. I mean we saw it in the fourth quarter. We're seeing it in the first
quarter. But having said that, we are going up against, to your point, easier comps and we do see gradual improvement
in revenues.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay.
<A - Andrea Jung>: It takes a while. One of the things that I feel good about is certainly the number of orders, the
number of representatives on staff still. Our representatives are still with us. It's the activity that has been pressured
obviously, as they're cautious about placing X amount of units more because they've been burned as it relates to how
long it took them to get them in the fourth quarter, et cetera.
So, as I said, as this recovers to historic levels, we now are going out because we didn't want to do that before we were
comfortable that we were back at these historic levels in terms of no more delays and in terms of an order fill rate that
they've been used to. To go out and really drive through incentives and strong affiliation, the kinds of programs, prizes
and incentives to our representatives to fully engage back with us at their normal level.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And you'd indicated in January, you did some market research that indicated 85%
of your reps in Brazil wanted to stay with Avon. Do you have an update on that number? Have you done any more
market research recently?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah. Our market research continues to show they're not – it validates the fact that we are not
seeing kind of retention issues. They're not leaving Avon. Their activity is down in terms – and their average order. The
number of pieces they're putting in has been pressured because of their concern about putting too many eggs in the
basket if they're not going to get it. But there hasn't been any increased people or representatives leaving the company.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. And, Chuck, if I could slip in a second question, can you just give us an update on
the FX transaction impact you're expecting for the full year in 2011? And also what was it in Q1? I think I missed it on
the slide deck.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: In Q1, it was – I just want to try to give you the exact right number. We had about 80 basis
points impacting both our gross margin as well as some of our expenses. I think as we look through the year that
transaction impact will – well, it all depends on the currencies, obviously, and how they move. But generally, we're
looking for continued gains from transaction exchange, not at the 80 basis point rate, however, that we had in Q1
because the favorability year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter diminishes.

that's on a plus three organic growth. But a very long trail of downs. How does the U.S. really fit strategically in your
overall portfolio? Do you need to have it? And, Chuck, now that you are running the U.S., or at least above the U.S.,
are you earning your cost of capital in the U.S.? And if so, by how much?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Well, let me start backwards and work forwards. Number one, with a margin that's in low
to mid single-digits or mid single-digits, we're not earning our cost of capital. And obviously, margin improvement is
going to be a part of the turnaround in this business.
Secondly, in terms of the business in our portfolio, I think it is a critical business that can grow at least with category, if
not a bit ahead of category, over the long-term once we get the fundamentals right. And when it does that we ought to
have a business that can deliver double-digit margins. So it will more than cover its cost of capital at that stage. And
then, I think about, well what are we doing and what are we going to set out on doing and I think our strategy that we
outlined some 18 months ago – timing, a little bit different, but the elements remain the same. And they were cost;
reduce costs. I think we've actually done a very good job there when you look at the cost movement versus those
declines in sales that you've referenced.
We talked about re-shifting the portfolio, or re-balancing the portfolio away from Non-Beauty against Beauty. I think
there we actually went a little too far. We starved the market basket of the representative and there was a halo impact
on the rest of her business as well. So I think we need to rebalance that a little bit, and I think we're kind of excited
right now as a team because we will be addressing that with introducing what I would call holiday giftables, actually
with separate merchandising or catalog presentation as well for the holiday periods, whether it's Christmas, Mother's
Day, Father's Day but starting at the end of this year.
I think when we look at the representative; it's all about improving her average order size. And so you think about the
giftables. You think about what we're coming out at the end of the year with the breakthrough product on skincare. You
think about the Mom & Baby franchise, which we'll start to expand. So I think we have things for the representative
from that perspective.
But I think the real answer is going to be how do we strengthen the leadership structure in the company and that's the
third prong that we talked about in terms of really moving the business model forward, and it's going to be a focus on
really how do we develop leadership within the model? How do we strengthen that opportunity in terms of the path to
title advancement? How do we manage as we go through leadership? A much more focus on growing the leadership
element of the business, helping leaders develop their downlines, rewarding people on sales and productivity rather just
on staff. I think here is where the real benefit is going to come in terms of enriching the earnings opportunity for
everyone.
So I look at those elements and I say, hey, we've hit on two of the cylinders. The third one is yet to come, but I'm really
excited that it will come and I'm really excited that it will add significant value. Then there's a lot of other things that
we're doing too longer term for the rep that we've talked about it in the past. But it's technology in terms of tools we
give her, it's Service Model Transformation, which Andrea has talked about and it's also a refocusing on customer
segmentation. So I think we have a lot of things in the arsenal. We're going to have to go on a deliberate path to execute
these and execute these flawlessly. But I really do believe, Ali, that this is a business that can deliver the kind of returns
that we're looking for and that'll be based upon getting back into double-digit margins.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So just a follow-up on that. The action plans you laid out all sound compelling, but I struggle to see
what's, I guess, different than before?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: What's really different is nothing from the strategy we laid out 18 months ago. It's how
we're executing it, and it's really the big item from a strategic perspective is really strengthening the leadership structure
and the role of leadership within the organization.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: And then how does price mix play into that? And maybe that's even a broader question for the
whole company. We've heard more balanced price mix. We're not getting that yet. How should we think about that?
And how are you thinking about that in the U.S.? But even more broadly for the whole company going forward?
Thanks.

<A - Charles W. Cramb>: It's a broader question than the U.S. It really is a company wide question, and sure we're in
a moment where with all the commodity pressures that you see, you have to be effective in managing prices and in
managing price realization. So that is the key element. But over the long term strategically, you're right. You're spot on
in that we need greater balance in terms of growth that comes from price and mix versus growth that comes from unit
growth, and the unit growth is going to come as much from an increase in the active representatives as it is the average
order of the representative in terms of number of units in her basket.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Yeah, I'd just add on to that, Ali, I think that growth in reps is going to be correlated with unit
growth, the unit trends which were still weak in the quarter. And we're looking at a pretty aggressive opportunity in the
second half to get them back in line so if you're talking about mixed single digits in the second half, I would hope that
about 2% of that comes from volume for units and a lot of our promotions, our incentives planned for the second half
are driving that. So I feel good.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Andrea Jung>: So that's if you just look at the mid single-digits, I'd look at a couple points of that coming from
units in the second half.

Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Hi, it's Barclays Capital. Can you guys just talk about the UK? Because I think organic
sales decelerated pretty significantly. We've got it as up 4% in the fourth quarter and then down 5% in Q1. Can you just
talk a little bit about what's going on there? Thanks.
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Yeah, I think you're right. There is what looks like a swing in terms of the trend in the UK.
Fourth quarter was unusually strong, very, very high promotional activity, a lot of discounting, a lot of taking
advantage of the holiday season. I think as we're looking at that business moving outwards to be flat to the low
single-digit run rate is probably right given that there still is a tough economic environment there. That tough economic
environment, by the way, is not helped much by the fact that they did take an increase in VAT in 2011. So I think from
an overall core business excluding the Liz Earle business, I think if you think of it, the performance in 2011 as
somewhat paralleling what we had in 2010. That's about right.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Okay. But what drives the acceleration from a 5% decline in Q1?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: I'm sorry.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: What would drive an acceleration from a 5% decline this quarter?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: It's just timing of programs. It's the merchandising activity. It's the way we do some catalog
work.
<A - Amy Low Chasen>: It's not – Lauren, it's Amy. It's not down 5%. It's down 1% in the first quarter.

Your next question comes from Doug Lane. Please state your affiliation then pose your question.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Yeah. Good morning. It's Jefferies. Can we talk a little bit about Silpada, what you're seeing on
top line growth there? And is it still on track to add $0.03 to $0.05 to earnings this year? And have you formulated any
more concrete expansion plans geographically for the next year or so?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Okay. Silpada, I think the big story in Silpada is price of silver. And if you remember when
we made the acquisition, silver was $16, $17 an ounce, and we all know where it is now or we knew where it was
yesterday because it moved so much, but it's in the $43, $44 range, which obviously is putting margin pressure on that
business. In terms of development of the business, the revenues are roughly they're kind of flattish to where we
expected them to be.
When we look at the business from an accretion point of view, it is accretive overall. Whether it'll be $0.03 to $0.05 or
not depends on how successful we are with the second half of this year and programs we've put in place, and those
programs as you would expect, have resulted in a significant change in our product offerings. You cannot raise prices
to fully offset silver and expect to keep your representatives or your consumers as you had them prior to those kind of
significant price increases.
So we're looking at, not only look at, we're implementing some fairly significant changes in the product range, changes
which allow us to have price increases without a direct comparison last catalog versus this catalog, and also the content
of the product in terms of silver versus semiprecious stone. So as we're looking out over 2011, it may not be quite as
the $0.03 to $0.05. Although there will be accretion of this acquisition to the business and if isn't $0.03 to $0.05, we'll
be darn close to it.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: And did you give an organic kind of top line growth that Silpada's running at currently?
<A - Charles W. Cramb>: Right now, it's roughly flat.
<Q - Douglas Lane>: Okay.

Your next question comes from Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: Morning, everyone. Weeden & Co. Andrea and Chuck, my question has to do with the
metrics you used to assess the health of direct selling businesses in general and the impact of your investment in
particular. When you acquired Silpada and Liz Earle in the due diligence process to assess whether this business were
attractive, I wonder whether, did you look at metrics in terms of the actual size of their sales force and whether the sales
force was increasing or decreasing?
And whether you also look at the retention rates of this business, particularly for those – for the leadership reps, to the
equivalent to your leadership reps? And, if the answer is yes, I wonder what is the rationale of not disclosing basic
metrics like this as your direct selling peers do, say, Herbalife?
This request, if you will, will help investors to really assess whether the bonus incentive that you have been handing out
to the field are sufficient to drive retention rates, particularly in markets like Brazil, where you mentioned that your
sales force actually cross sell competitive products like Natura and [ph] Digaty (55:43). Thank you.
<A - Andrea Jung>: Okay, Javier. Let me just quickly say, yes, we do look at those metrics. We looked at them
certainly for Silpada, who has a small – much smaller than Avon, but very, very productive sales force with obviously
good programs in place and good retention. And Liz Earle was not a direct sales business. So again it was something
that we planned to do in the future is take them – to look at the opportunity to put it into direct sales. But there weren't
any sales force productivity or retention metrics on Liz Earle when we acquired them. But just in terms of your
question, I hear you.
And just a comment about leadership reps. I think the retention or, I think if you would, the removal rates, et cetera, for
leadership representatives are considerably lower once they get to titles than the average. So there's a clear correlation
with those who are involved in leadership have better retention and that continues to improve the higher they go in
terms of title advancement. And a lot of our RVP is going into sales leadership incentives and commissions.
So we are by definition over time trying to improve retention not just through leadership, but obviously through some
of the things that I talked about earlier with Service Model Transformation, making it easier to do business with us, and
making our proposition have differentiators, certainly particularly if they're selling dual books or other direct selling
product lines. But we do have a significantly improved retention once someone is in the leadership program as an
up-line.
<Q - Javier Escalante MBA>: But the request probably is why don't you try to disclose this to investors? I understand
that it's not about the actual retention number, say 10, 20 – I don't know, but whether investors are going to be able to
basically track whether the spending that you are making on RVP is enough, right? Whether the turnaround is reliable
and sustainable? And you yourself are doing that when you buy a direct selling business, so you are basically asking
investors to buy Avon shares without having the benefit of the kind of metrics that you do, have when you buy direct
selling businesses. So how can we – it's just kind of like frustrating for us to be guessing all the time whether the
retention rates are increasing. Rather than being guessing, wouldn't it be better for investors to just simply see them and
that's it?
<A - Andrea Jung>: Well, I think your request or your recommendation I hear. I understand it. I hear it. I'll spend
some time talking to Amy about this. I mean we have felt to date that active representatives and how many in our sales

huge major negative. There was a little bit of a negative. But I don't think it's just gas prices, Connie. I would just say
the cost of living increases, food costs. I mean when you combine gas price and cost of living increase, while it didn't
play out as the real issue in our business and/or a major negative, I would think it's safe to say it certainly continues to
be a headwind in 2011, and I think the environment is still tough for our consumer.
When I looked at some statistics on the U.S. mass beauty market, it was down. It was down and so certainly we're
committed to turning this business around. You heard Chuck talk about the strategies that remain constant in terms of
how we intend to do that. But we have headwind from certainly for our consumer and the macros in the category are
not working for us as tailwinds certainly yet. So that's where I am in terms of North American macro.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. Thank you.
Andrea Jung
Okay. Okay, everybody, I think that was the last question. So thank you very much and we'll talk to you soon. Take
care.
