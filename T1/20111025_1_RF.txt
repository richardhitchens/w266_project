Now that we have all of that covered, I will turn it over to our president and CEO, Grayson Hall.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List, and welcome, everyone, to Regions' third quarter conference call. The third quarter results provide
additional evidence that our disciplined efforts are paying off, that we are successfully executing our business plans, as
we delivered another quarter of progress.
Regions earned $101 million or $0.08 per diluted share this quarter. Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income rose to
$540 million, up 19% year over year, and the highest level in more than three years, demonstrating ongoing
improvement in our core business performance. Further, adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision income exceeded the loan loss
provision for the second consecutive quarter, which is critical to Regions achieving sustainable profitability.
Although results met our expectations and demonstrated incremental progress, signs of a weakening economic recovery
and reduced consumer and business confidence began to surface during the third quarter, causing us to take an
increasingly cautious and disciplined stance on credit quality. This environment led to a $200 million linked-quarter
rise in gross nonperforming loan inflows largely driven by investor real estate credits. David will provide much more
detail, but it's important to note that 63% of these gross inflows were still current and performing as agreed.
Our credit metrics showed improvement linked quarter as total nonperforming assets declined 6%. Net charge-offs
decreased 7%. Business Services criticized loans fell 8%, and delinquencies, both early and late stage, improved. While
we remain cautious given the current uncertain economic backdrop, we do expect credit costs to resume their
downward trend in the fourth quarter and credit quality metrics overall to continue to improve.
Our investor real estate exposure continued to decline this quarter, with total outstandings down $4 billion, or 25% thus
far this year. Within this portfolio, construction loans are down 48% so far this year.
I'm particularly pleased with the progress we continue to make in fundamentally improving Regions' business model
both from the standpoint of generating profitable revenue streams and enhancing productivity. Our ongoing focus on
customer needs and superior customer service has enabled us to grow adjusted revenues 1% year to date versus prior
year despite greater economic and regulatory challenges. At the same time, we have focused on controlling expenses,
as evidenced by the 3% decline in year to date adjusted non-interest expenses versus the prior year.
In the third quarter, we generated $14.7 billion in new or renewed loan commitments. In Business Services, loan
production totaled a solid $12.5 billion, down linked quarter but stable year over year. Commercial and industrial loan
growth remained strong, with ending balances up 3% linked quarter and nearly 13% higher than a year ago.
Importantly, commitments increased approximately 3% during the quarter, and line utilization rose to 43%. Middle
market C&I lending, particularly specialized industries, such as energy, healthcare and franchise restaurant, continued
to drive the growth.
We do expect commercial loan growth to continue, even as economic uncertainty weighs on customer confidence,
which does have a moderating effect on investment by businesses. While we are seeing incremental pricing
competition, especially in the middle market space, our relationship banking approach and brand differentiation has for
the most part mitigated this impact. Our spreads remain above those experienced prior to the recession.
On the consumer front, loan production totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, a 7% increase over the prior quarter, led by
higher mortgage and credit card production.
Looking specifically at mortgage production, this quarter's low rates resulted in solid origination volumes totaling $1.5
billion, or 9% higher than the prior quarter. Additionally, indirect auto lending provided a steady source of loan growth,
with balances up 4% on a linked quarter basis.
Demand for home equity lines and loans remained low. As a result, this portfolio continues to decline at a pace of $90
million to $100 million per month. Customer deleveraging continues to affect overall consumer loan balances as

runoffs exceed new production.
Efforts to improve funding mix and costs continued to produce good results in the third quarter as well. As deposit
costs declined another 7 basis points, total average deposits were stable linked quarter, with average low-cost deposits
growing 2% linked quarter. We continue to see the opportunity to further reduce deposit costs, most significantly
through properly repricing maturing CDs, of which they declined this quarter 22% of total deposits. As a result, we will
likely continue to observe a favorable shift in deposit mix and a further reduction in funding costs.
Notably, from September 30 of this year through the end of next year, approximately $13.1 billion of CDs are
scheduled to mature. These CDs on average carry an interest rate of 1.54%, which compares to expectations in the
current rate environment for average rates of new CDs coming on at a 25 to 40 basis point range.
One other important note this quarter on deposits is according to the latest FDIC Summary of Deposits report, Regions
maintained its number one market share in Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi and also maintained a position of
fourth or better in Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana. This was achieved despite our efforts to reduce our CD portfolio
and lower deposit costs 26 basis points during the same time period.
Despite economic, legislative and regulatory challenges, adjusted non-interest revenues were down only 1% linked
quarter and stable year over year. Relationship banking, not single one-time transactions, are at the core of our business
plans. We are making steady progress in deepening and expanding customer relationships with a strong cross-sell of
products. We are continuing to adapt our product line to meet our customers' changing needs while maintaining a
best-in-class customer service.
Credit card revenues, including increased branch card sales, are already benefiting from our credit card portfolio
purchased late in the second quarter. We expect benefits to increase further once we assume servicing the portfolio next
year and we increase our focus and attention on cross-sell efforts in our branch offices.
I have mentioned implementation of the Durbin Amendment on October 1. This has presented the industry and Regions
with another financial hurdle in growing fee revenues, but we have already begun to implement plans to mitigate the
estimated $170 million annual impact. And between changes to our checking account fee structure and other revenue
initiatives that we have implemented in the second half of this year, we do expect to make up this revenue shortfall over
time during the balance of 2012.
Improving productivity and efficiency is another key element of our business plan, and we have continued to make
progress on this front in the third quarter. We're fundamentally changing our cost culture, continuously seeking
opportunities to improve and control efficiency while still making appropriate investments to enhance our competitive
position and remain a superior service provider. Year to date our head count is down 1,000 positions, with further
reductions expected by the end of the year. Also, occupancy expenses are declining as we have eliminated
approximately 1 million square feet of excess space in the company this year.
Our capital continues to build as we generate earnings with our Tier 1 common ratio at 8.2% as of September 30th.
And let me mention one other item before turning it over to David. As you know, we are reviewing strategic
alternatives for Morgan Keegan. We're not in a position to comment on this further today, but I can tell you that we're
making good progress. Progress is on schedule and in line with our expectations. And we do expect to have more to say
on this issue in the very near future.
I'll now turn it over to David, who will provide you with additional financial details for the quarter, after which I'll
come back for a few closing comments before we take questions. David.
David J. Turner
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter 2011 results beginning on
slide three.

Overall our results reflect stable revenue, lower expenses and improved loan loss provision. Earnings per share totaled
$0.08, and net income available to common shareholders amounted to $101 million. Adjusted TPI amounted to $540
million, an 8% increase versus prior quarter. Within TPI, total revenue was down 1% linked quarter, and the net
interest margin declined 3 basis points to 3.02%. However, non-interest expenses adjusted for the prior quarter's branch
consolidation and other property charges were down 5% sequentially, reflecting a decline in FDIC premiums, as well
as a reduction in salaries and benefits expense.
Let's now take a detailed look at credit quality trends, beginning with nonperforming loan inflows.
As shown on slide four, inflows of nonperforming loans rose $200 million late quarter to $755 million. This quarter's
increase was primarily driven by the land, condo, single-family and income-producing investor real estate portfolios.
However, it is important to note that 63% of this quarter's inflows were current in paying as agreed.
In addition, as shown on the right side of the slide, 45% or over $1 billion of the September 30th total Business
Services nonperforming loans were current and paying as agreed, a 3 percentage point increase versus the prior quarter.
Turning to slide five, nonperforming loans excluding loans held for sale declined $74 million or 3%, and
nonperforming assets decreased 6%. This quarter, we executed strategic sales of problem assets totaling $660 million.
Additionally, we moved $384 million of problem loans to held for sale.
Early and late stage credit indicators again demonstrated improvement, with total delinquencies declining 7%.
Additionally, Business Services criticized loans were down approximately $595 million or $8% from second quarter's
level and have declined $3.3 billion since this period last year. Despite the challenging economic backdrop, we expect
overall credit trends to continue to improve.
The $1.2 billion increase in accruing troubled debt restructurings or TDRs reflects this quarter's new accounting
guidance. Importantly, this change has no material impact to our allowance. In fact, commercial and investor real estate
loans modified as TDRs increased the allowance for loan losses by less than $20 million.
Moving on to slide six, third quarter's net charge-offs were impacted by the disposition activity discussed earlier. Net
charge-offs associated with this activity totaled $198 million; however, markdowns on the disposed assets had largely
been provided for earlier in our loan loss allowance.
Net charge-offs totaled $511 million and exceeded the loan loss provision by $156 million, marking the second
consecutive quarter we have provided less than charge-offs.
Excluding net charge-offs related to this quarter's disposition activity, net charge-offs were down 8% linked quarter.
Our loan loss allowance of nonperforming loan coverage was 109% at September 30th, while our loan loss allowance
to net loans totaled 3.73%.
Turning to the balance sheet, slide 7 breaks down this quarter's change in loans and loan yields. Average loans declined
less than 1% linked quarter, with declines in investor real estate offsetting healthy C & I growth and second quarter's
credit card portfolio purchase. The aggregate loan yield increased 4 basis points compared with prior quarter to 4.31%
and was driven by our credit card portfolio. We believe there are attractive opportunities to grow this portfolio over
time, as currently only 1 out of 10 of our customers has a Regions credit card.
On the Business Services front, we continue to see strength in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio with
average and ending loans up 12.4% and 12.9% from one year ago, respectively. Demand continues to be broad-based
as we experience increases in 55% of our markets. Total commercial and industrial commitments rose $700 million
linked quarter, ending the quarter at $28.7 billion, and line utilization increased to 43.3%, which still remains below our
historical levels.
We continue to make progress in derisking our investor real estate portfolio as well. Over the past year, we have
reduced this portfolio by 32%, and it now comprises only 15% of our total loan portfolio, down from nearly 21% one
year ago.

Moving on to deposits. As noted on slide 8, average and ending deposits were both stable linked quarter, driven by our
strength in gathering low-cost deposits, particularly non-interest bearing deposits, offset by reductions in our time
deposits. Average time deposits declined $1.1 billion during the third quarter. As a result, average low-cost deposits as
a percentage of total deposits have risen from 73.5% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to 77.8% this quarter. This
positive mix shift led to another seven basis points decline in third quarter total deposit costs to 46 basis points, which
is down 24 basis points since the third quarter of 2010.
Our shift in funding mix to low-cost deposits is also favorably impacting total funding costs, which declined another 5
basis points to 75 basis points. As was mentioned earlier in the call, we will continue to benefit from the repricing of
maturing CDs. Much of this benefit will come in the latter half of 2012, but we do have $2.4 billion of CDs maturing in
the fourth quarter of 2011, which carry an average rate of 1.32%.
Turning to slide 9, taxable equivalent net interest income declined $6 million, with the resulting net interest margin
declining 3 basis points to 3.02%. This quarter's drop was due to higher levels of prepayments and the resulting
negative impact on investment portfolio yields along with a larger impact from cash reserves at the Federal Reserve.
Recent changes to the Fed's large-scale asset purchase program, or Operation Twist, among other reasons, resulted in a
sharp decline in long-term interest rates. This, in turn, led to higher prepayment rates, causing an increase in premium
amortization on mortgage-backed securities. Since long-term interest rates declined in the latter half of the quarter we
do expect prepayments to increase in the fourth quarter as they typically lag a couple of months.
The major drivers of the outlook continue to be the levels of long-term interest rates, which drive prepayment, and
reinvestment rates in the investment and mortgage portfolios. However, barring any significant moves from here, we
expect the net interest margin will remain stable through 2012.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue on slide 10. Excluding securities transactions and leveraged lease
terminations, third quarter non-interest revenue amounted to $748 million, down 1% sequentially but unchanged year
over year. Third quarter's non-interest revenue reflected higher mortgage revenues and stable service charges, offset by
a decline in brokerage, capital markets and investment banking revenues.
Mortgage revenue was positive impacted by the third quarter's decline in interest rates. Origination volume rose 9% as
customers took advantage of historically low rates.
Service charge income remained strong due to the ongoing restructuring of our checking accounts to fee eligible and an
increase in spending activity, lifting debit card revenue. Incremental debit card usage has driven an 11% increase in
total transactions year to date, resulting in 13% higher interchange income. We have already begun mitigating the lost
interchange income through account changes, implementation of fees and new products and services for our customers.
Brokerage investment banking and capital markets income was down, reflecting pressure from greater market volatility
during the quarter.
Turning to expenses on slide 11, non-interest expense declined 5% linked quarter, excluding the prior quarter's branch
consolidation and property and equipment charges. The key drivers of this quarter's improvement were a $32 million
reduction in salaries and benefits expense and a $25 million reduction in FDIC premiums. Now going forward, we
currently expect FDIC premium expense to be approximately $50 million a quarter. Partially offsetting these are
credit-related expenses, which include other real estate expense, net gains and losses from sales of loans in our held for
sale bucket, and credit-related personnel costs increased $8 billion and accounted for 9% of third quarter's adjusted
non-interest expenses.
Over time, a significant amount of credit-related cost should be eliminated. Additionally, we reduced head count
another 1% in the third quarter, resulting in a 3% year-to-date reduction. We will continue to focus on driving expense
savings without sacrificing investment opportunities or compromising high service levels our customers have come to
expect and deserve at Regions. Slide 12 provides a snapshot of our solid capital ratios and favorable liquidity position.
Tier 1 common increased to 8.2% and our Tier 1 ratio stands at 12.8%. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding
company remained solid, with a loan to deposit ratio of 83%, and cash held at the Federal Reserve totaled
approximately $6 billion.

Overall, this quarter's results show continued progress. We are improving our core business performance, reducing our
credit risks and further strengthening our balance sheet.
Now let me turn it back over to Grayson for his closing remarks.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David. While Regions continues to face some headwinds we have a business plan in place that we believe
will enable us to achieve sustainable performance and ensure attractive long-term returns for shareholders. And
importantly, we are successfully executing our plan as demonstrated by our third quarter's results.
We can't control the economic environment, but we are focused on those factors we can control. At Regions, we've
made it our priority to keep focused on our customers. To illustrate this, let me point out that approximately 80% of our
associates are customer-facing, out in the field, in our branch offices, focusing on winning our customers' respect and
loyalty, taking market share and properly growing our business one customer at a time.
We are building sustainable profitability by diversifying and expanding our revenue streams and controlling our
operating expenses. We are quickly adapting our product offerings and services to be more innovative and to
compensate for the negative impacts from legislative changes as well as customers changing needs and expectations.
We are enhancing enterprise-wide risk management by derisking our balance sheet, maintaining pricing discipline and
prudently managing our capital.
Perhaps lost in the market turmoil is just how far Regions has come in the past few years. Let me highlight a few
examples. The investor real estate portfolio has been reduced by almost $14 billion. Our loan loss allowance, at $3
billion today, is over two times higher than it was just in 2007, and our Tier 1 common ratio has increased 150 basis
points. And today, we're core funded, attributing to a 25% increase in low-cost deposits. We are clearly a much
stronger franchise today, and we are profitably moving forward.
Operator, we'll now take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert Placet>: Good morning. This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. How are you guys doing?
<A - David J. Turner>: Hi, Rob.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert Placet>: First question, just on your outlook for credit quality. You mentioned you expect overall credit
trends to continue to improve from here. As we think about MPA levels, how should we think about nonaccrual inflows
from here versus additional asset dispositions?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Rob, obviously we're facing a challenging economic backdrop, but as we said in our
comments, we do believe that as we look forward we'll continue to see a favorable trend in our credit metrics. I'll just
stop there and ask Barb Godin, our chief credit officer, to make a few comments in that regard.
<A - Barb Godin>: If you look at our early stage delinquencies or late stage criticized, classified, again, they're all
down. So that too would suggest that we're seeing a little bit of stability, but as Greyson has mentioned, we are
obviously tied to what we're seeing in the economy. As we think about the influence that we've seen this quarter, a lot
of the inflows, as I said 63%, we're seeing current and as agreed, but it was based on conversations from our customers

that, you know, they were seeing some of the trends in the overall economy softening. Based on those conversations we
went ahead and we had moved those two to a non-performing loan status all in on the non-performing asset side.
However, we're going to continue to dispose of assets. You saw that we closed $660 million this quarter. We moved an
additional $384 million into held for sale for disposal next quarter. So we're going to continue with our, I'll call it,
aggressive derisking.
<Q - Robert Placet>: Okay. Great. And just a follow-up on your asset disposition this quarter. I think the market took
on the loans – it was around 20% this quarter, which compared to around 30% last quarter. So just a question on what
drove the decline. Is it a difference in the type of assets you sold, or it is a pickup in interest on the buyer side?
<A - Barb Godin>: No. What we actually saw, Rob, is that we had roughly a – the old 10% liquidity over and above
what we would have reserved the loans for. So we really didn't see a big difference in that. We did sell a lot more of
these smaller loans. If you take our average loan size we sold this quarter, it was under $1 million. If you look at
compared to a year ago, it was $3 million on average in terms of the size of loans we sold. They're getting a lot more
granular.
<Q - Robert Placet>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Jennifer.
<Q - Jennifer Demba>: Good morning. Can you just talk about – give us any more color you can on the higher
inflows of problem loans this quarter versus the second quarter? I know you gave us the categories that it was mostly
coming from, but can you just give us any more color that you can?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Jennifer, I would say that really the composition of the inflows from second to third
quarter really haven't changed that much. It's still the same, relative same mix. We continue to have dialogue with our
customers in terms of both capacity to repay and commitment to repay. We've had a number of those kind of dialogues.
Obviously we have a continuous credit review process, and as we come through the quarter, you know, we have
identified certain credits that we felt like that it was prudent to move to a nonperforming status. It's up slightly as
you've seen from the second quarter, but what we've sort of said all along there's going to be some level of volatility in
this. Obviously as the economy softened, some of our customer confidence has softened as well.
That being said, as we pointed out earlier in the presentation, there is a higher percentage of these loans paying as
agreed than what we've seen in the second quarter, and our overall nonperforming loan base continues to have yet even
a higher level of paying as agreed.
Barb, anything you'd want to add to that – the mix?
<A - Barb Godin>: No, I think you've hit on all the major points. Again, if you look at the migration that we've had, it
really was really the vast majority did come from our investor real estate portfolio, which we all have agreed will be
lumpy as we come out of the current economic climate that we're in.
<Q - Jennifer Demba>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Hi, thanks, guys. I have kind of a broad question. I'm trying to see if you can – or figure
out if you can keep your pre-tax, pre-provision earnings fairly stable here. Along those lines, a big piece of that would

be the margin, and I was a little surprised you gave flat margin guidance given that you've got so much firepower in the
margin, I suppose, in the – from potential better credit and potential use of liquidity. But do you think that you can keep
your pre-tax, pre-provision earnings fairly stable even if loans continue to shrink a little bit here?
<A - David J. Turner>: Jefferson, this is David. You know, in terms of if we look at margin, clearly having this
interest rate environment that we're in, a very volatile environment, on the low side, causes to us reinvest our cash at a
lower rate environment that puts pressure on our margin. That being said, we've been able to hold that margin because
of our benefit we receive on the deposit side of the house as we continue to reprice maturing CDs. So I think being able
to hold that, from a loan standpoint, we have had nice growth in our C & I loan bucket. We have offset that on a net
basis with the continued derisking in investor real estate, which we think will slow – the decline of that will slow
somewhat in the fourth quarter, so we feel good about being able to maintain that margin.
Now, we do have $6 billion of cash at the Federal Reserve that [ph] is paying (33:00) 25 basis points today that is
pretty conservative from a liquidity standpoint. And as our ratings continue, if we can get our ratings to improve, then
we can be less defensive with that cash and get it invested on a more efficient basis. So we have some upside and we're
not calling that right now. Perhaps when we get the rating changed, we will have further progression in the margin.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Thanks, David. Thank you.
<A - David J. Turner>: Sure.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Jefferson this is Greyson. You know, I think that when you look at the margin, we have
guided to the stable margin, there are obviously, you know, some opportunities for upside to that as there is for
downside. But I would say that the deposits, when we look at our cost to deposits, there's an opportunity there for
improvement to the margins on the loan side. As we're repricing loans, you know, we went into this cycle with a
relatively small percentage of our loans fixed versus variable, so we're not having repricing pressure. Most of our
repricing is actually to our advantage at this juncture in the cycle.
Where most of our pressure on margins is going to come from is from the investment portfolio, and depending on
which way rates go over the near term is really going to drive how much pressure that we'll actually receive from that
front. And the fourth element is, you know, is the effort to provide more favorable refinancing opportunities for
residential mortgage holders. And what level of prepayments does that result in? Because as you recall, our investment
portfolio is very heavy in mortgage-backed securities.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: Yep. I think David may have partially answered this. But do you think that the balance
sheet can take stay around the same size next year? Or do you think it should shrink a little bit as you continue running
off the runoff portfolio?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think that if you kind of look on a net basis, it's going to be driven largely by the economy
and how strong that is for us to continue the C & I growth, which has been a great driver of offsetting the decline. You
know, we've been declining the investor real estate portfolio about $1.5 billion each quarter and we've had great growth
in C & I. So the question is how long will the economy kind of hang in there where C & I can continue to move along.
But we do see a slowdown as I mentioned earlier in investor real estate, so we'll have to see how those two work
themselves out over the long haul.
<Q - Jefferson Harralson>: All right. Thank you, guys.

<Q - John Pancari>: Can you talk about the outlook for the reserve level longer term? And how do you think about
that right now, just as you're still seeing the ability to release reserves here in the coming quarters?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Okay. Matt Lusco, Chief Risk Officer, Matt, would you answer that?
<A - C. Matthew Lusco>: I'd be glad to. Our allowance level, we believe, is at about 109%, I guess, of our
nonperforming right now, and as you've seen, we've been able to underprovide our charge-offs for two quarters that are
running now. You know, we believe that our – we're seeing some shift in our loss given default and our model, but we
believe that's offset by a lower probability of default as we kind of continue to work through some of the things. That
being said, I think, you know, we are in the back latter half of this credit cycle, and I think you'll kind of see the trends
that we've shown with our allowance levels and our provision levels continuing into future quarters.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I do think we've been pretty disciplined in our allowance process. We've strengthened that
process over time and we're going to stay very disciplined in how we execute that. We've been, you know, we've been
conservatively modest in what we've done over the last two quarters. I think you can continue to see that conservatism
come through in our actions, but, you know, we're going to let our methodology and our disciplines drive the results of
that. And as Matt said we are seeing a forecast for more favorable trend, but with maybe a slower pace than we would
have seen 90 days ago.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up would be on the loan growth. You mentioned that
you're seeing loan yields hold up, particularly on your new loan growth largely concentrated in commercial. Can you
just give us some color on those new yields? What yields are your new commercial loan generation coming on at?
<A - David J. Turner>: Let me answer it this way, John. We have seen pricing pressure clearly in the upper end of the
middle market portfolio. That being said, spreads are still better than some of the earlier years. I think that a lot of folks
obviously want to grow C & I, and we see the pricing pressure coming through that. We want to maintain our discipline
in this environment because we want to make sure the loans that go on the books have the right risk-adjusted return.
And we will not go in put low spread product on our books just to grow the loan portfolio. We've been able to use our
relationship with our customers as our predominant sales tactic, and that relationship allows you to maintain the spreads
that we started with. So I think all in we should be able to maintain those spreads. The question would be what does the
economy give us for actual loan growth in that type of competitive environment?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: John, most of the pricing pressure has really come from the upper end of the C & I. The
lower end of C & I, middle market and small business lending, that pricing competition has been substantially less, but
that being said, you know, we're doing comparative pricing with third parties. We sort of know where we're at from a
spread standpoint. And I would say we have seen that spread compression in the upper end of C & I but still above
historical level. And we're very comfortable with where we're pricing today and the discipline we're using in that.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks. I know we're not going to able to talk about timeframes of either the Morgan Keegan or
eventual potential TARP exit, but I just wanted to ask you to go through with us what things you need as far as markers
or the glide path, I guess, as you're thinking through, you know, getting Morgan Keegan completed one way or the
other and then starting to think about eventual TARP repayment.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Ken, we're really not in position to comment on our strategic view with Morgan Keegan
this morning. And we don't – we hope that the commentary is forthcoming in the near future, but as of this morning,
we're not in position nor should we attempt to be to comment on that today. And our strategy on TARP repayment
really is not altered. We still are being patient and prudent in that regard. We believe we're doing the things necessary
to put us in position to be able to do that at the appropriate time, and really no change in that regard.

<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. And my follow-up question, just regards to the remaining risks left on the balance sheet,
you had mentioned that you'd expect this position to slow with regard – you know, in the context of continuing to see
asset quality improvement. But can you just give us some color on, you know, where you still see the opportunities to
dispose of assets in the portfolio? And related to or aside to that, you know, obviously, there wasn't a big improvement,
a big increase in the TDRs, which you had put forth to us in the 10-Q, but the magnitude is still pretty big. Can you just
remind us again what the reserves are already against the TDR book as they have already been migrated through the
portfolio?
<A - C. Matthew Lusco>: This is Matt Lusco. As David stated earlier, you know, the disclosure of incremental TDRs
consistent with the new literature really did not materially in any way change our allowance composition on that. But I
will tell you that as has been said, we continue to see in terms of all of our nonperforming book, we do continue to see
a higher percentage of paying as agreed, which we do believe provides us with a higher level of opportunity to dispose
of those assets.
We continue, as Barb said, to be aggressive in looking at our derisking activities, our higher content [ph] lost (42:50)
and land, condo and single-family is just right at a little north of $2 billion, you know, that's the segment we have
continued to try to work down by our derisking activities and I think we'll continue to be just as aggressive as we can
on that. It varies market to market. We see better opportunities in some of larger metro markets than we do in others,
but we do continue to – that is a critical part of our plan and we're working it as aggressively as we can.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But I would say – this is Greyson. I'd just add to Matt's comments, is that as Barb had said
earlier, you know, our stressed loan portfolio is getting more granular in nature, and these loans are in a smaller
denomination than what we had seen a year ago substantially. And we do still have many interested buyers and we are
still able to dispose of assets at economic positions that make sense. We haven't seen a lot of change in that. Obviously,
the, you know, valuations are still under pressure in many markets, and we have to adjust to that each and every month,
but so far, you know, our strategy remains intact, and we're still executing that strategy.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Good morning.
<A - David J. Turner>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: The first question I had is a follow-up to Ken's question and it's for Barb. I apologize in
advance that this will probably be a compound question. With regards to the additional $1 billion of investor real estate
TDRs that were identified under the new accounting policy, could you tell us specifically what in the change in
accounting guidelines caused you to reclassify this? What composition of this $1 billion is income-producing today and
what in your restructuring or the way you restructured these notes gives you confidence that you don't need to further
provide for this $1 billion?
<A - Barb Godin>: Okay. The literature itself suggested that when you do a renewal, you need to ensure that you
obtain a market rate. Because these loans are substandard in nature, which means they have a deficiency that we have
noted, that then brings into question what is the appropriate market rate, and we don't believe that that is an easy
number to find. We believe that we would be talking something probably double digits. The majority of these credits
that we've gone ahead and renewed, we have gone ahead and renewed them for increased interest rates in many
instances, or even additional collateral support. But clearly we're not able to get ourselves comfortable that we would
go ahead and make a substandard loan today at any rate. That's really the defining factor, is that we won't go ahead and
put new substandard loans on the books.

So by definition, all loans that are in the investor real estate portfolio that we are renewing that are substandard will be
considered as [ph] probable (46:14) restructures. And again, that's what led to the increase in the TDRs. But as Matt
and Greyson and others have pointed out, as we think about our reserving methodology, these have all been generally
reserved for us. We said it was less than a $20 million impact all in as we looked at what the impact of our TDRs were.
So we're feeling, you know, comfortable with our process, number one, and then number two as we continue with an
ongoing dialogue with our customers, which really is ongoing, it's not stop and start, we're able to look forward and say
there will be a number of these credits that in due course will be restructured when they're no longer considered as a
substandard loan, when they get back to a past-rated category. And at that time, we would hope it would come out of
the TDR status.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Let me add one thing to that. The TDR designation is an accounting matter, and as Barb
mentioned, does not have anything to do with how we calculate our reserves. These aren't restructurings; the bulk of
what you saw in the increase were not restructurings. They were renewals in ordinary course. And so as you look at the
TDR disclosures, and you're going to see a lot of disclosures coming through the 10-Q, the better disclosures that we
have are the criticized and classified loans and the reserves related to that.
And that really gets back to, Ken, your question that you had earlier, if you're still on, on reserves with TDRs. You
need to look at the criticized and classifieds and that's the better information available out there.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: That's helpful. And just a follow-up, could you I guess give us a sense of how much of the
total accruing TDRs are income producing and also during the renewal process if you get updated appraisals during the
renewal?
<A - Barb Godin>: I'll answer the second part of the question, which is we do get updated appraisals as we do our
renewals. We have a pretty standard process around that and we've ensured, Erika, that we keep our tendors short as
well. So generally what we've done is, it's been a strategy of ours, is to keep the tenor short to make sure that the
renewal is done in one-year increments. That way we stay close to the customer, close to their financial situation,
versus renewing something for a two or three-year period, which you could actually lose sight of the customer.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But I do think – this is a Greyson – that a point Barb made is important to note. At the
beginning of the cycle, we made a very conscious decision to start reducing our tenor. And most of our – there's a big
percentage of our commercial real estate loans that are on a tenor of one year. And so when these loans come up for
renewal, to David's point, when we look at TDRs as an accounting designation and we look at – if we're renewing a
credit that we've got risk reading substandard, the first question is is it a substandard loan, yes or no? And if it is, then
you have to ask yourself the question on the literature, what is the correct market rate that you would do that loan at?
And if you would look historically, most of the loans moving into a TDR status were restructured. In our case, it would
be predominantly consumer mortgages that we had made some sort of concession on that moved in there. On the
commercial side, it was really the restructures that we had done in an A/B note methodology, but today, under the
current literature, you're going to see renewals where renewals go in and if it's substandard and we can't define a market
rate, then by definition, it's going to get designated as a TDR.
<A - David J. Turner>: Just to let you know, you asked how much is in TDR-related investor real estate. The total is
about $1.5 billion.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: I guess, I'm sorry, my question was income producing versus still in construction phase.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, we'll have to get back with you on that. We don't have that breakdown in front of us.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Thank you. That was helpful.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Erika, I would mention, I guess, out of our total investor commercial real estate portfolio,
construction now just comprises slightly over $1 billion of the entire portfolio.
<Q - L. Erika Penala>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Nomura.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Hi. I guess just more broadly on credit, one of the issues it feels like everyone's trying to get their
arms around is for the past two years, three years, it's been easy to explain why you have more, you know, credit issues
than the average bank because you were heavy in real estate and you were heavy in the Southeast. And now, you know,
that we all see a lot of the real estate heavy banks improving at a faster and more consistent rate, and we see some of
your Southeast peers improving at a faster and more consistent rate, I guess, when you go through the same process of
benchmarking why do you think your credit is slower to improve at this point in the cycle than some of your peers?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Clearly, when you look at our portfolio, we went into this with, you know, with a
concentration in the Southeast and particularly in Florida and Georgia, which have been some of the more stressed
markets in the country, but certainly in our footprint, the most stressed. And clearly, when you see – you're seeing
improvement, but the question is the pace of improvement and the consistency of improvement, we continue to work
through the challenges we have in the portfolio. The progress is being made.
That being said, the pace of economic recovery in the markets we're operating in in large part are going to drive the
recovery of our customers. We're working through it. You're seeing improvements month after month, quarter after
quarter, but it's incremental at this juncture. Obviously we would love to see a faster pace and are taking actions to
accelerate that on our own balance sheet. But in the absence of real economic recovery, this is going to be slower than
we had anticipated. Barb?
<A - Barb Godin>: Brian, the other thing that I would add is that if I look at what did come into the migration for the
nonperforming loans for this quarter, between the Atlanta Sandy Springs area and Miami, that accounted for 22% of the
inflows. So I would consider those to be our most stressed markets, clearly. The rest of our markets, as you look, in
terms of the percentage that they provided on the NPL migration in was not great, but those two markets themselves
drove, as I said, around 22% of the inflow. And it really speaks to what's happening with valuation and the soft
economy in both Atlanta and Miami that continues.
<A - David J. Turner>: I'd add one thing, too. This is David. In terms of acknowledging that we have the credit that
you laid out, that's why we have a $3 billion loan loss reserve, which is 3.73% of total loans, which is higher than most
as well.
<Q - Brian Foran>: That's all extremely helpful. And if I could follow-up, the Atlanta and Miami, can you remind us,
I mean, assuming most of those inflows are Atlanta and Miami investor real estate, how much investor real estate is
there left in those two markets?
<A - Barb Godin>: I don't have that number off the top of my head. Again, we can get back to you on that.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We can get back to you. We don't have that with us this morning.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Great. And then if I could sneak in one last one. How significant is the rolloff of swaps next year?
And is that factored into the outlook for kind of a flattish NIM going forward?
<A - David J. Turner>: You know, in total, which is factored already into my comment on – that we should be able to
maintain the stable margins, but if you kind of broke the pieces apart, you'd be in that seven to eight basis point range.
<Q - Brian Foran>: Great. Thank you.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple questions, one on the asset sales that did you this quarter. Can you give us a sense
as to where you ended up marking them relative to what they were on the books for?
<A - Barb Godin>: Yes, we did a couple of bulk sales of some smaller loans, and again, we were within that 10%.
Again, I would call that the liquidity premium on the bulk sale. On the balance of the sales that we did, we were right
on where our marks were.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Does that at all factor into NCOs or is that embedded within the expenses?
<A - Barb Godin>: No, that would be, again, as we move them into held for sale, they show up the net charge-off line.
When they're in held for sale, they would show up as an expense. And we sold a lot of held for sale; we sold a total of
$660 billion overall of, which coming out of held for sale, we sold $244 billion of the nonperforming and a further
$163 billion of accruing loans.
<A - David J. Turner>: The OREO [indiscernible] (55:36)...
<A - Barb Godin>: Yes, OREO sales were $146 million.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I would add though that our experience used to be pretty consistent over this year with our
derisking activities that we really have, as Barb said, that 10% liquidity discount and what flows through beyond the
levels of marks and allowance we've already provided.
<A - David J. Turner>: So predictability and consistency of marks has gotten much better as this cycle has gone
along.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So on a Q-on-Q basis, the impact to the NCO ratio is fairly flat, or it's a little bit lighter; is
that right?
<A - David J. Turner>: Our net charge-off percentage is slightly elevated by the derisking activity. If you really take
out the derisking activities and look at more of a normal flow of streams, we'd be down from 250 to, you know, more
like 170 or so.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Betsy, if you're trying to go from each quarter, that liquidity discount has been about the
same and we actually had dispositions in each of the quarter transfers roughly close to the same number. So it's flattish
when you look at the provision component of that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just separately, and it might be too early to answer this question, but I just
want to get it out there. The FHFA announced yesterday some new program guidelines around HARP, and it sounded
like investor properties were going to be eligible. I know they're talking about small numbers, maybe doubling the size
of the program under the new guidelines. I'm wondering if you've taken a look at that and to the degree that that might
be helpful or impactful for you.
<A - David J. Turner>: We did. This is David. We looked at, you know, some rough numbers to see what that might
impact us. You've seen all kinds of numbers in terms of how many mortgages that might affect, maybe a million
mortgages. For us, we think, you know, that number in terms of prepayment exposure that we would have would be in
the range for a period of $20 million to $40 million perhaps.

Mr. Cassidy, your line is open.
<Q>: Hi everybody. This is [ph] Steve Jolly (58:11) in for Gerard. We've just got one question on the NPL inflows.
You guys had 60% that was current in paying. Do you know if that's consistent with the last couple of quarters?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: It's higher.
<A - Barb Godin>: It's higher than the last few quarters. 48% last quarter, and it's been tracking up each and every
