Thank you, Chris. I'll discuss the second quarter results for the company and Steve Chazen will follow for guidance for
the second half of year. Core income was $1.8 billion or $2.23 per diluted share in the second quarter this year
compared to $1.1 billion, or $1.32 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Net income was $1.8 billion, or
$2.23 per diluted share in the second quarter this year compared to $1.1 billion, or $1.31 per diluted share in the second
quarter of last year.
Here's a segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and Gas segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were
$2.6 billion compared with $1.9 billion in the same period of 2010. The improvement in 2011 was driven mainly by
higher commodity prices. The second quarter 2011 realized prices increased on a year-over-year basis by 39% for
crude oil, 31% for NGLs and 2% for domestic natural gas.
Sales volume for the second quarters of 2011 and 2010 were flat at 705,000 BOE per day. Production volumes were
715,000 BOE per day in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 701,000 in the second quarter of 2010. The production
guidance assumptions we gave you in last quarter's conference call were at a $95 WTI average price assumption. The
actual average second quarter oil price of $102.56 reduced our production volumes by about 5,000 BOE per day.
Domestic production volumes were 424,000 BOE per day compared to our guidance of 425,000 BOE per day. The
higher crude oil prices reduced Long Beach volumes by about 1,000 BOE per day.
Latin America volumes were 33,000 BOE per day. In the Middle East region, we recorded no production in Libya,
consistent with our guidance. In Iraq, we produced 5,000 BOE per day. The decline from first quarter volume was due
to the timing of development spending. The Yemen daily production was 23,000 BOE compared to 33,000 BOE in the
first quarter. Civil unrest and operational issues reduced our daily production by 3,000 BOE and higher prices and
lower development spending rates reduced daily volumes by 7,000 BOE. The remainder of the Middle East had
production of 230,000 BOE per day compared with 235,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. Qatar's production was
lower by 7,000 BOE per day, mainly due to planned maintenance and mechanical issues.
Our second quarter sales volume guidance which assumed a $95 WTI oil price was 725,000 BOE per day, which
translates to about 720,000 BOE per day at the higher actual prices for the quarter. Our actual volumes were 705,000
BOE per day. The lower volumes resulted mainly from the lower production in Yemen and Qatar and the timing of
liftings in Oman and Qatar.
Second quarter 2011 realized prices improved for all our products over the first quarter of the year. Our worldwide
crude oil price was $103.12 per barrel, an increase of 12%. Worldwide NGLs were $57.67 per barrel, an improvement
of 10% and domestic natural gas prices were $4.27 per Mcf, an increase of 1%. The second quarter of 2011 realized oil
price represents 101% of the average WTI price for the quarter.
Oil and Gas production costs were $11, cash production costs were $11.88 a barrel for the first six months of 2011,
compared with last year's 12-month cost of $10.19 a barrel. The cost increase reflects more workover and maintenance
activity and higher support costs. Taxes, other than on income which are directly related to product prices, were $2.36
per barrel for the first half of 2011 compared to $1.83 per barrel for all of 2010. Total exploration expense was $62
million in the quarter.
Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $253 million compared to $219 million in the first
quarter of 2011. The second quarter results, one of the highest ever reported for the Chemical segment, reflected higher
margins and volumes across most product lines.
Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2011 were $187 million compared to $114 million in the first
quarter of 2011 and $13 million in the second quarter of 2010. The increase from first quarter earnings was mainly due
to higher marketing income and improved margins in the gas processing business.
The worldwide effective tax rate was 38% for the second quarter of 2011. Our higher proportionate domestic income
brought us closer to the US statutory rates. Our second quarter US and foreign tax rates are included in the Investor
Relations supplemental schedule.

Let me now turn to Occidental's performance during the first six months. Core income was $3.4 billion, or $4.19 per
diluted share compared with $2.2 billion or $2.67 per diluted share in 2010. Net income was $3.4 billion, or $4.13 per
diluted share for the first six months of 2011 compared with $2.1 billion, or $2.61 per diluted share in 2010.
Cash flow from operations for the first six months of 2011 was $5.6 billion. We used $3 billion of the company's total
cash flow to fund capital expenditures and $1.2 billion on net acquisitions and divestitures. We used $685 million to
pay dividends and $1 billion to retire debt. These and other net cash flows resulted in a $2 billion cash balance at June
30. Free cash flow from continuing operations after capital spending and dividends but before acquisition and debt
activity was about $1.8 billion.
Capital spending was $3 billion for the first six months of which $1.6 billion was spent in the second quarter.
Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 85% in Oil and Gas, 13% in Midstream and the remainder in
Chemicals. Our net acquisition expenditures in the first six months were $1.2 billion, which are net of proceeds from
the sale of our Argentina operations. The acquisitions included the South Texas purchase, a payment for the costs
already incurred for the Shah Field Development Project and properties in California and the Permian.
The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first six months of 2011 were 812.5 million and weighted
average diluted shares outstanding were 813.3 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio declined to 11% compared with
14% at the end of last year. OXY's annualized return on equity for the first half of 2011 was 20%.
Copies of the press release announcing our second quarter earnings and the investor relations supplemental schedules
are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SEC's Edgar system. I'll now turn the call over to Steve
Chazen to discuss the guidance for the third quarter.
Stephen I. Chazen
Thank you, Jim. As we look ahead to the back half of the year at average oil prices of about $95 WTI, we expect the
back half of the year in Oil and Gas production to be as follows. Domestic volumes are expected to increase by 3,000 to
4,000 BOE per day per each month compared to the previous month. This should result in average third quarter
production of about 430,000 to 432,000 BOE a day. Latin America volumes should remain comparable to the second
quarter.
The Middle East region production is expected as follows. Consistent with the second quarter, we expect no production
for Libya. In Iraq, we are still unable to reliably predict spending levels, which have a related impact in cost recovery
barrels. In Oman, production is expected to grow from our current gross production of 210,000 BOE a day to a
year-end exit rate of 230,000 BOE a day, which should result in about a net of 2,000 BOE per day per quarter growth.
In Qatar, we expect to gradually regain the production rate lost due to planned maintenance and mechanical issues
resulting in about 3,000 BOE per day growth rate each quarter the second half of the year compared to the second
quarter average.
In Dolphin and Bahrain, production is expected to be similar to second quarter levels. In Yemen forecasting production
volumes remains difficult, although currently OXY operated production has been partially restored. We expect the
range to be between 23,000 and 27,000 BOE a day. We expect a lifting in Iraq in the third quarter of about 600,000
barrels of oil. Including this lifting, we expect sales volume to be about 725,000 BOE a day at $95 West Texas
Intermediate. A $5 increase in West Texas Intermediate would reduce our production sharing contract daily volumes by
about 3,500 BOE a day.
Our total year capital expenditures remains at $6.8 billion, same as the guidance we gave you last quarter.
With regard to prices, at current market prices a $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly earnings before
income taxes by about $37 million. Second – the average second quarter WTI oil price is $102.56 per barrel. A $1 per
barrel change in NGL prices affects quarterly earnings before income taxes by $7 million. A swing of $0.50 per million
BTUs in domestic gas prices is a $34 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX
gas price is around $4.40 per Mcf. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $80 million for seismic and

drilling for exploration programs in the third quarter.
The Chemical segment earnings is expect to moderate to about $225 million, mostly due to seasonal factors. The third
quarter segment Chemical segment earnings reflect continued strong export demand and overall good supply and
demand balances across most products offset by some seasonal factors and turnarounds. Historically, the fourth quarter
is typically the weakest quarter and generally earnings are about half of that in the third quarter.
We expect our worldwide tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 to remain at about 38%.
As far as our activity is concerned in California, we expect our current drilling program to result in more predictable
production growth going forward. The status of permitting is generally unchanged from the prior quarter. We obtained
enough permits to allow us to prosecute the program at the current pace until year-end. However, there remains some
uncertainty around future permits particularly related to injection wells.
Our overall rig count in the United States has gone from 38 at the end of 2010 to our current rate of 59 and is expected
to grow to 74 at the end of the year. This represents a 25% growth in our total rig count from current levels. The growth
will be in the Permian and Williston Basin and South Texas. This program leads to continued growth of production into
next year.
I think we're willing to take your questions now.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Hi, good morning, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Just thinking about your production targets and the monthly sequential growth. Can you
give us where you were in June domestically by region, just so we can kind of build from there?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, we don't report that way. And so what you have to do is use the average because that's
the way it will be reported. So if you take the average, which is the 424,000 number and so if you say, okay that was
the average, so it will be average to average when the numbers actually come out. So, if it will be up 3,000, up 6,000,
up 9,000 if it's 3,000, and then you average that out and you wind up with 6,000 of growth for the average for the
quarter. Because if you start at the end of the quarter, you don't actually see the exit rate for the quarter.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: And then kind of the regionalization of your domestic, how you see that 3,000 to 4,000
barrels a day of growth, how much of that is California, Permian, Williston? Any idea of that would be helpful.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, we risk these numbers. So the number that we use might be – is a risk number as
opposed to the maximum number that could come out or the worst number. So it's probably misleading to say exactly
where. Clear that there's going to be the bulk of it, the overwhelming majority will come out of California and there
will be some growth in the Williston. Williston is small anyway and some in the Permian. So I think if you look at the
third quarter, you'll see the bulk of the growth out of California with smaller amounts out of the rest.
As you go into the fourth quarter, because of the ramp-up in drilling in the Permian, you'll see a little more growth in
the Permian, but continued pretty strong growth in California as the wells come on. So that's sort of what it looks like
but to actually give you how we figured it out, I'd have to start with unrisked numbers and I don't want to give those
kinds of numbers out.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Okay. And then on the California permitting side, you talked about injection wells being
some uncertainty. If you could just walk us through any color around what that means. Is that just water disposable

availability and will you become limited as far as total oil volumes by that injection capacity?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well at some point we will. I don't think we're up against it now. Where it will affect more
than anything is actually THUMS more than at Elk Hills and the other places. We probably have enough for a while.
But THUMS, they got some – that's really a water injection for process. So I think that's probably where you'll see it,
but the numbers are real small for this year, certainly within the noise of the rest of the numbers.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: And how do you think about opportunities for additional acreage acquisition and kind of
where things are currently in the market?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well I don't know how much more there is in California. I'd probably don't want to buy the
land underneath the building here to drill. So I think California will probably, probably not much. Permian, we continue
to buy some small parcels of acreage for Wolfberry drilling primarily, and then Williston, there's a lot of acreage for
sale. You know, if we were open seven days a week, there would be seven guys here to sell us acreage. So there's a lot
in Williston and we're pretty picky about what we do. So there may be a small amount of acreage acquisition there. I
don't see a large deal flow in the back half of the year, although I think I said that last year at this time and was shown
to be completely wrong.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Thanks, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Hi Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Hi.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Can we just go back to the new disclosure on the rig count? What's the outlook beyond 2011 for
those various counts, do you think?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The California one depends on the permitting. I mean, if we had more visibility in the
permitting, we'd lay more rigs on to the back half, the fourth quarter. Right now this is the visibility we have and that's
why it's showing the way it is. Once we get more visibility, we'd probably raise the count.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: That would be a raised count just for 2011, you mean, exit rate?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes, your exit rate and so you got to get the rigs on before you get into 2012, so we'd start
contracting for the rigs. So you'd see a higher exit rate, but right now this is all the visibility we really have. We're
looking at the Permian and trying to figure out what the right level is, but more likely than not, it'll go up some more
and maybe even sizably more depending on how we can figure it out. I think South Texas is about the same and there
will be some growth in the Williston. But I think high probability of the Permian and if we can get the permitting issues
worked out the next six months, you'll see significantly higher rig counts in California. Right now, I can't, I just don't
have a basis to raise that rig count in California. What we're doing now will generate a fair amount of production
growth. So I'm not really concerned that this is going to be bad. But we could do some more, but right now, I just can't
– I don't have enough confidence in the permitting process.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: This level of rigs in California would generate growth through 2012 at the kind of pace that you're
talking about?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Which seems to be about 2,000 barrels per month?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, somewhere in that. We give you the 3,000 to 4,000. So some of that will be
California, maybe in some quarters all of it. So just hard to say exactly what is, again, I used risked numbers.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Understood. If we looked at the year-over-year, you're flat and looking backwards obviously over
2010 to 2011 Q2 to Q2.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's on sales, I think.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: I understand. Yes, it's on sales and then obviously net, there's been a negative basically from
Libya but all the other movements. From here forward, are we looking again back to the 5% to 8% if we ask you again
in a year's time, are we going to be in the 5% to 8% volume growth range that you've talked about in the past?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: At least that, because I think the domestic businesses are going to surprise, but I could be
wrong. But I think the 3,000 to 4,000 a month for the domestic business is pretty solid for a while, and maybe we'll do
a little better, but I think that's a good risked number for us.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Thanks, Steve. If I could ask you about Phibro, the midstream trading business.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sort of a surprise.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: It looked like a good number and we'd been expecting a headwind from Phibro.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It was a small headwind.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Okay, so Phibro was a net negative. And what I'm thinking about is whether the run rate of your
Midstream businesses is just structurally higher now as a function of Permian activity and piping and whether we
should think rolling forward of a higher through the cycle or even growing, I guess Midstream profitability.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Well, we break it out because it's the most volatile and we have a hard time predicting it. I
think the way to think about it is that the volatility and price volatility, oil price volatility and wide differentials
between say the Cushing and the world prices generates generally higher numbers.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Yes. Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It might generate lower numbers, too. But it reduces the predictability a lot. So if I were to
look at it and I'd say what's the average, I'd average the first and second quarter to get sort of an average number.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: And again just going back to Phibro, forgive me if I've garbled this number, but I think you said
the range historically would be a minus $0.08 to a plus $0.12, was it range of Phibro profitability or loss?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I can't remember anymore. He was ahead for the year at mid-year, so depending on how
you view modest, a modest loss in the second quarter. But for the year, he's ahead and he's well ahead now but again, I
think I've told you this before, no sense in watching it. It's like an NBA game. You may as well tune in the last 30
seconds and forget the rest.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: Fair enough. And then forgive me if I misheard. This is the last one from me. I kind of missed the
Iraq guidance. I think 5,000 of production with no sales in Q2. Is that correct? And then did you say 7,000 a day of
production?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't think we said for production in Iraq. You know, the field is doing fine.
<A - James M. Lienert>: Did we say it?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The field is doing fine, the gross is really doing fine. You know, our nets may be 6,000-ish,
but it really depends on the investment which has slowed up considerably. So I don't really know. We do have a sale of
600,000 barrels this month. So we will have some actual sales this month.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: And I see even given the spending slowing, that you will, the outlook for next year on Iraq
volumes is difficult?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't know how to do it because it reacts so quickly to the spending. Because if we spend
more, it would, production would go up immediately so I just don't know.
<Q - Paul Sankey>: What has been the spending constraint?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: There's a lot of issues, I think, with the operator and that sort of thing getting permits

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Yes, good morning, Steve. Just on California, you've spoken in the past about trying to get
these larger areas permitted because then you can progress it a little bit quicker once you actually get the permits
through and that means you get probably more effective capital. Could you talk to us in terms of have you got one of
these larger permit areas, two, three, when did you put those permits in and when, given they might take 12 to 18
months, you might get a larger area permitted?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I don't really know. We could go into that. I don't know how helpful it is. We put a number
of them in for large areas, a fair, a sizable number and we just don't know what the process is. It's not exactly
transparent.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: So at this stage, you don't really have a feeling for how long it's going to take for one of those
larger areas to actually be permitted?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think it's a nontransparent process.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right, okay. Maybe then a switch to the increase in rig count. Three to four monthly sequential
increase over the second half of this year but obviously your rig count is increasing as you go through the second half.
So as you look into 2012, would it be fair to think that that would accelerate a little bit?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It should. Let's say we bought a well today, it doesn't make any difference where. Spud a
well today, it will have a small effect on the production in the fourth quarter, because it takes say 90 days or so. You
hook it up and then you get a partial quarter. So what you're seeing is a wedge of this stuff pushing into next year. So
our exit rate going into next year ought to be fairly attractive with a pretty high backlog of production. So it just takes –
you just lose sight of how long it takes from today, what you spend to drill today to when you actually get a meaningful
measurement of production. So I think we're on good track now and I think we'll have an attractive exit rate in the
United States as the year ends.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And then final question is around realizations, maybe any strategies to perhaps, or any changes
we should be aware of to try to sort of get away from WTI inland pricing towards more international pricing across the
portfolio?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're not trying to solve the industry's problems in this. We're just trying to solve ours and
so I'd just assume not comment on our strategies but to point out that for example, California basically gets world
prices.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: I'm mainly thinking perhaps in the Permian.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: In the Permian, some of that could fall into the Midstream rather than into Oil and Gas.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Right, okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, good morning, Steve. Good morning, Jim.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Steve, at the beginning of the year, you suggested you may get 107 shale wells drilled this year.
What's the latest?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sorry, I missed you.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: At the start of the year, I believe you suggested that you would drill about 107 wells.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Shale wells.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Shales, yes. What's the latest estimate?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Bill can answer that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes Doug, good morning. I think right now we're looking at somewhere between 150 and
175 shale wells to be drilled in California for the year.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: And how many did you complete, Bill, in the second quarter? You gave us a first quarter
number. I think it was 26. How many did you complete in the second?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: It was 55.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Completed?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Correct.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Not necessarily hooked up.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's what I was going to say.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Right.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So your backlog is building basically?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Steve, at dinner about I guess a month or six weeks ago, you suggested your first base target was
to get to drill around 300 wells a year. To what extent, I mean, what is it going to take to get there and how engaged are
you with the state government in trying to achieve that objective?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're engaged with the state. You know, I just should not go into our state relations. I think
we're making some – we're making physical progress where we can, and I think the state, eventually, I think the state
will come around. It just takes longer, that's all.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I guess a couple other quick ones, if I may. The production from the shale's obviously what
we're all focused on in terms of how quickly that can ramp up. Are you prepared to give us what the current production
is from that particular part of the portfolio, and how you would expect given your decline curves and the rate of
drilling, how would you expect that to progress let's say over the next 18 months?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I'm not willing to give you a forecast because again, the forecast, the overall forecast I'd
give you is a risked number and the bottoms up numbers are essentially sort of unrisked, but I think Bill can give you
some numbers on where we are.

<A - William E. Albrecht>: Doug, right now, in terms of current shale production in California, we're running about
45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, and given the pace of the potential hiccups, Bill, where would you expect that to exit the
year?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think we're not into the forecasting of that again because I think you'll be mixing risked
and unrisked numbers on the totals.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it, all right. The final couple from me are again related to the same thing. Steve, the status of
the gas plant place I believe after the maintenance in Q1, I guess we should have been expecting some recovery there
and finally the Rosetta acquisition, how much of that was included in Q2? And I guess -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Very little because it closed in pieces during the quarter. So it was really a small number.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay and the plant status?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The plant is ready April, is that what you are thinking, Bill?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, Doug, we're targeting April of 2012 and actually we're currently running a little bit
ahead of schedule on that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Sorry Bill, I was talking about the existing plant.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The existing plant is an old plant that's not terribly reliable.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right. I will leave it at that, guys. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from Jason Gammel of Macquarie.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thank you, guys. A few more on California, if I could. Of the 29 rigs that you have running
in California, Steve, can you talk about how many of those are actually pursuing the unconventional objectives you
have? And then out of that number, how many are looking to derisk further acreage versus drilling in the I believe
200,000 acres that you said you thought you had derisked on the first quarter call?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Bill can answer that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Jason, right now of the 29 rigs we have running in California, fully 20 of those are drilling
unconventional plays or horizons, and of that 20, roughly 4 to 5 are in the process of derisking additional acreage.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Is the 200,000 acres still a reasonable number for us to be thinking about?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think [ph] that's now – (32:00) plenty for now.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Yes, agreed. And then one more if I could, it's probably too early to talk about this but I'm
going to try it anyway. Anything on type curves, initial production rates, what you expect ultimate recoveries to be, et
cetera?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think as we look at this, if we went back to what we said roughly a year ago or a little
more than a year ago, I think we're a little more optimistic on the verticals and a little more pessimistic on the
horizontals.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Steve, can you remind me what you're expecting on the verticals? Is that a 300 barrel a day
IP rate, 400?

<A - William E. Albrecht>: Yes, Jason, it's -- right now we're averaging about 370, and that's BOE, that's equivalent
per day.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: And then just one more if I could. Of that 370 or just on an overall mix of production out of
the unconventionals, how much would you expect to be gas versus black oil versus condensate?

Your next question comes from Faisel Khan of Citigroup.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: On the 3,000 to 4,000 per barrels per month domestic production growth at the end of the year,
how much of that is gas and -- gas and oil?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Because of the way it was computed, there's no particular easy way to tell. I would guess
the bulk of it, 75%, 80% would be oil.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got you. And then in terms of your -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Oil meaning real oil. NGLs isn't oil. Just so we're clear what we're talking about. NGLs are
something between oil and gas.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, fair enough. And then I'm looking at the overall domestic natural gas, dry gas production
portfolio, is that production kind of expected to remain flat through the end of this year, or do you expect declines to
take place?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No. I think it will probably grow.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, okay. And then lastly -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sometimes especially in California, you drill it and sometimes it's a little misleading
because if you drill a shale well, you might take it down to the deeper zone, slightly deeper zone, and the slightly
deeper zone tends to be gassy, and you may not have drilled the well for that purpose, but all of a sudden you've got
some gas. And so our ability – and so as we take what was designed as a shale well down a little bit further, you can
wind up with a gas zone and so you get a little more volatility in the number which is not a bad thing, by the way. So
predicting this stuff, you might get lucky and find a big gas zone, and so our gas might go up sort of by serendipity.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. And is that gas able to be produced into the market, or is there infrastructure required to
bring -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It depends on where it is, but the answer is so far we've been able to manage it.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. My last question is on the Permian Basin, in terms of your rig count kind of
going up in that basin, how much of that is split between the Delaware and the Midland Basin?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Bill?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: I would say -- looking forward, Faisel, is that what you are asking?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Yes, sir.

Your next question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good morning.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: With that new disclosure on the rigs on the back page, is, gross operated rigs, on a net basis,
are the increases similar?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Yes.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: There's a whole bunch of non-operated activity also especially in the Permian, the Permian
really. So we don't have any way of sort of predicting that.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. And the overall increase in the rig count in the US going from 38 to 59, are those
conventional drilling rigs, or are there workover rigs there included?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: No. That's just strictly drilling rigs.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We got a very large number of workover rigs so that would just obscure the numbers,
including workover rigs.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. The IP rig you mentioned, the 370 for the California shale well, that's a 24-hour rate?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: It's actually longer than that. It's generally -- a stabilized rate would be over, say a week's
time because these wells have to clean up before they stabilize. So it's really over a week or even longer period of time.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. How did your operations team deal with the flooding in North Dakota? I mean, you're
farther away from the river. So I'd assume there was less flooding where you guys are. But I'm not sure.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: It really didn't affect us at all given where we operate.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. I'm seeing an increase in NGL production from the US in the second quarter over the
first quarter. Is that correct? I mean, a substantial one?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: NGL production?
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Yes. I might be wrong. Let me see.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I didn't think it went hardly at all.

<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: In the Permian, Apache was mentioning the application of modern drilling and completion
techniques, horizontal applications to their CO2 floods and also water floods. I'm assuming whether you guys see

Your next question comes from Duane Grubert of Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Duane Grubert>: On the CO2 theme, we've had others in the sector see CO2 supply as a constraint and I think
you guys have been pretty proactive in telling us why it's not a constraint. Can you talk to us about how you think of
allocating capital in the Permian to non-CO2 versus CO projects and if CO2 available is a factor in that allocation?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We have, we supply about half of our own CO2 and we have ways to increase that. So the
fact that some smaller operator has a problem getting CO2 doesn't surprise us. The market's fairly snug. It's a very
profitable business. We allocated sort of, we have a five-year plan for putting CO2 in the ground and we just go ahead
and do it. It's a very profitable business because we spent all the capital really.
<Q - Duane Grubert>: And then jumping over to one of your recent acquisitions, the heavy oil stuff in California, do
you have any early read on your enthusiasm for your heavy oil project?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's a one-off thing. I don't think we're interested in more heavy oil. This was a pretty good
opportunity. It was an undrilled field and five years from now, it'll be pretty good results for us.
<Q - Duane Grubert>: Okay. And then you have been buying a lot of what appear to be one-off things that could have
legs domestically. I'm sure people also pitch to you international assets. Do you have any appetite to be shopping
internationally?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We always look for opportunities internationally but in places we understand, of course. So,
I don't think we'll be drilling much in Antarctica or anything like that. So we're looking for places we understand and
where we can make substantial returns. You don't want to go to international just to produce empty barrels.
<Q - Duane Grubert>: And then to follow on to an earlier comment you guys on California. You said unconventional
wells, you've got about 20 out of 29 rigs more or less developing and 4 or 5 derisking. Can we really think of that
whole program as being in a development stage now, or are there certain aspects of it like infrastructure sizing or
maybe where the footprint is that you are still in less of a development stage and more of a figuring out what you want
to do stage?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're always figuring out what we want to do, I think. I think we always are looking to
expand and figure out new opportunities. There's different plays that are around that we haven't talked about publicly.
So we're always looking for different things to do, trying to figure out where to build the next gas plant. There are a lot
of things we do and so we're trying to figure out what the program will be over the next decade. So that requires a
certain amount of – it's not high risk exploration, but significant step out activity just to figure out where we're going.
<Q - Duane Grubert>: And then with the current sector environment with the high oil prices and the ability to do a lot
of work in domestic areas that didn't frankly exist five or ten years ago, can you remind us of your philosophy of cash
use and maybe how the current environment might be influencing or changing that if at all?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Cash use has always been the same. I think I had the same slide for the last 15 years. The
number one use is maintenance capital, second use is dividends, third use is growth capital, the fourth is acquisitions

Your next question comes from John Herrlin of Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes, hi, a bunch of quick ones for you, Steve.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Sure.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: For your volume growth domestically in the second quarter, was the bulk of that South Texas?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We'll have to – maybe somebody will look at the numbers. I don't know whether it was the
bulk of it or not.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Next one, California.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, I don't think so.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. With California, you said that the lion's share of the rigs currently running are
unconventional. What would it have been a year ago, just to give some perspective?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It was more conventional. A year ago, we were probably even 50/50 on it, and we've shifted
because we said we were going to do that.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Year-end, should we assume that there's no Yemeni volumes?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No. I think in the case of Yemen, we think that there's a reasonable chance that the
government – first of all, half the production isn't really covered by that. It's other fields that have longer contracts. And
it looks to us that there's at least a reasonable chance that the government will allow us, will allow Nexen to continue to
operate the Masila Field while it figures out what it's going to do. So I think there's a reasonable chance that the stuff in
Yemen will continue for a while at the full rate. No guarantees of that obviously but about half the production is
unrelated to that and is pretty much unaffected by this.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. For the properties that Nexen is operating, would you expect then to pay a sizable
upfront bonus or some sort?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We don't know. I think right now, there's really no one to negotiate with. I assume that what
will happen is that they'll just let it go for a while until there's clarity in the government there.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. All right. That's fine. In terms of the property acquisition marketplace, you're full in
California and you said there's a lot for sale in the Williston and there's always drips and drabs in the Permian. Are you
considering any sort of new areas?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: In the United States?
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes, correct.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, not really. We tire kick a lot of stuff so we understand what's going on. But I don't see
any, certainly not this year.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay well you're accruing a lot of cash, so would it be reasonable to assume that you would
focus on more dividend growth or potentially share buyback, which I know you don't particularly like, but is that a
consideration?

<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We like dividends better than share repurchases.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. That's fine. Last ones from me, we're seeing a lot of gratuitous divorces these days in
the public marketplace, disintegrations, whatever. Would the board ever consider maybe doing a split of OXY between
domestic and international?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: You just have to come to conclusion that that actually creates value rather than just some
sort of, something to entertain investment bankers. So, you never say never, but I think right now there's a lot of
synergies between them. Very difficult for the international business to have anything less than a single A credit rating
to get new contracts and so it's just improbable that that would create any value, to split them off that way.

Our next question is from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Bill, just had a follow-up question thinking about the vertical well split, around talking
about 60% oil, 40% gas. That's for all the wells drilled including the Elk Hills primary wells, but your guidance is
reflecting more oil growth. Can you talk us through kind of what are the current well splits for the wells you're drilling
on the vertical unconventional?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Well, David, most of them are vertical wells in terms of the unconventional wells. Nearly
all are drilling vertical wells as opposed to horizontal, just speaking to the unconventional.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: I'm trying to understand the 60% oil, 40% gas and the average of all the wells drilled
versus the guidance that most of the drills is oil.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: What I was referring to was the 60/40 split was just solely on unconventional shale wells.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: That's an average rather than sort of the outcome. If you look at it, that's what they're sort of
doing because when you produce the oil, you get a fair amount of gas with it. The wells are oil wells. They just have
associated gas. It's just hard, it's hard – most of the growth is out of oil, but I think you asked about really, he answered
a very narrow range of wells.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Okay. So out of your total, what is your conventional development program heading
forward then and what do those wells look like?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Those wells are basically oil wells and they're a little less gas. Nothing wrong with the gas.
I mean, you get $4 and they have high rates and you get your money back pretty quick. It's just, but we think most of
the growth for this year will be oil because we're kind of biased that way. Occasionally, you have this issue with you
drill a little bit deeper and you wind up in a gas zone.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: And just was that a – the property acquired was 30 million, 35 million cubic feet
equivalent a day primarily?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think it was less.
<Q - David M. Heikkinen>: Okay.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think it's less than that. We're the largest gas producer in the state, and that's an old field,
been around a long time. It's in a different part of the state and I think we would probably market it a little different
than maybe the predecessor, but.

Your next question comes from Katherine Minyard of JPMorgan.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard>: Hi, good afternoon or morning. Quick question on your comments on California
and permits. You talked about there being some uncertainty around future permits particularly related to the injector
wells. I was just curious as to whether there's something about the nature of the injection wells that's holding them up,
or is it their location?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No, it's an industry issue not necessarily related to us.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard>: Okay. Just in light of that, how much of your growth forecast in California depends
on successfully permitting the injection wells and then does that change over time?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: It's a long-term problem for us rather than a short-term problem. The only place it would
affect us in the intermediate term is a little bit under 1,000 barrels a day at THUMS, but other than the rest of it –
ultimately, you need to dispose of the water. So it's hard to produce oil without producing salt water. So we're going to
have to ultimately have more injection wells. And so it's an issue, but it's more an issue for people in the steam flood
business, which there's some large players in that here in California that have I think a much bigger issue than we do.
<Q - Katherine Lucas Minyard>: Okay. All right, thanks. And then, can I just switch quickly to Latin America? It
just looks like the production that's being reported from Colombia is kind of trending downward. I'm just curious as to
whether that's a price related impact or whether it's project delays?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Basically, there's a kicker to the Colombian government on price.

Our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Hey, if refining keeps on a roll here, it's going to
cannibalize the front of your conference call at least for some folks. I will give you a break on the California questions.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Good, we thought we'd run out of counties.
<Q - Evan Calio>: I thought so. But on the Permian my question is are wider differentials impacting the way you think
about capital allocation, and potentially away from the Permian at least on an operating level, at least until diffs
normalize and move into another part of your portfolio?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: At $100 oil, which is the WTI price, you could drive a truck through the margins, on a cash
basis or reported basis or whatever, we historically have viewed $100 as a pretty decent price. And so the fact that
somebody says well maybe it should be on some basis $106, yes it's true, but this is still $100. You know, given a very
oily portfolio in the Permian, I mean this is enormously profitable. I mean, you say well, you should get some more.
Well, I don't know. We should get some more now but I don't know about a year from now. So I think we'll take the
money and run.
<Q - Evan Calio>: That's I guess the second question and clearly -- respect that that's very profitable. Do you think of
changing any kind of hedge position into 2012 if you -
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: We're not hedgers. We don't know. You know, the Phibro guys are bullish on oil forever so
I guess we're not hedgers in that sense.

<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay so nothing to protect any TILS exposure?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No. the reason we keep sort of a debt-free balance sheet is so that we don't have to protect
our downside, so we don't have to buy basically insurance for downside. We're not good speculators on product prices.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay. That's fair. Just maybe the last question on Iraq, and I apologize if I missed it earlier. You
mentioned your last call you begin liftings in the second half of '11.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Lifting will be, is this month. First lifting is this month.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hey, Steve. Sorry for the follow-up. I just wanted to get clarification on a couple of things.
You've said in the past that your shale wells were predominantly oil, meaning north of 90%. Has that changed?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So what's the 60/40 then, I'm confused?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: 60/40 is related as to whether it's called oil well or a gas well.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So what is the majority of the wells you're drilling? Are they 60% oil or 90% oil?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Closer to the 90%.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay thanks.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: But we may occasionally – you should understand that sometimes you drill a little deeper
and you wind up with a pretty gassy well.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So, no I understand that, but predominantly if we're talking about completing 150 to 175 wells
this year, what proportion of those would you say were in the 90% range than in the other range? Because it makes a
heck of a difference to the value obviously.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: Probably not as much as you think because the gas wells will have a lot of liquids with
them.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Right. The IP rates again, going back to Bill's comments. Previously you've said 350 was a good
run rate as an IP rate but you described that as longer than 30 days which is a bit different from Bill saying 7 days. So
we can get some clarification on that also? Maybe just reiterate how you see the decline curve as compared to what you
gave us a year ago.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Doug, just to clarify, really what I was talking about 7 days, I was talking about time for
the wells to clean up. That 370 BOE a day number really is a 30-day stabilized IP number. That's an average.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So how would I think about that in terms of, let's say, a month down the line 30-day average? Is
that a good number?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: That's a good number, Doug, yes.
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: I think what he was trying to say as opposed to just a IP rate like a Haynesville well which
is sort of 1 day or something, what he's trying to say is it takes him a week or so to clean up the well. It stays at this 370

for a month or so and then the decline would begin.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: All right, great. And the final one is previously $3 million a well was kind of the number to drill
complete and hook up I guess that you'd given us. Can you just talk a bit about what's happening to service costs in the
state and whether that was still a good run rate that we should be thinking about in terms of CapEx, and I will leave it at
that.
<A - William E. Albrecht>: Doug, I think $3.5 million to $4 million is really a good range. Drill complete and you
know, hook up to sales. We are seeing some inflation on pressure pumping obviously just as the whole industry is. But
that's still a pretty good number, $3.5 million to $4 million.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: You're not fracing these wells, Bill?
<A - William E. Albrecht>: No. There's a few that we do fracture stimulate, but the majority are just acidized.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, great stuff. Thank you.
Operator
And your final question comes from Sven Del Pozzo of IHS.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Yes, sorry. Just returning to the NGL question from earlier. Yes, in fact it did go up. Just
wondering, is that part of the south Texas acquisition? Is that rich gas? Is that why I'm looking at the domestic NGL
production, [ph] looks like it's up – (56:26)
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: The additional NGLs from last year, from a year ago come from South Texas and from in
the Permian.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: So are we going to see in the future a similar ramp-up in NGL production sequentially quarter
over quarter?
<A - Stephen I. Chazen>: No.
<Q - Sven Del Pozzo>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
There are no further questions.
