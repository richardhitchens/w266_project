Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter earnings show that we continue to produce favorable
results. Art will share more details on those results in a few minutes. Since assuming the CEO role at Southern
Company, I've been very public about setting five clear priorities for our company. I thought it might be interesting to
review our progress against those priorities.
First: preserve and enhance the circle of life. Our business model is predicated on making customers the primary focus
of everything we do. We continue to excel at bringing value to our customers. Our reliability remains outstanding, our
prices are still significantly below national averages, and our customer service ratings continue to place us among the
best in the industry.
Second: succeed with Vogtle units 3 and 4 and Plant Ratcliffe at Kemper County. I'm happy to report that both of these
projects remain on budget and on schedule. As with any large, complex undertaking we will always face challenges but
we are managing these challenges in a diligent, intensive and workman-like manner. When completed, both projects
will provide great value to our customers.
Focusing for a moment on Plant Vogtle, I know you were interested in the timing of the issuance of the amendment to
the design certification and the combined construction and operating license or COL for Vogtle units 3 and 4. It is our
understanding that the NRC will issue a revised schedule in a few weeks, clarifying the timeframes for these critical
documents. We are confident that the revised schedule will include approval to the amendment of the design
certification this fall. We are also confident that the NRC has the discretion to issue the COL shortly following the
approval of the amendment to the design certification also in 2011.
Certain administrative procedures related to the effective date of the COL could push the issuance date of the COL into
early 2012. If the commission decides to issue the COL around the effective date, then the NRC has the option to
approve our request, which was filed some two years ago for a second limited work authorization, or LWAB, in the
fall. This would enable us to maintain our schedule with additional construction activities related to the nuclear island
while we await the final COL.
Getting back to priorities, third: engage in the development of a sensible national energy policy. We have been active
with all of our external publics in arguing for a sensible national energy policy, one that balances the need for the best
reliability with a reasonable economic consequence and an optimal environmental impact, all critical to creating an
environment that fosters job creation and strengthens the economy and all for the benefit of our customers. First we
argue for all the arrows in the quiver, the need to develop all the available generation resources necessary to meet the
needs of this nation's energy future including nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency.
We are the only company in our industry actively engaged in all of these sectors and we have committed more than $20
billion to developing this 21st century generation portfolio.
Second, we are committed to technology development and are the only company in our industry with a robust
proprietary research and development organization. We've successfully developed and implemented our own
environmental control equipment and our own generation technologies like our TRIG project used for Plant Ratcliffe at
Kemper County, Mississippi.
Fourth is to promote smart energy. We've been active in developing all areas of smart technologies, as we call them:
smart power or generation; smart grid, or transportation, including smart meters; and smart choices, essentially focused
on those value chains that may emerge beyond the meter.
With respect to smart power and smart grid, our path is clear and our progress is significant. For smart choices, because
of how uncertain that environment currently appears, we will maintain a conservative posture and explore opportunities
with a number of options bets.

And fifth: value and develop our people. Southern Company's renowned for our deep end strength and our leadership
development practices. We remain committed to these practices and have added key external talent to our roster.
Enhancing our whats – that is our skills and our experience base – and further developing our culture – our hows – will
make this company successful for years to come. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Art Beattie, our Chief Financial
Officer, for a discussion of our financial highlights for the second quarter and our earnings estimate for the third
quarter.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. In the second quarter of 2011 we earned $0.71 a share compared with $0.62 a share in the second quarter
of 2010, or an increase of $0.09 a share. On a year-to-date basis we earned $1.20 a share in the first six months of 2011
compared with $1.22 a share for the same period a year ago, a decrease of $0.02 a share. Let's turn now to the major
factors that drove our second quarter numbers compared with the second quarter of 2010.
First, the negative factors. Increased depreciation and amortization reduced our earnings by $0.05 a share in the second
quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. This increase is primarily due to the expiration of the
Georgia Power cost of removal accounting order at the conclusion of 2010 and to increased environmental transmission
and distribution investments. A decrease in wholesale revenue in our traditional business reduced our earnings by $0.01
a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. This reduction primarily represents the
expiration of a long-term wholesale contract for Plant Miller capacity, which now serves retail customers at Alabama
Power.
Income taxes reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of
2010. Other income and deductions, primarily lower AFUDC equity, reduced our earnings by $0.02 a share in the
second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. Taxes other than income taxes reduced our earnings
by $0.01 a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. Finally, an increase in the
number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.02 a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the
second quarter of 2010.
Let's now turn to the positive factors that drove earnings in the second quarter of 2011. Retail revenue effects in our
traditional business added a total of $0.14 a share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the
second quarter of 2010. Most of this increase was the result of regulatory actions at Georgia Power that became
effective in January 2011 as a result of increased environmental transmission and distribution investments. Included in
this is $0.03 a share reflecting an increase in revenues associated with Georgia Power's cash recovery of financing costs
for Vogtle 3 and 4. This rate, also known as Georgia Power's NCCR tariff, is expected to save customers approximately
$300 million.
Increased usage among existing customers added $0.02 a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second
quarter of 2010. Weather in the second quarter of 2011 added $0.01 a share to earnings when compared to the second
quarter of 2010. Other operating revenues, primarily increased transmission revenues, added $0.01 a share in the
second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. Decreased interest expense in our traditional
business increased our earnings by $0.01 a share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of
2010. Finally, improved results at Southern Power added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2011
compared with the second quarter of 2010. This increase was due to a combination of new long-term contracts and
higher energy margins.
In conclusion, we had $0.12 of negative items compared with $0.21 of positive items or a positive change of $0.09 a
share over the second quarter of 2010. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.71 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the economy and several important
regulatory matters. First, total weather normalized retail sales for the second quarter of 2011 increased by 1.5% over
the second quarter of 2010, driven primarily by stronger sales to our industrial customers. Our industrial sales increased
by 3.3% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. The most significant increases were

in petroleum refining, up 18.7%, primary metals up 13%, pipelines up 10.9% and transportation up 4.5% compared
with the second quarter of 2010. This industrial recovery is very broad-based with all major segments except for the
housing related segments of stone, clay and glass and textiles experiencing year-over-year growth.
The continued growth in industrial sales represents the continuation of a trend that started in mid 2009 and is driven
primarily by strong export sales. The port of Savannah, Georgia, for example, achieved an all-time high in second
quarter activity. Container volumes in Savannah increased almost 9% during the second quarter of 2011 compared with
the same period in 2010. And the combined value of exports from Georgia and Alabama increased nearly 21%.
Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.2% in the second quarter, total personal income is still
strengthening, up 4% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period a year ago. But consumer
confidence continues to be affected by rising prices and slower than expected net job growth.
Some of the job gains in our territory resulting from new business development were offset by losses in
nonmanufacturing jobs, primarily state and local government, contributing to an overall unemployment rate that is
slightly above the national average. Manufacturing employers, meanwhile, continue to achieve productivity
improvements, which offsets the need to hire new workers. However, as the recovery continues, improvements in
productivity should yield to the additional hiring of workers, which should help stimulate growth in the consumer
sector. Residential new connects are essentially flat and residential customer counts have increased by approximately
2,100 since the second quarter of 2010. While low, these numbers reflect the loss of approximately 7,000 customers
due to the devastating tornados in April. However, most of these customers remain in the area and are living in
temporary accommodations.
Homeowner vacancy rates are rising but remain below peak recession levels, while construction activity remains
sluggish but is consistent with our forecast. Commercial sales remained flat on a weather normal basis in the second
quarter of 2011 compared with the second quarter of 2010. Some data indicate that markets may be stabilizing such as
the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index which has been positive for the past 16 months and sales tax collections which have
been positive for the last 12 months.
This quarter we reassembled our economic round table group which consists of several key customers and economists
from the region. Overall, the group was more cautious than six months ago, with lower GDP expectations for 2011 of
2.4% to 2.8% versus earlier estimates of 3% to 3.5%. Most of the participants in our round table said that they expect
stronger GDP growth in the second half of 2011 of between 2.8% and 3.5%. Driving this trend will be continued
growth in exports and the auto industry, which is driving strong growth across many sectors, especially chemicals and
primary metals. Construction-related industries such as stone, clay and glass and textiles are expected to remain flat.
Finally, most participants see the manufacturing industry continuing to focus on productivity gains which boost
long-term competitiveness but restrain short-term employment growth. Meanwhile, we continue to see announcements
of new business expansions and job additions in our service territory, similar to those we've shared with you over the
past several months. More recent announcements include Johnson Controls, a critical supplier to Mercedes-Benz, is
opening a facility in Cottondale, Alabama that will create approximately 185 new jobs; BAE Systems Southeast
Shipyards in Mobile is adding 400 new positions; and Toyo Tires in Bartow County, Georgia plans to add up to 470
new jobs. In the aggregate, we have in our economic pipeline more than 230 active projects with a potential to yield
nearly 20,000 new jobs. Data indicate that activity in the pipeline in the first six months of 2011 is likely 18% to 20%
higher than the comparable period a year ago. So interest in the southeast region remains strong and our future growth
prospects are bright.
Turning now to the latest regulatory developments for our companies, on July the 8th, Gulf Power asked the Florida
Public Service Commission for a $93.5 million increase in base rates. This is Gulf Power's first rate base request in 10
years and would be used to offset rising costs in day-to-day operations and also strengthen northwest Florida's electric
infrastructure. Gulf Power has asked for a portion of this increase – slightly more than a third – to be implemented in
September of 2011 pending a final decision on the full request in early 2012. Also on July the 12th the Alabama Public
Service Commission voted to eliminate a tax-related adjustment under Alabama Power's rate structure effective with
billings in October of this year. The purpose of this revision is to eliminate a portion of the tax-related adjustments that

have been rendered obsolete within Alabama Power's current forward-looking rate-setting mechanisms. This change
will result in additional fourth quarter 2011 revenue of approximately $30 million for Alabama Power, which will
partially replenish the natural disaster reserve that we utilized following the tornadoes in April.
In 2012, additional revenue of $150 million is expected as a result of this order. Accordingly, Alabama Power has
agreed to a moratorium on any 2012 increases through Rate RSE. My final regulatory update concerns the agreement
Georgia Power reached last week with the public interest advocacy staff of the Georgia Public Service Commission.
Both parties agreed to withdraw their recommendations for a risk sharing or incentive mechanism related to the
construction of Vogtle units 3 and 4. We believe the settlement and the hearings that preceded it reinforced the
significant protections already afforded our customers under current Georgia law. The hearings and negotiations also
highlighted the additional $1 billion of value Georgia Power expects to capture for customers from the time of the
original certification of Vogtle 3 and 4. The agreement is subject to final approval by the Georgia Power – excuse me,
the Georgia Public Service Commission which is scheduled to vote on August the 2nd.
Turning now to an estimate of our third quarter earnings, our estimate for the third quarter of 2011 is $1.02 per share.
As a reminder, as we said in January of this year, our earnings guidance for 2011 is $2.48 to $2.56 per share. At this
point, I'll turn the call back to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thank you, Art. Before I close I'd like to recognize the heroic efforts of our employees in responding to the tragic
storms that struck our territory this past April. These storms, which caused a loss of life and severe property damage,
were among the most powerful natural disasters ever to affect our region. They resulted in a temporary loss of service
to some half a million customers in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi and more than $220 million in damage to our
system. And yet, within just seven days of the initial storm impact, power had been restored to 100% of those
customers who were able to receive service.
This accomplishment is a tribute not only to the efforts of our line crews, generating plants and customer service
personnel, but also to the reliability of our SouthernLINC Wireless network which proved crucial in the restoration
effort; our employees worked tirelessly in the wake of an unprecedented tragedy and I couldn't be more proud of the
contribution they made. Bob Dawson, a 45-year Southern Company employee and the CEO of SouthernLINC is
retiring in October. His service to our customers in the southeast has been immense and he will be missed. We wish
him and his family the best.
In closing, we are encouraged by the first six months of 2011. Our businesses are performing well and the industrial
side of our economy is continuing to drive a much-needed regional recovery. We believe that the inherent
attractiveness of our region to new business development will help fuel a gradual return to prerecession unemployment
levels. Our primary focus remains, as it has been for the past 63 years, to provide a reliable and affordable supply of
energy to meet the needs of our customers and the energy requirements of the southeastern United States.
One last comment before I go to Q&A. It's been announced that our Vice President of Investor Relations Glen Kundert
will be retiring at the end of this year and we will honor him appropriately a little bit later in the month ahead.
Replacing him will be Dan Tucker and I'm sure you'll all have fun getting to know Dan. As well today is a notable day
in that Jimmy Stewart, a long-time Investor Relations professional, is experiencing his 50th earnings call. Well done,
Jimmy.

[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jim von Riesemann with UBS.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Good afternoon, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey Jim, how are you?
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: I'm doing well. Happy 50th, Mr. Mayor.
A question for you, thanks for the call, it was very insightful. But in light of AEP's announcement on their scuppering
of their carbon capturing plans, can you talk a little bit about your own commitment to your own CCF facilities and
what your expectations are?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, thanks, Jim. In light of this notion about proposing a sensible national energy policy
we've long felt that preserving coal as a vital resource to meet the nation's energy future is critically important. And so,
in light of that need plus this notion of being a leader in research and development, we have continued in a robust way
to push forward on carbon capture research. We are doing it in very visible ways on both a pre-combustion and
post-combustion basis.
The pre-combustion method is essentially our TRIG technology. Once we gasify the lignite in Mississippi we will then
strip out 65% of the CO2 and our carbon capture process there will use the CO2 in enhanced oil recovery. So, in fact,
we generate symbiosis between increasing oil production in that region of the United States and increasing a supply of
electricity which, while using coal, will have an environmental signature roughly equivalent to natural gas.
As well, we are going forward with our project at Plant Barry. This is a post-combustion carbon capture effort where
we take – we tap into the affluent streams of that plant, we will take the CO2 out of there, and we will ship it via
pipeline to the Citronelle oil fields north of Mobile. Likewise that has symbiosis in driving more domestic energy
supplies for the southeast United States.
But we're also doing a lot more. Many of you know that at Wilsonville, Alabama, we host the carbon – national carbon
capture research facility. We also, at Plant Daniel in Mississippi, have demonstrated that we can sequester some 3,000
tons of CO2 in an underground geologic formation and that has proved to be exceedingly stable. And we're also
looking elsewhere around the United States or at least the southeast United States, to evaluate different types of
geologic formations to assess their suitability for these activities into the future. We think this is an important part of
R&D and that's why we argue for this as part of our sensible national energy policy.
<Q - Jim von Riesemann>: Super. That's all I had, thanks.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
<A>: Hi, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just first I'll focus on the Vogtle and potential for any delays there. Can you just walk us
through when you would expect a decision out of the NRC on an expanded site work license and then how CapEx
would get phased down or adjusted from what you guys gave at the analyst day that was not provided?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, so we tried to be very careful with the words we had. We are still confident of
achieving schedule and all that, we haven't changed our confidence a bit. We really see two avenues for this to occur.
One avenue is once we get the DCB affirmed this fall that the NRC has the ability to issue the COL right then or within
10 days. Assuming – there is a chance that there are administrative issues in which the NRC may want to issue the
COL coincident with the effective date of the COL. The administrative issues – and it's purely administrative – are that

once the proposed COL is put forth that it goes to OMB for a scoring process and that is a process that is designed to
assure that the recipients of the regulation are not overburdened with regulation. The second is that the COL will be
published in the Federal Register, that takes about 30 days.
So if, in the event the COL is – the issuance of the COL is delayed to the effective date, then the NRC has the ability to
issue a second limited work authorization. We filed that LWA – we call it LWAB here – we filed it some two years ago
and we've always contemplated that there may be a need to allow the NRC to continue – for us to continue work on the
site in a manner that will preserve schedule and cost. And, in fact, that is something that we think is sensible and we
believe that is an alternative course of action that is just as good as receiving the COL – practically just as good as
receiving the COL this fall. The whole issue is to preserve schedule and cost. We think we can do that either way.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay, good, thank you. And then I guess as the other question if you could give some updated
thoughts on any implications of kind of the CSAPR rules if that's going to help make a new – firm up any decisions on
environmental CapEx on the plants where you guys are still evaluating your options.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, I'll let Art hit the CapEx. When we look at the cross-state rule, there are the issues
related to the timeframes that are espoused, particularly the 2012 timeframe. I guess what that drives us to, with that
kind of timeframe, is to use allowances in perhaps revising our dispatch ranking in order to accommodate the
requirements of the rule. In terms of the generation and transmission expansion plan implications, which are really the
farther-reaching applications, really, we think that, at least for Southern Company, the kind of dominant document, if
you will, looks more like HAPs MACT, that our decisions under the cross-state rule are consistent with the HAPs
MACT proposal that's put in place. Art, would you want to say anything about CapEx?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, the CapEx, really based on what Tom says, is the HAPs MACT will dictate what
we do equipment-wise since it is a larger rule and the rules are a little more meaningful there. The – we do not expect
any change from the CapEx numbers that we've given you already. And we'll relook those in the fall once we get the
final rules, hopefully we'll have a better view into – as to what we'll actually be doing. But at this point we don't have
any change contemplated as a result of a cross-state rule.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay, thank you, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yep.

Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jonathan, how are you?
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Good, thank you, Tom. A quick question, this may be a kind of arcane one but we were just
puzzled by the weather adjusted sales disclosure where it looked like weather helped the residential segment. But it hurt
the commercial segment. You had sales down absolute but then flat weather adjusted.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Jonathan, those are weather normal numbers. Weather's removed. So residential for the
quarter was up 1.2% and -
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And commercial was basically flat once you took weather out.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: That's what we were trying to understand is why weather would have been a negative impact
on the commercial segment.

for example, for commercial, it may be a little more intermittent than it might be for the residential. There are –
Jonathan, we'd have to get back to you on that with any other explanation.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: A simpler explanation is commercial just responds differently for the different weather
patterns than we've seen in residential.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay. And then the second thing I – there was no real sort of mention in the quarterly drivers
of kind of O&M generally. Could you comment at all on sort of how – it seems like you certainly controlled O&M
better than we thought you would this quarter. Anything you could say there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, O&M is basically under our plan. But year-to-year I think they're actually up a little
bit on a year-to-date basis. For the quarter I think they're pretty flat. The storms in Alabama has a tendency to push
some of their what would normally be O&M expense into their storm reserve because of so many resources being
applied to that restoration effort and you saw a little bit of that in Georgia as well. So some of it may be timing as well,
Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Any – can you hazard a guess as to how much of what would have been O&M was
effectively capital, storm adjustment?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No, I really don't have a number on that. I believe Alabama was under their budget by or
plan by about $20 million. So, if you were to add that back in I think you'd see a more normal growth than non – O&M.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The breakout of O&M to capital in the storm -
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: The breakdown is basically a total cost of – these numbers are revised downward from our
original estimates of $175 million to $220 million. About $40 capital of that would be O&M and the rest would be
capital. So by far it's a capital event than it is an O&M event.
<Q - Jonathan Arnold>: Okay, thank you very much, guys.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: The NRC has the ability to – shortly after the amendment of the design certification is
approved – the NRC has the ability to, at that time, issue the COL.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: And that – if they do that it will likely happen before year end.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: And then shortly thereafter, sometime in early 2012, the COL effective date will likely
occur.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Following the timeframe of these administrative procedures.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Right. Now, based on – there's a possibility that the COL issuance and effective date would
take place at the same time in 2012 due to the OMB scoring issues and the Federal Register timelines. So if that is done
where the COL issuance takes place in early 2012, then the NRC has the ability to issue a limited work authorization
that would allow you guys to keep on schedule?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right. And we filed for that two years ago.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Okay. Great. That's all -

scenario where the NRC doesn't issue the COL until the Federal – you know, the -
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Effective date.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: OMB and the effective date, we would have essentially already seen some kind of

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That will occur this year. So once the rule goes for scoring to OMB you know what it is.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Right. So you know you're getting the COL, then, you just don't have it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Exactly. That's why we're calling it administrative. And we think there is a legal means for
them to issue the COL because of that almost – well, within 10 days. And then if they want to delay and – not delay but
if they want to wait until the administrative process unfolds and the COL becomes what they call effective then they
have this LWAB that they can issue that's been essentially asked for two years ago.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: And what is the scoring?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's a process that was put in place under the Obama Administration to relieve the
administrative burden of new regulations. And so OMB, for any major new regulation, does an assessment as to its
effect upon the issuee, essentially. We're the sole issuee here.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Okay. So that shouldn't be an issue, then?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then you didn't talk much in your remarks today about your views, at least it
sounds like your views on the opposition to the timeline of HAPs MACT and changes that you'd like, could you – I
know your comments will probably be filed soon to EPA. Could – and I know you're pursuing other initiatives, could
you just give us an update on both what your comments might be on the rule as well as the other initiatives you might
be looking at?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, sure. Well, Steve, I think we've been reasonably public on our position there and this
goes all the way back to my speech before the United States Chamber of Commerce, and then I testified before
Congress, and then, in a variety of other forums we've been very consistent with this. We think for a variety of reasons
the EPA is overreaching on the HAPs MACT rule. We think that the comment schedule was way too short. Now, they
did give us 30 days more than the original 60 day but for any other MACT rule it had been somewhere between 120
and 180 days. So giving us 90 days is still far short and this is the most far-reaching of the MACT rules they've ever
done. Remember this thing has almost a thousand pages long, a thousand pages of supporting documentation.
So then they've given us 30 days more. Well, but they haven't changed the effective date. And so therefore I just
wonder how EPA is going to process all of that information to create an effective rule that will be in place, I guess, this
November. So we think the effective date of the rule, so this November date this year, we think is too short for EPA to
assimilate the comments.
And then finally I know that I talked to a number of members of the administration and a variety of other people and I
know people say, "Oh, well this is a DOJ issue." The DOJ was very clear in their order back to the EPA that if EPA felt
they needed more time to assess this issue that DOJ was positively disposed to do that.
Secondly, the EPA, on their own, has developed the thresholds for the measurement and the whole regime as to how
this rule would be implemented and we think the thresholds and some of the new tests – and I think I've pointed out, for
example, the condensable PM standard, this is all brand-new stuff. And I know from time to time people say, "Oh,
well, you knew this was coming." No one knew that this condensable PM standard was going to be put forth and I'm
just guessing not many people, or very few know how to measure it in the first place. So look, for a variety of reasons,
we think this whole process has been flawed. We will file our comments on August 4th.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Thank you.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Andy.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Hi, how are you doing, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Just on the LWAC (sic) [LWAB], so I guess the NRC would have to issue that; how would that
work?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, that's right. It's LWAB, like boy.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay, I'm sorry.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No problem. The NRC would issue that.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. And that would happen around when, in your opinion?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sometime following the affirmation of the DCB.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. And when do you expect that to happen?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: This fall.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: This fall, okay. And then just for Art, just on the quarterly guidance, and also maybe on the
yearly guidance, I guess the first quarter you were down $0.10 versus last year, right? $0.50 versus $0.60 and then the
second quarter you were up $0.09.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Third quarter you're projecting up $0.04, puts you up $0.03 for the year, gets you to about $2.40.
So you'd actually have to have a pretty sizeable bump in the fourth quarter, is that kind of what the expectation is or are
you guys being conservative on the third quarter? Just trying to figure out the numbers.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, you'll see some – the bigger pickups because of the COR from last year, the COR
effects that you won't see much of that in the third and fourth quarter and those will be reflected in rates this year as
cash rates. So those will be reflective as additional pieces of gain. You had a lot of weather in the numbers last year as
well in the third quarter so that's a big driver.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. And then, on Southern Power, I guess at least I was, I was expecting kind of flat earnings
for the year. Is that – I guess you're looking like you might be up for the year, is that possible?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Southern Power is doing better than we expected. Most of that is energy margins and
their ability to – with those low-cost gas units, are able to sell into the markets. Their capacity levels are increased
much over last year and their energy margins have reflected that result. As to whether or not – there were also some
new contracts on the year-to-date – or year-over-year basis that reflected a lot of increase. But a lot of those contracts
started mid-year last year so you won't see the contract piece be additive for the rest of the year but you could see some
additions on the margin side.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, hey, Andy let me jump in on a couple of these, too. Fourth quarter of '10, I guess, it
was – what was it about -
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: $0.18.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: $0.18. It was abnormally low for us.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Absolutely.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: If you go back in prior years, I just went and looked it up real quick, I mean, it's easy – it's
not easy, but I think it's normal for us to expect $0.30 or more. So with a normal progression, a normal fourth quarter,

very much in the strike zone there. This other thing with Southern Power is really pretty interesting. I know we've
chatted with many of you in the past about our strategy about Southern Power and I think what we mentioned to you
was that just in – I know it was a topic of conversation early last year, 2010, and perhaps even in '09 keeping our
powder dry a little bit while we assessed what was going on with environmental regulations.
As you all know and it's happened with us, heck we've gone from 70% of our energy generation from coal to now about
52% from coal with gas picking up the difference. And so what we're seeing is this notion of keeping our powder dry at
Southern Power has turned out to be really good. And, in fact, in this period before HAPs MACT takes effect, we're
seeing that they've been able to generate through energy margins more net income. Their capacity factor for their
combined cycling units has gone up this year to 50% from say a similar period last year of 38%. So we have reason to
believe that they're going to do better this year certainly than what we thought they would at the beginning of the year
and we think, frankly, there's pretty good reason why that should continue.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: Okay. That sounds good. And then just one last quick question back on the -
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Andy, one more thing I just want to say – No, no, I was just kind of thinking of it
myself. But remember, we have a pretty sustainable idea of covering their capacity with long-term contracts. We
actually have, if you start thinking about what might happen 2015 and beyond, assuming we don't get any relief from
schedule or consequence of HAPs MACT plus 316(b) plus everything else coming down the road, we actually think
Southern Power's very well positioned from a long-term standpoint to do well in the years ahead.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: That's great. And then back on the LWAB.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Levi>: That allows you to begin the nuclear construction phase?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So the LWAB, we've already done some work under LWAA, right, and that's how we
made so much progress to date. LWAB as it was filed two years ago is very kind of defined. Essentially what we will
do is put rebar on the plant and then pour concrete on the base of the plant. But that will be very sufficient for us to
maintain schedule and cost estimates.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super. Hope you're doing well.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: All right. Couple questions. What is a typical Alabama RSE adjustment relative to $150
million that you've been authorized?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, there's not a typical adjustment. Some years – they didn't have an adjustment this year
under their RSE mechanism. They're authorized to increase rates under the rate no more than 8% over any two-year
timeframe. So if they have a 3% increase in one year then they can't increase rates the following year by more than 5%.
And that's the way the rate works. So there is no normal increase. As you know, they've got other rate mechanisms as
well, such as rates for their environmental investments and expenses. But the $150 million or so that it will raise in
2012 is just under a 3% increase in base rates.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thanks, that helps a lot. The other question, or one of the other questions kind of relative to
your $0.62 guidance, can you kind of parse out the pieces, I guess we've got about $0.06, $0.07 of weather?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'm going to pick at you while Art fools around with that. We only do guidance once a
year and that's the range and then we update our guidance in October once a year. These are just estimates so we tend
to – we yell at each other about that here. So Art's ready to go.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: For the quarter or the year-to-date period?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Quarter.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Against the guidance, weather was up about $0.07.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Estimate.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Estimate. And Southern Power's up about $0.02. So there's lots of other cats and dogs but
that will get you there.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. And then lastly, there's been some articles in the press about you talking about the
potential for cost overruns at Vogtle but your language – sounds like you're pretty confident of getting this done on
budget. Can you kind of just address the dichotomy there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'm not aware of anybody talking about cost overruns at Vogtle. I'm looking around the
room and I'm not aware of it. Look, there was an independent evaluator report that is part of the regular process in
reviewing, remember, every six months the costs associated with constructing Plant Vogtle, and I think he highlighted
in a report that got some media play, some concerns he had.
The only thing – I would just caution everybody on this call. I completely understand that interest in Vogtle 3 and 4 and
its schedule and its costs has white-hot interest. Well, it certainly does for us as well. And our view is we will always
have challenges on a construction project of this magnitude and of this complexity. So really our test is how we manage
these various ebbs and flows in the progress of the project. Our sense is, and has been, that we're on budget, on
schedule. The other thing that I would just want to highlight here, we've said it before, but I love to say it, again, since
certification we believe we've brought over $1 billion of value for the benefit of Georgia's customers associated with
Vogtle 3 and 4. And that now is part of the permanent record at Georgia Power company and now, when they evaluate
the progress on the project, that's part of the context in which they evaluate our progress.

Our next question comes from Marc de Croisset with FBR Capital Markets.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Marc.
<Q - Marc de Croisset MBA>: Hi, Tom, good afternoon. If I may I'd love to ask a quick question on your thoughts on
the cross-state air pollution rule. One of the arguments that I think the EPA has made is that SO2 compliance could be
achieved by having utilities use existing scrubbers more effectively. And as a result that would be one of the means to
reduce – to achieve SO2 compliance. And I'd be very interested in your reaction to this argument and have you seen
any indication in the industry that – or in your region that scrubbers over the last several years may not have been
utilized as often or as effectively as they could be?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, so there's a lot of layers to that question, let me hit just kind of a couple of them.
And I just can't contain myself but start with a commercial. About half the scrubbers that we put in place, I think maybe
two-thirds of them, are the Chiyoda scrubbers that we developed at our R&D facility along with the Chiyoda company

out of Japan and those companies use a fiberglass wall, if you will, for the bubbling structure where we take out the
harmful effluents. We've been able to put those in place on time under-budget and their performance has exceeded our
expectations and normal industry performance. It's just another example of how R&D and also this engineering
construction services group we have – about 1,500, 1,600 people in Birmingham – really work to the benefit of our
customers.
Now, when I evaluate the effectiveness of the scrubber technologies that we have put in place, I would say that there's
not a whole lot more that we're going to do to improve their performance. They already perform in an excellent
manner. I would argue – and I just know this, I'm not going to throw names out – but certain people around the industry
have come to us for some help in trying to support their scrubber programs. And either it's a flaw in the technology or
because they rely on third-party constructors they don't perform as they might have. And also sometimes scrubbers
were deployed in order to meet certain, shall we say, merchant market credit thresholds that really don't operate in an as
efficient manner as possible in order to generate thresholds as required by the EPA.
And then finally, some of the technologies that have been deployed were deployed years ago, and just are not the latest
and greatest technologies. So when EPA considers, "Oh, well, if you just operate more efficiently," I think you've got a
very tough question here. In other words, are you going to be able to run your scrubbers more efficiently, are you going
to be able to throw in DSI, or Trona or any of that other stuff? Remember, too, it's not just a simple matter of, well, if
you just run your scrubbers more efficiently you're going to comply. Well, if you add up the aggregate effect of all the
other issues they're raising, including PM standards where this DSI may cause a problem on the PM side of the
equation, it's just not that easy.
<Q - Marc de Croisset MBA>: Tom, just one clarification, can a scrubber be effective but utilized infrequently? Is
that a possibility? So even – I'll just repeat that, even if a scrubber is effective at removing SO2, can you use it less
often at your discretion?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You can. Wait, so the answer to the question is yes. Now, I kind of want to understand
that. In other words, it would be – I bet what you're getting to is a coal unit being used more as an intermediate or
peaking kind of facility where you might run it – I can't imagine in this future environment you're going to run
unscrubbed coal.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<A>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey Tom. You went into a lot of detail on HAPs MACT about some of the concerns,
timeline et cetera. Would love kind of similar feedback on the cross-states rule whether it's timing that concerns you,
whether it's how the allocations were given out on a state-by-state or a plant-by-plant basis, whether it's something else.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Michael, at the risk of being glib, it's all the above. And honestly when we think about
this, sometimes what you see is significant overlap between rules. And certainly that's the case we think with this
cross-state thing and HAPs MACT. Timeframes and all the other issues you raise are absolutely legitimate here and
kind of what the value of the allowances are and what they might be in the future regime. Is all of this warranted, is the
net effect -- I have to keep going back to: remember our business model puts customers in the middle of everything we
do.
And the question that I think should be on the table for everybody, especially in the context of these national debt
negotiations and a variety of issues that are facing our national economy is why now, when we consider the potential
impacts to the price of electricity in the United States and how important that is to the national economy, what impact is

that going to have? Our own estimates by our own economists would say that if the price of electricity goes up 20%
that could represent a reduction in national GDP of about 0.5% and that could represent the loss of between a million
and 1.5 million jobs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Interesting. What is the likelihood – it may be early to make this call – on whether the
court and whether it's the same court that put it back on remand or another court, I'm not sure of the legal path, I would
assume it's the D.C. Circuit, would consider a stay or an injunction if the EPA proves inflexible on timeframes?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, it's the D.C. Circuit. And we believe something needs to happen to create a more
sensible approach. See, when we think about this, we go to the kind of three prongs of reliability, economic
consequence and environmental impact. And right now we're out of balance I think with the proposal of these rules.
We've got to come back, and I don't know how it will happen but we think through the D.C. Circuit there may be some
chance here.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. One more of a modeling oriented question. How should we think about outside of
the core subsidiaries – meaning the regulated subs and Southern Power – what costs exist at the holding company level
or at the parent level? If I remember correctly, you had $1 billion, $1.5 billion of combined short and long-term debt,
just curious about other costs there, if any.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, a lot of those are corporate costs at the Southern level that are allocated. Some are
charged directly to the op cost and others are handled through the dividend allocation that we allocate to each of the
operating companies.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Help us out with your question a little more. What are you interested in?
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: No, I'm just trying to true something, I'm trying to kind of back into what else potentially
besides holding company debt could be a drag if I were to look at the difference between some of the form one filing
data and some of the SEC data. But I'll follow up with you guys offline.

Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good afternoon. Tom, just listening to our commentary with regard to the proposed HAPs MACT
rules and EPA rules and reconciling the point that you've made many times in prior presentations about the kind of
political backlash you expect from the Midwestern core states and other areas and the lobbying efforts by you and
others, where do we stand today looking at the reality on the ground? Is your thinking now that the rules, the likelihood
this go in as planned? I mean are the challenges of delay much more today than they were say four or five months ago,
what's the latest on that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's hard to assess because the context is changing, right? So here we are with this national
debate right now about what to do about the federal deficit and the national level of debt and everything else. And, it's
fascinating to hear the two sides talk about on one hand we've got to cut costs and, on the other hand, we've got to raise
revenues through increased taxes. And it's our sense that cutting costs is certainly a dominant solution, we've got lots of
room to do that and we've got to rationalize essentially the size of government. By the same token when you consider
raising taxes, you're not going to be able to cut your way out of this problem and you're not going to be able to tax your

way out of this problem, we're going to have to grow the economy and that's the way out of the problem, eventually.
Raising taxes just dampens your ability to grow. And the point we continue to make and I think it has some traction, is
that when you consider some of the overreaching regulation that we're seeing now this has clearly had the effect of an
indirect tax on the economy. And that is not good for anybody right now. So we ask the question, again, why now?
There will be time that will play out as these events unfold where we'll have more clarity.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And Tom, I recall also one of the avenues for pushing things back is the White House, or the
administration adding another two years beyond the one year that EPA has flexibility on. Is that still an option, is that
still on the table as far as you can tell?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Oh, sure. And so the question there is the devil in the details. How does that get issued?
You know, is that something that's just unilaterally done by the President? Can he essentially delegate that authority to
the states? A variety of other issues.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And last question, the folks from NEI have been talking about the COL approval process and
one of the points they raised was that this time around there would be mandatory hearings as part of the process which I
believe has not been done before and they put that in the category of unknowns and uncertainties. Do you guys look at
it that way and what's your view on that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we think that there are no kind of contentions to the schedule that's going to be laid
out. We think actually – I know people are really focused on this but we think actually the process that's being laid out
is thoughtful, it is thorough, and it is predictable. And I think as the NRC comes out with its revised schedule I think it
will provide some clarity, transparency to the process. And we think, frankly, it will be supportive to issuing the COL
in a timely manner.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Mark Barnett with Morningstar.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey, you guys, how are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Good.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: I know you've been answering a lot of policy questions today, I don't want to push you too hard
but actually switching gears a little bit towards kind of the renewable policy framework and how that's affected your
plans at Southern Power maybe in pursuing solar. If you look at kind of the cash grants will be expiring this year and
obviously with the debt debate, some of these things have come up on the chopping block, just wondering what your –
what you've heard, I guess, what might be targeted and how that might shape your kind of strategic planning around
renewables at Southern Power.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, so you raise a great point and in our discussions on Capitol Hill, both within the
administration and in Congress, it is clear that renewables exist today primarily because of federal subsidies in the form
of tax benefits either with production tax credits, invested tax credits, a variety of other things. To some extent, from a
policy level, federal support makes sense, particularly when you want to get something started, okay. So you give it
some support, you get its legs underneath it and then it goes forward. The question that I think remains for the
renewables sector is how viable are those projects in thinking about the national energy portfolio ex federal subsidies.

That's why we've said before that we're kind of bullish on the development of solar just as apart from wind, for
example. When we think about, we did our project in New Mexico with First Solar, a terrific company, great group of
guys, their idea is to get thin film photovoltaics to a economic competitive basis by the middle of this next decade, say
2016, to where maybe it will be $0.15 per kilowatt hour. When you consider the normal trajectory of energy prices in
the United States if they're able to reach that – and it's really two ways to reach it: it's either through efficiency gain in
the conversion of sunlight to electricity, so from a technological improvement standpoint; and then the second would be
kind of a production cost efficiency standpoint. If they can now generate thin film solar panels at a cost per panel rate
that continues to decline, well, maybe they can hit that. And as you consider the price of energy in the United States –
now you know we in the southeast are pretty cheap, we're about $0.085 on a retail basis. Nationally, $0.15 per kilowatt
hour might make sense even without federal subsidies.
That's where the renewable sector has to go. They have to be able to demonstrate their reliability and economic
consequence without federal subsidies eventually.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay, thanks for those comments. I guess also regarding sort of Southern Power looking to the
future, obviously sitting on that dry powder and kind of waiting things out, are you looking at any of the deals in the
transactions going on this year or the offered portfolios, I should say, and do you see any kind of bargains out there, is
there anything that you're looking at maybe acquisition-wise anywhere around the U.S?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we always look at acquisitions and, in fact, recently we've done some things. The West
Georgia deal we did a trade for – what was the project in Florida? We did a trade for one of our projects in Florida for
West Georgia. What? DeSoto, we traded DeSoto for West Georgia plus cash, I guess. But we're always in the market to
evaluate opportunities and do that. So we're always on there. The other thing, I guess I didn't really hit this, I kind of hit
it, so Southern Power through our Southern renewables company, it's all managed in the same spot, we've done a solar
deal, we're doing a biomass deal, and there are tax credits associated with that. Obviously, we're very modest in our
approach there compared to perhaps some other people.
From a financial policy standpoint, we view tax advantaged investing as riskier than normal investing and for Southern
Company given our conservative profiles and having the best level of financial integrity and the most conservative
business model around, we put a higher hurdle rate on those kind of investments than just good old brick and mortar
investing. So you'll look to see us continue in that vein in the future. We'll probably be pretty modest there.

Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Hi, how are you doing?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Great.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just two quick questions. One on Fukushima, the report that came out, did you guys see
anything in there that would cause you any concerns about increasing expenses?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So do you mean – let me break – I'll answer my own question here, heck with it. With
Vogtle 3 and 4 we got reaffirmed that, in fact, Vogtle 3 and 4 had the design characteristics, et cetera, et cetera so it was
very supportive of moving forward with all reasonable haste to get that done.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. I meant the existing fleet.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The existing fleet. I got my own plug in there, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The existing fleet, it's hard to tell right now. When you consider that this 90-day report
was the very solid work product of six people from the NRC, that work product has to go through a thoughtful review
at the NRC. And I think in its review of NRC's normal processes they will take a very thoughtful look and assess its
applicability to the current fleet. So it's really just hard to say right now. I think there are some attractive areas to
consider improving the current fleet but it will take some time.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Second question is it sounds like the economy is doing pretty well. Before you guys
were sort of maybe thinking that I guess economic growth in your area could be about 4% but you guys were being
conservative at 3%, 3.5%, at least that's the last thing I recall, maybe it's changed. I was wondering if it has changed
actually, what your outlook now is for a healthy economy.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, you know, our forecast is what it is. And as we look at where we are now I would
expect us to do a bit better than what we forecast on industrial, kind of like what happened last year. The mix was
different although we hit our total forecast or did a little better than our total forecast, the mix may be off a bit. We may
under-run our estimate on residential and commercial growth. But in total we don't think we'll be too far from our
numbers.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey let me give you just a little more flavor there which is kind of fascinating to me. You
did see this little bump in residential compared to say prior quarters. There's almost two classes kind of people right
now in the United States, those with jobs and those without. And let me say right at the outset that unemployment is at
unacceptably high levels in the United States and we got to get about fixing that problem. What we are seeing,
however, for those that have jobs in the southeast, they're doing reasonably well. We've seen a 4% increase in personal
income growth. We've seen we think with this bump an increase in usage. We see an increase in tax receipts. People
are spending more money.
So there's this interesting set of data points that suggest that if you have a job, that we may see some momentum to
grow not only with the creation of jobs as we suggested on the economic development front but also in the future in
terms of personal consumption. So it's a pretty interesting thing that we're keeping our eye on. It's highly uncertain.
With the visibility we see on the economic development front we think it will turn. The question is when will it turn.
And just a last comment I'll make, when we make estimates as to economic growth and a variety of other things we do
this with this economic round table that Art runs and that Paul Bowers before him started. This is really not our own
estimate but it's really kind of the aggregation of everyone's estimates that we talk to in the southeast.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: I guess I'll follow up a little bit on what you were just talking about, in particular with the
industrial groups. You were pretty positive when you talked about job growth in the industrial sector in your region.
But we did see a slowdown in the weather adjusted change from quarter to quarter. And also you mentioned that your
round table group was more cautious than they were six months ago. I guess could you give us a little color on kind of
the trend you're seeing with industrial? Have you seen any pullback as the quarter progressed as we've kind of seen in
the national economic numbers or are you not seeing that in your region?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we've seen some spotty things but when you look year to year '11 to '10 you'll notice
last year's pattern of industrial sales grew throughout the year. So our ability to grow over last year's numbers is going
to be a little more limited this year than it, say, was last year because we're working off a very low base. You had some
additions to capacity such as ThyssenKrupp in Alabama that have ramped up production a little quicker than we
thought. You've had the addition of a new refinery in Alabama which has helped those industrial sales as well offset by,
say, Honda which was impacted by some of their production by the Fukushima – or the earthquake in Japan,
interrupting the supply chain a bit. So you've got hot and cold spots. But on the whole, our chemicals, our primary
metals, our fabricated metals, and auto production continue to be very strong and we expect them to remain that way.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: One more local story of interest, just real quick. One of my buddies runs Southtowne
Automotive here in Atlanta, several dealerships for automobiles. He's selling out of low-priced, fuel-efficient cars, he's
selling out of used vehicles. He's getting plenty of supply but they're coming off the lot and he's having trouble
replacing them with other product to sell. So it's a fascinating time right now. It feels like we're on the cusp of some
recovery. My sense is it's still a prolonged recovery but we see interesting signals all over the place.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. Moving on. You talked a little bit about that you filed for – at Georgia Power for I
think it was $93.5 million increase.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Gulf Power.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Or Gulf Power I mean, yeah, sorry. What's the requested ROE and what are the other drivers
of that and then what was your earned ROE in the last 12 months at Gulf?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: The requested ROE in the case is 11.7%. The drivers for the increase are basically, as I said
in the text of my remarks, was that they haven't filed a base rate increase in over 10 years. And just the increase in costs
and the infrastructure hardening that the Commission has asked for within the state of Florida are cost increases that the
company has to date been able to cover. But at this point it's necessary to go ahead and try to get recovery of those
increased costs. The actual last year earned ROE total company was 11.7%.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then the last question I have is just what was the quarter end debt balance and
then what are the – any change in debt plans for the second half?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, basically we're right at $20 billion in debt. The plans, let's see, so far year-to-date
we've issued $1.7 billion, not all of that is new money. We have done a little more refinancing as the markets have
allowed. And for the rest of this year we probably have another $1 billion to issue.

It appears our final question is a follow-up from the line of Brian Chin with Citi.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Hi, thanks for taking my question in what's turning out to be an epic Southern call.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We always enjoy talking with you folks.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: A question on Southern Power. If I remember right that's roughly 80% contract is what
you've told us in the past.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Certainly in the near term, that's right.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Is that 80% volumetrically contracted as well or was that contracted in terms of expected
overall margins?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So remember what we do is we try to structure our competitive gen business with a
similar risk posture to our integrated regulated business. So virtually all of our contracts have two segments. One
segment is associated with the investment in brick and mortar capacity and for the term of the contract we earn a fixed
return on those investments on that capacity even whether the assets run or not.
The second element, the second segment of contracts deals with energy. And as you see with our integrated regulated
businesses, those essentially are comp pass-throughs, essentially fuel costs with some variable O&M. And there is the
ability with some small level to earn upsides. That would be for starts, energy margin, availability, a variety of other
small potential benefits that we can do.
So when we think about kind of keeping our powder dry and 80% and all that, we were wondering earlier last year and
even the year before how aggressively do we want to cover the uncovered portion of that generation portfolio. And
remember, that generation portfolio is almost exclusively gas-fired in the southeast. As you think about the weight of
the implications of these proposed regulations by EPA, we have felt that Southern Power was exceedingly attractively
positioned to take advantage of this kind of rapidly changing environment, not only in just kind of how the world may
change as a result of regulations but also the economic effect of cheap, plentiful so-called tight gas shale gas relative to
coal. So that's what we're seeing with Southern Power right now. Did that hit your question?
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Well, I guess what I'm – because your earlier comment about volumes or utilizations at
CCGT is going from 38% up to 50%.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Right.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Sparked my interest in Southern Power and what we're trying to think about here is if
Southern Power is seeing a similar level of interest in demand, then do your contracts preclude you from seeing that
upside or do your contracts allow you to capture a little bit more upside than what you had projected you were
contracted at?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, that's it but it's not much.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It depends. It depends on if the customer that you have a contract with has scheduled that
capacity. If they have not, then, we might have the opportunity to sell it somewhere else. But normally in this kind of
environment, they're going to schedule it all on their own.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And just to review kind of what Art said, the broader context, because this applies to
operating companies as well, we operate in a pool of energy here in the southeast. Each of the companies – when you
meet your own needs first for your retail load. Secondly, you meet the needs of sister companies first. Thirdly, only
after you meet the needs of all of your retail customers all across our service territory, then do you get to make
opportunity sales and offset a Lambda somewhere else in the U.S. Interestingly we've had a real pickup in this second
quarter of sales to our west. So that's kind of where we've made the excess margin in the second quarter.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Last question on this: with the allowance shortfall at Georgia Power, would it be possible
for you to meet that shortfall by running your coal plants less and then ramping up utilization at some of the Southern
Power plants, or am I just not really thinking about this correctly?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, absolutely. Look -
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That is an option.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: When we say change the dispatch, that's what we're talking about.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Okay. Because your answer back to Marc de Croisset earlier seemed to imply that your
scrubbers on your coal plants already running at as high a utilization rate as you think they can go. So, ergo you can't
increase the utilization on the scrubbers, the only thing you can do is – or one of the options you have is to swap out on
the dispatch curve.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, see, I know I went into detail there with Marc but the point is ours are already
performing at an excellent level, an industry-leading level for heaven's sake. So I don't know how much – so we've got
all these engineers that tinker around with this stuff and love to make it work better, so there's always some potential.
But I think relative to what you're seeing elsewhere in the United States I thought his question went more to other
people that had other technologies, other experience, older technologies, deregulated markets with a different reality. It
really applied to somebody other than Southern.
<Q - Brian J. Chin CPA>: Okay, and to summarize your earlier response back to me, in terms of your hedging at
Southern Power, you are essentially physically hedged and not financially hedged, is that maybe a better, more accurate
way to phrase that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Very accurate.
