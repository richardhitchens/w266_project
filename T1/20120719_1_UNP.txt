Greetings and welcome to the Union Pacific Second Quarter Conference Call. At this time, all participants under a
listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]
As a reminder this conference is being recorded and the slides for today's presentation are available on Union Pacific's

Koraleski, you may begin.
John J. Koraleski
Good morning, everyone, and second to Union Pacific's second quarter conference call. With me in Omaha are Rob
Knight, our Chief Financial Officer, Eric Butler, Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales and Lance Fritz,
Executive Vice President of Operations. Union Pacific achieved an all-time record quarter, generating an earnings
milestone of $2.10 per share, an increase of 32% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Best ever quarterly operating
revenue and operating income drove our record operating ratio performance and bottom line results. We are clearly

delivering on the strength of our diverse franchise; volume growth across many of our market sectors allowed to us
offset the 17% decline in coal volumes.
When combined with solid pricing, efficient network operations and continued productivity gains, the net result was
our best ever quarter by nearly every financial measure. We're continuing to focus on providing safe, efficient, high
quality service that creates value for our customers and increased financial returns for our shareholders. So with that,
we'll get started this morning. I will turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack and good morning. Let's start with a look at customer satisfaction which came in at 93 for the quarter.
That's one point better than a year ago and it matches the record we set in the first quarter this year. We appreciate this
recognition from our customers and we are committed to providing them a strong value proposition. Second quarter
volume was a little better than flat against last year as strong growth in automotive and chemicals and solid gains in
industrial products and intermodal were offset by continued weakness in coal. Excluding the impact of coal, combined
volume in the other five groups grew 5% in spite of softer ag export market.
Core price improved 4.5%, all six groups posted gains but the overall improvement was impacted again this quarter by
the fall off in coal volume where much of our legacy repricing has occurred. The improved pricing along with about
2% from an increased fuel surcharge revenue resulted in a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. Together the
slight increase in volume and improved average revenue per car resulted in a 7% increase in freight revenue to a record
$4.9 billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups.
Let's start with coal, which we used to report as energy. To avoid confusion with the fast-growing shale energy markets
that are driving growth and chemicals and industrial products and other energy markets from wind to ethanol, going
forward, we're going to call this group coal. This is just a renaming of the old energy line of business. There's no
change in what's included in the results. And the second quarter coal revenue declined 9% as a 10% improvement in
average revenue per car wasn't enough to overcome the 17% drop in volume. Coal demand remained weak as
historically low natural gas prices reduced coal's share of electricity generation and mild winter weather sent coal
stockpiles soaring. Powder River Basin stockpiles are estimated to have grown 70% from their low point last August,
swinging from seven days below normal at that time to nearly 24 days above normal this April before dropping back
some the past two months.
The tough market conditions and the ongoing impact of a couple of contract losses last year led to an 18% decline in
Southern Powder River Basin tonnage. Colorado/Utah tonnage grew 4%, overcoming the weak domestic demand with
a 135% increase in export tons.
Seasonal strengthening boosted overall coal volume toward the end of the quarter and the recent upward movement in
natural gas prices has been an encouraging trend. But the chart in the upper left shows we are still tracking well below
last year and the comps get tougher in the second half. Ag products revenue was up 1%, as volume declined 2%, but
average revenue per car improved 2% despite a negative mix impact. With improved world supply, grain exports have
declined as expected, down 32% from last year's strong volumes. Reduced U.S. soybean crush drove a 6% decline in
soybean meal shipments. DDGs declined 13% as more product was fed locally, reducing rail demand, and lower
gasoline consumption was reflected in a 3% reduction in ethanol volumes.
Partially offsetting those declines was an 8% growth in domestic grain shipments and a 3% growth in food and
refrigerated carloads.
Automotive shipments grew 15%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car, drove a 25%
increase in revenue. As a reminder, last year's results were softened somewhat by the impact of the disaster in Japan on
the automotive supply chain. With Global Insight's current full year forecast at 14.2 million vehicles, the automotive
industry's continued recovery was reflected in solid year over year growth in sales. Improved credit availability is
releasing pent-up demand to replace aging vehicles with new, more fuel efficient and technologically-equipped vehicle.

For the UP, that translated into 14% growth in finished vehicle carloadings while parts shipments grew 17%.
Chemicals revenue grew 14%, as a 12% volume increase combined with a 1% improvement in average revenue per car.
Petroleum shipments increased 92%, driven by continued growth in crude oil shipments originated in the Bakken and
Eagle Ford shale plays and moving to UP served terminals at St. James, Louisiana and Galveston and Houston, Texas.
Plastics volume was up 7% with increased demand and new business. Industrial chemicals, LPG and most other
chemical segments also posted gains, however, fertilizer was an exception with volume down 15% as demand for
potash remained soft. The decline in fertilizer also had a negative impact on average revenue per car.
Industrial products grew 6%, which combined with an 8% improvement in average revenue per car produced a 14%
revenue increase. UP's franchise is well positioned to link new sand origins in the Upper Midwest to new destination
facilities and the oil rich shale plays. Combine that with the continued conversion of rigs from vertical to horizontal
drilling technology, now sand carloads continued to grow, even as overall drilling activity was flat, driving a 28%
increase in nonmetallic mineral shipments. Decreased demand for rock into the Eagle Ford shale play along with
increased construction activity in the Houston area led to an 18% growth in rock traffic and an 8% increase in cement.
As housing starts climbed, lumber carloadings increased 8% to the highest level since 2008, although they are still well
below pre-recession volumes. Offsetting some of the strength in industrial products markets was a 55%, or 11,600 unit
decline in hazardous waste as ramp down of government funding has impacted our uranium tailings business in Utah.
Intermodal revenue grew 10% as 3% growth in volume combined with a 7% improvement in average revenue per unit.
Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove international intermodal volume
up 3%. Growth was dampened slightly by the continued impact of the contract loss last year, the effect of which we
finally wrapped at the beginning of May. Continued success in converting highway business to rail drove 3% growth in
domestic intermodal.
That wraps up the second quarter. So let's take a look ahead at what we see for the second half of 2012. Our current
outlook is for the economy to continue its slow improvement, although that's far from certain with ongoing problems in
the Eurozone and fast approaching U.S. budget and tax policy challenges. No matter what the economy does, we will
continue to focus on our strong value proposition, attracting new customers and supporting our existing customers as
they continue to work to grow their business. Clearly, continued weakness in coal presents a sizable challenge as we
look at the rest of the year. While seasonal strengthening of coal shipments is already driving a stronger run rate
sequentially against a tougher comp, the third quarter volume decline is expected to be in the low to mid-teens.
In ag, the prolonged and widespread drought conditions have moderated our earlier optimism about opportunities with
the fall harvest. Recent corn yield estimates have dropped back to last year's levels, likely eliminating any upside
potential. World demand for U.S. soybeans still looks strong for the fall. The good news is for our diverse franchise
gives us a wide range of opportunities to offset the challenges and drive growth. The biggest of those opportunities is
continued strength in shale energy, delivering inbound materials as well as outbound crude oil.
While the slowdown in natural gas drilling and the slower than expected ramp up of customer facilities has shale
energy related carloads a little off their expected pace, we still expect it to contribute about two points to overall growth
for the year. Shale energy will continue to be the largest growth driver in industrial products and chemicals with other
segments of those two businesses expected to continue as they did in the first half. Forecasted improvement in housing
starts and growth in nonresidential construction in the South should boost lumber, rock and cement in industrial
products. While global markets may challenge some chemical manufacturers, low cost feedstocks are keeping U.S.
plants competitive and facility expansions also provide us with opportunities
We anticipate strength in plastics will continue and industrial chemicals should track with the economy. We expect
continued success converting highway business and domestic intermodal and international intermodal to pick up,
tracking ahead of last year as the slowing, growing economy is expected to produce a positive but somewhat muted
peak seasons.
Auto manufacturers expect sales growth to continue and that should be good for our finished vehicles and auto parts
business. Put that all together and we expect to overcome the challenges in coal, with the anticipated volume growth

combining with price gains to drive revenue growth.
With that, I will turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thanks, Eric and good morning. Starting with safety, for the year-to-date period, we came very close to achieving an
all-time record performance in our reportable personal injury rate. The second quarter reportable rate increased 9%
compared to 2011, offsetting the year-over-year improvement in the first quarter. More importantly, a fatal incident that
occurred in Goodwell, Oklahoma at the end of June took the lives of three Union Pacific employees. It was a terrible
reminder of how unforgiving our industry can be and it underscores why we are relentless in pursuing the goal of zero
safety incidents. With respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments, our year-to-date reportable rate improved 4%
and we are even more favorable when including all derailments not just those meeting the FRA reportable threshold.
In public safety, the grade crossing incident rate increased 22% in the year-to-date period, continuing the trend we saw
in the first quarter. The combined effects of our robust growth in the South which has a higher grade crossing density
than our overall network, and growth in commercial traffic, has increased our grade crossing accident exposure. We
continue to focus on community support and driver behavior to address this increased risk. Our safety strategy helps
keep our network strong and resilient, and as a result, our network remains fluid and is operating at very efficient
levels. Weather was friendlier to our operation in the second quarter compared to last year, which helped but that wasn't
the whole story.
In addition to milder weather, the operating team adapted the T-Plan, locomotives and crews to manage shifts in mix
from coal to growing manifest and premium volumes in the South. In Texas and Louisiana, we are effectively utilizing
the existing infrastructure while we build new capacity, which I will talk more about in a minute. As a result, velocity
improved 2% to 26.6 miles per hour. Compared to 2010, average speed was up 1% despite 4% growth in our seven day
volumes.
Our service scorecard illustrates UP's customer value proposition. Local operating teams continue to provide great
service as reflected by industry spot and pull, which tied an all-time quarterly record of 95%. The second quarter
Service Delivery Index, a measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, also improved from
2011 levels. While the UP team is successfully managing the continued carload surge in the South, we continue to have
capacity for growth in other parts of the system, with about 420 employees furloughed and around 900 locomotives in
storage.
Moving on to network productivity, slower miles were down over 20% from last year which was a second quarter
record for us. Our network is in excellent shape reflecting our investment in replacement capital. Moving to the upper
right, our car utilization metric improved year-over-year and reflects the improvement in network velocity and fluidity.
In the lower left, gross ton miles per employee declined 4% versus 2011, which includes the headwinds of 700
additional employees working on capital projects and positive train control, driving about half the decrease. It also
reflects the 17% decline in coal volumes which is one of our heaviest commodities.
Increased premium and manifest traffic including local train starts also masked productivity gains. While not shown on
the graph here, productivity gains were also achieved on the intermodal side as train lengths grew to an all-time
quarterly record of 173 boxes per train, improving 3% on a 3% increase in intermodal volumes compared to 2011.
Lastly, our team is leveraging the robust volume growth in the South using UP's extensive terminal infrastructure to
generate a 1% improvement in the number of cars switched per employee day. To expand a bit more on the progress we
are making in the South, second quarter volumes in the South were up 7% versus last year and up 6% from first quarter
levels.
In fact, we are pretty much back to pre-recession volumes. During the first quarter call, we talked about the initiatives
underway to handle this robust growth efficiently. Our results demonstrate the great progress we have made advancing
them in the second quarter. Benchmarking against the first quarter, you can see the improvement made in terminal

dwell, on-time train departure and car connections, despite volume growth of 6%. We have realigned resources,
adjusted car routings to leverage terminal capacity and modified train starts to maintain fluid operations and to increase
the local service frequency. In addition, the capital investments we're making in the south are beginning to have a
positive impact in supporting both volume growth and improved service levels.
Our targeted 2012 capital spend is still around the $3.6 billion mark. Spending for service growth and productivity will
total over $1.3 billion. It's important to note that all of these projects have a positive safety impact. Capacity,
commercial facilities and equipment are the primary drivers. Major projects include additional double track on on the
Sunset Corridor and the Blair project, work on the Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility and various projects in the South.
Our capacity expansion plans in the South are estimated at around $200 million this year, increasing threefold from
spending levels in 2011. The map shows current and future investment plans. Late in the second quarter, we cut over
new capacity in West Texas that will help us serve inbound and outbound loads for the Permian Basin.
In the second half of 2012, we will be cutting over additional new capacity across the system, including projects to
efficiently deliver growth in crude oil moves to St. James, Louisiana. Most encouraging is that new capacity
investments are generating an excellent return while supporting our diverse book of business, including increased
shale-related volumes, growing Mexico and intermodal business, as well as export grains to the Gulf.
So with that, we remain positive on our operating outlook for 2012, and our ability to achieve network improvements
on various fronts. A more mature total safety culture, stronger relationships with local communities and improved
infrastructure position us well to achieve our goal of another record safety year. We will provide customers with a
value proposition that supports growth with high levels of service, and we are well positioned to react to dynamic shifts
in volume, while generating productivity and to invest a record amount of capital that generates attractive returns by
capacity in high volume corridors.
With that, I will turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks, Lance and good morning. Let's start by summarizing our second quarter results. Operating revenue grew 7% to
an all-time quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by core pricing gains and improved fuel surcharge recovery.
Operating expense totaled $3.5 billion, increasing only 1%. Lower fuel prices this quarter helped offset other cost
increases, after nine consecutive quarters of higher year-over-year fuel prices. Operating income totaled $1.7 billion, a
24% increase and a best ever quarterly performance.
Other income totaled $21 million, down $5 million compared to 2011. Interest expense of $135 million was also lower,
down 9% versus last year. Income tax expense increased to $608 million, mostly driven by higher pre-tax earnings.
Quarterly net income exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time in our history and was up 28% versus 2011. The
outstanding share balance declined 3%, reflecting our share repurchase activity. These results drove a quarterly
earnings record of $2.10 per share, a 32% increase versus last year.
Turning now to our top line; freight revenue grew 7% to a best ever quarterly record of $4.9 billion. Volume growth
was up about a half a point. The mix impact was flat this quarter, unlike the first quarter, where it was a large positive
driver on a year-over-year basis. Growth in intermodal traffic and shorter length of haul moves such as stone offset the
growth impact of higher average revenue per car moves such as the shale-related activities.
Fuel surcharge revenue added 2% to our top line growth, driven in part from the positive lag impact of our fuel
surcharge programs. The continued benefit from our recently negotiated legacy contracts generated a meaningful
step-up in fuel surcharge coverage, contributing over 1% in freight revenue growth, and roughly $0.05 in earnings per
share compared 2011.
In addition, we achieved solid core pricing gains of 4.5%; however, pricing gains this quarter were impacted by the
17% decline in coal volumes. The combination of solid core pricing and fuel surcharge coverage gains reflect the value
of Union Pacific's service offerings and contributed to the record profitability this quarter.

Moving on to the expenses, slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was down
1% compared to 2011. Consistent with our recent guidance, more moderate inflation drove only a 1.5% increase in
costs. Positives in the quarter include mild weather conditions versus last year's Midwest floods, lower new hire
training costs and generally more efficient operations. As you know, wages for our union employees will increase
effective July 1 which will drive inflation costs higher in the second half of the year to roughly 2.5%.
Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter compared to 2011, driven entirely by increased capital activity, including
positive train controls. Excluding growth on the capital side, we still expect workforce levels to increase for the full
year, but not at a one-for-one rate with volume growth.
Slide 24 shows fuel expense, which totaled $882 million, decreasing $22 million versus last year. The average diesel
fuel price was $3.21 per gallon which declined 2% year over year. The mix shift of lower coal volumes and growth in
manifest and premium traffic drove a 2% increase in our fuel consumption rate, partially offsetting the impact of lower
fuel prices. Purchased services and materials expense increased 5% to $542 million, driven in part by higher subsidiary
contract expenses relating to the 17% growth in subsidiary revenue reflected on our Other revenue line.
Engineering, locomotive and freight car repair expense also increased this quarter driven by increased material usage
and inflation costs. Overall, our year-over-year comparison was a bit easier due to the $10 million in flood-related
expenses that we incurred last year in this expense line.
Other expenses came in at $190 million, down $6 million compared to 2011, driven by lower personal injury expense.
Our recent actuarial study resulted in a larger reduction to our estimate for prior year activity compared to last year.
Conversely, equipment and freight damage costs increased roughly $15 million while property tax expense was also up
compared to last year. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect the Other expense line to be more in the range of
what we saw in the first quarter of this year, barring any unusual items.
Slide 16 summarizes the remaining two expense categories; depreciation expense increased 8% to $433 million, mainly
driven by increased capital spending. Looking at the full year 2012, we expect depreciation expense to be up around
8% to 9% compared 2011. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $299 million, up 6% from 2011. Growth in
automotive and intermodal volumes drove an increase in short-term freight car rental expense which was partially
offset by lower locomotive lease expense.
Bringing revenue and expenses together, slide 27 reflects our operating ratio performance. This quarter, we achieved an
all-time quarterly best of 67% operating ratio, improving 4.3 points compared to last year and more than one point
better than our previous record set in the third quarter of 2010. Lower fuel prices contributed to about a point of the
improvement versus 2011. For 2012, we have tightened our guidance a bit, and we are now targeting a sub-70% full
year operating ratio, which would be a first ever in our history. Our incremental margin after adjusting for fuel price
and last year's flood impact was a notable 78% for the quarter, highlighting the positive impact of core pricing gains,
improved fuel surcharge coverage, operational efficiencies and growth in attractive new businesses.
That said, it's also likely to be the high mark for the year. Union Pacific's record earnings drove solid free cash flow in
the first half of the year but below 2011 due to a 37% increase in capital spending and a 54% increase in our cash
dividend payment. While cash from operations improved year-over-year, earnings growth was masked by more than
$600 million in higher cash tax payment. Much of that was driven by the 100% bonus depreciation program in effect
last year which significantly reduced our tax payments in 2011. Although the impact of bonus depreciation will still be
in that benefit to free cash flow this year, it will result in a headwind compared to 2011 due to the catch-up of prior
years' programs and a lower bonus depreciation rate in 2012.
Our balance sheet remains strong, supporting our investment grade credit rating. At June 30, 2012, our adjusted
debt-to-cap ratio was 40.6%. We continue to make opportunistic share repurchases which play an important role in our
balanced approach to cash allocation. Union Pacific's increasing returns over the last several years have enabled us to
drive greater shareholder value. In the second quarter, we bought back 3.8 million shares, totaling $415 million at an
average purchase price of around $110 per share. Combining dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned
over $1.4 billion to our shareholders in the first half of 2012, up more than 40% versus last year. Looking ahead, we

have 20.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.
That's a recap of our second quarter results. Looking forward, our quarterly financial comps become more challenging
but we still expect to achieve record earnings and a sub-70% operating ratio in 2012. In addition, we are still
forecasting volumes to be on the positive side of the ledger for the full year. Continued growth in domestic intermodal,
energy-related shale moves of crude oil, frac, sand and pipe, in addition to strong automotive and chemical shipments
should offset the coal decline.
We are committed to achieving real pricing gains driven by the increased value of our service offerings and solid
demand in many market sectors. Our prospects for 2012, supported by Union Pacific's strong value proposition and the
strength of our diverse franchise should result in greater profitability and allow us to grow shareholder returns. With
that, I will turn it back over to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Thanks, Rob. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, the global economic outlook has become more uncertain
and coal volumes are certainly going to remain a challenge; however, we are going to continue to take advantage of the
opportunities provided by our diverse franchise to drive record financial results. I want to emphasize a point that Lance
made, Union Pacific's commitment to employee and public safety is our number one priority – that has not and will not
change. We will continue to focus on providing efficient service that adds great value for our customers. We are well
positioned for upside, while remaining agile in today's changing environment. That said, we still believe in our
prospects for growing profitability, generating improved returns and increasing shareholder value this year.
So with that, let's open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is
from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please state your question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning, and congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to see if you
could give a bit more commentary on the coal view. Your slide shows an absolute load. It seems like things have
bottomed but you do have more difficult comparisons in second half. So how would we think about year-over-year? I
think you had some stockpile comments. I didn't catch them all and then I don't know if you want to comment on
natural gas within that. So do you think the broader – a little more detail on your outlook for coal in the second half.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay, Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Tom, in terms of callout, look, as we said earlier, our run rate is increasing as weather
increase in load, coal load demand increases also as natural gas prices increase, our coal utility providers become more
competitive in terms of using coal versus natural gas. As we said in the third quarter, we will continue to have some
tough comps as you saw on the slide, even as our volumes sequentially improve, which is why we said in the third
quarter, we'll be down again in the second half. The third quarter we said we will be down in the low to mid-teens.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: If I can just add, Tom, to your point on the trough. What that slide shows is that our low
point was in the second quarter on an absolute basis, forget the year-over-year for a second. On an absolute basis, we
did trough out in our coal in the second quarter and that was at a low on a PRB basis of around 23 trains per day and we
have sequentially grown to where we are running around, call it 30 trains PRB today, so we clearly have come out of
that trough.

<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, and Eric, I think you might have mentioned this – I just didn't catch it, what was
the days of stockpile you think you are at today?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I don't think we actually mentioned the absolute number. The report comes out this afternoon.
We are expecting a reduction in the stockpiles with the report that comes out today or tomorrow. It will be around the
low 20s, we think, above normal in terms of days above normal. So we are seeing continued and expecting, particularly
with this kind of weather that you are seeing across the country, a reduction in what the stockpile report will show.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Tom, I'm a little skeptical of that reported information, it's going to go and show as Eric said,
the last report that came out said 23 days of available stockpile. Our customer base is not behaving like they have 23
days of excess coal supplies. They are ordering more coal. They are bringing more coal sets on service. That is a
generalized number and I think it involves all Powder River Basin shipments throughout the United States. I think in
our served territory, we might actually be in somewhat better position than what that average stat might indicate.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As Rob mentioned, we are seeing our run rate sequentially improve.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. That's very helpful. For the second question, if I could – there's so much focus on
legacy contracts this year. I don't think I have heard you talk much about legacy in 2013, but you have shown charts, I
believe, $350 million in legacy business in 2013. Can you give us a sense of the timing of that? Is that all skewed to the
beginning of the year so you would see a full-year benefit? And is that all coal or is there some other stuff in it?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Tom, I would refer you and others to the chart that you've seen us use in the past that kind of
lays out the pie chart, if you will, of legacy where we show in 2013, there's about $350 million of legacy renewals up in
2013, and most of that is front end loaded, and we haven't broken it out precisely but as you know, the bulk of what's
still in front of us is coal related.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. So it's front end loaded. Great. Thank you for the time.

Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah, hi there. Good morning. Hey, Rob, I want to just follow up on a comment that you made
which is that the decline in coal affected core price. Do you know roughly how much that would have affected it if it
had just been, say flat?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, roughly, it's if you recall, Bill, in the first quarter we said about half a point of our
pricing was hurt, if you will, by the fall off in coal. That was even worse in the second quarter because coal was down
more. So it was more than half a point.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: On core price?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: On price, yes. Core price.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Got it. Okay. And then I realize that there's a lot of moving parts here and there's
uncertainty, but I think, correct me if I'm wrong, usually the third quarter is typically your best OR quarter and coal at
least sequentially looks like it will be a little bit better. So I sort of look at kind of the sub-70%s target and I say, well,
given where the first half was, the second half should be better. So that feels like a pretty modest guide or is there a part
here that we have to remember just in terms of a cost metric or something as we model the second half?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Go ahead. Okay, Rob, go for it. We're going to fight over this one.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Bill, I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, so, I would just say this, that
we are not going to solve for the 70%. Just like all the previous targets we've set, we are going to get there as efficiently
as we can, and do it the right way and that's through a combination of good service, safe service, pricing it right, and
running it efficiently. So don't look at the 70% as a solved-for number. We're going to get there as efficiently as we can

but there are a lot of uncertainties in front of us.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: No, that's fair. That's fair. Just one last detail. I think in the past you tried to estimate the market
size for some of this shale play. Can you remind us sort of what numbers you have thrown out? Thanks.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I am not sure we have thrown out any absolute total market size numbers. What we have said in
the past is that we would kind of double our volumes this year, and what we have said today is that as we look at the
outlook, our current outlook, that's about a 2% impact on our volume growth. I'm not sure we've given an ultimate
market size impact of the shale play in the past.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think, Bill, one of the things we said in the past is we expected our shale business when
you add it up all together to be somewhere close to 400,000 carloads this year and as Eric reported, there's a couple of
customer facilities that are a little slower coming online. We're probably going to fall a little bit short of the 400,000
carloads, but not too terribly much.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So, Rob, just wanted to follow up on the yields. And you talked about how mix was kind of a
neutral in the quarter after a big positive in the first quarter. How should we think about mix in the back half of the year
and then just to follow up on the point about coal, as the coal volume declines moderate, is it fair that we should think
that the same store pricing increases a little bit relative to that 4.5% in second quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I'm not giving guidance on the mix, but as you know, Scott, it really is dependent upon what
actually moves. So we saw a fairly dramatic shift from first quarter to second quarter on that mix, which was a result of
– as I pointed out, worse coal, more intermodal, more manifest, lower arc moves. We are not troubled by that by the
way because what we are focused on, on whatever the business is that we move, we are focused on handling it right and
generating strong returns as we proved in the second quarter, even without the benefit of mix. So I can't give you
guidance on the mix, other than it's not an excuse for us to turn in less attractive margins and we'll continue to approach
it that way.
And in terms of your question on the core pricing, yeah, I mean just generally speaking, again, we are not giving
pricing guidance, but to your point, as coal strengthens, we should achieve the benefit of some of those renegotiated
contracts as that business picks up.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That's great. And then I just want to understand your thoughts on grain given what's
going on in the Midwest and the drought conditions. And understand, when you talk about eliminating the upside corn
potential, does that mean you guys are now thinking about grain volumes being flat going forward starting this third
quarter or is this still a chance that we get positive grain volumes given the comps being easy in what still look like
strong wheat production and wheat exports?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, if you look at or you go back a couple months and look at the USDA projections, they
projected this year to be almost a bumper year, one of the best three or four best years in terms of crop yield, crop
production. That clearly has come down with the current drought conditions. I think the latest USDA projections are it's
going to be relatively flat versus last year in terms of crop yield, crop production. And so, our outlook in our ag
business is probably relatively similar to that.

<A - John J. Koraleski>: We actually have I think, Scott, if you look at it, we have somewhat easier comparisons in
the third and the fourth quarter. So, we're hopeful that at least if it doesn't get any worse than what they are currently
talking about, we're hoping that we could still do a little better from a volume perspective in the second half than last
year.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, guys. So, I was curious as we look at coal and kind of trend off through the
remainder of the year, at this point, if you were assuming normal weather, when do you get to normal stockpiles at your
utilities served and then how do you think about directionally 2013 volumes? I know this is difficult. But just curious,
from your standpoint, how you are thinking about next year in terms of flat, down or up.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Justin, you're right. This is really difficult. If the kind of weather pattern that we see right
now persists through the end of the year, we should reach a point where we'll be okay with the stockpiles and our coal
business should be coming back to a more normal kind of a run rate for us. That's a pretty big if. We have seen the
weather change dramatically off and on, so you have been with us a long time. You have seen that happen from year to
year.
If the stockpiles stay where they are, come in on a normal range, we'll have a pretty good year next year in our coal
business and hopefully, we won't have the aberrations we'll see. And then the other swing factor is what's going to
happen with natural gas prices? Will they act the way the forward curve is kind of looking and continue to edge their
way up? If that happens, we'll have a better prospect for a good year next year. If they crater on us and fall back down
again, it will be a little more difficult.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: So you still see western coal, I mean as solidly base load. You haven't seen permits
switching that you think would impair that growth rate looking out over the next couple of years?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: That's right. We do not see anything happening right at the moment that causes us to think
the growth rate is impaired.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Okay. And then on the export side, there's been a little bit of news, with you guys and
Peabody. I'm just curious where you guys are trending right now in terms of exports and how you think about that
business on a go-forward basis.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Last year we moved about 5 million tons of export coal. We think we are on a track run to
increase that 60% to about 8 million tons this year with the recent announcement as we continue to look for other
opportunities for port capacity to export.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Great. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time.

question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yes, good morning, everyone.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning, Brandon
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Jack, when we go back to your Analyst Day a couple of years ago when you guys
laid out the strategy to get to 65% or 67%, I don't think anyone envisioned that you would be getting to numbers close

to that this quickly. So could you just talk about some of the risks? I mean obviously we have seen coal come down,
hasn't had much impact. But what could get in the way of achieving that maybe a little bit faster than was anticipated a
couple years ago?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Brandon, I think as we laid that out in terms the 67% to the 65%, the thing that I would put
into perspective for you was we have no intention of stopping there. If we get there sooner rather than later, then the
goal just drops below the 65% at some point in time. We're going to continue to look at that. Certainly right now, when
you look at what are the things that could get in the way, there's a wide assortment of those things. All of which we're
up to the challenge of managing.
You have the U.S. economic situation that will take and play its course out here. Everyone hears a lot in the press about
the financial cliff that is approaching depending how the tax bills and things get settled out. That's certainly a risk to us.
There's always a concern about what happens with fuel prices long term and near term. We are watching carefully the
global positioning of the global economy. When you look at anywhere between 30% to 40% in any given quarter of our
business originates or terminates in another country, certainly what happens in China, what happens in the Eurozone
and all those things can represent risk.
Interestingly enough, they can also represent opportunity for us. So as the economic climate of Europe becomes more
unstable, that raises the prospects in the United States of possibly moving some of that manufacturing to our economy,
and particularly if we continue to see a positive impact on energy prices as a result of shale and shale development and
those kinds of things. So there's a whole variety of things, up to and including weather as we are seeing this year,
weather can be a friend. Weather can be an enemy. All those things kind of play their role, but that being said, the path
may be a little saw-toothed in getting there, but we will get there. And when we get there, we'll reassess where we are
headed and we'll keep our direction on providing the most efficiency and productivity, while adding great value for our
customers.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: All right. Thanks for that. And maybe one for Eric as well on intermodal which has
actually seen some pretty favorable growth, a little bit above the economy here. How is your Mutual Commitment
Program rolling out through the year?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We are excited about our Mutual Commitment Program. We think it is a strong leverage value
for us in the opportunity and the marketplace. We're seeing a number of our customers adopt it as they are recognizing
the value of it, and throughout this year, in terms of the volumes that we are seeing, that are going through our MCP
program, they are aligned with what we are expecting and what we planned and we are excited about the continued
upside opportunity.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. I guess, Rob, just to clarify, you are not in any way talking down
second half with the sub-70% OR? Are you just looking at that? And I guess to that point on the employee cost side,
you mentioned that you were looking at it to go up, I guess, or union wages were going up. It was, I guess on a per
employee basis, costs were down 3% this quarter. Should we be looking for that to spike back up on a year-over-year
basis in the back half?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Ken, a couple points and I am not saying things are going to get worse in the second
half. What I'm simply giving is the record guidance of operating performance on a full year basis and, remember, that
long-term target of 65%, 67% is a full year number and as I pointed out in my comments, we have never in our history
had a sub-70% operating ratio for a full year and we are focused on doing that, but, again, we are not going to solve for
70%. We will get there as efficiently as we can, and if we get sub-70% – the more sub we can get, the better

In terms of the point I was making on the cost side, just simply calling out that the inflation rate will go up a little bit in
the third quarter as a result of the labor agreements, and I think I pointed out in my comments that that labor line
inflation will look more like 2.5%, rather than the 1.5% that it was in the second quarter.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: So we could still – I mean if it was down 3% on a per employee basis if you add a point,
you could still see that -?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Aiding results then, right?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yes, Ken, you're exactly right. Those are still very good efficiency and productivity
numbers from a cost standpoint.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: All right, great and then, Jack, is there any expectation for an update or proposal we are
making or anything out of the STB following last summer's hearings that you would expect in the back half?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Ken, the STB has made some comments that would lead us to believe they are going to have
some sort of announcement, pronouncement, finding, or something. We don't know what that is yet, nor do we know
the timing of it. So the answer to your question is I just don't know.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Okay. So there's nothing that's heating up, at least you have heard behind the scenes or
anything to lead you to believe that something is more imminent than not?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Nope. No change.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Dahlman Rose. Please state your question. Mr. Seidel,
your line is open for question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Yes, good morning, guys. Two line of questioning, one on the intermodal front, the other on
pricing. You mentioned that you are up to a record 173 boxes per train. I was wondering, sort of where you think you're
going to max out? In other words, how much capacity do you have left in your intermodal network?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Jason, this is Lance, I will take the capacity question. We have said this before that we have got
plenty of upside in terms of productivity and train size and specific to the intermodal business, it's quarter specific, but I
think historically we have said we could see getting to a 200 boxes per train kind of number. But, again, it just depends
on where the growth is but we've got upside potential on virtually every quarter where intermodal is and we are
investing to enable future growth as we speak. So, candidly, I just don't see a limit at this point.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. My other question is around the pricing, the comment was made just so I understand it,
4.5% is in the core. Coal hurt you by more than a half a percent. My question is, what percent of the business right now
is sort of tied to inflationary indexes and how do you think that kind of was calculated into the mix? Did that hurt that
core pricing number a bit?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So, what we have historically said is about 75% of our business is embedded in contracts,
long-term contracts. If you look at the percent of our business that's related to ALF or RCAF increases, we've
historically said that's about 17% of our business.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And that number was only 1.5% in the second quarter.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: So it would have a negative impact on the core pricing number that you gave?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yes, to some extent.

Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Thanks, good morning. Some questions as it relates to coal and pricing. Can you give us an
idea outside of legacy, I know you mentioned the $350 million of legacy for next year but outside of that, maybe
contracts that have turned over more recently, what percent of your coal business is going to reprice in 2013 and what
should we expect if we assume, let's say we assume natural gas is in the $2.50 to $3 range, do you anticipate that
pricing can be steady or is it going to have to come down? What is your view if we make that assumption?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob, do you want to handle the legacy?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, let me just say, Chris, in terms of your question of – we don't give the specifics in terms
of how much business we are negotiating. But rest assured, we are in constant negotiations across our entire book of
business daily. We talk a lot about the marquee, if you will, legacy renewals but we don't give specific guidance
numbers beyond that. So it's just a constant part of our business and a constant part of what we do in our marketing and
sales team.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, let me talk about the second part of your question, it sounded like you were asking,
do we adjust our prices based on natural gas prices? We absolutely price to the market. We don't adjust our prices
based on commodity prices. We believe we have a strong value proposition, and we believe the marketplace is
recognizing our service and value proposition and we're continuing to price to that value proposition across our entire
book of business, including coal.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Right, yeah, I wasn't suggesting it was tied directly to the price, but more in line with your
comment about the market. If natural gas is in the $2.50 to $3 range, what is the market for PRB coal? Is it competitive
and you would expect therefore that prices are okay?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think there are a number of different kind of public assessments that suggest that PRB coal,
$2.50, $3 natural gas price is about the place where PRB coal becomes more competitive versus gas for many of our
serving utilities.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, the yields in the chemical business were a little bit weak.
I'm sorry if I missed the reason for that. Was it a mix issue or what was going on there?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Mix.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: What specifically?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Well, as you know, our fertilizer business was down as we talked about in our comments and
also I think we talked about last quarter in terms of the tremendous growth that we have in our crude oil business and
our crude oil franchise, we talked about last quarter I believe that some of that business is shorter haul, so there's a
downward mix impact associated with that.

<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks, good morning. Maybe a question on the intermodal side. Eric, can you give us a
pricing update? I just want to get a sense of what kind of the current dynamic feels like right now. We've had fuel
prices come in a little bit on the domestic side. I'm just kind of wondering what the dynamic is with truck and kind of
how you are feeling about that market.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. That's a good question. I think if you look at our results for the quarter, you can see that
we are getting strong pricing in the quarter. Truck costs are going up. There is a competitive environment out there, and
the intermodal business, as you know is historically competitive with truck, but we are seeing pressure on the costs for
truck providers and we've had pretty good results in the quarter in terms of our growth in intermodal pricing as you've
seen.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: So the recent move we've had, which I know has kind of bounced off of the bottom recently
on fuel, hasn't necessarily had much of an impact from a market share perspective?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We still see the strong opportunity for pricing out there. Certainly as you go through any period
of time, you might see a period of time where a trucker wants to price something on fuel, but that doesn't change our
strategy and we are continuing to drive our value proposition.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: So we have not seen much of an impact.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a little bit bigger picture as far as some headlines we
have seen recently about the potential for East Coast labor issues, I'm just wondering how much does that get involved
in conversations you have with customers as you are thinking about kind of the midsummer kind of late – early fall
type of peak discussions? Does it come up at all, people thinking about it?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Customers are thinking about it. We have not seen much of an impact to-date. Certainly if there
were an East Coast labor impact, customers were saying that they would use West Coast options but to-date, we haven't
seen much of an impact.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: And from a mutual commitment perspective, does that give you just a little bit more leverage
in those discussions or is that not yet kind of on the table?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: To-date we are not really seeing that being much of an impact.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Peter Nesvold of Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: I think most of my questions have been addressed. Maybe just a quick one on velocity. So,
velocity continues to improve here. Is there any way of thinking about that on an apples-to-apples basis? I suspect with
coal volumes down, that's going to help velocity all else equal. I guess what I'm trying to think about is as volumes start
coming back at some point, are you going to be able to hold the velocity gains that you are putting up right now as a
result of the capital projects or should we assume that some of that starts to revert to the mean again?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yes, so, the way to think about velocity – the way we look at velocity, we believe given the
profiles that we have got looking forward, we can maintain the kind of velocity we have got right now. Our capital
programs target where we have constraints in the network and so presuming we are effectively attacking those
constraints which we have been, those really won't get in the way too much.

What might be a risk to go-forward velocity is if growth happens in a rapid unexpected fashion somewhere where we're
highly constrained, that can be a negative. But even this year, we have shown that where we get a significant growth in
the South, where we are highly constrained, we have been able to manage through that largely and still put up good
numbers.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: If you are looking year over year, Peter, the one thing to remember is that last year, we were
hurt very badly by the drought in the South and the flooding situation in terms of our overall velocity. So,
year-over-year, our current operating environment is much more favorable.
<Q - H. Peter Nesvold>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. All of my questions have been answered, except for one. I just wanted to
touch in here on the peak season. I know one of your competitors in the East earlier this week talked about a little bit
more of a muted peak season and I think yours sort of was around that same line. I think you mentioned positive but
muted. I think that's where we were last year, I'm just curious as to whether that comment was relative to last year, or
are we looking at kind of the same thing as you saw last year?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I mean, when we talk about peak season, we typically talk rough numbers 10% to 12%
improvement in volumes for the peak season, vis-a-vis the period of time before the peak season. This year, to our
current outlook, it's probably 5% to 8% improvement in volumes, which will be muted from what we typically see, but
we think it will be a little stronger than what we have seen last year.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. That's great. Okay. That's my only question. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you. Questions around the shale business, I think in aggregate, we think about it as a
potential 400,000 carload business. Can you walk us through the length of haul dynamics in there? And I heard you say
crude was a shorter haul but I think frac sand is long. And then, right now, what's the mix of, say, unit train businesses
versus manifest?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay, Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: There's a variety of locations. There's a balance. There's some longer haul business, some short
haul business. As you know, a sizable position of our crude oil business is joint line business with the B in and the CP
out of the Bakken, so that has an impact. The crude oil business coming out of the Eagle Ford shale going to St. James,
that's a shorter distance. So there's a number of ins and outs in terms of length of haul, depending on where the business
is flowing from and where the sand business is flowing from.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay. And then unit train versus manifest?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: The vast majority of our crude oil business is unit train business. Historically, our sand business
has been manifest business but we are driving more unit train opportunities with the current volumes. I think our
current outlook in terms of the percent of unit trains in our sand business will be about 15%.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Okay. And then a follow-up, somewhat unrelated, but the intermodal peak you just
referenced, does the uptake in MCP smooth that peak? I'm just trying to separate what's happening in the economy
versus how the MCP might smooth your peak.

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, again as you recall the MCP, the intent of that was to smooth our year round volumes.
The peak driver really is market drivers and to the extent someone does not have an MCP agreement with us, they
would have to try to get boxes and service on a peak spot price basis.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Yeah, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. We talked a little bit about
labor inflation earlier on. Rob, could you give us an outlook for overall maybe inflation ex-fuel for the second half and
then through 2013, and then how much of that inflation you believe the company might be able to offset through a
continuation of its productivity enhancements?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, John, overall inflation, I would say is in the 2% to 3% range overall for us, which is
down, as you know from last year. And our going in position, we haven't finalized our 2013 numbers, but I can just tell
you this, that are going in position just as it is every year is to offset – we challenge ourselves to offset inflation with
productivity. And there's lumpiness in there and mix will play a role in that, but that's the way we approach it. And if
we get half of that, let's say, that's doing pretty good. And if you look historically, we've achieved about that half
offsetting inflation with productivity. But we'll go in with that kind of mindset.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thanks. That's great. And then as a follow-on, on the 4.5% core price improvement
year-over-year, if you backed out the impact of the legacy repricing that's taken place over the last 12 months, what
would the core pricing have been in that case?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: This is Rob again. Roughly a point and a half of the 4.5% was legacy, and, again, that was
held back because of the lack of volume in coal that we talked about. But rough numbers, I would say about 1.5 points
of that.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Just two questions. One on petroleum, one intermodal. For the petroleum business, it
ramped pretty substantially 28.8% to 55.2% on the carload side. Is that a good run rate number or are you guys still in
the process of bringing on more destinations and facilities? And where do you think that run rate will sort of level out
in the next six months?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We are in the process of bringing on more destinations and if a satellites
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: And can you give us a sense for how much more that will ramp? Obviously, the 92%
growth is probably a little high.

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, we're expecting additional growth, probably sequentially not be as high as the growth we
have seen but we are expecting additional growth.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Can you give us any kind of direction, like so, 20%, 30%, 50%?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: David, this is Rob. No is the answer to that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: All right. I just figured I would ask. And then for the intermodal business, the volume
decline, you seem to have sort of offset the prior weakness and the pricing on at least on a reported RPU number is
down. Are those things independent or have you guys taken the throttle off a little bit on pricing and intermodal to
offset some of that share loss?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I'm not sure I understand the question. Would you say it again?
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So the last couple of quarters, you have been getting double-digit RPU gains in
intermodal, and volume declines in intermodal. This quarter, you got a 3% gain in intermodal volume and a 6% gain in
intermodal RPU. Are those independent or have you guys taken the throttle off a little bit on pricing aspirations in
domestic intermodal?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, I think those are independent. I think if you look in the previous quarters, we basically were
able to renegotiate some legacy things and get fuel where we had not historically gotten fuel. So that's where you see
that. In terms of the volume improvement that you see this quarter, we think that that's really market related, driven.
We are still focused and maintaining our price strategy, and are excited about the results of that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So, market driven from a domestic or international standpoint?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: The international business has strengthened a little stronger than what we expected in our earlier
outlook, and our domestic business in terms of highway conversions are also going very strong.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Good morning. Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just a quick question on the fuel surcharge side. So fuel
surcharge increased coverage accounted for roughly 1% of revenue growth this quarter. I think it was also similar,
roughly 1% last quarter. How sustainable is this? So at what point will this start to tail off? What percentage of your
overall book of businesses do you currently assess fuel surcharge on?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay, Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Sal, you've probably heard me say that we are not going to sleep at night until we have
100% of our book of business with adequate fuel surcharge recovery mechanisms in place and we are not there yet. But
we did take a big step forward with the big legacy renewals that we talked about that were both at the end of 2011 and
early 2012, and that's what you are seeing the continuation of here in the second quarter. So I would not expect that
unless we lap these legacy renewals that you will see as big a step forward as you saw in the second quarter, but we
would expect it to still move directionally in the right direction because better not – we are not at 100% to where we
want to be.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: And also you said you start to lap that in the third quarter or is it the fourth quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: No, it would be the end of fourth quarter is when some of that started.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Okay. Understood. And then just if I could just revisit the labor cost side, it was very impressive
labor performance. So you are saying that the labor inflation for the second half should be about a point higher than it
was in the second quarter. So would it be fair to assume that your labor expense per employee would be down on a

year-over-year basis in the second half or flattish?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, we've got capital employees in there as well including the positive train control.
So, I mean, directional, I can't give an answer here but that's probably not directionally off, Sal.
<Q - Sal Vitale>: Okay. Thank you very much and then just the last question if I could. What are you currently paying
for fuel? What is your current fuel price?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Just slightly over $3 right now and going up. Slightly going up.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brad Delco of Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brad Delco>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, I guess this is for you. A little bit more on the
intermodal pricing. It seems as if IMCs are expecting or commented that pricing is a little bit weaker, and I thought
maybe I could get an update from you on how many boxes you have parked? What your expectations are in the back
half of the year and would you expect your domestic intermodal pricing to be maybe decelerating on a year-over-year
basis in the back half of the year versus what we saw last year?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I don't think we publicly talked about how many domestic boxes we have stored. We view
that as internal competitive information. We as you know are focused on price; we're focused on that value proposition
and we certainly understand the value of our services and that's where we are pricing them at. I can't speak to other
IMCs and others in terms of how they are pricing their services but we are pricing ours based on our value proposition
and our results in the quarter demonstrate that and we are not changing our strategy in the future.
<Q - Brad Delco>: Okay. Well, maybe, if I asked it another way, you would say your value proposition is as strong
this year as it was last year?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We are as highly confident of our value proposition. As you said, you have seen what some of
the IMCs have reported and what they have said. I would just say we have a strong belief in our value proposition and
if the business is not reinvestable, if the business we don't believe is supportive of our value proposition, we're okay not
getting every piece of business.
<Q - Brad Delco>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time.
