Thank you. Ms. Gutzler, you may begin your conference.
Robin Gutzler
Thank you, Rashira. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Charter's 2011 second quarter earnings call. This
morning, we issued a press release of over PR Newswire at 8 A.M. Eastern Time detailing our results. This information
is also posted on our website charter.com. The website also contains the presentation that accompanies today's
comments.
Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements
contained in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. We will not review those risk factors and other
cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.
Various remarks that we make in this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause

During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies.
In today's earnings release, we reported results in accordance with GAAP as well as pro forma results for 2010. The pro
forma results reflect the divestitures of cable systems in 2010 as if they had occurred on January 1, 2010, unless
otherwise noted. The year-over-year growth rate we'll be referring to you this morning are on a pro forma basis. Joining
me on today's call are Mike Lovett, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael J. Lovett
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with another quarter of solid adjusted EBITDA growth and
the substantial progress we have made on our strategic initiatives. Our adjusted EBITDA rose 4.8% to $673 million and
our margin improved a full percentage point to 37.6% versus last year on revenues of $1.8 billion. And while we
continue to make strategic investments in our business to set us up for long-term success, we generated $155 million of
free cash flow. We remain focused on improving the ways in which our customers interact with and perceive Charter.
We conducted a number of successful pilot programs, which I highlighted for you on our first quarter call, including
areas such as customer onboarding, technical issue resolution and CPE management, and we are rolling these initiatives
out across our footprint. Even prior to these pilots fully taking hold, we've seen a 5% decrease in billing and service
calls as well as an 8% lower service truck rolls compared to last year. We achieved the best second quarter and
year-to-date retention rates we have experienced since I joined Charter, and anecdotally in markets where we launched
these pilots, we're seeing an increase in the number of customer compliment letters.
We continue to leverage our internet superiority as the demand for fast and reliable connectivity grows. Nearly 95% of
our residential customers are on 12 meg or higher, which is double the fastest speed available from DSL, a fact that is
beginning to be recognized by our customers as well as IP content providers. We intend to maintain that advantage. As
of June, we had deployed DOCSIS 3.0 to 85% of our footprint and we expect to be essentially complete by the end of
the year. As we upgrade a particular market, we launch our 60 meg residential product and 50 and 100 meg coax
products for commercial customers. And similar to other cable operators in DOCSIS 3.0 markets, we have the
capability to offer speeds of more than 100 meg down the road as we see consumer interest.
Another strategic priority for us is to change the dynamic in our video business and to continue to provide innovative
solutions for our customers. As of the end of the quarter, 68% of our homes passed were switched digital video
enabled, allowing us to offer our customers more HD channels and additional VOD choices. At the end of the second
quarter, we averaged more than 60 HD channels across the footprint. While we're still in a bit of a catch up mode, we're
on track to achieve our 75 average HD channel target by year-end.
We also just announced new features that will be available for our customers such as HBO GO, BTN2Go, and a remote
record scheduling application. And we're strengthening our sports offering with NFL Network and their extremely
popular RedZone product in time for the 2011 season. We're slated to pilot the first phase of our Next Generation
television strategy later this year with the integrated TiVo Premiere Service, and will follow with soft launches to
virtually all markets in the early part of next year. And the investments we're making in our commercial business are
beginning to translate into strong financial results. Similar to the first quarter, we stepped up the commercial services
growth rate compared to last year and continue to have strong pipeline for future growth in small and medium business
segment as well as the carrier space.
I'm confident in our strategic direction, and I believe we're making the right investments for long-term sustained
growth. We're just beginning to see the benefits of some of these initiatives through higher customer service levels,
retention, and improved margin. However, it requires patience for the full benefits of these investments to show up in
our top line results. That being said, we have in place a number of tactics to boost top line growth and drive value
during this investment phase.

We've introduced a number of new products and packages to help maximize the value of our services and bundles for
both the higher end users as well as high credit risk households such as Charter Starter. We're focused on sales, both in
our service centers and in our direct response marketing mix. We'll continue to reinforce the strong quality and brand
messaging to consumers while layering on compelling price guarantee and bundled offers. The price increases
previously announced started to take effect in July. And we're also exploring some new non-traditional sales channels
to grow Internet and phone market share.
Now, for more specifics on the quarter. If you look at slide 5, on the residential side of the business, the growth in
internet customers and a modest increase in phone customers wasn't enough to offset the decline in video customers,
resulting in our residential PSUs declining by 54,800 in the quarter. When it comes to overall customer relationships,
we're making significant strides even in the soft economy. We saw a 74% improvement in reduced overall relationship
losses during the first half of 2011 compared to prior year, again reflecting the early benefits of our strategic
investments and focus on disciplined customer acquisition. We continue to focus on driving bundle and advanced
services penetration, and we saw a 2.6% increase in overall residential ARPU as a result.
In Video, similar to all areas of the residential business, we made significant strides in retention levels and took a
disciplined approach to customer acquisition, both through rate/volume balance and segment marketing. Second quarter
seasonality and a competitive marketplace for standalone video pricing, however, drove a lower rate of customer
acquisition, offsetting those higher retention levels, though housing starts and a soft economy clearly had an impact as
well.
Video customers were down 80,000, reflecting losses similar to prior year, disproportionally driven by video-only
analog customers. And we're providing increasingly attractive offers and incentives to this space to upsell into bundles
and digital. The number of advanced digital customers taking HD and/or DVR, and we continue to see a steady climb
in both our digital and advanced services penetration. Video ARPU rose 3.4% to $71.40. This is the area where we
most see the economy having an effect on revenue growth, both with a decline in rate of upgrade activity as well as
customers' rightsizing their packages whether it's taking lower digital tiers, premium channels or lower paid VOD
usage.
As you can see in the chart on slide 7, we continue to see growth in Internet and Phone customers. For the second time
in a row, our Internet service was ranked as the best performing ISP in the nation by Netflix in their quarterly rating.
And similar to our popular home networking solution, we recently added another enhancement, Charter Cloud Drive,
which allows our customers to safely and easily share and store data. We're successfully selling this to our existing
customers and we're seeing a 14% uptake with our new customers. As we've stated strategically, we are leading with
our strength in Internet and growing our non-Video customers at nearly double the rate of growth in last year's second
quarter.
Given our broadband performance advantage, we see a tremendous opportunity to get our foot in the door and form a
new customer relationships with approximately 7 million homes passed where we don't have a relationship today.
We've done two free speed upgrades in the past 18 months and we're seeing the benefits of improved customer
certification, better brand awareness and higher retention rates, which all support our long-term strategy. However, in
the near-term, as we expected, we're getting less ARPU lift from higher speed tier upgrades. Internet ARPU declined
1% versus last year. That expected ARPU drag was nearly offset by the lift from our home networking service. More
than 20% of our Internet customers now rely on us to be their solution provider in the home through our home
networking offer, with roughly a third of new customers taking this value-added service. Particularly driven by fewer
acquisition opportunities from movers in new housing, we saw a lower increase in the number of phone customers, but
we see room for further growth by bundling phone for existing customers, both video and non-video, and intend to get
more aggressive on that front.
Moving to the ad sales business, revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by growth in the automotive and retail sectors,
and through the rollout of EBIF standard, we are well positioned to take advantage of interactive advertising streams as
they develop.

An area we are very pleased with is the progress in Commercial Services. Charter business revenues increased 17.5%
in the second quarter, and with an $8.5 billion market, we see opportunity for further growth. We increased commercial
PSUs by more than 8% compared to last year's second quarter, with 22% growth in internet and phone customers.
Revenues from carrier customers, which aren't included in PSUs, nearly doubled. In July, the number of cell towers
sites we serve surpassed the 1,000 milestone. In addition, we currently have more than 650 towers under contract and
scheduled for installation by the end of the year, and the sales pipeline remains quite robust. We're continuing to invest
to enhance and expand the solutions and services we provide to this largely untapped market. Our commercial
customers are benefiting from the strategic investments we're making such as DOCSIS 3.0, and we're seeing the results.
In addition, our Phone Plus product, providing such features as enhanced voice mail options, simultaneous rings, auto
attendant and more, is now fully deployed and we're seeing nice uptake there as well. I'll now turn it over to Chris to
walk through the financials.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Looking at slide 9, in the second quarter we continued to grow our high
margin internet, phone and commercial products with 2.2% revenue growth over the prior year. And while as Mike
indicated, we've already implemented a number of top line tactics for the second half of the year, our principal focus is
on making the investments and executing on our strategic initiatives to position ourselves for long-term growth.
Video revenue was down 2% in Q2 due to customer loses, partially offset by growth in advanced services. Notably, we
also saw a decrease in revenue per user from pay VOD and premiums, which highlights both the customer economic
rightsizing Mike mentioned as well as the potential benefits from an improved video platform, with SDV investment
driving increased linear HD and on demand content and an enhanced user interface and search engine via the integrated
TiVo Premier box.
Taking a look at our total revenue base, we continue to see diversification with video now representing only half of our
total sales, and with our video customers digital penetration now stands at 77% with 56% taking HD and/or DVR.
Internet rose 5% year-on-year with penetration reaching over 29%. The key highlight here is that 65% of our video
customers use our internet, but we have only 9% penetration of our non-video households so far, which is still nearly a
20% increase year-over-year. Phone revenue increased just under 4% with triple-play penetration continuing to climb
and we're implementing a number of tactics to drive higher attach rates in both video and non-video households as
Mike mentioned. In the past year, we've spoken quite a bit about disciplined acquisition contributing to margin
expansion. That discipline has improved customer retention rates by 8%, driving significant efficiency, not only in the
P&L, but also in capital expenditures.
What disciplined acquisition really means is not chasing volume with lower rate on a standalone basis and avoiding
direct marketing and selling into segments of the population, which have formed a large percentage of our connects in
the past, but a disproportionate percentage of our service cost and churn.
Unfortunately, most of our rate acquisition discipline has been offset by customer right sizing of their packages, either
through premium usage or at off or roll off, both of which we see as a cyclical effect. But we will begin to more
actively market to the higher credit risk segment again in the third quarter with a Lite version of our triple play offering
Charter Starter as Mike mentioned. We believe a more suitable product can better service this segment without really
pushing the discipline that benefits our bottom line today.
Our commercial business continued to demonstrate real momentum. Revenues increased a healthy 17.5% during the
quarter, led by higher sales to small and medium businesses and carrier customers. Keep in mind that our commercial
segment includes approximately $43 million of video revenues in the quarter, primarily from MDUs and hospitality. So
by excluding that revenue, we're still early on in the commercial space, where growth in internet, telephone and carrier
is actually 28% year-on-year.

For advertising, in addition to growth from automotive and retail, the increase in advertising sales also benefited from a
$3 million change in the way we account for certain revenues, now reflecting them on a gross basis and thus increasing
both revenues and expenses by the same amount. We do expect to see the return of the Japanese automotive segment as
their inventory returns post tsunami, though keep in mind we benefited quite a bit in the second half of 2010 from a
strong political year.
Moving on to costs and adjusted EBITDA, I'd like to provide some color on the key factors driving the 4.8% EBITDA
growth and a 100 basis point improvement in margin. Total operating costs and expenses increased less than 1% as
higher programming costs were nearly offset by reductions in other operating cost. And we're definitely seeing the
results of our disciplined acquisition and retention strategy, and early benefits from simplifying and enhancing the
customer experience as evidenced by fewer truck rolls, lower call volume offsetting programming increases.
Programming costs rose 3.5% as contractual increases were partially offset by customer losses. And as we look to the
rest of 2011, we do not expect programming cost pressures to abate. Marketing expenses were down $6 million
year-over-year from a $7 million favorable adjustment for expenses associated with prior year marketing campaigns
offset by higher spend on product and brand focused marketing.
As operating improvements allowed us to fund growth areas like commercial, we were able to hold labor costs
essentially flat year-over-year, and we saw continued improvement in bad debt with a 14% or $6 million reduction
compared to the year-ago quarter. In total, adjusted EBITDA grew 4.8% to $673 million for the second quarter with a
margin of 37.6%. And excluding the marketing expense adjustment and storm related negative impacts of $3 million,
second quarter EBITDA growth could have been 4.2% with a margin of 37.4%.
Let's move on to CapEx on slide 11. Capital expenditures from Q2 totaled $324 million or 18% of revenue. This was
$15 million lower than 2010 due to the timing of strategic investments and bandwidth initiatives, partially offset by $9
million of incremental capital due to the well-publicized tornados in Q2. Commercial CapEx increased by 32% to $45
million in the quarter primarily due to line extension and construction as we've invested for revenue growth both within
the quarter as well second half installs.
Our overall growth-oriented capital expenditures continue to be approximately 75% of our total spend. And our
estimate for total year 2011 CapEx remains approximately at approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.
Although we saw growth in adjusted EBITDA and revenue, net loss increased $25 million on prior year from higher
interest expense as we continued to extend our debt maturities, $19 million higher loss on extinguishing of the debt,
which is non-cash, and an increase in depreciation and amortization. Our income tax expense for Q2 was driven by a
$78 million increase of deferred tax liabilities. And as a reminder, our taxes are predominantly non-cash due to our $10
billion tax basis and $6.9 billion loss carry forward position at the end of last year, and we do not expect to be a
significant cash taxpayer until after 2017. Cash tax payments for Q2 and year-to-date were $3 million and $5 million
respectively, reflecting certain state income taxes.
We generated free cash flow for the sixth consecutive quarter, shown on slide 13. Free cash flow for the second quarter
of 2011 was $155 million compared to $125 million in 2010, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower CapEx,
partially offset by higher cash interest payments. In looking at our capital structure and free cash flow, we remain
comfortable with our liquidity, our maturity profile and our leverage target. And as of June 30, 2011, our net leverage
was 4.7 times, and our leverage target remains 4 to 4.5 times, and we're comfortable plus or minus a half turn either
way to enable strategic opportunities.
On the M&A front, we continue to evaluate opportunities and remain disciplined in using quantitative and qualitative
filters for both acquisitions and divestitures. We currently have signed acquisitions totaling some 40,000 basic
customers or 70,000 PSUs, primarily in the Windjammer acquisition, which closed yesterday, and the previously
announced US Cable transaction, which we expect to close in Q3. We also signed a few non-core divestitures for about
8,000 basic customers.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.

Michael J. Lovett
Thanks, Chris. I'm pleased with the progress we've made in implementing our disciplined operating approach and
executing on all our strategic priorities. I feel good about the strength of our business and remain confident that we're
on the right path to unlock the growth potential that exists inside Charter to build value for our shareholders.
Thank you. Operator, we're ready for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a question on Charter's Starter package for data and
video. Is that something you just launched? What's the price, relatively speaking, relative to your existing offers? And
do you view that more as a save tool or are you out aggressively marketing? And I have a follow-up.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, Jeff, we haven't launched yet. We're in the process of launching Charter Starter, and
the goal is really to drive connects from the high credit risk segments. And as we've talked over the last several
quarters, we suppressed marketing to those higher credit risk segments. And I'll give you a few stats here to help better
understand why. We looked historically at those segments and were very focused on customer lifetime value, as you're
well aware. 70% of those households were gone within nine months, and a significant number of them were gone
through non-pay disconnects. This segment was financially upside down for us. So we didn't want to market until we
had a product that would be successful there. As we mentioned, we suppressed the direct marketing there for the last
three quarters. For competitive reasons, we're not going to share a lot of details on this. We'll have more to share
probably as we end Q3 and have some returns on the marketing of this market, but we want to make sure that it limits
the ability for customers to tap into higher cost elements until they establish a creditworthy relationship with us. The
fact that 70% of them were gone within nine months tells us that 30% of those households still have an opportunity to
be a creditworthy customer with Charter. We just want to make sure that we're able to monitor that segment and move
them into a creditworthy status and then upgrade them into products over time.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Is that data package, is that going to be usage based? I think you discussed that last
quarter, potentially.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: No. At this time, it won't be usage based.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Okay. Cablevision and Comcast have been quite successful with implementing new brand
name strategies. Is that something you might consider?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, we're looking at it. We actually, when we emerged from our restructuring, we took a
look at brand shift, and what we've been doing over the last three quarters is investing fairly heavily with our marketing
media mix in refreshing the Charter brand. I think there is an opportunity, somewhat similar to a Charter Starter, to use
sub branding within products and packages.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Okay. And then one last quick one. What was the storm effect on your video sub loss? I'm
sorry if I missed that. Or if there was a significant video sub loss as a result of the storms?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: There were. There were I'll call it a few thousand customers who literally came off the
network for a period of time. What we said in terms of the financial impact is that to the P&L inside the quarter, both
from an operating expense as well as a revenue standpoint, it was about $3 million inside the quarter. And from a
capital standpoint and you see that show up in the support line in capital, it's $9 million, effectively for a plant rebuild
of a trunk and distribution, as these storms had passed through particularly Alabama, Georgia, but also to a lesser extent
Tennessee and a bit in New England.

<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: All right, thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Jason Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. First of all, I was
hoping if you can give us a little bit of a preview into the trend so far in the third quarter? I know you have a lot of new
initiatives coming out and just wanted to see if you have any early indication in terms of what the volume trends look
like so far in the third quarter?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, from a trend standpoint, we mentioned last quarter the price increases that we're
implementing. Maybe Chris can give a little bit of detail on those.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. So we've taken some very targeted price increases across different portions of
our customer base. Those include a modem rental fee increase from $5 to $7 for cable modem customers not in price
guarantee and not taking home networking. It also includes a basic rate increase for our analog customers, which
pushes the pricing of analog much closer to our digital tier, obviously an incentive to go more digital. And we've also
taken an increase on our sports tier from $5 to $10 as well as the rolling increase through some of the existing customer
base for some of the premium price increases we took earlier in the new year – earlier in this year that will roll out for
the existing customers. Really all of those price increases roll out sequentially through the quarter in Q3, so you
certainly won't see the full impact of either the revenue increase or the churn related to that until the end of Q3 on a run
rate basis. And again to just reiterate, customers that are inside an existing price guarantee, will not be affected inside
for those rate increases until they hit a roll off of their existing price guarantee.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: So, and Jason, on the volume side, I touched on a number of the tactics that we're
implementing relative to pricing and packaging. It's a little early to see any type of trends, and you know that July has
continued to be a seasonally soft month as well. Probably one thing to touch on though is the shift in medium mix.
Over the last two quarters, historically Charter spent 100% of our media on direct response marketing, for a lot of
obvious reasons. Over the last two quarters, we've shifted to more brand focus, and there is a lifetime value benefit, but
you don't see that benefit for several quarters. And one of the things that impacted us, and frankly it was a bigger
negative impact than we had initially anticipated, was the decrease in volume, incoming acquisition volume, because of
that shift to more brand oriented direct media mix.
We'll be dialing up a more balanced approach in Q3 and Q4 of this year, still focusing on brand. We think strategically
that's the right thing to do. Certainly, the results that we're seeing from a customer satisfaction standpoint are exceeding
our expectations, and that promoter scores are increasing, customer sat scores are increasing, and obviously having the
best retention in any quarter that I've seen since I've been with the company. All very positive signs that our strategic
investments are getting traction, but we'll balance that a little bit more with direct response marketing in Q3 and Q4.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Got it. Thank you and just a question on data ARPU. I think that data net adds were sort of the
bright spot in the quarter relative to some of the other products, but ARPU for data turned negative year-over-year for
the second quarter in a row. Is that a function of the existing customers actively trading down to lower price tiers
because they want to save money or is it more of new gross adds coming in at a cheaper tiers because the incremental
new subscriber may be more price sensitive than your existing base?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: No, the real driver here is the – again, it goes back to the strategic approach that we're taking
from a customer sat standpoint. In the last 12 months, we've upgraded our speed tiers. We've doubled the speed tiers for
free for our existing customer base. So you see a slower increase of upgrades into higher speed tiers because they're
getting an incremental speed at no additional cost, and that was not a surprise to us. But again, looking at probably the
best example I have here is looking at net promoter scores. Those customers that we surveyed that recognized that they
got a free speed increase moved 37% up on net promoter score. So again, customer lifetime value benefit is not
insignificant.

<Q - Jason K. Kim>: Understood. I'm sorry, just one quick follow-up. On the $7 million, the marketing, the favorable
adjustment, you mentioned that's a one-time item that's only for second quarter, right? That doesn't impact second half
of the year.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: That's correct.
<Q - Jason K. Kim>: All right. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks. Good morning. Chris, just a couple of things in the back half as we think about
cost and actually ARPU as well. It sounds like you'll be dialing up marketing a bit, I'm just trying to parse the words,
Mike's words from just a few minutes ago about the mix between direct and brand. And also programming costs, I
realize you said they wouldn't abate, but the growth on a per sub basis, I think it's been about 9% to 10% in the first
half, any expectations that that's going to materially change higher or lower in the back half. I'm just thinking in the
context of the margin expansion we saw. And then just lastly on ARPU, can we look at the price increases that you've
put in and assume that ARPU growth will accelerate in the back half from Q2? Those are my questions.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Okay. I think just technically, given the adjustment that we had in marketing inside
the second quarter, it would stand to reason that you're going to see an uplift in marketing expense in subsequent
quarters because you won't have that benefit rolling through. I think what Mike was more talking about. I'm not giving
guidance here on marketing expense generally, but what I would say, Mike is talking about shifting some of the above
the line or more advertising or brand-related media spend more towards direct response. And so the point there is less
about overall spend and much more about the mix in terms of going direct response versus brand.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: And Ben, maybe a little more color on that, to add some clarity. If you think about the mix,
if we have 40% of our media spots, brand-specific moving a mix to more direct response of that 40%, maybe you cut
that down to 20. And then also getting a little granular here, but if you think of a 30-second spot, how many seconds of
that spot are oriented to brand and how many seconds of that spot are oriented towards offer, and triggering the phones
to ring. And those are the shifts that we're making in the second half of the year. Again, we feel very good, and if I was
given the opportunity to do this again, I'd make the same decision because strategically it's gaining traction above and
beyond what we expected, but it's the balance of the mix. And really where we saw the impact was more on our phone
units as opposed to any other were – in the business. It was really a negative impact that caught us a bit by surprise on
phone.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah. And the final thing on marketing is we've always given so much of it as
variable cost per order. To a certain extent, we hope we are spending more marketing on acquisition. On programming
costs for the second half of the year, we said we don't expect those programming costs to abate, some of that is just the
natural effect of the same contractual increases rolling through. You also have a trend that takes place when you have
increased digitization with a different mix in terms of your gross margin, that's driving those higher direct costs on
programming as well as, as we mentioned, some of the premium business being a little bit challenged, and that happens
at the expense of content on a relative basis.
On ARPU, I think the challenges are the one that we've highlighted. So effectively customers trying to right size their
packages, we don't see that trend as it relates to the economy changing dramatically. On the other hand, you'll see some
of the price increases rolling through. And given that we are going to reopen targeting that higher credit risk segment
with some more suitable product related to them, I think there's a variety of different factors that are going to drive
ARPU. So, again to highlight, the economic pressures are not subsiding. We will have a rate increase to offset. And in
addition to that, rolling out Charter Starter is going to be with the Lite product set across the triple play. So you could
see those factors driving ARPU shifts.

<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Great, and maybe if I just follow-up, Mike, on the data product, I look at your broadband
penetration of in the past of around 29% at the end of the quarter. My guess is you're probably at 50% or so market
share on high-speed data in your footprint residential. I don't know if you would agree with that rough number. I'm just
trying to think about as you roll out DOCSIS 3.0, where is the opportunity in the data business? Do you think it's
ARPU related? Do you think it's market share related? You've talked a lot about non-video sub penetration, and how do
you make it obvious to the customer that selling data – that taking cable data with DirecTV, for example, is a smart
decision versus the DSL product? And I ask that in the context of your peers often sell broadband standalone at a pretty
big premium to the bundled price, so actually kind of going the other way, which is dis-incenting that decision. I'm
wondering what your thoughts are on all that?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah. First of all, I would agree that your percentage of market share is roughly in the
ballpark with what we see. We look at this a little differently. I think continued ARPU growth on the tier side of things
– it's got to be driven by customer selection. So it's selection into home networking, it's selection into Charter Cloud,
it's selection into higher speed tiers. I think that's going to be the ARPU driver, not rate. And we eliminated the
incremental fee for being a standalone internet customer with us because we did see that as a barrier and we really look
at this as share play. We've got a superior product and we expect to leverage that.
You touch on selling against DirecTV. I'll share a little bit with you about what we're doing with regards to
nontraditional sales channels. We formed a partnership with DISH, and we've been running pilots and selling our voice
and our data product into DISH households, and both parties are extremely pleased with the results, and we're
expanding that relationship. We've done direct mail pieces in A/B testing with DISH. And this is where you have a
Charter envelope and then you have a DISH envelope with the Charter offer inside of it. The response rate, as you can
imagine because they have a relationship with that provider today, is extremely favorable relative to a Charter direct
mail piece.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: That's interesting. Thanks a lot.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from David Joyce with Miller Tabak & Co.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Thank you. If you could just provide some more color on what's going on competitively as we
think about the fear of over the top usage by your customers. At first blush, it might seem to be putting the cart before
the horse in terms of raising the speeds for your customers whereas we're – a lot of investors are looking for usage
based building on what that's going to do to improve ARPU. So, we're there competitive reasons in some of your
markets that necessitated the price increases as a means to try to migrate people up from DSL more quickly?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: David, did you mean the speed increases?
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Yes.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, the speed increases were twofold strategically, one was to drive additional satisfaction
and loyalty with our existing base by giving them something for nothing. And frankly, the response rates there, as I
mentioned, from a net promoter score standpoint are significantly positive. The other is to really drive home the fact
that we've got a far superior product relative to DSL. And I think customers that are experiencing video streaming are
seeing the real advantages of having true high-speed associated with Charter. And I think the fact that Netflix has
highlighted us as being the highest performing ISP for two quarters in a row is not insignificant. And we view that as
bringing quality and value to our customer base.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Thanks. And if I could on the video side, with the loss of a lot of video only customers, as
they're exiting, have you been able to determine are they tending to head towards satellite or towards the telco
providers?

<A - Michael J. Lovett>: I think it's a bit of both. We saw a significant increase in Q2 media spend from the AT&T
folks, roughly a 7-to-1 ratio of spend in the markets that we're in today. And so we saw an increase in media spend and
very aggressive video offers. We also saw very aggressive video offers from the satellite players.
<Q - David C. Joyce>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Thanks. I just had a few questions. I guess, first, can you talk about what proportion of your
base is on the sports tier and therefore seeing that $5 rate increase on the sports package? Secondly, what has the
impact of eliminating that unbundled broadband fee been on broadband ARPU? And once you annualize that change in
the fourth quarter, should residential ARPU – data ARPU then start to improve? And then lastly, how long do you think
it will take for your team to reach that point where your video product is, where you think it needs to be competitively?
Thank you.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Regarding the sports tier, we don't disclose the percentage of customers that we have within
our tier structure, but we do anticipate with the signing of NFL Network and launching the BTN2Go that we're going to
drive additional satisfaction with our existing base, but also have great hopes that we'll be upgrading customers into
that sports tier. Do you want to take the ARPU, Chris?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yeah, on the ARPU, on the unbundling of, having that effective penalty fee for not
taking a bundled video offering, that was done some time ago. So really, at least a year ago before my time. So I think
Mike was highlighting that the strategy for us has been different. We've been focused on this non-video household
segment for some time, and that we're looking at these alterative sales channels as a way to further get into customers
thinking that even if they don't have our video product today, it's okay, and it's possible to take internet with us without
an additional fee.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: On the video side, obviously with the TiVo launch later this year, then the soft launch across
the enterprise early in 2012, we feel like that's going to close the gap significantly relative to our video product and
really access to our On Demand library having a user interface that makes it easy to access, I think is really a game
changer relative to the video product. That along with our deployment of Switched Digital Video that allows us to add
additional linear HD channels as well as additional HD VOD opportunities, I think really helps close the gap. So I think
2012 is going to be a bit of a shift for Charter relative to the video product.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Has the Whole Home DVR expanded beyond the three to four markets? Or is it still – yeah.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yes, we're launching in Q3 into the entire enterprise.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Okay, and when will the TiVo interface be available for Whole Home DVR? Is that next year
or is that longer term?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: That will be next year.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Okay, great, thank you.

curious what your current thinking is on that front as you get into another target zone for leverage? And I acknowledge
that you need to tweak some covenants in order to really get going on that. And then I'll have a follow-up.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Okay. Look, our thinking hasn't really changed. Today, we're sitting at 4.7 net
leverage. We've got a stated leverage target of being in the 4 to 4.5 times range. And again, to just make it really clear,
we're comfortable plus or minus and that really means plus or minus a half of turn either direction to enable strategic
activity. So as it stands today, there's no pressing need because we're not inside that target leverage range. And the way
that we're going to think about excess cash, if you will, once you're inside that target leverage range is, one, the pending
organic opportunities for investment inside the business; two, the strategic opportunities that may exist through M&A.
And then to the extent that neither of those exist in a way that is more attractive than for example buying back your
own shares, then you take a look at the use of any additional capital against either share buybacks, security buybacks
including, or dividends as well. So that's the way that we've been thinking about it, it hasn't really changed and we're
sitting at that 4.7 times leverage today, so there's no real pressing need at this stage.
<Q - Michael V. Pace>: And that's a good segue into my follow-up for Mike or Chris. But in terms of M&A, it clearly
feels like it's at least a little more robust and has been in the last couple of years. I guess, what are the key logjams to
the larger deals getting yanked, in your opinion, and maybe away from the obvious bid/ask spread. But is it the local
competitiveness in those markets, commercial opportunities or sharing of synergies, I guess what are the key focus
points for those discussions?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Well, I guess, maybe it'd be better to step back and kind of frame how we look at things
relative to M&A and then we can talk a little bit about what we view as some of the logjams, to your point. So we've
evaluated opportunities both on the acquisition and divestiture side through a set of strategic filters. For example, what
it does to our footprint or the capabilities. And that gets to some of the points that you made, Mike, relative to looking
at an opportunity or a divesture. We also look at it from a quantitative filter standpoint, and they include a relative
comparison to buying back our own stock for acquisitions or selling our own stock for divestures. In both cases, we
take into the analysis the relative synergies, again getting to some of the things that you're talking about, or the
potential dis-synergies for a divesture, and forecasted FCF growth relative to our own business plan. The key here from
a Charter perspective, and I doubt that our peers think about this any differently is, we'll continue to be extremely
disciplined when it comes to looking at any type of M&A, and I'm not just talking about cable assets. We're looking
beyond cable assets as well.
<Q - Michael V. Pace>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from [ph] Amy Young with McGuire (41:08).
<Q - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. CapEx seemed to be lighter than expected. Do you
think it will come in at the lower end of your guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, and should we expect free cash
flow to grow at the same pace in the back half of the year? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So I think, look, the guidance remains at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. The drivers for
the lower CapEx inside Q2 really were timing of some of those strategic bandwidth initiatives, and so we saw a
significant impact. You can see that it's most pronounced when you take a look at Q2 on Q2 of last year. So you see in
that scalable infrastructure category some real seasonality depending on when we were investing in some of those
strategic bandwidth initiatives. What we've done inside this year is to time those investments a little bit different
outside the summer periods. And so that's why you see some of the seasonality drop there. So the guidance hasn't
changed. We've got some seasonality there. And you did see a strong uptick inside of Commercial. And given the fact
that it's almost entirely success-based capital expenditure, we certainly hope that is sustained and increases in fact. So I
think that's a little bit of the color I'd give there. The last one is just to highlight that in spite of a lighter quarter for
CapEx inside Q2, in addition to that, we had the $9 million that was inside there, inside the support category for the
tornado CapEx. So that was your question as it related to CapEx.

On free cash flow, again we're not providing guidance for the second half of the year. I think a lot of people have their
own view as to what's going to happen with EBITDA and CapEx. We've also stated in the past that we tend to be
working capital neutral and inside of a particular year. We did have the one-time effect coming into this year of having
a – the one-time effect of having a negative AP, a negative cash balance driving a higher AP. It was a one-time kind of
$30 million working capital impact inside Q1. And so it remains to be seen if we make that up through the entire course
of the year. The other one then that people are obviously running into their models is the higher run rate interest
expense as it relates to extending maturities of our debt profile.
<Q>: Okay, thanks.

Your next question comes from Lance Vitanza with CRT Capital.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thanks for taking the call, guys. It's nice to see you adding HBO GO, NFL Networks, and
NFL RedZone. Is there much incremental cost associated with those programs?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Look, there of course there's incremental cost associated with some of those
programming contracts. What we've been trying to do in terms of our strategy is when we've taken rate increases, it's to
be able to add additional content in there to support those rate increases that we had already announced a couple
months ago. And so when you think about the additional content costs coming through, you should also keep in mind
that that sports tier is going from $5 to $10. And so certainly it'd be partially offset there.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Okay, great. And then just lastly I did notice that the diluted share count, it looks like it was
about 4 million shares lower this quarter. Can you remind me what's going on there?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, the outstanding shares have been at a roughly 114 million plus some decimal
points, I don't have in front of me right now. But we had done the 4.5 million share buyback from Franklin, and so that
was reducing the amount of outstanding shares because the company continues to hold those 4.5 million shares as
treasury stock. And then you take that 110 million shares outstanding, you'd add back to that the treasury equity method
relating to the warrants and the options and the RSUs that are outstanding today.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Any plans though for the Franklin shares going forward that you can disclose at this time?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: No. Look, I think the fact is that there's no negative tax impact to us holding onto
their shares, it's something that we're going to give some consideration to, we just hasn't made a formal decision as to
what we're going to do it from there. I think the lot of questions that have come to us over the past quarter or so has
been is there any sinister plan? There is not at this stage, so.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from Richard Greenfield with BTIG.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Hi, a couple questions. One, you've commented on the fact that Charter is now offering
their entire sub base 16 megabits of downstream bandwidth. Curious when you look across your – the average
subscriber in terms of the competition, what do you think your average competition is? I mean I realize you have some
premium products, but on average, what do you think the average tier is that you're competing against from the
RBOCs? And then two, you've done deals now with HBO GO where you're letting them authenticate Charter service

on HBO servers, curious how you feel about FOX doing it as well as Hulu, particularly whether an aggregator like
Hulu, whether you have any issues with aggregated authentication going forward? Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So on the internet speed tiers, I would, it's not quite 16, it's 12 megabits per second.
So 95% of our customer base is at 12 megabits per second or higher. Included inside of that is predominantly the 12
meg product, but a fairly high amount that's sitting at 18 as well, and then a lower portion on the 25 and 60 meg
products as those represent some of the more premium tiers. What we compete against predominantly in the market, if
you take a look at our competitive overlap, which is somewhere between 31% and 34% of AT&T and FiOS overlap.
Predominantly on the DSL side, we're hitting against 3 meg product at $14.95 and 6 meg product as well. And then on
the U-Verse and FiOS side, everybody's aware of the products that they're offering there. But we see more competing
against 6 megs, which is one of the reasons that being at 12 megs and above for all of our 95% customers, we believe is
the right thing to do in spite of some of the ARPU pressure that Mike mentioned.
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: From an authentication standpoint, clearly, with all of our upcoming programming
negotiations we're looking to get authentication, keeping a keen eye on kind of integrated authentication, I really don't
have a strong opinion on supporting it today, but I think there, depending on how their business structure would be put
together, I think there's an opportunity there. But our preference would be to work with our programming partners
directly and get authentication into all of our agreements.
<Q - Richard Greenfield>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from [indiscernible] (47:50).
<Q>: Hey, thank you, guys, for taking my question. How do you think Charter Starter will influence service costs as
we look ahead? There were 8% lower truck rolls during the quarter. Are you going to do this in such a way as to be
more cost efficient than perhaps you were in the past?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: Yeah, that's absolutely the case to make sure we're getting the right customers in the door
from those higher credit risk segments. And that plays out favorably not only from a programming and lifetime value
standpoint and on the revenue side, but probably as importantly and possibly even more so on the OpEx side, as you
see in evidence in our decline in calls into the billing and service centers as well as our service truck rolls.
<Q>: And just a follow-up on the TiVo, could you just restate what milestone is going to occur in the second half of
the year with that implementation?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: So we'll have pilot markets in the later part of this year and then we'll be doing soft launches
in the early part of 2012.
<Q>: And the pilot markets will be TiVo boxes and then as we roll on we'll get the full integration of the software, is
that how it's going to go?
<A - Michael J. Lovett>: The pilot markets will have the integration as we deploy.
