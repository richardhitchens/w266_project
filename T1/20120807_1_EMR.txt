I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Third quarter
sales increased 3% to $6.5 billion, underlying sales growing 6% as robust growth in Process Management was driven
by strong energy end markets and recovery of sales deferred from the Thailand flooding and supply chain disruption.
The strong U.S. dollar, particularly against the euro, reduced growth by 3%.
Gross profit margin improved 80 basis points from the prior year to a record of 40.5%. Operating profit margin of
19.9% increased 180 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from strong sequential operating profit leverage of
55%. Earnings per share of $1.04 increased 16% from the prior year achieving a record for the third quarter.
Today, Emerson's Board of Directors approved the fourth quarter dividend payment, completing 56 consecutive years
of dividend increases. Our third quarter reflected solid results with strong operational execution despite slowing of the
global economy.
Next slide P&L summary. Again, net sales increased 3%. And underlying sales grew 6% with mixed demand among
end markets and regions. Operating profit margin of 19.9% improved 180 basis points from the prior year, benefiting
from strong volumes leverage, cost reduction benefits, and recovery of Process Management sales and profit from the
Thailand flooding. Earnings growth of 13%, along with the repurchase of 4.4 million shares drove an EPS increase of
16%.
Next slide, underlying sales by geography. Underlying sales in the U.S. grew 6%, Europe was flat, Asia grew 9%, Latin
America grew 19%, Canada grew 10% and Middle East and Africa grew 5%. Total underlying sales grew 6%; currency
translation deducted 3% with net sales increasing 3%.
Moving to slide 5 profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 40.5% improved 80 basis points and achieved a record
level. Lower SG&A as a percent of sales drove further margin improvement as operating profit margin expanded 180
basis points. Other deductions was essentially flat as higher restructuring of $14 million in currency, transaction losses
of $11 million were offset by payments received related to dumping duties of $37 million under the U.S. Continued
Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. Pre-tax margin reflected an increase of 200 basis points.
Next slide, cash flow. Operating cash flow decreased 6% as strong earnings were offset by higher receivables related to
sales timing. Free cash flow was essentially flat to prior year with strong conversion from earnings at 90%. Trade
working capital as a percent of sales was even to prior year benefiting from strong inventory performance.
Moving to slide 7, business segment earnings. Business segment margin of 18.5% includes 160 basis point reflecting
strong volume leverage and cost reduction benefit, as well as the dumping duty payments received mentioned earlier.
Corporate expense declined $14 million primarily due to lower stock compensation expanse and interest expense
decreased 8%.
Moving to slide 8, Process Management results. Process Management net sales grew 19% and underlying sales grew
23%, as currency translation deducted 4%. By region, U.S. was up 29%, Asia up 25%, Europe up 14%, Latin America
up 33% and Middle East and Africa up 13%. Robust investment in oil and gas, chemical and power industries drove
growth in all businesses and geographies. Sales benefited from approximately $130 million of converted backlog
related to the Thailand flooding supply chain disruption.
Segment margin of 23.1% improved 270 basis points, primarily driven by volume leverage and cost reduction benefits.
Year-to-date underlying orders have grown 17% with the U.S. up over 20%, which has driven backlog of 15% from the
prior year. Continued energy end market strength and the high backlog support a strong outlook for the next several
quarters.
Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net sales decreased 1%, but excluding currency translation
grew 3% with the U.S. up 12%, Asia flat, Europe down 4%, Latin America up 9%, and Middle East and Africa down
1%. Strong growth in the power generating alternators, hermetic motors, and ultrasonic welding businesses was offset
by decreases in the fluid automation and motors and drives businesses primarily due to European weakness.
Segment margin of 18.8% improved 220 basis points, which benefited from the dumping duty payments, as well as
cost reduction benefits that offset material inflation, unfavorable product mix and higher restructuring expense. We

expect the European fiscal crisis and euro weakness to remain a challenge in the near term.
Next slide, Network Power. Network Power net sales declined 6% and underlying sales decreased 4%, as currency
translation deducted 3% of growth and acquisitions added 1%. By geography, U.S. was down 14%, Asia up 6%,
Europe down 7%, Latin America up 16%, and Middle East and Africa down 6%.
Global telecommunications and IT end markets remained weak, particularly in the U.S. The Asia growth benefited
from the NBN project in Australia, while Europe economic conditions were challenging. Product line rationalization
continued in embedded computing and power, deducting approximately $30 million from sales.
Segment margin of 10.3% declined 10 basis points from the prior year as volume deleverage, unfavorable product mix
and higher restructuring were partially offset by cost reduction benefit and materials cost decreases.
Profit margin improved in the network power systems business from the prior year quarter. And sequential margin
improvement continued in the embedded computing and power business. We expect the aggressive restructuring over
the past year to continue to generate incremental cost savings and profitability improvement.
Moving to slide 11, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies' net sales decreased 2% and underlying sales declined
1% with currency translation deducting 2% and acquisitions adding 1%. By region, the U.S. was up 1%, Asia down
5%, Europe down 12%, Latin America up 9% and Middle East and Africa down 14%.
U.S. market improved, but channel conditions were mixed with strong growth in residential and commercial offsetting
weakness in service. China improved as well, but remained negative, although rest of Asia was flat and economic
conditions remain a challenge in Europe.
Segment margin of 20.2% improved to 60 basis points despite the sales decrease, benefiting from cost containment and
mix. We shipped our 100 millionth scroll compressor in the quarter and we're showing a broad global installed base.
U.S. and China markets should improve at a modest pace, but weakness in Europe will continue.
Next slide, Commercial & Residential Solutions. Commercial & Residential Solutions' net sales grew 2% and
underlying sales grew 7%, as the heating products business divested in 2011 deducted 4% and currency translation
deducted 1%. By geography, U.S. was up 4%, Asia up 11%, Europe down 1%, Latin America up 5%, and Middle East
and Africa up 58%. Steady demand in the U.S. commercial construction markets continued.
Segment margin of 20.4% improved 20 basis points, as cost reduction benefits drove solid margin improvement. We
expect U.S. construction end markets to remain stable through 2012.
Moving to slide 13, the outlook. The strong third quarter results keep us on track for a solid 2012, but the economic
outlook is clearly weakening. There is no apparent fix for the Europe debt challenges, U.S. fiscal policy crisis, or
slower Chinese economy. The global economic uncertainty has limited visibility and companies are being cautious with
investment.
Based on current conditions, the revised 2012 outlook is as follows: underlying sales growth 3% to 4%; reported sales
growth 1% to 2%; operating profit margin 17.5% to 17.8%; restructuring expense approximately $125 million; tax rate
approximately 32%; earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.40; operating cash flow of $3.3 billion to $3.4
billion; and capital expenditures approximately $700 million.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much. First, I want to thank everybody for joining us today and I appreciate our shareholders and their
long-term support. As you know today the Board did finalize our final dividend increase for fiscal 2012 by the $0.40 to
$1.60 for the whole year, our 56th year. And along with approximately $1 million of repurchase in fiscal year 2012,
which is our current target, a strong commitment of payment back to our shareholders in cash, which is very, very

important to our focus here as a company and our management team.
At the same time, we have continued to increase our investments internally for growth. For capital, we need to grow the
company at record levels and our balance sheet stayed strong and liquid and we have the room to do what we need to
do. We can control our own destiny.
I also want to let you know that Zorro my rally monkey and my baseball bat are here with me today to keep me in line
and to make sure I do not lose my focus. Thanks to all those helpful tools as we know.
I also want to recognize the operating executives across this company and especially the Process Management
operating executives that got the job done this quarter. They had a tough hand coming out of the Thailand flood and the
situation that we hit early on this year. They mapped out the course of correction. They kept taking the orders, we didn't
lose the business. We supported the customers and we've got the sale shipments done.
This quarter we picked up approximately $130 million of sales from the impact that we had in the first quarter. We'll
have a little bit more of that in the fourth quarter, probably $140 million, $150 million somewhere around that range
and a little bit left over in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. But the team out there in Process is getting the job done.
Across the whole company operationally we're getting the job done. From an execution standpoint of cost reductions,
from shipments to backlog reductions, they are getting it done.
As I look at the pace of business, the last 70 days, it is definitely slowed. In early May, when we had our last
communication, we talked about 7% to 8% underlying sales growth this quarter. We ended up at 6%. It's a function of
the weakening that we have seen around the world in the U.S., in Europe, China, Brazil, India, clearly we have seen
this continuing weakening in orders. Our order pace is maintained around 3%. We expected it to improve a little bit. It's
maintaining probably the month of July too, we haven't gotten the final numbers, but my gut tells me, we're probably
around 3% on orders in the pace for this month. The key for us is maintaining the order pace to deliver the backlog and
reduce that backlog. The same game plan we just executed in the third quarter. Underlying sales will be slightly better
in the fourth quarter to our normal pattern, but we need to execute on getting the sales out the door. Operations are
focused on that and we believe that we can deliver.
In addition to the lost sales that we had in underlying orders and sales this quarter, we also had a stronger dollar which
impacted us about $50 million in the third quarter from beginning to end, and that pace unfortunately will be even
worse as we go into the fourth fiscal quarter. And we've been reviewing those numbers for the last three 8-Ks and the
order pace to keep an idea out there for the shareholders to know what we see happening relative to this stronger dollar.
I personally like a stronger dollar that reflects a stronger economy. I believe in it. It gives us a lot more leverage relative
to managing our global company, and we are a global company. We are not an export-driven company. So I personally
like a stronger dollar. I think it's great for this country.
From my perspective, Europe has continued to be a weaker economy. I do not see any change in that as we go forward
here into the next fiscal year. At this point in time, I would expect negative growth coming out of Europe. I'd expect
negative GFI again in 2013 on Europe. U.S. has one big issue. It's called fiscal cliff and fiscal mismanagement. It is
causing corporations in the United States to pull back, pull back on the reins, as I refer to it, you hear me talk about this
all the time. It's causing us to pull back on the reins clearly. Our capital spending in the third quarter was less than prior
year and less than we have been running at from the pace basically. However, I still think that that's going to continue,
going to be a weaker pull back as we look at going on here in the next couple of months. I believe that companies out
there right now are only spending what they need to spend, the uncertainty of what's going to go on relative to the U.S.
fiscal policy is a big issue. It's a huge issue. People are only going to spend what they need to spend and people are
cutting back on anything they see for growth and I think that's going to be an impact relative to the whole rest of this
calendar year relative to underlying U.S. growth.
In China, from my perspective, China has stabilized. It has not picked up significantly. The economy is definitely
weaker than prior years and I think the economy in China will continue to struggle. The political transition is
underway. We will see how that plays out, but I see nothing at this point in time to change the growth profile of China
significantly than what we've been seeing for the last 6 months, 9 months, 12 months as we go into fiscal 2013 – in

calendar year 2013.
Relative to Brazil, which is impacted clearly by the slowdown around the international markets and exports to their
products that economy has also slowed down in my opinion and will continue to slow and struggle from a whole
standpoint of their cost structure and also that it's an export driven material marketplace, which I think will be
impacted.
India also has its own issues right now, be it from a political standpoint, a financial standpoint, inflation standpoint and
power standpoint. India has continued to be good market for us, but I am concerned about the future in the next 12
months to 18 months in India, given what's going on inside that country. Relative to the leverage in the third quarter, it
was outstanding leverage. It's what we expected. We expected to get some money back from the government on the
Byrd Amendment. That's been around. We've known about it for six months. We've had it planned in the forecast, we
had it planned in, in May. It will most likely be our final payment, maybe $1.2 million more in the future. This thing is
going on, but it's going to be finalized here, but it's pretty much done for us. It was well planned. The rest of the
operations have continued to execute on slower growth, leveraging back the cost structure, getting the job done in
restructuring and positioning themselves for I think a slower growth environment here for the foreseeable future.
We're doing what needs to be done across this company to protect our profitability, protect our cash flow and make
sure we have the flexibility to deal with issues that come up. Be it Thailand flood, be it embargoes, whatever happens,
be it wars around the world. We are taking the action necessary to make sure this company is strong and able to have
the flexibility to get the job done.
As I look at the fourth quarter right now, we have to execute just like we executed in the third quarter. We need Process
Management to continue to reduce its backlog that we build up. Their order pace has been very, very strong throughout
this whole year. As you've seen, it's not just – just one or two months, it's been strong now for a long time. We need to
execute getting that order pace or those orders converted to sales. We need to get that backlog down and we need to
deliver the profitability just like they did in the third quarter, and I expect that team will do that.
At the same time, we need to continue to restructure across Network Power, which had good traction in the third
quarter and will have continued good traction in the fourth quarter. We are dealing with a lower growth environment
than we expected, but we've got our cost in line as we started way back three, four, five months ago as we saw things
slowing down. I feel good that we will continue to execute in this fourth quarter and I feel that we are ready to deliver a
record level of profitability and hopefully a record level of sales given what's going on at this point in time, but clearly
with the underlying growth rate slowing down a little bit and given the fact that dollars continue to strengthen, that's
getting tougher and tougher relative to the top-line sales, but we feel good about where we are right now. We have a
good start in the month of July. We are now into August and we're executing.
The top 40 executives of Emerson will be in town for the next three days working with the OCE talking about how we
close out this year, talking about when we look at 2013 and basically making sure we're positioned to continue to
perform at high levels even if we have issues coming at us. From my perspective, again, I want to thank the operating
team for what they've got done in the third quarter. We will continue to execute. We have a fourth quarter challenge.
We must make sure we deliver. And I feel good about where we are right now. And we're going into a 2013, to be
honest, that I think will continue to be very challenging from growth and from the standpoint of what's going to happen
around the world. Companies need to be flexible. They need to be able to adjust very quickly and deal with the issues
that come at them.
There are pockets of growth out there, but there's also pockets of weakness and it's very important for us to focus on
where that growth is and to dial back where the weakness is. But we're not looking at anything, in my opinion, that's
going to quickly turn around and so a strong growth profile. We're looking at a challenging growth environment, very
similar to what we're dealing with right now and I expect that will continue throughout 2013 and maybe even a little
longer. So again, thanks for the shareholders being with us today. Thanks for supporting us. And we will continue to
work hard, to deliver a very strong finish to this year and to execute like Emerson can execute as we have done in the
past.

With that, we'll open the floor for questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Hey, Dave. I had a couple on Network Power. One just how the Chloride Trinergy in the
transformer lists, when that might start to drive some share reversion, I guess I'd call it and then secondarily thoughts
on repositioning budget for that next year, what kind of headway have you made on what you see as requisite for that
segment?
<A - David N. Farr>: The new transformers product in the United States has been introduced. The first wave has
happened. Who knows what is going in the marketplace from a share standpoint, who knows what's going on in the
marketplace standpoint right now with the uncertainty. I think the whole Network Power Systems business has had a
good quarter and they continue to make good progress around the world and they will continue to make good progress
the next quarter. My opinion right now, you're looking at a challenging marketplace these guys are serving and will
continue that way in 2013. I don't see anything that's going to say that this business – a business environment is going
to say that we're going to go out and spend money freely without some clarity on what's going to happen in Europe
from a fiscal standpoint and what's going to happen here in the United States from a fiscal standpoint. So we're
planning on very low growth. Continue to execute the restructuring. Improve the profitability like that we're doing and
get the new products out the door. That's where we are.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Okay and then just lastly, the SG&A spend has been very steady five or six quarters. Do
you start to see any upward pressure on that spend rate, annual increases or what have you?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think, from my perspective, we are going to continue to keep our costs in line. We have gone
out and pushed pretty hard on making sure that we're spending appropriately. We are going to be looking at our
spending on the big growth investments going into 2013 and look at which ones we want to maintain and which ones
maybe we want to curtail. But from our perspective right now, I think our SG&A is in pretty good shape. The key issue
is we would like to try to drive to have our GP margin hit the 40% level for the whole year. We're real close to that
right now. We're a little bit shy of that. As you look at the first nine months, I think we're at, what, 39.9% or 39.8%
somewhere around like that. So I think from the SG&A standpoint, we're not big spenders here and we move around
from a mix standpoint but I think we've got that pretty well under control.
<Q - Christopher Glynn>: Great, thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Dave it just looks consistently that Latin America was very strong in the quarter. You did make
some negative comments about Brazil. Can you just talk about maybe some timing issues there in the quarter or what

kind of drove that strength, and particularly in Network Power?
<A - David N. Farr>: I mean from the standpoint of Latin America, there are a lot of projects. It's more of a project
business down there and we've had some good orders down there for the last six months, both in Network Power, both
in the process side, and we're able to get those businesses out the door. Right now, I think Brazil will still do okay. I
think Mexico is far stronger than Brazil right now. Mexico has become a very important market for us and we have a
very strong position there and it has continued to grow. So I think right now, across Latin America I expect another
pretty good quarter. I expect another good year next year, but my concern about Brazil is they made some big forecasts
relative to investments and capital and let's say oil and gas type investments and the question is will those continue to
go forward or will they delay those a little bit. But right now our business is doing well down there. We expect it to
continue to do well down there, but my focus right now is Mexico and it has continued to perform extremely well. We
have a new government in Mexico. I'm very encouraged by this new government and I'm looking forward to meeting
the new President and his team. Because I think Mexico is going to be a $1 billion market for us in the next couple of
years.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, that's helpful. As a follow-up, just trying to get a sense of how the market is changing or
shifting in climate. I mean when you see tough conditions like this, does it rotate back towards kind of older
technologies like reship away from scroll or is that just not an issue anymore?
<A - David N. Farr>: That's not an issue anymore. I think the key issue on the climate standpoint is the consumer is
very, very tight with spending money and last year, they did a lot of repair work. This year, they are doing the outside
unit and they're replacing the outside unit. So it's less service for us, more sales for our OEM customers, which is good
for them. We get the compressor, but obviously at a different price point. The scroll will continue to do well. You got
another transition underway that will happen effectively January 1, 2015. So the key North America OEMs right now
are going through that process, how they're going to reach those new standards, and obviously we're working very
closely with those and you are going to see that continue.
So the key issue for us right now is we need to see some stronger housing in North America. We need to see a stronger
replacement market. But I'm not expecting much of a big surge here. I expect some stability. The key issue also is that
you have to see commercial, which had been weakening a little bit and you're also seeing a transportation type of
marketplace weaken a little bit. So fortunately we're a global business, and we have some pluses and some minuses.
Right now, our mix is very good, so we have a pretty good profitability and residential has not been one of the, what I'd
say, one of strengths. But our commercial business has been very good, and our refrigeration business has been very
good.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, helpful. Good quarter guys. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Mike.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Can you give us an update on the mid tier sales strategy, whether this backdrop is the right
backdrop to continue with that and in China is it the right time to move into second third tier cities, given just 2%
growth there?
<A - David N. Farr>: We've been moving into second and third and fourth tier cities in China for ten years, so I think
fundamentally China will continue to be a good growing marketplace. If you look at quarters a lot of things happen.
You have quarter surges. You have quarter backs off. Underlying China will continue to outgrow, in my opinion, the

5, 3 years, we've averaged well over 15% growth. We have a tough year this year. It doesn't mean I'm backing down.
The mid-tier strategy is going to continue. We started this 18-24 months ago. A lot of products have started launching.
We have been building the organization, and I expect China will have a better year in 2013 from an underlying sales
growth standpoint just because of our businesses and our mid-tier projects where I think's happening, I feel good about
China, even though it's still going to be challenging and the economy could be weaker, I still think we're making the
right moves at this point in time.
<Q - Mike R. Wood>: Great and can you give us an update on where you think the global fixed investment is running
currently and how you're faring on outperforming that?
<A - David N. Farr>: The problem is that the information is more a rearview mirrors type stuff. So right now the trend
line has continued to deteriorate. I would say at this point in time, the forecast I gave in May, and EPG is holding pat
right now from that perspective, and so I don't think it's changed much. I don't have anything that tells me it's improved,
but I definitely think it's weakening and I don't have a visibility relative to how much it's weakening because it's so
rearview mirror oriented and I think you got to wait for things to settle down for a while. But clearly economic numbers
you're seeing around the world continue to weaken a little bit and I think the business spending this quarter has been
weaker so that will reflect in the GFI spending. So my feeling is, it's going to be – the numbers I put out there and
showed in EPG in May are still holding tight and I don't have those off my head, but they are out there in the charts,
you can get them.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: I wasn't sure if you knew who I was.
<A - David N. Farr>: Someone asked me a question and I was answering the question, you know. I was multi-tasking.
I'm eating a banana, I'm drinking a coke and I'm petting Zorro, so be nice. I mean a CEO's got to do a little – a couple
things at one time, you know.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Exactly.
<A - David N. Farr>: And I apologize for not recognizing you in the first 30 seconds.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: It sounds like you're chewing gum, too.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I'm chewing my banana.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Couple questions. So the Network Power margin trajectory looks encouraging obviously.
Where are you at on kind of the down size of embedded power relative to kind of the overall plan? And just kind of
taking that a step further, I mean that margin improvement we saw in the quarter came on very little sequential revenue
growth. So can you give us some context to think about how restructuring saves or other dynamics are coming into play
and how we should think about this margin going forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay. The embedded power restructuring, I mean we still have a little left, but it's really getting
close to finalizing from our perspective. And you got – you want to comment – Pat, you want to say something here?
Okay. And Pat is looking at me like – he's afraid I'm going to say something. From the perspective, they are winding
down, repositioning, I think, we're about there. I expect them – our growth rates to be less negative, let's put this way in

that space. So I think from the restructuring you're going to see a slower number there, it will be even less as we go into
– starting into 2013.
On the network power systems standpoint, we still have a lot going on there relative to Europe, because these programs
take on – they take on quite some time. It takes us anywhere from 12 to 18 months for some of the restructuring there.
So that – but that will continue and we'll -that will continue going into 2013. Overall, I do expect our restructuring
dollars to probably end up being a little bit lower in 2013 and I would expect Network Power to spend less money in
2013 in total than we spent this year. It's a function of what we see happening relative to our European opportunities,
the window opens up; we'll obviously take advantage of that situation. Relative to the overall, I mean integration where
we see right now – we're in pretty good shape, it's just a matter of continue to execute, I believe, that we'll see
continued sequential improvement and profitability in the fourth quarter. It's a matter of how we're getting our backlog
out the door and stuff like that I – but there is not, I wouldn't say a robust improvement in the business space. It's more
of an internal execution at this point relative to what we have day-to-day business getting the stuff out the door and
continuing to finalize the restructuring. So we're really in our – control of our own destiny at this point in time, and I
feel good about it.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: How about CapEx? Are you planning to spend down next year on an aggregate Emerson
basis?
<A - David N. Farr>: Probably not because as I talked about for the last, I think, for the last couple of calls, process
has a capacity that based on what we see on the underlying demand based on our backlog, based on continued
repositioning of the business on a global basis, we are going to have to improve our spending and capital as we put on
that capacity in that regionalization. So I would say that we are going to be up a little bit next year in capital and it's
going to be primarily driven by Process Management because of the strong growth we've had in the last couple of years
and I think we're going to still see some pretty good growth there. So we need to make sure we reinvest for the next
wave and that's where we are now is this whole cycle just like we did a couple of years ago in climate technologies,
you have to get ahead of these things, you can't wait or you'll miss shipping opportunities.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And finally for me and I'll get out of the way. What's your feeling at this point, appetite on
M&A versus share repurchase? Obviously, a nice bump in the dividend today, where is your head at on that now
looking into 2013?
<A - David N. Farr>: Acquisitions are still – I mean I consider the acquisitions number one relative to share
repurchase, it's a function of can we find the assets out there, there's not a lot of assets out there and we're trying to
work those assets, but we've had a couple of years of less than $300 million from a spending standpoint, as you know,
it's lumpy we'll go two or three years less than $500 million then we'll have – could have a big year. So we still are
looking for the acquisitions, I'd rather do acquisitions than share repurchase, but in the meantime, our balance sheet is
strong and we would continue to do the share repurchase if we had the flexibility.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great, thanks a lot.
<A - David N. Farr>: Take care, Jeff. Thank you very much.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Just maybe a quick follow-up to that last question, I mean given all your commentary
that's sort of trending more negative on the macro even though it sounds more positive operationally, are you thinking
about divestitures in the same way, same sort of longer-term timeframe, even as the macro deteriorates or has that
thinking evolved?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't think our divestiture programs have changed from what I talked about both at
AllianceBernstein conference and/or the EPG or even last February. We're looking at a multiyear program here.
Knaack will be finished this quarter. We'll evaluate some other assets as we close out this year going to our strategy
plan with the board in November. So you know there's no change at this point in time.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. On the process conversion, so much of that was on the backlog and you've
got these record margins. So as you think about normalizing kind of a normal growth rate without the excessively high
backlog from Thailand, what – how are you thinking about margins evolving in that business as you head into next year
or what or maybe later next year as that normalizes?
<A - David N. Farr>: From a total – on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the process margin will move around because of the
type of mix we have clearly. If you look at – if we finish in the low – around 20% for this year, we'll probably have a
little bit uptick next year from a profitability standpoint. I'm not looking at a significant change in the margin of that
business. Clearly, from our profile, we are investing quite significantly in underlying growth programs and
technologies and we intend to continue to do that. We want to protect that core business as a very important core
business to us, and we're going to make sure that we protect it and not melt it. And so I think that you're looking at low
profitability from the 20s% and we'll mix and match around that level at this point in time.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And maybe just sneak one more in on telecom. How are you thinking about end
user CapEx and telecom and as you look at the next couple of quarters, how optimistic are you on that?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think – you know, I wouldn't say I'm optimistic. I mean I'll just put it this way, I think they're –
the telecom guys are spending money. The question is not, can we continue to get piece of that spending, but they are
spending money and the question will be as what does that do as we go into 2013. But right now, they have a bunch of
– pool of money they are spending and we have to make sure we get a piece of that. I mean – process, I'm far more
optimistic about capital spending than I am – of our customers than I am with the telecom spending, let's put it that
way.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Makes sense. All right, thank a lot. Thank you, guys.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Dave, in terms of pulling back on the reins obviously, your customers in process
aren't doing it. Where, particularly when you look within businesses by businesses, are you seeing that specifically at
customers?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I haven't personally called every C of my customers out there, but I think that if I look at
most customers and from the standpoint of looking at their inventory stockings and looking at the industrial customers,
so I think there people are pulling back and being very careful to spend money. And I would say that even the process
guys are being a little bit more careful of where they're spending money. I don't know how you say they're not. I think

these guys are going to be very careful about where they put their money. I think they're going to continue to spend on
high levels, but I think they're going to be very cautious. Across the board, last quarter if I remember correctly, if I look
at the spending in the GDP numbers of our business that actually weakened a little bit, Sean. And so, Shannon, I'm
sorry, I keep calling Sean, Shannon. So that's my input. I've just – my feel out there talking to CEOs, they're being
careful.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yes, I would just spend with process, it seem, I mean I don't know if it came in stronger
than?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm not going to tell you by business-by-business. If you want to go out and call the CEOs, I'll
give you some numbers, you can call them if you want to, Shannon. But I don't personally do that.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: I'll take them.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay, good. I'll give them to you.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: One more just on embedded power as you continue to downsize the business there, is
that changing at all? How you view the attractiveness of sort of the industry structure there now that you've sort of got a
smaller business to operate whether it's still tough?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's still tough. And I will make – I'll review our decision on what we're going to do with this
business as we go on this year with the board in November and we will be making decision of what we're going to do
with it as we have talked about it earlier. Right now, we're – it's still a very difficult marketplace relative to profitability
and returns and a very dynamic marketplace. So the dynamics haven't changed and I'm not and at this point in time, I
don't see any change relative to what we – how we view it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Hi. Just a quick question on the Industrial Automation as a new president of that business. I
just wondered what if any of the priorities that maybe changing alongside that and in particular I guess around the
outlook for restructuring. Do you think those are going to be very high again in 2013? The business is kind of bumping
along at flattish organic sales growth. It seems to be some risk that maybe margins level off. So could you talk a little
bit about the main priorities in IA right now?
<A - David N. Farr>: As we go through – Mark will be going through his first strategy session with us in September
with the OCE. I would say the main priorities there are basically looking at a very low growth environment. So we
know what restructuring needs to be done, it's underway. Right now, what's the current plan for this year relative to the
restructuring, Frank? We're going to get the number here for this business approximately.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Approximately $25 million.
<A - David N. Farr>: $25 million. I think you're going to be looking probably again in and around that $20 million
level next year. So we're going to continue to restructure, we can, Julian, that business. It's a very – as you know a very
European centric business and we're taking our time relative to that. The key issue for us is we have new products
coming out in the drives area, we have new products coming out in a couple of areas there and that's very, very
important to us relative to reignite some growth in that market space but overall, I think you're right, it's going to be a

low growth environment and the question will be, is can – we need get our costs aligned to protect that profitability,
that will be the goal for IA next year. You're right.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks. And then just secondly on Network Power. The decline in earnings has sort
of shrunk recently but the earnings have still fallen for sort of seven quarters in a row year-on-year. So when we're
thinking about the next 12 or 18 months for that business, how confident are you that we can get some kind of earnings
growth. I mean, for example, is there reasonable earnings growth if we strip out embedded computing and power, so it's
just a question of maintaining that if something strategic happens to embedded computing?
<A - David N. Farr>: The key issue for us to get the earnings growth going forward from here is to stop the weaning
out of what the business – businesses we don't want to be in and that process is truly slowing down and we should start
seeing some earnings growth as we go forward here because the majority of that weaning is almost done and the
profitability is improving and we're taking the cost actions. So I – we will continue to work on that issue and I feel
good that we will get some underlying growth and we will start getting some underlying earnings growth in that space.
So as we go through that process, it takes time and obviously a very challenging process, but I feel good that we're
making headway and as we go into 2013 and 2014, I see that we'll get some earnings growth out of that. We have done
this before and we will get it back.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: So just to follow up on that quickly, so excluding embedded computing, the earnings in
Network Power...
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm not going to tell you that. I'm not going to break out the that segment. Good try, Julian, nice
try.
<Q - Julian C. Mitchell>: Sure. Thanks a lot.

<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Hey, start up with the question I don't know if it's for you, Dave or Frank, but just can
you comment on the increase in the receivables at the end of the quarter was all just the timing of shipments?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yes, I mean we had $550 million sequential increase in sales, so it's really just the timing
that caused the receivables to pop up at the end of the third quarter here.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. That check for the antidumping cleared successfully?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. They took my tax payment and paid it back to me – to the company.

changed in what you're thinking maybe a month ago. What are the kinds of a key hard thought issue you'll be going
through levers, new product introductions, pricing, but what could you share with us?
<A - David N. Farr>: Good question. The answer is yes, it has changed in the last 60 days. From my perspective, the
number one issue is, if we look at the underlying growth rate of both the mature and the emerging markets, then you'll

see the trend lines that have sort of come out here over the last 12 to 18 months, we have to figure out how we're going
to manage in a little bit lower growth environment for a couple of years. As we talked about in May, I think, you're
looking at some challenging, it could be three, four, five years here.
The other key issue from my perspective, we got to talk about is talking about where do we want to put our incremental
investment dollars? We've been very strong and as you know in some of what we call our A12, A13 programs and I
want to talk – we're going to continue to invest in those dollars. What big programs do we want to invest in given the
tough environment we're in right now and the market mix we're seeing out there, where do we want to put those dollars
and the business leaders and the OCE and the top 40 guys and people. Those guys will be discussing that issue.
The other issue will be, in my opinion, is we are now going into I think a little bit more of a negative material type
environment. We've have had an environment here, we surged up in material costs and raised prices, now it's starting to
weaken in a low growth environment. I think you're going to be looking at more of a negative material type
environment, and how do you maintain our pricing integrity and our green, what we call the net green environment on
that and try to manage that very carefully. So, those are things I want to talk about.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: This may be rhetorical. But, just how does that environment compare to the discussions
you had with the same team in 2008?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well I mean 2008, we were looking at clearly a lot higher growth globally. We weren't looking
at the type of debt structure we have out there and you're looking at a whole different growth profile at that point in
time, so it's a more selective focused growth area, and so that's what we want to get our minds around. Where do we
want to put those dollars to make sure that we get the returns and make sure that we drive as much growth as we can in
the pockets out there, and the areas that we don't have that opportunity of growth, what restructuring, what
repositioning can we do to protect our profitability? I still believe the company can grow. I think we can continue to
improve our profitability and deliver high level of returns in cash but the question is then, how do we get that and
where do we invest that money carefully. That's what it's about.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. Thank you.

based type business. But that's primarily what was down in the U.S.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: That's not just in Asia.
<A - David N. Farr>: You got it.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: It's a global business. We try, even though some of the products are made and sold over there,
it's actually we look at destination and destination comes back into the U.S.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. And then piggybacking on Jeff's question about the sequential margin. Last year, you
went from 10.5% to 13.5% from third quarter to fourth quarter. How do we look for the fourth quarter Net Power for
this year?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're still looking at last year, that 300 basis points, I would, we're looking probably half of
that.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: The key thing for us, Steve, is we've been restructuring. We've got the instability there, and the
question is executing around the products, the new products that are coming out and getting that job done. So when we
see the momentum right now, the profitability is improving and I'm pleased with that.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Got you. And then, on the cap side, on the alternator side, you said power generation was strong,
but it seems like Cat gensets have been pretty weak year-over-year. There's probably less inventory in the channel
relative to where it was in the 2008, 2009 time period. So, maybe it's more real time these days. Is that business, is that
kind of the source of the concern going forward when you talk about Europe, because I know that is reported through
Europe revenues, I think.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think that from the genset standpoint, what we do and what Cat does it is a little bit different
timing difference here, but we're also as you know, half our business is non-Cat too. From what we see right now,
clearly what happened in India is a good issue for us. The gensets, and we're a strong player in India and Asia. I'm a
little bit nervous about that we're sitting at very, very record levels of our alternator business right now. So I'm a little
bit nervous about that. I think Europe is weaker. But I still think that there's power needs around the world and if the
economies hold up and we still have power issues around the world, we should have a reasonable year next year. But it
is a concern for me because if you look at the general order patterns, it's not been that strong. And you're right, the
actual inventories out there are not that big either. So, that's a plus. We live day-to-day in that area. But I'm just nervous
overall, of the overall underlying power needs and the economy needs. So emergencies out there like in India is a good
news for us.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, one last question for you, a little bit bigger picture. You obviously had a going on first
quarter last year. The weather with the seasonality and climate, the network kind of air pocket, whatever you want to
call it, the process stuff. If you kind of model normal seasonality, you've got some pretty easy comps in the first half of
the year, but you're talking about how cautious people are in the near term and obviously the fiscal cliff, who knows
when that gets resolved. So I'm just trying to kind of put those dynamics together. When you go out and you think
about 2013, will it be as easy as saying hey, comps are easy so we're going to kind of come strong out of the gate. Or is
it the economy is going to subdue that and so it will be more straight line as we move through the year next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know, I really haven't thought about it that long. All I know is as I look at the trend lines,
and I know next year is going to be a very difficult year for anyone to model because of how disaster first quarter we
had and almost a disaster in the second quarter, then we started coming back. So it's going to be very difficult and we're
going to have to help people on this one for sure because it's a little bit more help than I normally give because I don't
give quarterly forecasts, as you know, Steve. But as I look at it here, I'm looking at – if I'm saying underlying growth

rates, it's going to be low single digits next year, and I think I wouldn't look at a straight line. It's not how I'm thinking.
I don't think – it's hard for me to say, but right now, I haven't thought about that first, second quarter. But I don't think
it's going to be say easy comps and then we just have a straight line. I just think what to think about how that first year
unfolds, how are backlog finishes and the order pace as we go into this – as we finish September. But it's going to be a
difficult year.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Sorry. Did you say low single digits underlying sales growth?
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say yes, I did.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, that's for 2013?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: You got it.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Langenberg with Langenberg & Company.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Hey, guys, thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hey, Brian. How are you doing?
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Good, good. A couple of questions, first of all on the process side, just review this
backlog that flowed through from Thailand. Were most of the expenses incurred in earlier periods in the fiscal year and
basically, kind of wondering what the incrementals were just on net piece as flow-through? Did it unusually boost the
margin in the first quarter? That's my first question.
<A - David N. Farr>: It definitely helped it, but I'm not going to – I'm not going to tell you that. That's for me to know
or you not to know. So...
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Okay.
<A - David N. Farr>: Clearly, the way this thing works is we incurred costs. We definitely incurred costs and we built
the product and put it in inventory. There's no doubt we captured costs that way. We also had around $35 million
spread evenly throughout the year's cost that we're having to incur because of the expediting and just overall costs,
customer cost from that standpoint. So if you think about we had – what was the EBIT margin for the quarter for
process, 22%?
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: 23%
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: 23%.
<A - David N. Farr>: 23%. You know, we have been running around 20% for the whole year and so for our company,
so we clearly had a pretty good incremental flow-through on that profitability. For us to say what was Thailand, which
is not Thailand, it's an exercise of basically left pocket, right pocket and I'm not going to waste my time on that. And
that process guy's got one thing they have to do for me this quarter, they've got to ship a lot of sales and make a lot of
money. And, so, that's where I want them to focus, but we had a good flow-through obviously at 23%.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Clearly. I'm not trying to nitpick. So basically, some of this is unusually good growth.
Some of it is bad. Some of it sounds like lower expediting cost, if you will?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Okay great.

<A - David N. Farr>: And you're right. We did capture stuff in inventory. There's no doubt we can do that, too.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Okay. And can you just overall talk about price raws for the total company in the
quarter, total price net of raws and materials?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's still positive right now because our price, we take pricing actions more early in the year and
so if you remember correctly, we had probably the first quarter was negative. We went slightly positive in the second
quarter and were more positive. And, so, right now, we are obviously what we call green net price – net material price.
We'll again have that in the fourth quarter and then what we'll do is, we'll start working the price increases. And clearly
as I said earlier, we're looking at more of a negative net material inflation environment. So therefore next year in order
– it's going to be a different environment. This year, we're probably ending up totally around, let's say around 0.5
positive, 0.4 positive price, and I don't know what the final number is going to be. Next year we will have to fight hard
to hold a zero, but net material inflation is going to be negative. And so we'll be working that issue as we go into that
now. But, it's clear, we're going to go into a different environment and the key thing I want my management team to be
thinking about is, how do we manage it going from a more costly material cost environment to a negative one? And
how are you managing that pricing giveback as you go through that process?
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Understood. And then just a last one. Great SG&A performance and your sales year on
year were up $217 million and your SG&A was down $25 million. So, let's just say in terms of normalized SG&A, of
course targets $60 million or $70 million. How much of that was just discretionary pullback and just kind of put some
chunks around what you did in the quarter to manage that. Because you've clearly played it really tight?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well we started about almost 90 days ago, and I think on the last conference call in May I talked
about it. We really started pulling back in a range and we started talking about not necessary replacing people. The
restructuring savings have come into play now in the second half of the year where we took some cost out in the SG&A
level. We are being very cautious relative to our spending levels. And so, there's a little bit of that going on, but is just
basically being cautious and then allowing that growth. We have 6% underlying growth without trying to increase our
spending levels. And we're going to try to do the same thing again this quarter in order to get the leverage because for
us to deliver the whole year, it doesn't take a rocket science to figure what kind of margin I need to have in that fourth
quarter. And, so, we're going to keep that spending level really tight right now, I'm really nervous about what's going
on around the world and so I'm pulling those range back and I haven't yanked the ranges back and put the bit in the
horse's mouth real hard yet, but I could easily do that in and you could see our costs come down.
<Q - Brian K. Langenberg>: Okay, thank you very much Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much. Take care, Brian.
